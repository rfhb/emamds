## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Requested type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Glaxo Group Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 31 July 2014 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC further to submission of the results of Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411), a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours.

## 1.2. Rationale for the proposed change

This Type II variation supports the amendment of the SmPC, Section 4.2, Paediatric population, to delete the sentence 'No data are available'.

Results from study ADVL0815/PZP114411, a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours, are available and the statement of 'no data are available' is no longer appropriate. The available paediatric data regarding safety and tolerability of pazopanib are limited and therefore the conclusion 'that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established' remains unchanged.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The MAH for Votrient (pazopanib) has submitted a variation in order to amend the SmPC, Section 4.2, Paediatric population, to delete the sentence 'No data are available'.

With the variation results from study ADVL0815/PZP114411, a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours, has been included. The primary purpose of the phase I study ADVL0815 was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib for administration to children, adolescents and young adults. The primary objectives were to evaluate toxicity and begin the process of characterising pazopanib PK parameters in a paediatric population.  Evaluation of clinical activity was a secondary objective. A total of 53 paediatric subjects with a variety of relapsed/refractory solid tumours were evaluated and reported.

The  data  showed  that  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations  associated  with  clinical  and  biologic  effects consistent with VEGFR inhibition (20 µg/mL) were achieved at all dose levels after oral administration of tablets/suspension.

Some clinical activity of pazopanib was observed in a heavily pretreated paediatric population.

Clinical activity included 2 subjects with partial responses in refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumour and hepatoblastoma. Stable disease were seen in 12 subjects (23%) in a variety of tumour types (malignant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

melanoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant glioma, osteosarcoma, desmoplastic  small  round  cell  tumour,  alveolar  rhabdomyosarcoma  (n=2),  alveolar  soft  part  sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma.

Serious adverse events were reported for 25 (47%) subjects.  The most common SAEs were anaemia (4 [8%] subjects), increased lipase (4 [8%] subjects), abdominal pain, dyspnoea and hypothyroidism (each in 3 [6%] subjects). No other SAEs were reported for greater than 2 subjects. Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were reported for 9 (17%) subjects, 3/17 at the MTD for tablets and none at the MTD for the suspension.  All (3) fatal SAEs had the primary cause of death related to their disease.  The types of AEs observed was consistent with those seen in the adult population treated with pazopanib.

## Overall conclusion

It can be agreed that based on the data from this small paediatric study no firm conclusion can be drawn about activity nor safety  in particular tumour types and consequently efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age based on the data from this study has not yet been established. The overall efficacy and safety  profile  of  pazopanib  in  the  approved  indications  (renal  cell  carcinoma  and  soft  tissue  sarcoma) remains unchanged.

With the provided data the statement currently included in the SmPC section 4.2; 'no data are available' is no longer appropriate. It is also endorsed that even though some information is now available the overall paediatric data regarding safety and tolerability of pazopanib are still limited and therefore the conclusion 'that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established' should remain unchanged.

It  has  been  considered  whether  it  could  be  of  value  to  evaluate  the  data  by  comparing  the  PK data/parameters in adults with those in children of the various age categories (2-6, 6-12, 12-18 years and &gt;18 years) taking into account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide some level of paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC. This has been addressed by the MAH. As Votrient (pazopanib)  is  not  approved  for  the  use  in  the  paediatric  population,  and  the  numbers  on  which  any pharmacokinetic information may be based on and subsequently addressed in section 4.2 is very limited it is considered fully acceptable that nothing further may be included in section 5.2 in the SmPC.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC further to submission of the results of Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411), a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours.

The requested variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

is recommended for approval.

## 4. Scientific discussion

## 4.1. Introduction

Votrient (Pazopanib), a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2 and -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) -α and -β, and stem cell factor receptor (c-kit), is approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and also for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy.

At the time of the type II variation to include advanced soft tissue sarcoma as a therapeutic indication (EMEA/H/C/001141/II/007), the MAH agreed to add text regarding the paediatric population to Section 4.2 of the SmPC.  The currently approved text is as follows:

## Paediatric population

Pazopanib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns on organ growth and maturation (see Section 4.4 and 5.3).

The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age have not yet been established (see Section 5.1).  No data are available.

With this type II variation the MAH asks for an amendment of the SmPC, Section 4.2, Paediatric population, in order to delete the sentence 'No data are available.'

The proposed change is below (proposed deleted text is struck through):

## Paediatric population

Pazopanib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns on organ growth and maturation (see Section 4.4 and 5.3).

The safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age have not yet been established (see Section 5.1). No data are available.

The MAH has submitted the results from a Phase I paediatric study and consequently the statement of 'no data are available' is no longer appropriate. However, the available paediatric data regarding safety and tolerability of pazopanib are limited and therefore the conclusion 'that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established' remains unchanged.

The data submitted with this application relates to the use of pazopanib in the paediatric population from a study in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumours. The study; ADVL0815 (PZP114411), a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours, was conducted by the Children's Oncology Group and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), US.

## 4.2. Clinical aspects

## 4.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411)

## Study Design

Study ADVL0815 was a phase I trial design where pazopanib, as a single agent, was administered orally on a once daily basis.   The primary purpose of ADVL0815 was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib for administration to children, adolescents and young adults with refractory solid tumours, including central nervous system tumours.  Other primary objectives were to evaluate toxicity and obtain initial pazopanib pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in a paediatric patient population.   Evaluation of clinical activity was a secondary objective.

This study was a three-part study:

- Part 1 (Phase I Dose Escalation): The starting dose of pazopanib was 275 mg/m2.  Pazopanib dosing was  escalated  in  subsequent  cohorts  in  increments  of  approximately  30%.    There  was  no intrapatient dose escalation.  Blood samples were obtained for PK analysis and correlative biology studies  including  VEGF  haplotype,  plasma  levels  of  VEGF,  P1GF,  soluble  VEGFR1,  and  soluble VEGFR2 and measurement of circulating endothelial cells and peripheral blood monocytes.  Changes in tumour vascular permeability in response to pazopanib were also explored using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).
- Part  2a  (Suspension  Formulation  Component):  The  starting  dose  was  50%  of  the  MTD  as determined in Part 1.  Once the MTD or highest dose level was reached, the cohort was expanded in order  to  obtain  additional  safety  information  and  PK  data  for  the  suspension  formulation.    PK evaluation was required in all subjects who participated in this component of the study.
- Part 2b (Expanded Imaging Cohort): At the MTD or recommended Phase II dose, a cohort of up to 10 subjects with recurrent or refractory (revised to relapsed or refractory in Protocol Amendment 1A) soft tissue sarcoma (revised to soft tissue sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumour or extra-osseous Ewing sarcoma in Protocol Amendment 2) and a measurable (at least 2 cm) lesion in the head, neck, extremity or fixed within the abdomen or pelvis (revised to thorax, abdomen or pelvis in Protocol Amendment 2) such that it is not sensitive to motion artefact were recruited to further  explore  changes  in  tumour  vascular  permeability  using  DCE-MRI.    Imaging  studies  and limited PK sampling was required in all subjects who participated in this component of the study.

The primary objectives of this study were:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To estimate the MTD and/or recommended Phase II dose of oral pazopanib administered on a once daily schedule to children with refractory solid tumours.
- To define and describe the toxicities of oral pazopanib administered as either a tablet or suspension.
- To characterise the PK of oral pazopanib in children with refractory solid tumours.

The secondary objectives of this study were:

- To preliminarily define the anti-tumour activity of oral pazopanib within the confines of a Phase I study.
- To assess the biological activity of oral pazopanib including changes in peripheral blood monocyte counts, CECs, and plasma angiogenic factors.
- To explore changes in tumour vascular permeability following initiation of pazopanib therapy and to correlate these changes with clinical outcome, as applicable. Specifically, to evaluate changes in (DCE-MRI) scans obtained within 15 ± 2 days after initiation of pazopanib therapy as compared to baseline within a soft tissue sarcoma cohort.
- To preliminarily assess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) haplotype/phenotype relationships in a paediatric cancer patient population.
- To explore pazopanib concentration effect relationships with biomarkers and with clinical outcomes, including hypertension.

## Enrollment

Subjects were to be enrolled on the study once all eligibility requirements for the study were met.  Subjects who gave informed consent, or whose parents or guardian gave informed consent if the subject was a child, in order to undergo screening for eligibility were not considered enrolled and were not to be enrolled until the screening was completed and they were determined to meet all eligibility criteria.  Subjects were not to receive any protocol therapy prior to enrolment.  Complete inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in the clinical pharmacology study report.

## Treatment

In all parts of the study, treatment cycles were defined as 28 days in duration.  Subjects were to receive up to a total of 24 cycles of therapy with pazopanib in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.  A maximum of 55 subjects were anticipated (increased from 46 subjects in Protocol Amendment 3).

## Part 1: Phase I Dose Escalation

Subjects with recurrent or refractory (revised to relapsed or refractory in Protocol Amendment 1A) solid or CNS tumours were enrolled.  Two to six evaluable subjects were entered at each dose level for determination of MTD.  A minimum of 9 and a maximum of 24 evaluable subjects were expected to be enrolled in Part 1 of the study.  In Protocol Amendment 3, this was increased to a maximum of 27 subjects.

## Part 2a: Suspension Formulation Component

Once the MTD or Phase II recommended dose had been defined, up to 12 additional subjects with relapsed or  refractory  solid  tumours  were  to  be  enrolled  to  acquire  PK  data  using  the  powder  for  suspension formulation.  In Protocol Amendment 3, the maximum number of subjects in this strata was increased to 18 subjects, to ensure 12 subjects with PK at the MTD with at least 6 subjects &lt;12 years of age in this expanded cohort.

## Part 2b: Expanded Imaging Cohort

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Once the MTD or Phase II recommended dose had been defined, up to 10 additional subjects with recurrent or refractory (revised to relapsed or refractory in Protocol Amendment 1A) soft tissue sarcomas were to be enrolled to evaluate changes in vascular permeability using DCE-MRI.

## Statistical Methods

Efficacy was a secondary objective of this study, best defined by the preliminary anti-tumour activity as assessed by disease response.  Summary statistics were produced to describe best response.

Disease response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) Version 1.0 for measureable disease. Each subject was classified according to their 'best response' for the purposes of  analysis  of  treatment  effect.  Two  objective  status  determinations  of  disease  status,  by  computer tomography  (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  obtained  on  two  consecutive  determinations, separated by at least a 4-week time period, were required to determine the subject's overall best response.

## Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population

In total, 53 subjects entered the study.

## 4.2.2. Pharmacology results

Part 1 and Part 2a were the dose escalation parts of the ADVL0815 (PZP114411) study.

The starting pazopanib tablet dose in Part 1 was 275 mg/m 2  and 2 to 6 evaluable subjects were enrolled at each dose level.  Part 2a investigated the safety and PK of pazopanib after administration as the suspension formulation.  The starting dose of the pazopanib suspension in Part 2a was 50% of the MTD or highest dose investigated in Part 1.  Once the MTD or recommended Phase II dose of pazopanib tablets was defined, up

to  10  additional  subjects  were  enrolled  in  Part  2b  (imaging  cohort)  to  explore  changes  in  vascular permeability using DCE-MRI.

Serial blood samples for the determination of plasma pazopanib concentrations were collected over 24 h after a single dose (Day 1), and over 8 h after repeated oral doses on Day 15 or Day 22 in a subset of subjects (PK population).  Blood samples were collected at predose (trough) at the Days 15, 22, and 27 clinic visits, and just prior to starting subsequent odd-numbered cycles.

The mean (range) age of subjects enrolled in Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411) was 13.1 (3 - 23) years.  A total of 22 (42%) subjects were aged between 2 and &lt;12 years.

Mean (range) body surface area was 1.37 (0.8 - 2.1) m 2 .  Oral pazopanib doses of 275 mg/m 2 , 350 mg/m 2 , 450 mg/m 2 , and 600 mg/m 2  as tablets were investigated.  Oral suspension doses of 160 mg/m 2  and 225 mg/m 2  also were investigated.

The pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in subjects in Study ADVL0815 (PZP114411) are summarized in Table 1. Predose (trough) plasma pazopanib concentration are summarized in Table 2.

## 4.2.3. Efficacy Results

Two (4%) subjects achieved a PR (Table 3).  Subject 794200, with desmoplastic small round cell tumour, achieved a PR after 5.5 months, which was sustained for 24 months.  Subject 774572, with hepatoblastoma and embryonal hepatoma, had a PR after 5.5 months and maintained this response for a further 5.5 months; however, they were removed from the study because of an AE.

Twelve (23%) subjects had a best response of stable disease, and had the following diagnoses:

- In Part 1: malignant melanoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant glioma, osteosarcoma
- In Part 2a: desmoplastic small round cell tumour
- In Part 2b: alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma. (All subjects in Part 2b had sarcoma.)

## 4.2.4. Safety Results

The primary objective of this study included defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), evaluate toxicity and obtain initial pazopanib pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in a paediatric patient population.   In addition to monitoring of AEs, monitoring of specific toxicities was performed for growth plate, thyroid and cardiac toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In total, 53 subjects entered the study.  All were included in the safety population and were evaluable for the analysis of safety. Of the 53 subjects entered into the study, 27 subjects received pazopanib tablets in Part 1, 16 subjects received a pazopanib suspension in Part 2a, and 10 subjects received pazopanib tablets (at the MTD) in Part 2b. All subjects discontinued study treatment.  The most common primary reason for discontinuation  from  study  treatment  was  disease  progression  (35 [66%] subjects),  followed  by  AEs (11 [21%] subjects).

The planned duration of the protocol therapy was 24 cycles, with each cycle defined as 28 days in duration. Median exposure was 3.0 months (range: 1 to 23 months) across all groups. One subject in Part 2b received the maximum of 24 cycles of study treatment.

## Analysis of Adverse Events

All subjects had at least one AE during the study and at least one AE that was considered   by the investigator related to study treatment (Table 4).  AEs led to withdrawal for 11 (21%) subjects.

AEs were also analysed by age group (2 to &lt;12 years, 12 to &lt;19 [i.e., up to and including 18] years, &gt;18 years [i.e. 19 years and above]), although interpretation is limited by the small number of subjects (n=22, 22 and 12, respectively).

- Of the most common AEs, AST increased and hyponatremia were the only AEs reported at a higher incidence in the 2 to &lt;12 years group compared with the 12 to &lt;19 or &gt;18 years age groups (59%, compared with 41% and 33% , respectively, and 50% compared with 32% and 42%, respectively).
- Of the most common AEs, those reported at a higher incidence in the 12 to &lt;19 years group compared with the 2 to &lt;12 or &gt;18 years age groups included fatigue (64% compared with 50% and 58%, respectively), headache (55% compared with 36% and 42%, respectively), and hyperglycemia (55% compared with 41% and 42%, respectively)
- Of the most common AEs, a number were reported at a higher incidence in the &gt;18 years group compared with the 2 to &lt;12 or 12 to &lt;19 years age groups (&gt;15% difference).  These included ALT increased (75% compared with 41% and 41%, respectively), diarrhoea (83% compared with 41% and 55%, respectively), lymphocyte count decreased (67% compared with 41% and 41%, respectively), platelet  count  decreased  (67%  compared  with  36%  and  41%,  respectively),  and  white  blood  cell decreased (75% compared with 59% and 50%, respectively).

Seven (13%) subjects died and all had the primary cause of death reported as  disease under study Table 7. Only one primary cause of death was given for each subject and the 7 deaths includes the 3 subjects considered to have fatal SAEs.

Note: Only one primary cause of death was given.  If there were other reasons for the death then these were captured under the contributing causes.

Table 8 presents the clinical laboratory grade changes from baseline grade for ALT and bilirubin.  Other clinical chemistry values of Grade 3 included: alkaline phosphatase (1 subject), amylase (1 subject) and lipase (1 subject). These findings were reported as AEs. There were no Grade 4 values reported for any parameter.

N is defined as the number of subjects with values at the specified planned time.

## Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

Five subjects had an increase to Grade 2 diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 2 subjects had an increase to  Grade 3 DBP and 2 subjects had increase to  Grade 2 systolic blood pressure (SBP). In addition 3 subjects had decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction or shortening fraction as noted on echocardiograms, and one subject had an AE of 'cardiac disorder - other' reported.

Growth plate toxicity was also monitored. A total of 36 (68%) subjects had an open tibial growth plate at screening. At least two knee radiographs were obtained and centrally reviewed for 27 subjects. One subject had a closed growth plate on central review, and the second was ineligible for the study.  Of the 26 subjects with open physes (median age, 11 years; range, 4 to 17 years), one 11-year old subject  had thickening of the growth plate. This was confirmed by MRI, and a decrease in height velocity. Three additional subjects aged 11, 8 and 4 years-old each had growth plate widening radiographically after 4 cycles of treatment, but were discontinued because of progressive disease. The remaining 22 subjects  had normal radiographs, including 3 subjects receiving 8, 12, and 13 cycles.

## 4.2.5. Discussion &amp; conclusion

The MAH for Votrient (pazopanib) has submitted a variation in order to amend the SmPC, Section 4.2, Paediatric population, to delete the sentence 'No data are available'.

With the variation results from study ADVL0815/PZP114411), a Phase I Study of Pazopanib as a Single Agent for Children with Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours, has been included. The primary purpose of the phase I study ADVL0815 was to identify the MTD of pazopanib for administration to children, adolescents and young adults. The primary objectives were to evaluate  toxicity  and  begin  the  process  of  characterising  pazopanib  PK  parameters  in  a  paediatric population.  Evaluation of clinical activity was a secondary objective. A total of 53 paediatric subjects with a variety of relapsed/refractory solid tumours were evaluated and reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  data  showed  that  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations  associated  with  clinical  and  biologic  effects consistent with VEGFR inhibition (20 µ g/mL) were achieved at all dose levels after oral administration of tablets/suspension.

Some clinical activity of pazopanib was observed in a heavily pretreated paediatric population.

Clinical activity included 2 subjects with partial responses in refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumour and hepatoblastoma. Stable disease were seen in 12 subjects (23%) in a variety of tumour types (malignant melanoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant glioma, osteosarcoma, desmoplastic  small  round  cell  tumour,  alveolar  rhabdomyosarcoma  (n=2),  alveolar  soft  part  sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma.

Serious adverse events were reported for 25 (47%) subjects.  The most common SAEs were anaemia (4 [8%] subjects), increased lipase (4 [8%] subjects), abdominal pain, dyspnoea and hypothyroidism (each in 3 [6%] subjects). No other SAEs were reported for greater than 2 subjects. Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were reported for 9 (17%) subjects, 3/17 at the MTD for tablets and none at the MTD for the suspension.  All (3) fatal SAEs had the primary cause of death related to their disease.  The types of AEs observed was consistent with those seen in the adult population treated with pazopanib.

## Overall conclusion

It can be agreed that based on the data from this small paediatric study no firm conclusion can be drawn about activity nor safety  in particular tumour types and consequently efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age based on the data from this study has not yet been established. The overall efficacy and safety profile of pazopanib remains unchanged.

With the provided data the statement currently included in the SmPC section 4.2; 'no data are available' is no longer appropriate. It is also endorsed that even though some information is now available the overall paediatric data regarding safety and tolerability of pazopanib are still limited and therefore the conclusion 'that safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years have not been established' remains unchanged.

However, it could be considered of value to evaluate the data by comparing the PK data/parameters in adults with those in children of the various age categories (2-6, 6-12, 12-18 years and &gt;18 years) taking into account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide some level of paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

## 4.3. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this variation, section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated. The proposal is considered appropriate. Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 5. Request for supplementary information

1. It could be considered of value to evaluate the data by comparing the PK data/parameters in adults with those in children of the various age categories (2-6, 6-12, 12-18 years and &gt;18 years) taking into account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide some level of paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

## 6. Assessment of the responses to the request for supplementary information

## Question 1

It could be considered of value to evaluate the data by comparing the PK data/parameters in adults with those in children of the various age categories (2-6, 6-12, 12-18 years and &gt;18 years) taking into account possible differences in formulation and absolute doses and provide some level of paediatric PK data in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

## Response:

VOTRIENT does not currently have an indication in the paediatric population; however, GSK agrees that paediatric pharmacokinetic data could be of value. To that end, the available data were reviewed.

The breakdown of the pharmacokinetic results of the children by age categories, formulation, and dose from Study ADVL0815/PZP114411 (a phase I study of pazopanib as a single agent for children with relapsed or refractory solid tumours, including central nervous system (CNS) tumours) is shown in Table 1. As can be observed from the information in the table, the sample size for each age category is very small therefore the data are not amenable for a summary in the SmPC to provide relevant pharmacokinetic data to a prescriber at this time.

GSK will continue to collect and review data from ongoing paediatric studies and will inform the EMA of relevant data in this population as they become available.

## Conclusion

The MAH as provided their response to the one outstanding issue. As highlighted by the MAH Votrient (pazopanib)  is  not  approved  for  the  use  in  the  paediatric  population,  and  the  numbers  on  which  any pharmacokinetic information may be based on and subsequently addressed in section 4.2 is very limited. Thus the conclusion of the MAH, that nothing further may be included in section 5.2 in the SmPC is endorsed.
