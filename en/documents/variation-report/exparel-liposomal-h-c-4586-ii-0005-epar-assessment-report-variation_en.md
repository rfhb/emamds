## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pacira Ireland Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 13 August 2021 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include treatment of children aged 6 and older as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds for EXPAREL liposomal; as a consequence, sections 4.1,4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.1 of the RMP has also been submitted.

The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) P/0342/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0342/2021 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## Disease or condition

Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage and postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury or nerve injury, or both. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of adult and paediatric patient care (Derry 2013), and if treated inadequately can significantly affect recovery (Apfelbaum 2003). Inadequate pain relief in children may lead to short and long-term physiological and psychological consequences such as hyperalgesia and anxiety (Berde et al,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2012; Gerik, 2005, Taddio, 2009) and may diminish the effect of adequate analgesia in subsequent procedures (Weisman et al, 1998).

## Epidemiology

It has been estimated that 5.4 million patients under the age of 18 undergo inpatient surgical procedures every year in the EU (Jonker, 2014). Moderate-to-severe pain is experienced by approximately 60% of children following surgery in the hospital setting (Kozlowski et al, 2014).

## Aetiology and pathogenesis

The aetiology and underlying physiology of postsurgical pain is similar in paediatric and adult patients. Peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal afferent pain transmission is mature already in neonates (Berde et al, 2002). Relative to adults, children younger than 12 years of age have minor differences in nerve myelination (i.e., incomplete myelination in children and shorter distances between nodes of Ranvier) that may lead to slower transmission of pain signals (Brislin et al, 2005; Mazoit, 2006; Rose et al, 2004). However, these differences are not considered clinically relevant because the major neurons involved in nociception, C fibers and Aδ fibers, are unmyelinated or thinly myelinated in adults, respectively (Rose et al, 2004).

## Clinical presentation, diagnosis

During the postoperative period, pain manifests itself with maximum intensity during the first 24 hours, reducing progressively (Nava-Obregón, 2016). Most intense pain is experienced on postoperative day 1, which decreases slightly by postoperative day 3 (Apfelbaum, 2003).

## Management

In both paediatric and adult patients, multimodal analgesia is the standard of care for postoperative pain management (Chou et al, 2016; American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001).

Multimodal regimens incorporate two or more agents with different mechanisms of action to maximise pain control at lower analgesic doses while minimising drug-induced side effects. The current treatment options  for  postsurgical  analgesia  include  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  local anaesthetics, acetaminophen, opioids, N-methyl-Daspartate antagonists, and α2 -adrenergic agonists; the specific components of effective multimodal care vary depending on the patient, setting, and surgical procedure (Chou et al, 2016).

Local anaesthetics are particularly useful for management of moderate-to-severe acute pain and have been shown to improve postsurgical analgesia and reduce opioid utilization (Berde 2002; Brislin et al, 2005; Mazoit 2006; Suresh et al, 2014), however, their duration of analgesic effect is typically shorter than the duration of moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain, which can often extend for several days. Bupivacaine is one of the longer-acting local anaesthetics but it has a duration of action of approximately 4-8 hours (Whiteman et al, 2011).

## 2.1.1. About the product

Exparel liposomal is a prolonged-release liposomal dispersion of bupivacaine. It is indicated as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults.

Bupivacaine hydrochloride has been used in Europe and worldwide for more than 50 years. It is approved for use in paediatric patients aged 1 year and older in the EU (Marcain SmPC) and the UK.

Exparel was approved by CHMP in 2020 and by the US FDA in October 2011 for the use in adults. FDA also  granted  indication  for  children  6  years  of  age  and  older  for  single-dose  infiltration  to  produce postsurgical local analgesia.

Since moderate-to-severe acute pain following surgery or injury from trauma often lasts longer than the duration of action offered by current formulations of local anaesthetics, the rationale for developing Exparel has been to provide prolonged acute pain management via a single administration.

This Type II variation concerns the use of Exparel liposomal as a field block for the treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in paediatric patients aged 6 and older.

## 2.1.2. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

## Scientific Advice

The MAH received written scientific advice from HALMED in Croatia on 30 April 2021 and from MHRA in the UK on 07 June 2021. Both scientific advices addressed questions on pharmacokinetics, extrapolation of study results, safety and SmPC.

In summary, the approach proposed by the MAH comparing the pharmacokinetics of Exparel in children to that in matching surgeries in adults was supported. It was agreed that similar PK profile in adults and children would allow to conclude on safety, however a discussion would be required to justify similar efficacy. It was also agreed that results from studies of cardiothoracic and spine surgeries would allow extrapolation to similar surgeries as these have a long wound size and represent extremes in PK.

## PIP

The PIP Decision for EXPAREL (P/402/2018) was issued on 7th December 2018 and was modified by subsequent PIP Decisions on 29th January 2020 (P/0036/2020), 17th March 2021 (P/0113/2021) and 9th August 2021 (P/0342/2021). The current clinical measures agreed for the PIP consist of 4 clinical studies, two in wound infiltration and two in nerve block. The Final Report submission for Study 402-C319,  A  Multicenter  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Pharmacokinetics  and  Safety  of  EXPAREL  for  Postsurgical Analgesia in Pediatric Subjects Aged 6 to Less Than 17 years (PLAY), is provided in this type II variation.

The Compliance Report on the agreed PIP, dated 31 August 2021, confirms that study 402-C-319 was compliant with the EMA's Decision (P/0342/2021) of 9 August 2021.

At the time of submission of the type II application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred

## 2.1.3. General comments on compliance with GCP

The MAH provided the statement that all studies were conducted with respect for the individual participants according to the respective protocol, the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline.

FDA inspected one Study 319 US site (No 116), from 12 Feb - 1 Mar 2021 (Voluntary Remote Record Review).  Due to coronavirus pandemic, there was no formal GCP inspection, the site was inspected remotely. The site successfully passed its remote record review without major findings.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this variation application, except an assessment of environmental risk which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

## PHASE I: ESTIMATION OF EXPOSURE

## Assessment for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity

According to the guideline, drug substances with a logKow &gt;4.5 should be screened for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) according to the guidance provided for REACH.

As the measured partition coefficient values for bupivacaine were below the trigger of 4.5 (0.5 at pH 5, 2.2 at pH 7 and 3.1 at pH 9), a PBT assessment was not required. The value for the dissociated molecule determined around a pH of 7 is considered most realistic for PBT and chemical safety assessment.

As bupivacaine metabolites are expected to be more soluble in water than the parent drug substance, the risk for bioaccumulation of metabolites is also considered to be acceptable.

## Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC)

In Phase I, the PEC calculation is restricted to the aquatic compartment. The calculation of the PEC in surface water further assumes that the predicted amount used per year is evenly distributed over the year and throughout the geographic area, the sewage system is the main route of entry, there is no biodegradation or retention of the drug substance in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and metabolism in the patient is not taken into account. Thus, a PEC is only calculated for the active entity (the parent compound or the active metabolite for prodrugs).

PECSURFACEWATER (expressed in mg/L) is calculated as:

## Figure 1

<!-- image -->

(for explanation of abbreviations and values, see Table 1 below).

An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline assuming that 100% of the patient population is daily taking the medicinal product. Refinement of the Fpen is possible based on a refined Pregion and the treatment regimen following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Figure 2

<!-- image -->

In which:

Pregion

prevalence for particular region

ttreatment

duration of one treatment period (days)

Ntreatment,p

number of treatment periods/year

Nd

number of days/year, i.e., 365 days/year

If  reasonably  justified  market  penetration  data,  e.g.,  based  on  published  epidemiological  data,  are available  to  estimate  a  more  accurate  Pregion,  this  may  be  used.  The  refined  Pregion  represents  the prevalence of the medical indication, where possible refined for a subpopulation of patients eligible for treatment with the drug substance under consideration. Further refinement based on posology is possible for drug products with a well-defined treatment regime.

The proposed variation is to expand the indication for use as a field block for the treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in children aged 6 years or older. The dose is dependent on the size of the surgical site, the volume required to cover the area and individual patient factors that may impact the safety of an amide local anesthetic.

Exparel is intended for single-dose administration only and is expected to be used once a year (i.e., one vial/patient/year).

There are no data to refine the Fpen based on prevalence for the indications. Therefore, the default of 0.01 is used and considered to cover all indications. As Fpen represents the fraction of a population receiving the active substance, adults and children are covered by definition.

The default factor of 0.01 as suggested by the guideline is used as Pregion. As EXPAREL is intended to be used only once a year as a single dose, Fpen can be refined for posology using

Equation 2 with ttreatment = 1 and ntreatment,p = 1:

Fpen = 0.01 * (1 * 1)/365 = 0.0000274

The calculation of the related PECSURFACEWATER is shown in Table 1 below:

The PECSURFACEWATER is below the action limit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the first version of the ERA report, an additional calculation was included to validate the PEC calculation based on default Fpen, using actual consumption data of bupivacaine (not restricted to EXPAREL). The additional  calculation  showed  that  the  environmental  exposure  based  on  actual  consumption  of bupivacaine was lower than that estimated using the default Fpen. As the default Fpen in the current version of the ERA still applies, the exercise of conducting an additional calculation based on consumption data is not repeated.

## Applicability of action limit

As the CHMP guideline indicates that the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not applicable to all substances, i.e. more specifically, not for substances that may affect reproduction of vertebrate or lower animals at concentrations lower than 0.01 μg/L, the toxicological data related to reproduction in mammals are considered.

Bupivacaine  solutions  have  been  marketed  in  Europe  and  the  US  for  many  years  as  a  local anaesthetic/analgesic  administered  by  field  block,  peripheral  nerve  block,  and  central  neural  block (caudal and epidural). The pharmacology, PK, and toxicology of bupivacaine and its structural analogues in laboratory animals and humans are thus well understood.

## Reproduction and developmental toxicology

Bupivacaine HCl was administered subcutaneously to rats at doses of 4.4, 13.3, and 40 mg/kg and to rabbits at doses of 1.3, 5.8, and 22.2 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis (implantation to closure of  the  hard  palate).  No  embryo-fetal  effects  were  observed  in  rats  at  the  high  dose  which  caused increased maternal lethality. An increase in embryo-fetal deaths was observed in rabbits at the high dose in the absence of maternal toxicity with the fetal NOAEL. The NOAEL is thus considered to be 5.8 mg/kg/d.

In a rat pre- and post-natal development study (dosing from implantation through weaning) conducted at subcutaneous doses of 4.4, 13.3, and 40 mg/kg/day, decreased pup survival was observed at the highest dose. The NOAEL is thus considered to be 13.3 mg/kg/day.

The overall lowest ecologically relevant NOAEL was 5.8 mg/kg. In order to reach this concentration in fish,  the  bioconcentration  factor  (BCF)  in  fish  should  be  very  high  (i.e.  concentration  in  fish  / PECSURFACEWATER =  5800  [μg/kg]  /  0.0036  [μg/L] =1.6E+06  L/kg,  calculated  from  the  worst-case PECSURFACEWATER). This is very unlikely, considering the low measured partition coefficient values of 0.5 at pH 5, 2.2 at pH 7 and 3.1 at pH 9.

Therefore, based on available data, bupivacaine is not expected to affect the reproduction of vertebrate or lower animals at concentrations lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L.

## CONCLUSION

The measured partition coefficient values of bupivacaine are below 4.5 (i.e., 0.5 at pH 5, 2.2 at pH 7 and 3.1 at pH 9). Therefore, bupivacaine cannot be identified as a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or a very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance.

The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of bupivacaine was 0.0036 μg/L and does not exceed the action limit of 0.01 μ g/L.  Bupivacaine  is  also  not  expected  to  affect  the  reproduction  of  vertebrate  or  lower  animals  at concentrations lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L.

Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  medicinal  product  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  for  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this variation application, except an assessment of environmental risk, which is considered acceptable. As bupivacaine is a well-known active substance widely used in paediatric patients, additional non-clinical studies, including juvenile toxicity studies, are not expected to provide new data and are not thus required.

However, concerns regarding the suitability of the excipients for the paediatric population and safety of the  formulation  in  the  new  proposed  age  category  were  raised  by  the  CHMP.Within  the  response documentation,  the  MAH  provided  a  comprehensive  justification  for  safety  and  suitability  of  the excipients used in the EXPAREL for the proposed paediatric population. A non-clinical package included in  the  original  MAA application assessed the local tolerability of the DepoFoam particle components, specifically DEPC as a novel excipient in the EU. DEPC is a synthetic homolog of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) which is a natural lipid. Once the DepoFoam vesicle is broken down into individual components DEPC is expected to follow the lipid catabolism pathways similar to a natural fatty acid. Furthermore, toxicity studies on the excipient DEPC indicated that it is without significant local or  systemic  toxicity  at  single  or  repeated  doses,  and  that  it  has  no  genotoxic,  teratogenic,  or developmental effects. In additional, a pilot juvenile rat study submitted as part of the initial MAA did not reveal effects of treatment on mortality, clinical findings, body weights or body weight gain, postweaning food consumption, macroscopic examinations, or organ weight data.Regarding an assessment of  environmental  risk,  the  MAH  has  recalculated  the  PECSURFACEWATER,  using  a  Fpen  for  the  extended indication, which is refined based on treatment regime.

The recalculated PECSURFACEWATER is 0.0036 μg/L. Since PECSURFACEWATER of bupivacaine remains below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, it is still believed that Exparel is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

In  addition,  the  measured  partition  coefficient  values  of  bupivacaine  are  below  4.5.    Therefore, bupivacaine cannot be identified as a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or a very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical studies are required in support of this variation application. The CHMP agreed that the excipients used in the EXPAREL are suitable for the paediatric population without safety concerns. Based on the updated ERA data submitted in this application, the extended indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

To support this Type II variation and extension of field block indication to paediatric patients aged 6 years and older, the MAH completed two studies in spine and cardiac procedures (Study 120 and Study 319). These two highly vascular procedures were selected in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of EXAPREL under conditions where the highest systemic levels of bupivacaine and corresponding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

risk for toxicity would be expected, thereby allowing for the data obtained to be extrapolated to less invasive procedures.

Two additional supportive studies in matching surgical procedures (one in spine procedures and one in thoracic procedures) in adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg via local infiltration were performed to provide a scientific bridge between the paediatric and adult age groups (Study 117 and Study 118). Both studies were assessed in the initial MAA. All studies in the program were designed to characterize the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of EXPAREL by assessing systemic levels of bupivacaine. Efficacy assessments  were  included  in  the  paediatric  studies  as  exploratory  endpoints,  and  these  were  not powered to make efficacy claims.

The basis for the extrapolation of efficacy of EXPAREL from adult to paediatric patients consists of the following factors:

1. a similar pathophysiology of postsurgical pain in paediatric and adult patients
2. a  similar  mechanism  of  action,  metabolic  pathway,  and  response  to  intervention  with conventional bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients
3. demonstration of efficacy in two Phase 3 randomized, controlled studies (bunionectomy, haemorrhoidectomy) of EXPAREL in adults that supported its approval as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds
4. confirmation of similar bupivacaine exposures from single-dose infiltration of EXPAREL in paediatric and adult subjects in matched surgical models and anticipated similar effect site exposure
5. the systemic absorption of bupivacaine from EXPAREL was similar among paediatric and adult  subjects  in  matched  surgical  procedures.  This  observation  in  light  of  the  similar metabolism of bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients supports that the rate of local release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL is similar across age groups.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## PK methods

For Studies 117, 118, and 319, the bupivacaine pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis of subject data for plasma bupivacaine concentration over time. Actual sampling times relative to study drug administration were used to estimate all pharmacokinetic parameters. Cmax and Tmax values are described in three ways:

- Early Cmax / Tmax: values occurring within 0-4 hours after administration of dose
- Late Cmax / Tmax: values occurring after 4 hours after administration of dose
-  Global  Cmax  /  Tmax:  the  maximum  values  occurring  during  the  entire  observation  period  after administration of dose.

All mean Cmax and Tmax values were calculated by averaging Cmax and Tmax values for all subjects.

In Study 120, pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using a population PK approach.

## Population PK model

The population PK model of EXPAREL was originally developed using adult PK data from wound infiltration studies (201, 208, 316, 317, and 401). This model was updated based on the results of Studies 117, 120 and 319.

Both non-compartmental analysis and population PK model were used to analyse PK data in paediatric subjects. The methods are considered appropriate.

No statistical analysis was performed to evaluate similarity of the exposure between paediatric and adult population in matching surgical procedures. The comparison is rather of descriptive manner and there were no pre-defined criteria to establish similarity in exposures. It is acknowledged that no therapeutic range exists for systemic bupivacaine and therefore formal demonstration of statistical similarity in PK parameters would not be feasible. Instead, the MAH focuses on showing similar PK profile suggesting prolonged release of bupivacaine in paediatric subjects.

The current variation of EXPAREL at a dose of 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 266 mg) is for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 6 years and older undergoing spinal or cardiac procedures. To support clinical pharmacology in paediatric subjects, two studies were conducted in paediatric subjects undergoing spine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or cardiac surgery (i.e., studies 120 and 319), and two studies were conducted in matching surgeries in adults (i.e., studies 117 and 118) to provide a basis for comparison of the pharmacokinetic profiles (see Table 2 above).  Of note, Study 120 was utilized to inform the appropriate sampling windows and to provide supportive pharmacokinetics and safety data to support the selection of the EXPAREL 4 mg/kg dose in Study 319.

Study  120 was  a  Phase  1,  open-label,  single  arm  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and pharmacokinetics  of  EXPAREL  when  administered  via  local  infiltration  for  postsurgical  analgesia  in subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years old undergoing spinal surgery. Eligible subjects received a single dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (not to exceed a maximum dose of 266 mg) based on the body weight of the subject. Fifteen subjects completed the study for PK and safety assessments.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the PK of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.

The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.

The pharmacokinetic sampling scheme is presented in Table 3 . Each subject provided either five (Groups 1 - 3) or eight (Group 4) blood samples for the determination of bupivacaine plasma concentrations.

The amendments in Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection Timing Schedule were introduced before inclusion patients in group 4. The characteristic early/late double peak profile, which is often observed with EXPAREL administered by infiltration, was either not present or could not be observed due to the limited number of samples collected at early time points post-administration. In addition, in all subjects, systemic bupivacaine had already fallen to clinically insignificant levels by the fourth sampling time point. Thus, following the PK interim analysis, it was decided to update the PK sampling scheme to include more samples at earlier time points and to limit the last PK collection window to 42 - 60 hours postEXPAREL administration.

## Pharmacokinetic Results of Study 120

Prior to implementation of Amendment 2 of Study 120, which changed the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme from 5 samples per subject to 8, a total of seven subjects were randomized to either Group 1 or Group 2 or Group 3 (Table 3). As the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme had been inadequate to fully

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

characterize  bupivacaine  concentrations  during  the  earlier  sampling  times  (Figure  3),  no  definitive pharmacokinetic conclusions could be drawn from these subjects.

ActualTime(hours)SinceStudyDrugAdministration

A total of eight subjects were randomized to Group 4. In general subjects in this group showed two bupivacaine peaks: the first was observed between 15 to 30 minutes (i.e., first two sampling windows) following administration of EXPAREL, and second was between 1-3 hours for five subjects and between 10 to 18 hours for two subjects, which was followed by a gradual decrease to the lowest concentrations by approximately 42 to 60 hours (Figure 4). Observed peak plasma concentrations ranged from 331.0 to 559.0 ng/mL.

Actual Time(hours) Since Study Drug Administration

Instead of non-compartmental analysis, the applicant used a population PK model to assess the PK parameters for this study as four different sampling schemes were implemented.

The observed inter individual variability has been explained with non-compliance with study protocol. One subject received a single total dose of 80 mg EXPAREL and was underdosed; based on subjects' body weight, a total dose of approximately 248 mg EXPAREL should have been administrated, whereas two other subjects received a single total dose of 286 mg and 296 mg, respectively, exceeding the maximum dose limit of 266 mg, which is also the approved dose in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 120 evaluated PK and safety of Exparel 4 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum dose of 266 mg) in paediatric subjects (12 to &lt; 17 years) undergoing spinal surgery. When sufficient PK samples were obtained  (Group  4,  8  PK  samples),  a  characteristic  double-peak  Exparel  plasma  profile  could  be observed. The highest observed bupivacaine plasma concentration in this study was 559 ng/mL at 0.3 hours, which is below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. The lowest bupivacaine plasma levels were reached by approximately 48 hours which could have implications on the duration of the effect. Please see further considerations below.

The study included exploratory efficacy assessments which are addressed in the Efficacy part of this AR.

Study 319 was a Phase 3, open-label, multi-centre study to evaluate the PK and safety of EXPAREL when administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine surgery (Group 1) and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing spine surgery or cardiac surgery (Group 2).

In Group 1, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of either EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (maximum 266 mg) or bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg (maximum 175 mg). In Group 2, all subjects received a single dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (maximum 266 mg). Study drug was administered via infiltration into the surgical site prior to wound closure.

Group 1: The mean (±SD) total incision length was 30.9 (± 5.71) cm in the EXPAREL group and 30.3 (± 4.09) cm in the bupivacaine HCl group.

Group 2: The mean (± SD) total incision length was 19.3 (± 13.58) cm in the spine surgery group and 13.0 (± 3.74) cm in the cardiac surgery group.

The primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;17 years undergoing various types of surgeries.

The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;17 years undergoing various types of surgeries.

This study was not powered to evaluate efficacy; efficacy was examined for descriptive purposes only.

A noncompartmental analysis (NCA) was performed to calculate the PK parameters.

Population PK modelling was also performed using all PK data collected during the study.

## Pharmacokinetic Results of Study 319

## PK Results in Subjects who Underwent Spine Surgery

Mean plasma bupivacaine concentration over time after administration of EXPAREL or bupivacaine HCl following spine surgery is presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Mean Plasma Bupivacaine Concentration with EXPAREL after Spine Surgery in Study 319

<!-- image -->

EXPAREL-treated subjects showed a prolonged duration of measurable systemic bupivacaine compared to bupivacaine HCl-treated subjects in the spine surgery group. The pharmacokinetic profile of subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl shows that bupivacaine was more rapidly absorbed systemically compared at higher peak concentrations than was the case for EXPAREL.

In Figure 5, Exparel plasma profile combines PK data from patients undergoing spine surgery from Group 1 (n=16) and Group 2 (n=2), while bupivacaine HCl plasma profile comes from Group 1 subjects only. EXPAREL-treated subjects showed a prolonged duration of measurable systemic bupivacaine compared to bupivacaine HCl-treated subjects in the spine surgery group. The pharmacokinetic profile of subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl shows that bupivacaine was more rapidly absorbed systemically compared at higher peak concentrations than was the case for EXPAREL.

Pharmacokinetic parameters of Exparel for subjects undergoing spine surgery in Study 319 are shown in Table 6 below:

The higher AUC values in EXPAREL-treated subjects were consistent with the higher doses of bupivacaine base given to EXPAREL-treated subjects. The Cmax observed in the bupivacaine HCl treatment arm was higher (1.45-fold geometric mean) than in the EXPAREL treatment arm, even though the overall Tmax values were very similar (~1 h). Two Tmax values were visually apparent for EXPAREL; an Early Cmax occurred during the first 2 hours of Exparel administration, and Late Cmax occurred at approximately 18 hours after administration. For most subjects, Early Cmax was higher than Late Cmax. The highest observed  concentration  for  spinal  surgery  was  595  ng/mL  at  1-1.25  hours.  The  highest  observed concentration in the bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg group was 1270 ng/mL at 0.25 hours. The bupivacaine t½ was considerably higher for EXPAREL than for the bupivacaine HCl treatment arm.

## PK Results in Subjects who Underwent Cardiac Surgery

Mean plasma bupivacaine concentration over time after administration of EXPAREL following cardiac surgery is presented in Figure 6.

Most subjects receiving EXPAREL exhibited two bupivacaine peaks. Early Cmax generally occurred during the first hour after Exparel administration and Late Cmax generally occurred at approximately 30 hours after administration. Afterwards, there was a gradual decrease to approximately 200 ng/mL at 60 hours.

Pharmacokinetic parameters of Exparel for subjects undergoing cardiac surgery in Study 319 are shown in the Table 7 below:

Cardiac subjects receiving Exparel had higher exposure than spine subjects, based on Cmax and AUC. The highest observed concentration for cardiac surgery was 1290 ng/mL at 0.5 hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 319 was a PK and safety study for the use of EXPAREL as a field block for the treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in paediatric patients aged 6 years and older.

PK comparison of Exparel 4 mg/kg vs bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg in Group 1 (spine surgery in adolescents 12-17  years  old)  showed  that  Exparel  exhibits  similar  PK  properties  as  already  observed  in  adult subjects; slower absorption and more sustained bupivacaine concentrations, in line with the extended release of bupivacaine from the multivesicular liposomes. The observed Cmax was lower and Tmax later in the Exparel group, with two maximums present in most subjects. However, since systemic plasma concentrations do not correlate with the local effect of Exparel, they are more indicative of safety.

Group 2 included subjects aged 6 to &lt;12 years, who were given Exparel 4 mg/kg only, and most of them (n=21)  underwent  cardiac  surgery.  Group  2  included  only  2  subjects  in  the  age  range  6-12  years undergoing  spine  surgery,  whereby  the  applicant  concludes  that  the  exposure  matched  that  of  the Exparel subjects (12-17 years) in Group 1. This is considered to be a rather limited sample size to allow such  conclusion,  although  it  is  generally  acknowledged  no  physiological  reasons  exist  to  expect  an influence of age on bupivacaine absorption at the site of action.

The highest Cmax was observed in cardiac surgery: 1290 ng/mL at 0.5 hours, which is below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects.

Study 117 ( in adults ) was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and PK of EXPAREL when administered as a field block via local wound infiltration to subjects undergoing open posterior spinal fusion or reconstructive surgery. Eligible subjects, whose surgical incision was between 8 and 30 cm in length, received a single dose of EXPAREL (266 mg/20 mL) expanded in volume with 40-280 mL normal saline, depending on the size of the incision. Twelve subjects completed the study for PK and safety assessments. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained predose (on Day 1 prior to study drug administration); at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hours after study drug administration; and on Day 7.

Three  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  pharmacokinetic  analysis  set,  because  they  did  not  provide sufficient samples to allow for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK parameters are presented in Table 6.

Study  118 ( in  adults )  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and pharmacokinetics  of  EXPAREL  when  administered  for  postsurgical  analgesia  in  subjects  undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy surgery. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 and received a single 266 mg dose of EXPAREL.

Cohort 1: 20 mL EXPAREL + 20 mL normal saline (0.9%) for a total volume of 40 mL. Twenty mL (containing 133 mg liposomal bupivacaine) were injected intercostally over 5 interspaces; the remaining volume (approximately 20 mL, containing 133 mg liposomal bupivacaine) was used to infiltrate the wound/port/chest tube sites (further diluted as needed to cover incisions).

Cohort 2: 20 mL EXPAREL + 10 mL normal saline (0.9%) for a total volume of 30 mL. Twenty mL (containing 177 mg liposomal bupivacaine) were injected intercostally over 5 interspaces; the remaining volume  (approximately  10  mL,  containing  89  mg  liposomal  bupivacaine)  was  used  to  infiltrate  the wound/port/chest tube sites (further diluted as needed to cover incisions).

Five subjects completed the study for PK and safety assessments.

Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained pre-dose/baseline (Day 1 prior to study drug administration) and at 0.5, 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after study drug administration. The PK parameters are presented in Table 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For comparison of paediatric PK profiles from Study 319 to adult PK profiles from Study 118 (assessed in  the  initial  MAA),  different  routes  of  administration  were  applied.  In  study  118,  Exparel  was administered as a posterior intercostal nerve block with wound infiltration of the remaining suspension to adult subjects undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.

In MAH's view, since both studies involved cardiothoracic procedures in highly vascular areas and similar PK profiles were shown, these studies can be considered comparable. Due to the fact that vascularity is one of the key factors affecting systemic absorption and, thus, safety, this approach is acknowledged, although this comparison is not considered ideal due to different mode of administration across the two studies, as well as the limited sample size in the adult study.

## Comparison  of  Pharmacokinetic  Profile  Between  Paediatric  Subjects  to  Adult  Subjects  in Matching Surgical Procedures

## Comparison of Pharmacokinetic Profile Following Spine Surgery

In the setting of spine surgery, the mean bupivacaine time-concentration curve for paediatric subjects who received EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 266 mg) in Study 319 was compared to the curve for adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg in Study 117 (Figure 7).

The difference in AUC values observed between age groups is due to the difference in absolute dose administered in adults and paediatric subjects.

The  MAH  has  conducted  additional  population  PK  analyses  which  suggest  that  incision  size  is  not significantly  associated  with  greater  exposure.  The  difference  in  AUC  values  observed  between  age groups is due to the difference in absolute dose administered in adults and paediatric subjects.

As already mentioned, no statistical analysis was performed to assess the similarity of the PK profiles between paediatric and adult subjects, and there were no pre-defined criteria to evaluate when the exposures  could  be  considered  similar.  While  it  can  be  concluded  that  PK  profiles  following  Exparel administration  in  both  studies  319  and  117  clearly  differ  from  the  PK  profile  of  bupivacaine  HCl administered in study 319, it is more difficult to establish the similarity of Exparel PK profiles between adult and paediatric patients without adequate statistical comparison.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the sparse PK sampling schemes, all PK comparisons were based on population PK modelling rather than direct comparison of observed values across groups. The characteristic shape of the PK profile between adults and paediatric subjects appears to be reasonably similar, however it is noted that while the Early Cmax and Late Cmax are considerably similar between the children and adolescents, the pediatric  population  in  whole  has  demonstrated  lower  values  than  adult  population.  Based  on  the applicant's  view,  the  difference  is  observed  due  to  different  absolute  dose  administered  -  in  adult population, a 266 mg dose of EXPAREL irrespective of weight was administered, whereas in in paediatric subjects 4 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 266 mg, were administered.

It is important to note that the paediatric exposure remaining below the adult exposure can support the safety of the proposed paediatric dose 4 mg/kg.

Using population PK model for spinal procedures, AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax for adolescents dosed at 4 mg/kg were 37-39% lower, 22-35% lower, 30-36% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, depending on the statistic (Table 8). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, the AUC, early Cmax, late Cmax values were 55-58% lower, 31-35% lower, 43-56% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg.

## Comparison of Pharmacokinetic Profile Following Cardiothoracic Surgery

In the setting of cardiac surgery, the mean bupivacaine time-concentration curve for paediatric subjects who received EXPAREL 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 266 mg) in Study 319 was compared to the curve for adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg in Study 118 (Figure 8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is noted that comparison of paediatric PK profiles from Study 319 to adult PK profiles from Study 118 is made using different routes of administration as discussed above. However, since both studies involved cardio-thoracic  procedures  with  high  vascularity,  this  approach  could  be  acknowledged.  In  cardiac surgery, PK data are available only from subjects of younger age group (6 to &lt; 12 years). During initial assessment, the applicant was asked to estimate the exposure for the adolescent group (12 to &lt; 17 years) using the developed Pop PK model and discuss whether exposure could be considered similar. With the responses, the applicant has provided additional analysis showing that canonical overall PK profile of Exparel is evident in all age groups, although more variability was observed in the early and late Cmax values among adults relative to adolescents and children, whereas early Cmax values were similar in all age groups.

Paediatric subjects undergoing cardiac surgery had higher bupivacaine exposures based on Cmax and AUC  compared  to  subjects  undergoing  spine  surgery.  However,  these  exposures  were  below  the exposures associated with safety concerns in adult subjects.

The bupivacaine exposure parameters in adults and paediatric subjects who received EXPAREL into the thoracic wall and surrounding subcutaneous tissue following cardiac and thoracic surgery were generally similar (Table 10).

Using population PK model for cardiac procedures, AUC and late Cmax values for adolescents dosed at 4 mg/kg were 36-39% lower and 33-40% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively, depending on the statistic (Table 10). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, AUC and late Cmax values were 55-58% lower and 47-53% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively. Early Cmax values were similar in all age groups due to very high absorption rate.

aPredicted using covariates and random effects of adults that received EXPAREL for spinal procedures in Study 117.

Pop PK modelling has shown that the differences in observed bupivacaine exposure between adolescents and children relative to adults in the clinical studies are consistent with the magnitudes of the differences that would occur between adults receiving EXPAREL at corresponding absolute dose levels (266 mg, 194 mg and 132 mg).

## · Evaluation and Qualification of Models

Two pop-PK models estimating the PK parameters in paediatric population have been presented by the applicant:

- Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL in Studies 402-C-120 and 402-C-117,
- Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL and Bupivacaine HCL in Study 402-C-319.

## Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL in Studies 402-C-120 and 402-C-117

A  previously  developed  population  PK  model  of  bupivacaine  following  administration  of  EXPAREL  as wound infiltration  to  adult  subjects  in  various  surgical  procedures  was  expanded  to  describe  spinal procedures in pediatric (12 - &lt;17 years old) and adult subjects (from study 117). Absorption parameters for the spinal procedures were added to the model; differences between absorption parameters of adult and pediatric subjects were explored; the influence of body weight and sex on the PK parameters was evaluated.

Objectives of the population PK model were:

- To expand a population PK model of EXPAREL administered as a wound infiltration to describe spinal surgical procedures in pediatric (12 - &lt;17 years) and adult subjects.
- To explore whether there are differences in EXPAREL PK between adult and pediatric subjects of 12 to less than 17 years old;
- To determine post-hoc estimates of exposure (early and Late Cmax and Tmax, and AUC) for pediatric subjects from study 120.

Number of subjects and PK samples included in the Pop PK analysis is shown below:

Model development was data driven and was based on various goodness-of-fit indicators,  including diagnostic plots, precision of parameter estimates, and the minimum objective function value (a p-value of 0.01 was used for model discrimination). The model was evaluated using various diagnostic plots and visual predictive check techniques.

The diagnostic plots of the model did not indicate any model deficiencies. The visual predictive check plots of the simulated percentiles overlaid with the observed data or percentiles of the data show an agreement between the simulated and observed data (Figure 9).

Concentrations are plotted versus time from dose on arithmetic scale (left) and semi-log scale (right). The circles show the observed values. The lines show median (red), and the 5th and 95 th  percentiles (blue) of the simulated (bold solid lines) and observed (dash lines) concentrations. The simulated values were computed from 1000 trials with sampling and the covariate values of subjects from the respective studies.

Observed  data  for  adult  subjects  from  study  117  appear  to  be  adequately  captured  by  the  model predictions, both the central tendency and variability in the concentrations. For paediatric subjects from study  120,  median  and  5th  percentile  appear  to  be  adequately  predicted  by  the  model,  while  95th percentile of the observed data seems to be over-predicted by the model. This is considered to provide an additional safety margin for the simulated data.

The final model was used to predict bupivacaine concentration-time profiles for spinal procedures in pediatric  and  adult  subjects.  Conditional  simulations  were  used  to  predict  and  summarize  individual concentrations, PK parameters, and exposures (Early and Late Cmax and Tmax and AUC) in pediatric and adult subjects.

Based on the model simulations, the MAH concludes that PK of bupivacaine in adult and paediatric subjects undergoing spinal procedures was generally similar. While early and late Cmax appear to be comparable  between  paediatric  and  adult  subjects,  AUC  and  t1/2  were  quite  lower  in  paediatric population. In Study 120, observed bupivacaine plasma concentrations reached the lowest levels by approximately 42 to 60 hours and it was evident from the simulations that bupivacaine concentrations drop faster for adolescents compared to adults. Therefore, during initial assessment, a concern was raised  whether  lower  AUC,  shorter  t1/2  and  reaching  lowest  concentrations  earlier  in  paediatric population could affect efficacy and duration of effect in this population. The MAH again emphasized that PK of local anaesthetics are more relevant to safety than efficacy. The systemic concentration of a local anaesthetic  is  not  directly  correlated  with  pain  relief  because  the  degree  of  analgesia  a  patient experiences at a given time is determined by the exposure of the agent at the site of action, which cannot be measured in vivo. Bupivacaine PK profile following Exparel administration in paediatric patients was showing characteristics of the prolonged bupivacaine release at the site of action, similar as in adult patients.

## Population PK Analysis of EXPAREL and Bupivacaine HCL in Study 402-C-319

The  objective  was  to  expand  an  earlier  developed  population  PK  model  that  described  EXPAREL administered as a wound infiltration in adult and adolescent subjects to characterize PK of EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCL in pediatric subjects (6 -&lt;17 years) in study 402-C-319.

Number of subjects and samples included in the Pop PK analysis is shown below.

Concentrations are plotted versus time from dose on arithmetic scale (top) and semi-log scale (bottom). The circles show the observed values. The lines show median (red), and the 5th and 95th percentiles (blue) of the simulated (bold solid lines) and observed (dash lines) concentrations. The simulated values were computed from 1000 trials with sampling and the covariate values of subjects from the respective treatment groups of study 402-C-319.

The  final  model  was  used  to  predict  bupivacaine  concentration-time  profiles  for  pediatric  subjects undergoing spinal and cardiac procedures. Conditional simulations were used to predict and summarize individual concentrations, PK parameters, and exposures (Early and Late Cmax and Tmax and AUC) for subjects in study 402-C-319.

Visual predictive checks show that the observed concentrations are well captured within predictions for Exparel  administered  in  spinal  and  cardiac  surgeries.  There  are  quite  some  underpredictions  of  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations following administration of regular bupivacaine HCl. However, this is not considered to have an impact on PK conclusions obtained by the NCA.

## Additional Population PK Modelling to Evaluate the Similarity of PK in Adults and Paediatric Patients

The key Population PK findings from the final model (Model 520, Population PK Report V3) for adult and paediatric patients include:

- Apparent clearance and inter-compartment clearance does not depend on body weight or age among individuals less than 55 years of age. Apparent central and peripheral volumes are proportional to body weight in individuals with a weight up to 75 kg, with no further increase at weights exceeding 75 kg, with no dependency on age.
- The AUC of bupivacaine with EXPAREL for a given procedure is equal to dose divided by clearance. Since clearance is not dependent on age (&lt;55 years) or weight, the AUC would be proportional to the total dose administered.
- The early Cmax of bupivacaine with EXPAREL is reciprocal to the volume of distribution, which is proportional to body weight up to 75 kg and is almost independent of clearance. Thus, regardless of age, early Cmax values would be similar for individuals of different weights if they were dosed on a mg/kg basis. At a fixed dose, individuals of different body weights would be expected to have early Cmax values approximately proportional to their respective difference in weight regardless of age (with individuals of lower weight having proportionally higher early Cmax values).
- The late Cmax of bupivacaine with EXPAREL depends on both clearance (like AUC) and volume (like early Cmax). Since both factors play a role, the effect of weight and dose on late Cmax would be expected to be of a magnitude between that for AUC and early Cmax.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, if the same dose (e.g., 266 mg) was administered to adult and paediatric patients, the AUC values would be expected to be equivalent, but the early and late Cmax values would be higher in paediatric patients than adults due to their difference in weight. To preserve safety in paediatric patients, it is appropriate to dose EXPAREL in a weight-based manner such that the maximum bupivacaine concentrations do not exceed those of adults.

In the clinical studies, while the same prolonged-release profile would be expected in all age groups, AUC values would be expected to trend lower with age since paediatric subjects received lower absolute doses than adults. Early and late Cmax values for paediatric subjects would also be expected to trend lower than adults because of the lower absolute dose administered on the basis of weight (to ensure that Cmax values in paediatric subjects did not exceed those of adults).

To address the differences in dosing paradigms, the final Pop PK model of field block in adults (Model 132) was utilized to evaluate whether the magnitudes of the observed differences in PK parameters between adult and paediatric subjects in the clinical studies were consistent with the differences that would be expected among adults of the same age and weight who were administered different absolute doses of EXPAREL. The reference adult weight used for the simulations was 75 kg and the reference dosing values evaluated in these simulations were:

- 266 mg
- 194 mg (corresponding to the median weight of 12-&lt;17-year-olds: 48.5 kg * 4 mg/kg)
- 132 mg (corresponding to the median weight of 6-&lt;12-year-olds: 33 kg * 4 mg/kg)

The estimated fraction of EXPAREL dose absorbed through the fast route was 21% for spinal procedures and 7.4% for cardiac procedures. Spinal and cardiac procedures were not evaluated in the adult studies that were included in the final model for field block in adults. Therefore, the population PK model for haemorrhoidectomy derived from the composite population pharmacokinetics data was selected to emulate PK in spinal procedures and the population PK model for inguinal hernia repair was selected to emulate PK cardiac procedures because of their similar fractions of EXPAREL dose absorbed through the fast route (25% and 11%, respectively).

## Pop PK Evaluation Corresponding to Spinal Procedures

Holding weight (75 kg), sex (male), and age (&lt;55 years) constant, the estimated PK parameters for the adult dosing groups undergoing haemorrhoidectomy procedures were proportional to dose (Table 17 and Figure 11). The AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax values in adults who received 194 mg and 132 mg were 27% and 50% lower than adults who received 266 mg, respectively, for all statistics (i.e., geometric mean, median, and mean). Thus, if the release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL was comparable in paediatric and adult individuals, an adolescent (weighing 48.5 kg) or a child (weighing 33 kg) who received EXPAREL at 4 mg/kg would be expected to have AUC parameters that were approximately 27% or 50% lower than an adult (weighing 75 kg) dosed at 266 mg, respectively. The Cmax parameters would also be expected to be lower in children and adolescents, but not to the same degree as with AUC for the reasons outlined earlier.

The magnitudes of the differences in PK parameters between adults dosed at 266 mg and paediatric subjects dosed at 4 mg/kg in the clinical studies were similar to the predicted differences in adults at the corresponding dose levels. In the clinical studies, AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax for adolescents dosed at 4 mg/kg were 37-39% lower, 22-35% lower, 30-36% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, depending on the statistic (Table 18). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, the AUC, early Cmax, late Cmax

values were 55-58% lower, 31-35% lower, 43-56% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg. (It is important to note that the exposure values in paediatric and adult subjects were derived from actual data in the clinical trials where age and weight varied across subjects in each group; thus, some variability across statistics would be expected unlike the adult simulations described above where age, weight, and sex were held constant.)

In addition, the plasma concentration-time curves among adults dosed at 266 mg and paediatric subjects dosed at 4 mg/kg undergoing spinal procedures (Figure 12) were consistent with the predicted PK for adults undergoing haemorrhoidectomy (i.e., a surgical procedure with a similar fraction of bupivacaine absorption from EXPAREL through the fast route) at corresponding dose levels (Figure 11).

Population concentration time profiles for males and age &lt; 55 years old (for adults). The reference value of dosing solution concentration was used for simulation. Median weights of 6 -&lt;12years old(33kg) and12 -&lt; 17 years old (48.5 kg) in Study 319, and of adult subjects in Study 117 (77.6 kg) were used for simulations.

## Pop PK Evaluation Corresponding to Cardiac Procedures

Holding weight, sex, and age constant, the estimated PK parameters for the adult dosing groups undergoing inguinal hernia procedures were proportional to dose (Table 19 and Figure 13). The exposure values (AUC, early Cmax, and late Cmax) of the adult dosing groups that were selected to represent the dose received by adolescents at the median weight (194 mg) and children at the median weight (132 mg) in the clinical studies were 27% and 50% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively. As described earlier, in the clinical studies, AUC values would be expected to be approximately 27% and 50% lower in adolescents and children than adults, respectively. Cmax parameters would also generally be expected to be lower, but not to the same degree as for AUC.

Population concentration time profiles for adult males &lt; 55 years old. The reference value of dosing solution concentration and weight of 75 kg were used for simulations.

Apart from early Cmax, the magnitudes of the differences in PK parameters between adults dosed at 266 mg and paediatric subjects dosed at 4 mg/kg in the clinical studies were similar to the predicted differences in adults at the corresponding dose levels. In the clinical studies, the early Cmax values were similar in all age groups due to the very high fast absorption rate (ka,fast), however weightbased dosing preserved the intended goal of Cmax values in paediatric subjects not exceeding those of adults. AUC and late Cmax values for adolescents dosed at 4 mg/kg were 36-39% lower and 33-40% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively, depending on the statistic (Table 20). For children dosed at 4 mg/kg, AUC and late Cmax values were 55-58% lower and 47-53% lower than adults dosed at 266 mg, respectively.

a Predicted using covariates and random effects of adults that received EXPAREL for spinal procedures in Study 117. Predicted using covariates and random effects of adolescents (12 to &lt; 17 years) that received EXPAREL for spinal

procedures in Study 319.

The overall PK profiles of bupivacaine with EXPAREL for cardiothoracic procedures in adults dosed at 266 mg and adolescents and children dosed at 4 mg/kg (Figure 14) aligned closely with the overall PK profiles in adults for inguinal hernia repair (i.e., a surgical procedure with a similar fraction of bupivacaine absorption from EXPAREL through the fast route) at corresponding dose levels (Figure 13).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 14: Predicted Population Concentration Profiles Following EXPAREL Administration by Age Group among Subjects Undergoing Cardiothoracic Surgery, Final Model 520

<!-- image -->

Population concentration time profiles for males and age &lt; 55 years old (for adults). The reference value of dosing solution concentration was used for simulation. Median weights of 6 - &lt;12 years old (33 kg) and 12 -&lt; 17 years old (48.5kg)inStudy 319,and of adult subjects inStudy117(77.6kg)were used for simulations.

Pop PK modelling has shown that the differences in observed bupivacaine exposure between adolescents and children relative to adults in the clinical studies are consistent with the magnitudes of the differences that would occur between adults receiving EXPAREL at corresponding absolute dose levels.

## Absorption, Distribution, Elimination

No additional absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies have been conducted for the paediatric local infiltration indication.

## Absorption

It is known that the rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose of medicine administered, the route of administration, and the vascularity of the administration site.

## Disposition

The bupivacaine  metabolic  pathway  is  similar  in  adults  and  children.  The  factors  that  influence  the pharmacology of amide-type local anesthetics are substantially mature in paediatric patients by 2 years of age (Berde et al, 2002, Brislin et al, 2005):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Bupivacaine  metabolism  is  similar  in  adults  and  children  because  hepatic  cytochrome  P-450 levels increase to adult levels in the first few months of life.
- Bupivacaine clearance is similar in adults and children because renal function in infants reaches adult levels by 12 months.
- Levels  of  plasma  albumin  and  alpha-1  acid  glycoprotein  increase  during  infancy;  by  early childhood, levels of unbound bupivacaine in plasma are similar to those observed in adults.

No significant differences are expected in bupivacaine disposition between adults and paediatric patients (6-17 years) based on the published literature.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacology of bupivacaine has been extensively characterised in the scientific literature and it has been an approved local anaesthetic for several decades.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

No PK/PD modelling was conducted.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

To  support  this  Type  II  variation,  the  MAH  has  performed  and  submitted  two  studies  in  paediatric subjects: Study 120 (to support the chosen paediatric dose) and Study 319 (PK and safety study used as the basis for efficacy extrapolation).

Both studies characterized PK and safety profile of Exparel, while efficacy measurements were only exploratory.

Efficacy is extrapolated from adults to paediatric patients 6 years and older based on the similarity of the exposures achieved in matching surgical procedures. Moreover, pathophysiology of postsurgical pain is considered comparable, and mechanism of action, metabolic pathway and response to intervention with bupivacaine is considered similar between the paediatric subjects of this age range and adults.

## PK methods

The sample size of subjects for Study 120 and 319 was chosen to enable characterization of the PK profile in paediatric population.

Both non-compartmental analysis and population PK model were used to analyse PK data in paediatric subjects. The methods are considered appropriate.

With regards to assessment of similarity of the exposure between paediatric and adult population in matching surgical procedures, the comparison was descriptive, without pre-defined criteria to establish similarity in exposures. This was considered a limitation. The MAH further clarified that no therapeutic range exists for systemic bupivacaine and therefore formal demonstration of statistical similarity in PK parameters would not be feasible. The MAH therefore focused focuses on demonstrating the similar PK profile suggesting prolonged release of bupivacaine in paediatric subjects.

## ADME

No additional ADME studies have been conducted which is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the published literature, no significant differences are expected in bupivacaine disposition between adults and paediatric patients (6-17 years) since bupivacaine protein binding, metabolism and renal clearance are similar.

Due to the prolonged release system, the absorption of bupivacaine from Exparel liposomal is expected to depend primarily on the release from the liposomes. The slow release of bupivacaine is likely due to reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended period of time. Even though lipid metabolism is not thought to be the primary mechanism of bupivacaine prolonged release, based on literature, there are no apparent differences between adult and paediatric populations (6 years and older) with respect to the metabolism of lipid components of the multivesicular liposomes that could lead to differential absorption.

## Study 120

Study 120 was a Phase 1, open-label, single arm study that evaluated PK and safety of Exparel 4 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum dose of 266 mg) in paediatric subjects (12 to &lt; 17 years) undergoing spinal surgery. No formal dose-response study was performed. The 4 mg/kg dose was selected based on an earlier experience in paediatric patients and was the only dose evaluated.

During initial assessment, a major objection was raised to address the issue regarding applicability of the same dose to all types of paediatric surgeries under the extrapolation concept. With the responses, the MAH clarified that the  dose of 4 mg/kg was the maximum dose studied. The actual administered dose in the clinical practice depends on the clinician's judgement of the size of the surgical wound, the volume required to cover the area and individual patient factors. This is considered acceptable.

The objective of Study 120 was to investigate whether the exposures achieved using Exparel 4 mg/kg (up to 266 mg) were similar to the exposures achieved in adult patients receiving 266 mg Exparel and undergoing spinal surgery.

Due to sparse sampling in study 120, PK parameters were estimated using a population PK model. The previously developed population PK model of bupivacaine following administration of Exparel as wound infiltration to adults was updated and refined using the data from spinal surgeries in adolescents (Study 120) and adult patients (Study 117).

Groups 1-3 provided only 5 PK samples and could not identify double peaks. When sufficient PK samples were obtained (Group 4, 8 PK samples), a characteristic double-peak Exparel plasma profile could be observed. The highest observed bupivacaine plasma concentration in this study was 559 ng/mL at 0.3 hours, which is below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects. The lowest bupivacaine plasma levels were reached by approximately 48 hours which could have implications on the duration of the effect.

Based on the Pop PK model predictions, the MAH concludes that the PK of bupivacaine in adult and paediatric  subjects  undergoing  spinal  procedures  was  generally  similar.  While  early  and  late  Cmax appeared to be comparable between paediatric and adult subjects, AUC and t1/2 were considerably lower in  paediatric  population.  Observed  bupivacaine  plasma  concentrations  reached  the  lowest  levels  by approximately 42 to 60 hours and it was evident from the simulations that bupivacaine concentrations dropped faster for adolescents compared to adults. During the initial assessment, a concern was raised whether lower AUC, shorter t1/2 and reaching lowest concentrations earlier in paediatric population could affect efficacy and duration of effect in this population.

The MAH has provided additional discussion that systemic concentrations are not directly correlated to a magnitude of analgesic effect. Bupivacaine PK profile following Exparel administration in paediatric

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients shows characteristics of the prolonged bupivacaine release at the site of action, similar as in adult patients.

It  was  noted  that  two  paediatric  subjects  in  Study  120  received  a  single  total  dose  that  exceeded maximum recommended dose of 266 mg in adults. The peak concentrations for these subjects were however comparable to other study subjects.

Section 4.2 of the SmPC provides dosing guidance that maximum mg/kg dose should not exceed 266 mg.

## Study 319

Study 319 was a Phase 3, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the PK and safety of EXPAREL when administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine surgery (Group 1) and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing spine surgery or cardiac surgery (Group 2).

A total of 8 PK samples was collected per subject and PK parameters were calculated using the noncompartmental analysis. Additionally, population PK model was further updated and refined using the data from Study 319.

The chosen surgical models (spine and cardiac surgery) do not completely correspond to adult Exparel indication for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. However, both surgical sites are highly vascular and can be regarded as procedures of highest risk for systemic toxicity. It was therefore considered acceptable to extrapolate safety results to the less invasive procedures included in the indication.

## Spine surgery

PK comparison of Exparel 4 mg/kg vs bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg in Group 1 (spine surgery in adolescents 12-17  years  old)  showed  that  Exparel  exhibits  similar  PK  properties  as  already  observed  in  adult subjects; slower absorption and more sustained bupivacaine concentrations, in line with the extended release of bupivacaine from the multivesicular liposomes. The observed Cmax was lower and Tmax later in the Exparel group, with two maximums present in most subjects.

While it can be concluded that PK profiles following Exparel administration in both studies 319 and 117 clearly differ from the PK profile of bupivacaine HCl administered in study 319, it is more difficult to establish the similarity of Exparel PK profiles between adult and paediatric patients without adequate statistical comparison.

Additional population PK analyses suggest that incision size is not significantly associated with higher bupivacaine  exposure.  The  difference  in  AUC  values  observed  between  age  groups  is  due  to  the difference in absolute dose administered in adults and paediatric subjects.

To  compare  PK  parameters  between  adults  and  adolescents  (12  to  &lt;17  years)  undergoing  spinal procedures, EXPAREL exposures (early Cmax, late Cmax, and AUC from zero to infinity [AUC0inf]) were predicted  using  the  final  population  PK  model  (Model  520)  with  spinal-surgery-specific  parameters derived from adult and adolescent data (Population PK Report V5). Exposures were predicted for adults from Study 117 (N=13) and for adolescents (12 to &lt; 17 years) from Study 319 (N=16). The expected exposures for children (6 to &lt; 12 years) following spinal procedures were estimated using individual doses, covariates, and random effects of children who received EXPAREL for cardiac procedures in Study 319 (N=20).

## Cardiac surgery

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All PK parameters for cardiothoracic surgery were estimated using the population PK model due to the sparse PK sampling schemes. To compare PK parameters between adults, adolescents, and children undergoing cardiothoracic procedures, EXPAREL exposures (early Cmax, late Cmax, and AUC0-inf) were predicted  using  the  final  population  PK  model  (Model  520)  with  cardiothoracic-surgery-specific parameters derived from Study 319 data in children (6 to &lt;12 years, N=20). Expected exposures for adults  and  adolescents  (12  to  &lt;17  years)  following  cardiothoracic  procedures  were  estimated  using individual  doses,  covariates,  and  random  effects  of  the  subjects  that  received  EXPAREL  for  spinal procedures in Study 117 for adults (N=13) and in Study 319 for adolescents (N=20). Exposures for these subjects following cardiothoracic procedures were predicted using the final population PK model (Population  PK  Report  V5).  Paediatric  subjects  undergoing  cardiac  surgery  had  higher  bupivacaine exposures based on Cmax and AUC compared to subjects undergoing spine surgery. The highest Cmax in paediatric subjects was observed in cardiac surgery: 1290 ng/mL at 0.5 hours, which is below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult subjects.

The comparison of paediatric PK profiles from Study 319 to adult PK profiles from Study 118 (assessed in the initial MAA) is made, although the route of administration was not uniform across the two studies.

## Extrapolation concept

Publications from Dunne et al. (2011) and Berde et al. (2012) suggest that it would be scientifically reasonable to extrapolate efficacy from adults to paediatric population for local anesthetics with wellknown mechanism of action, such as bupivacaine. In that case, paediatric studies should focus on PK, dose response and safety. In this procedure, PK and safety aspects are addressed, while dose response was not formally evaluated. The dose of 4 mg/kg was selected based on prior experience in the realworld evidence study 'Retrospective Analysis of Pediatric Utilization of Liposomal Bupivacaine: Cleveland Clinic Experience,' and evaluated in Study 120.

Extrapolation of efficacy from adults to paediatric patients is based on similar systemic exposure that is expected to lead to similar exposures at the site of action and thus similar efficacy.

The following arguments have been put forward by the MAH to justify the general assumption that extrapolation is possible based on comparable exposure levels achieved following the use of Exparel in matching surgical procedures:

-Discussion  was  provided  to  confirm  similar  pathophysiology  of  postsurgical  pain  between paediatric (6 years and older) and adult patients based on data from literature

-Discussion was provided on similar mechanism of action, metabolic pathway and response to intervention based on data from literature

-Demonstrated efficacy of Exparel as a field block for the treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small-to-medium sized surgical wounds in adults was referenced to

-Discussion on similar PK profiles of bupivacaine following field block with Exparel in paediatric and adult subjects in matched surgical models was provided suggesting similar local release rate of bupivacaine from Exparel

With regards to the pathophysiology of postsurgical pain, it is agreed that pain transmission is mature in paediatric subjects of the proposed age range (6 years and older) and can thus be considered similar to that in adults. Moreover, metabolic pathways involved in bupivacaine clearance are also substantially mature in paediatric subjects by 2 years of age. There are no apparent differences between adult and paediatric populations (6 years and older) with respect to the metabolism of lipid components of the multivesicular  liposomes,  so  it  is  not  expected  that  there  could  be  clinically  significant  differences between adult and paediatric population in respect of absorption. This allows to justify the extrapolation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concept from studies in adults to children based on a similar systemic exposure, which is in principle considered appropriate.

While it is well-known that systemic bupivacaine concentrations do not correlate with analgesic effect, they could be considered indicative of the release profile of the local anaesthetic at the site of action. When used as a short-acting agent, bupivacaine is rapidly absorbed, distributed, and cleared from the site of action with an expected duration of effect of 3-8 hours as a field block. Exparel, on the contrary, provides prolonged effect with its prolonged release from liposomes, and the efficacy has been confirmed in studies with adults. With the current application, the applicant has provided PK data in paediatric patients which show similar PK prolonged-release pattern.

Since observed PK data are based on relatively sparse sampling scheme, PK exposure parameters for comparison between adult and paediatric patients are obtained using population PK modelling. Using population  PK  model  for  spinal  procedures,  comparison  of  Exparel  liposomal  PK  between  adult  and paediatric patients shows that adolescent patients (12 to &lt;17 years old) had approximately 30% lower early Cmax, late Cmax and AUC, while children (6 to &lt;12 years old) had approximately 50% lower early Cmax, late Cmax and AUC compared to adults who underwent matching procedure and received 266 mg dose of Exparel liposomal. Similar pattern was observed for cardiac procedures, except for early Cmax that was similar in all age groups. Due to lower systemic exposures observed in paediatric patients compared to adults, overall similarity of systemic exposures and the impact on efficacy extrapolation was questioned.

As Cmax and AUC are not indicative of therapeutic effect at the site of action, it is generally acknowledged that  no  therapeutic  range  exists  for  systemic  bupivacaine  and  therefore  formal  demonstration  of statistical similarity in PK parameters would not be relevant. Moreover, when compared to bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg dosed in adolescents who underwent spine procedures, lower Cmax and increased AUC were observed which is in line with the characteristic PK profile of a slow-release bupivacaine.

Additional  simulations  performed  have  shown  that  the  magnitude  of  differences  in  PK  parameters observed between adult and paediatric subjects was comparable to the differences expected in adults due to different  absolute dose  administered  given that  adults  received  a  fixed  dose of  266  mg  and paediatric subjects received 4 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum of 266 mg). Body weight was not found to  be  a  significant  covariate  on  clearance.  Therefore,  AUC  values  would  be  expected  to  be  lower  in paediatric subjects receiving lower absolute doses than adults. Early and late Cmax values would also be expected to trend lower, which is acceptable from the safety perspective. Given that 266 mg is the maximum recommended dose in adults, and the actual dose administered to adult patient can be lower, the magnitude of decreased exposures observed in paediatric subjects can be considered reasonably similar to adult exposure and is not expected to have an impact on efficacy.

The observed systemic exposure in children 6 years and older with similar PK characteristics as in adult population seems to be sufficiently convincing evidence to conclude on the similar pattern of bupivacaine release from liposomal particles at the site of action and, thus, local anaesthetic efficacy.

Based on the data provided, the efficacy of Exparel as a field block for treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults can be extrapolated to paediatric patients 6 years and older.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The application is considered approvable from the clinical pharmacology point of view.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

Clinical efficacy was evaluated in two studies: extrapolated from pharmacokinetics data obtained in two studies:

- Study 402-C-120 (Study 120): a phase 1, open-label, pharmacokinetic and safety study used to support the dosing of 4 mg/kg in Study 402-C-319 and to provide supportive pharmacokinetic and safety data on EXPAREL for the proposed indication. All paediatric patients treated in this study underwent a spinal surgery.
- Study  402-C-319  (Study  319):  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study supporting the use of EXPAREL for local infiltration. Paediatric subjects in this study underwent either a spinal or cardiac surgery.

Both  studies  included  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints,  however,  they  were  not  powered  to  evaluate efficacy and only descriptive data on efficacy were available.

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

No dose-response studies were performed for 6-17 years old paediatric subjects. Exparel dosing was based on body weight, consistent with general standards for dosing of local anesthetics in paediatric practice. A paediatric dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 266 mg was selected based on  real-world  evidence  from  paediatric  procedures  performed  at  The  Cleveland  Clinic,  simulated pharmacokinetic data, and data from Study 402-C-120.

## 2.4.2. Main studies

## Treatments

Subjects in Group 1 were randomly assigned to treatment with EXPAREL 4 mg/kg or bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg. In group 2 all subjects received EXPAREL.

EXPAREL was formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, homogeneous suspension of bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicular lipid-based particles.

Bupivacaine in EXPAREL was at a nominal concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. EXPAREL was provided in 20 mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.

EXPAREL could have been expanded with normal (0.9%) saline to increase the volume up to a final concentration  of  0.89  mg/mL  (i.e.,  1:14  dilution  by  volume).  The  total  volume  of  expansion  was dependent on the incision length.

Dosing of EXPAREL was based on body weight, at a dose of 4 mg/kg, not to exceed a maximum total dose of 266 mg. The study drug was administered prior to wound closure. Each infiltration site was spaced 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart and approximately 1 to 1.5 mL was delivered into both deep and superficial areas.

The investigators were instructed to document the total volume of expansion used; and calculate the total volume for each surgery depending on the incision length.

In Group 1 subjects in the control arm received Bupivacaine HCl. Dosing of Bupivacaine HCl was based on body weight, at a dose of 2 mg/kg, not to exceed a maximum dose of 175 mg.

Patients could receive postsurgical opioid medication as a rescue medication.

## Objectives

Primary objective: evaluate the PK of EXPAREL in paediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;17 years undergoing spine or cardiac surgeries.

Secondary  Objectives: evaluate  the  safety  of  EXPAREL  in  paediatric  subjects  aged  6  to  &lt;17  years undergoing spine or cardiac surgeries.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Pharmacokinetic endpoints:

- Area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC)
- Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
- The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2el)
- Apparent clearance (CL/F)
- Apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F)

## Safety endpoints:

Safety assessments consisted of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, neurological assessments, laboratory tests, and AEs. The safety endpoints were assessed at the specified timepoints:

- Change from baseline in vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure).
- -Assessment  of  vital  signs  (resting  heart  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) was performed at screening; upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30.
- Summary  of neurological assessments (subjects who were oriented, disoriented, not assessable), numbness (of lips, tongue, or around mouth), metallic taste, hearing problems, vision problems, and muscle twitching. The number and percentage of subjects were tabulated for each neurologic assessment for each age group and overall.
- -Neurological assessment was made at screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30.
- Change from baseline in clinical laboratory data.
- -Clinical  laboratory  tests  (hematology,  chemistry,  and  urinalysis)  were  collected  at screening; at baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); and at 96 hours after the end of study drug administration.
- ECG tracings, classified as 'normal, 'abnormal not clinically significant' or 'abnormal clinically significant'.' ECGs were assessed at screening or on Day 1 prior to surgery and could also have been conducted if a subject experienced an AESI (i.e., cardiac AE or neurological AE), or an SAE.
- Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs until Day 30.

## Other (efficacy) Endpoints:

- Pain intensity scores.
- -Pain intensity was assessed at screening; at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; immediately prior to each administration of postoperative  opioid  pain  management  medication  until  96  hours;  and  at  hospital discharge.

Pain intensity scores were collected using the following instruments:

- -11-point NRS-R for subjects aged 12 to &lt;17 years
- -Color Analog Scale CAS for subjects aged 6 to &lt;12 years
- The AUC of pain intensity scores for the specified time intervals.
- Total opioid consumption in oral morphine equivalents.
- Time to first postsurgical use of opioid medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of EXPAREL in paediatric subjects following administration via wound infiltration. The studies were not powered for hypothesis testing.

## Randomisation

Subjects in Group 1 were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single dose of EXPAREL or bupivacaine HCl. Subjects in Group 2 received a single dose of EXPAREL. The randomization code was generated by a centralized randomization system, which was also used to communicate subject randomizations to study sites. All randomized subjects had both a unique subject identifier and a unique random code identifier. No subject or random code identifiers were reused once assigned.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open label study and blinding was not performed.

## Statistical methods

Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics [sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum]. Categorical variables were tabulated with number and percentage of subjects. Unless otherwise noted, percentages were based on the number of subjects in the treatment group or group within the analysis population and summaries presented data that were pooled from all sites.

## Efficacy analysis

Summary statistics are presented for pain intensity scores at each assessment timepoint. Area under the pain-time curve (AUC) is derived using the linear trapezoidal rule on the pain scores. AUC starts with the first pain assessment obtained after surgery and use all following pain assessments including those collected prior to administration of opioid medication and unscheduled assessments. Summary statistics are presented for the following pain intensity AUCs: AUCAdjusted(4-24), AUCAdjusted (4-48), AUCAdjusted (4-72), AUCAdjusted(4-96) and AUCAdjusted(4-Hospital Discharge).

Opioid consumption is converted to oral morphine equivalent dose (MED mg) using the appropriate conversion factor. Total postsurgical opioid dose is calculated through 24, 48, and 72 hours. In addition to the descriptive statistics for continuous data, geometric mean (GM) and coefficient of variation (CV) is included and mean and SD is excluded.

Time to first postsurgical use of opioid rescue medication is computed in hours as the date and time of the first opioid rescue medication minus the date and time of the end of surgery. If a subject is not administered an opioid rescue medication, the time to first administration is censored at 72 hours after surgery  or  at  the  time  of  last  follow-up,  whichever  is  earliest.  Time  to  first  opioid  consumption  is summarized by the quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th), minimum and maximum estimated using KaplanMeier methods within age group and part of the study. The quartile and the 95% confidence limits (CONFTYPE=LOGLOG) for each quartile is presented. A Kaplan-Meier plot of the time from end of surgery to first opioid rescue medication use will be presented within age group and part of the study, and a logrank test p-value of treatment difference shown for group 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data

Missing information that could not be obtained through query resolution was imputed on a case-by-case basis, in a conservative manner to minimized bias.

Opioid rescue pain medication usage is a projected amount, if a subject discontinues the study early. If a subject is discharged at x&lt;36 hours after end of surgery, the total postsurgical opioid consumption through 72 hours is calculated as 72*(D0,x/x), where D0,x is the opioid consumption during the initial x hours postsurgery. If a subject is discharged at 36≤x&lt;72hours, the total po stsurgical opioid consumption through 72 hours is calculated as D0,x+D2x-72,x0 where D2x-72,x0 is the opioid consumption from 2x-72 hours (exclusive) through x hours (inclusive). For example, if a subject is discharged at x=70 hours, the postsurgical 0 to 72 hours opioid consumption will be calculated as the consumption during the first 70 hours plus the consumption between 70 and 72 hours, which is imputed by the consumption between 68 and 70 hours.

Missing pain intensity scores were not imputed or replaced in efficacy analysis due to the descriptive nature analyses without formal hypothesis testing.

## Results

## Participant flow

In Group 1, 61 subjects were screened, and 61 subjects (31 EXPAREL, 30 bupivacaine) were randomized and received study drug.

For Group 2, 37 subjects were screened, and 37 subjects were randomized (6 in the spine surgery group, 30 in the cardiac surgery group, and 1 subject was discontinued after enrollment because study drug was not available at the site. A total of 34 subjects received study treatment (5 in the spine surgery group and 29 in the cardiac surgery group).

## Recruitment

The  study  was  conducted  at  15  sites  in  the  United  States.  No  treatment-by-center  analyses  were performed. The study period was from 2 April 2019 (first participant was screened) up to 24 September 2019 (last participant was observed).

The date of the original CSR was 13 May 2020, and date of amended report was 22 July 2021.

## Conduct of the study

Six specific changes were made to the clinical study report for Study 402-C-319. However, there was no information in study protocol on protocol amendments.

## Baseline data

Demographic characteristics and baseline characteristics for the PK population are overall similar to those for the Safety population. Summary of subject demographics for Safety population is available below.

## Group 1

According to subject demographic characteristics for the Safety population of Group 1 EXPAREL arm and bupivacaine arm was similar. The overall subject population was predominantly White (77.0%), nonHispanic (68.9%), and female (82.0%). The mean age was 13.8 years (± 1.32 years). In EXPAREL group was more female subjects than bupivacaine group (90.3% vs 73.3%), and in bupivacaine group were more white subjects than in EXPAREL group (86.7 vs 67.7%) (Table 23). Subject demographics in PK Population was similar with subject demographics of Safety population.

## Group 2

Overall  subject  demographic  characteristics  for  the  Safety  population  of  Group  2  EXPAREL  arm  and bupivacaine  arm  was  similar.  For  Group  2,  the  overall  subject  population  was  predominantly  white (88.2%),  non-Hispanic  (73.5%),  and  almost  evenly  divided  between  males  (52.9%)  and  females (47.1%). The overall mean age was 8.9 years (±1.80 years); the mean age was slightly higher in the spine surgery group (10.0 years) than in the cardiac surgery group (8.7 years), but the sample size in spine group was very small (N=5) (Table 25). Subject demographics in PK Population was similar with subject demographics of Safety population.

In Group 2 (Safety population), Spine surgery and Cardiac surgery arms slightly differed in numbers of Normal  ECG,  baseline  NRS  pain  intensity  and  ASA  classification,  but  it  should  be  considered  as preliminary due to the limited sample size (N=5) (Table 26).

## Prior, Intraoperative, and Concomitant Medications

Prior  medications  were  defined  as  medications  with  a  stop  date/time  prior  to  start  of  study  drug administration. Intraoperative medications were defined as medications given as part of the surgical procedure. Concomitant medications were those taken after the start of study drug administration (i.e., started prior to the start of study drug administration and continued after or started after the start of study drug administration) and were not designated as intraoperative medications.

## Prior Medications

## Group 1

In Group 1, at least 1 prior medication was used by 30 EXPAREL subjects (96.8%) and 28 bupivacaine subjects (93.3%). The most commonly taken prior medications (≥50% of subjects overall) in Group 1 were  dexamethasone  (70.5%),  midazolam  (67.2%),  propofol  (65.6%),  fentanyl  (62.3%).  The percentages  of  subjects  who  had  used  fentanyl  and  midazolam  were  higher  in  the  EXPAREL  group compared  with  the  bupivacaine  HCl  group;  for  fentanyl,  77.4%  and  46.7%,  respectively,  and  for midazolam, 77.4% and 56.7%, respectively.

## Group 2

In Group 2, at least 1 prior medication was used by 3 subjects (60.0%) who underwent spine surgery and 29 subjects (100%) who underwent cardiac surgery. The most commonly taken prior medications (≥50% of subjects overall) in Group 2 were cefazolin ( 79.4%), fentanyl (79.4%), midazolam (76.5%), rocuronium (67.6%), and protamine (61.8%). The percentages of subjects using prior medications were generally higher in the cardiac surgery group.

## Intraoperative Medications

## Group 1

All subjects who underwent surgery in Group 1 received at least 1 intraoperative medication. The most commonly used intraoperative medications (≥50% of subjects overall) were propofol (95.1%), fentanyl (90.2%),  ondansetron  (90.2%),  tranexamic  acid  (88.5%),  dexamethasone  (83.6%),  paracetamol (72.1%),  remifentanil  (70.5%),  cefazolin  (70.5%),  rocuronium  (57.4%),  lidocaine  (55.7%),  and midazolam (52.5%).

## Group 2

All subjects who underwent surgery in Group 2 received at least 1 intraoperative medication. The most commonly used intraoperativ e medications (≥50% of subjects overall) were cefazolin (97.1%), fentanyl (94.1%),  rocuronium  (76.5%),  dexmedetomidine  (76.5%),  protamine  (61.8%),  tranexamic  acid (55.9%), sugammadex (52.9%), propofol (50.0%), and dexamethasone (50.0%).

## Concomitant Medications

## Group 1

All subjects (100%) in Group 1 received at least 1 concomitant medication. Overall, paracetamol and oxycodone (98.4% of subjects) and natural opium alkaloids (98.4%) were the most commonly used concomitant medications in both study arms. Other concomitant medication ATCs used by &gt;50% of subjects  overall  included  other  analgesics  and  antipyretics,  osmotically  acting  laxatives,  acetic  acid derivatives and related substances, softeners (emollients), serotonin (5HT3) antagonists, other centrally acting agents, and first-generation cephalosporins.

## Group 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All subjects (100%) in Group 2 received at least 1 concomitant medication. Overall, anilides (94.1%) and natural opium alkaloids (94.1%) were the most commonly used concomitant medications in both study arms. Other concomitant medication ATCs used by &gt;50% of subjects overall included acetic acid derivatives and related substances, first-generation cephalosporins, solutions affecting the electrolyte balance, and H2-receptor antagonists.

## Efficacy Results

## Pain Intensity Scores

The mean NRS pain scores in group 1 were generally low in both study arms and were similar between the EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups up through 96 hours. Mean pain scores were highest (≥4) in the EXPAREL group at 8 hours (4.1), 72 hours (4.5), and 96 hours (4.2). In the bupivacaine subjects, mean pain scores were highest (≥4) at 36 hours (4.0), 60 hours (4.2), and 96 hours (4 .3).

Pain intensity scores for Group 1 (12 to &lt;17 years) using the NRS are displayed in Figure 17 and Table 27.

## AUC of Pain Intensity

The mean AUC for NRS pain intensity scores were lower in the EXPAREL group compared with the bupivacaine HCl group for the 4 to 24 hour, 4 to 48 hour, and 4 to 72 hours, but the mean scores was slightly higher in 4 to 96 hour and 4-Hospital discharge, where the minimum and maximum scores varied a lot (in EXPAREL group AUC 4-96 minimum and maximum scores was 91-568, and median value was 323.5. In Bupivacaine group and AUC 4-96 minimum and maximum scores was 36-650, and median value was 297.2.  In EXPAREL group AUC 4-hospital discharge minimum and maximum scores was 15426 in EXPAREL group, and median value was 367.1. In Bupivacaine group AUC 4-hospital discharge minimum and maximum scores was 36-650 and median value was 233.1. Subjects also received the study site's standard of care for pain control.

## Study 120

## Methods

Study 120 was a phase 1, open-label study with one treatment group designed to evaluate the PK and safety of EXPAREL when administered via local wound infiltration in paediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria:

- Subjects whose parents or guardians had signed and dated the ICF for the subject to participate in  the  study,  and  subjects  who  had  provided  written  assent  to  participate  in  the  study  (if capable).
- ASA Class 1-3.

Male or female subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age on the day of surgery.

Body mass index at screening within the 20th to 80th percentile for age and sex.

- A negative pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential must have been available prior to the start of surgery. The pregnancy test must have been conducted in the preoperative holding area according to the study site's standard of care.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subjects and their parents/guardians were able to speak, read, and understand the language of the ICF and any instruments used for collecting subject-reported outcomes to enable accurate and appropriate responses to study assessments, and to provide informed consent/assent.
- Subjects must have been able to adhere to the study visit schedule and complete all study assessments.

## Exclusion criteria:

- Contraindication  to  bupivacaine  HCl  or  other  amide-type  local  anesthetics  or  to  opioid medication.
- Administration of EXPAREL or bupivacaine HCl within 30 days prior to study drug administration.
- Subjects with coagulopathies or immunodeficiency disorders.
- Administration  of  an  investigational  drug  within  30  days  or  5  elimination  half-lives  of  such investigational  drug,  whichever  was  longer,  prior  to  study  drug  administration,  or  planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject's participation in this study.

In addition, the subject was ineligible to receive study drug if he or she met the following criterion during surgery:

- Any  clinically  significant  event  or  condition  uncovered  during  the  surgery  (e.g.,  excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might have rendered the subject medically unstable or complicated the subject's postoperative course.

## Treatments

All  subjects  in  this  study  received  a  single  dose  of  EXPAREL  4  mg/kg/bodyweight,  not  to  exceed  a maximum total dose of 266 mg.

EXPAREL was formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, homogeneous suspension of bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicular lipid-based particles.

Bupivacaine in EXPAREL was at a nominal concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. EXPAREL was provided in 20 mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.

EXPAREL could have been administered undiluted or may have been expanded with normal (0.9%) saline to increase the volume up to a final concentration of 0.89 mg/mL (ie, 1:14 dilution by volume). The total volume of expansion was dependent on the incision length.

Patients could receive postsurgical opioid medication as a rescue medication.

## Objectives

Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of EXPAREL in paediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.

Secondary Objectives: The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of EXPAREL in paediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal surgery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Pharmacokinetic endpoints:

- Area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC)
- Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
- The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2el)
- Apparent clearance (CL/F)
- Apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F)
- Time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) - Early and Late

## Safety endpoints:

Safety assessments consisted of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, neurological assessments, laboratory tests, and AEs. The safety endpoints were assessed at the specified timepoints:

- Change from baseline in vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure).
- -Assessment  of  vital  signs  (resting  heart  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) was performed at screening; upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30.
- Summary  of neurological assessments (subjects who were oriented, disoriented, not assessable), numbness (of lips, tongue, or around mouth), metallic taste, hearing problems, vision problems, and muscle twitching. The number and percentage of subjects were tabulated for each neurologic assessment for each age group and overall.
- -Neurological assessment was made at screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30.
- Change from baseline in clinical laboratory data.
- -Clinical  laboratory  tests  (hematology,  chemistry,  and  urinalysis)  were  collected  at screening; at baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); and at 96 hours after the end of study drug administration.
- Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs until Day 30.

## Other (efficacy) Endpoints:

- Pain intensity scores.
- -Pain intensity was assessed at screening; at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; immediately prior to each administration of postoperative  opioid  pain  management  medication  until  96  hours;  and  at  hospital discharge.

Pain intensity scores were collected using the following instruments:

-11-point NRS-R for subjects aged 12 to &lt;17 years

-Color Analog Scale CAS for subjects aged 6 to &lt;12 years

- The AUC of pain intensity scores for the specified time intervals.
- Total opioid consumption in oral morphine equivalents.
- Time to first postsurgical use of opioid medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of EXPAREL in paediatric subjects following administration via wound infiltration. The studies were not powered for hypothesis testing.

## Statistical methods

This was a single-treatment group study, no comparative statistics were performed.

Continuous  variables  are  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics  [sample  size  (n),  mean,  standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum]. Categorical variables are tabulated with numbe r and percentage of subjects. Unless otherwise noted, percentages are based on the number of subjects in the population.

## Handling Missing Values

Any information that is missing and cannot be obtained through query resolution was imputed, on a case-by-case basis

## Total Postsurgical Opioid Consumption

If opioid is taken on the discharge day but time of dosing is missing, it was imputed as time of discharge or 12:00 pm on the discharge day, whichever is later. If opioid is taken after the day of discharge and time of dosing is missing, it was imputed as 12:00 pm the day after discharge.

## NRS Pain Intensity

Missing NRS was not imputed when calculating AUC or summarized over time.

## Analysis sets

Safety: The Safety population consisted of all subjects who underwent the planned surgery and received study treatment. All analyses based on the Safety population were by actual treatment received.

Pharmacokinetic: The PK population consisted of subjects who received study drug and provided at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration. All analyses were by actual treatment received.

## Results

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

MAH has presented comparison of efficacy results from Study 319 (Group 1) and Study 120, however, this comparison is not feasible as designs of concerned studies are not sufficiently similar. Thus, these results cannot be interpreted as pooled analysis.

## Pain Intensity Scores

Comparison of Efficacy Results from Study 319 and Study 120

Similar  NRS-R  pain  intensity  scores  were  observed  in  studies  120  and  319  group  1  following  spine surgery through 96 hours (Figure 22). Mean NRS-R pain remained between 3 and 5 throughout the study treatment periods.

## AUC of NRS-R Pain Intensity

AUC of NRS-R Pain intensity scores in Study 120 were higher than in Study 319 due to differences in calculation of AUC between the studies, where the start of the AUC time interval was 0 hours in Study 120 and 4 hours in Study 319 (Table 38).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nearly  all  subjects  in  both  studies  regardless  of  treatment  utilized  an  opioid  medication  in  the postoperative setting. The geometric mean total postoperative consumption of opioids following spine surgery was lower and the median time to first dose was later in Study 120 than Study 319. The Applicant explains the difference with differences in standard of care across clinical sites, where Study 120 was a single-center study conducted at The Cleveland Clinic whereas Study 319 was conducted at 15 sites in the US (Table 39).

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The MAH  has  submitted  two  studies in paediatric subjects (319 and 120) that investigate pharmacokinetics and safety of single dose administration in patients 6-17 years of age to support the extension of indication. The MAH has compared pharmacokinetic data for EXPAREL in paediatric patients 6 to &lt;18 years old from Study 319 with matched studies in adults (adult spine surgery from Study 402C-117 and adult cardiothoracic surgery in Study 402-C-118). Extrapolation of efficacy assumes that similar systemic exposure in adults and children would lead to similar exposure at effect site and thus similar efficacy.

The MAH included spine and cardiac surgery in surgical models because in these procedures highest systemic  levels  of  bupivacaine  and  corresponding  risk  for  toxicity  would  be  expected,  therefore representing a high-risk population. Inclusion of highly vascular procedures allow to extrapolate EXPAREL safety in less invasive procedures, where systemic absorption, possible side effects and toxicity also is expected to be lower.

Dedicated  phase  3  trial  to  evaluate  clinical  efficacy  in  the  setting  of  local  analgesia  in  paediatric population ≥6 years of age has not been conducted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The extrapolation of efficacy  of  Exparel  from  adults  to  paediatric  patients  is  based  on  the  following factors:

1. a similar pathophysiology of postsurgical pain in paediatric and adult patients
2. a  similar  mechanism  of  action,  metabolic  pathway,  and  response  to  intervention  with conventional bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients
3. demonstration  of  efficacy  in  two  Phase  3  randomized,  controlled  studies  (bunionectomy, haemorrhoidectomy) of Exparel in adults that supported its approval for single-dose infiltration to produce postsurgical local analgesia
4. confirmation  of  similar  bupivacaine  exposures  from  single-dose  infiltration  of  EXPAREL  in paediatric  and  adult  subjects  in  matched  surgical  models  and  anticipated  similar  effect  site exposure
5. the systemic absorption of bupivacaine from Exparel was similar among paediatric and adult subjects in matched surgical procedures. This observation in light of the similar metabolism of bupivacaine in paediatric and adult patients supports that the rate of local release of bupivacaine from Exparel is similar across age groups.

There were no dose-response studies performed for 6-17 years old paediatric subjects. Exparel dosing was based on body weight, consistent with general standards for dosing of local anesthetics in paediatric practice. A dose of 4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 266 mg was selected based on real-world evidence from paediatric procedures performed at The Cleveland Clinic, simulated pharmacokinetic data, and data from Study 402-C-120.

Study 319 was phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open label study to evaluate the PK and safety of Exparel when administered via infiltration in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine surgery (Group 1), and in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing spine or cardiac surgery (Group 2). The efficacy endpoints were measured as exploratory, thus the study was not powered to evaluate efficacy and only descriptive data are available.

AUC values of NRS-R pain intensity score in Study 319, Group 1 show that results for Exparel (4mg/kg) are  comparable  to  bupivacaine  (2mg/kg).  Postsurgical  opioid  consumption  data  are  inconclusive  in respect of clinically meaningfulness, where nearly all patients required opioids. It should be taken into account that patients received additional medications according to the study site's standard of care. Spinal and cardiac procedures also had different standard of care applied, where differences in prior, intraoperative, and concomitant medications between both groups in study 319 were observed.

Some descriptive comparison is available for age group ≥ 12 to 17 years of age that can be regarded as supportive efficacy data, while no comparative data is available for lower age group ≥ 6 to 12 years of age.

Study 120 was an open-label, phase 1 study, its primary and secondary aims were to evaluate PK and safety of Exparel in paediatric population 12 to less than 17 years of age in local anaesthesia setting. Efficacy endpoints were also exploratory. Study was too small, early phase trial with no comparison group that precludes any conclusions.

The  MAH  presented  comparison  of  efficacy  results  from  Study  319  (Group  1)  and  Study  120.  This comparison is not feasible as designs of concerned studies are not sufficiently similar to allow for such exercise.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Efficacy endpoints in presented studies suggest that EXPAREL provides pain relief in paediatric patients 6-17 years of age, but since these were extrapolatory endpoints, no conclusions can be made.

Efficacy can be inferred from comparative pharmacokinetics studies in adult and paediatric population which showed similar systemic exposure.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The purpose of the safety assessment for this procedure is to determine safety profile for the liposomal bupivacaine formulation in the paediatric population (6 years and older).  As agreed with PDCO during review  of  the  PIP  for  EXPAREL,  the  focus  of  the  EXPAREL  paediatric  development  was  to  obtain pharmacokinetic data in children in order to be able to extrapolate the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL in adults to children when undergoing similar surgeries.

## Patient exposure

The MAH has completed two paediatric clinical studies and two adult clinical studies to investigate the safe use of EXPAREL as a single-dose infiltration in the paediatric population:

• Paediatric Clinical Studies:

o  Study  120:  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  PK  and  safety  of  local  administration  of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg for postsurgical analgesia  in  paediatric  subjects 12 to less  than  17  years  of  age undergoing spinal surgery.

o Study 319: a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the PK and safety of EXPAREL for postsurgical analgesia in paediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 17 years undergoing spine or cardiac surgery.

• Adult Clinical Studies:

o  Study  117:  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  PK  of  local  administration  of EXPAREL when administered for postsurgical analgesia in adults undergoing open posterior spinal fusion or reconstructive surgery.

o Study 118: a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and PK of EXPAREL when administered for postsurgical analgesia in adults undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.

Overall,  the  safety  data  are  grouped  into  three  safety  data  pools  for  the  purposes  of  comparative analysis: Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, Adult Clinical Study Pool, and Historical Infiltration Pool (see Table 40). The Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and the Adult Clinical Study Pool are presented in this Summary of Clinical Safety, while the Historical Infiltration Pool and related comparisons are presented in the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS). The Historical Infiltration Pool is representative of the safety profile of EXPAREL in the approved indication for its use as a single-dose infiltration to produce local analgesia.

## Paediatric Clinical Study Pool

Key characteristics of studies included in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool are summarised in Table 41. The Paediatric Clinical Study Pool includes all subjects from Study 120 and Study 319 who received study drug. Study 120 evaluated the PK and safety of EXPAREL in subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine surgery. Study 319 evaluated the PK and safety of EXPAREL in subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years undergoing spine surgery (Group 1) and in subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years undergoing  either  spine  or  cardiac  surgery  (Group  2).  Subjects  who  received  bupivacaine  HCl  (i.e., subjects from Group 1 of Study 319) are presented separately in this pool. Within study 319, the safety of EXPAREL in the younger age group (6 to &lt;12 years) was compared to the older age group (12 to &lt;17 years).

## ADR in Paediatrics

Adverse Reactions Reported in All Local Infiltration Clinical Studies in Paediatric Patients Aged 6 to Less Than 17 Years.

The safety of EXPAREL in 110 paediatric patients (80 EXPAREL 4 mg/kg, 30 bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg) between the age of 6 and 17 years old undergoing various surgical procedures was evaluated in one randomized, open-label, clinical study in which EXPAREL was administered by infiltration into the surgical site and one single arm, open-label study in which EXPAREL was administered by infiltration into the surgical site. Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 2% reported by patients in clinical studies studying 4 mg/kg EXPAREL alone or comparing 4 mg/kg EXPAREL to 2 mg/kg bupivacaine HCl are shown in Table 44.

## SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL STUDIES

## Paediatric population

## Study 120 (Spine Surgery)

All 15 treated subjects experienced at least one TEAE during the study (Table 45). All TEAEs were mild or  moderate  in  severity.  Three  (20.0%)  subjects  experienced  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse events (TESAEs).  Fourteen (93.3%) subjects experienced TEAESIs. There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation.

CSR:clinical studyreport;TEAE:treatment-emergent adverse event

a: Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as those adverse events with onset date between the start of the study drug administration and the end of study (Study Day 30 ± 3 days)

b: Related treatment-emergent adverse events were those adverse events indicated as 'possible', 'probable' or ^definite' related by the investigator on the adverse event case report form.

A summary of TEAEs experienced by more than one subject is presented in Table 46. The most common (reported by &gt;50% of all subjects) TEAEs were anemia (15 subjects [100%]), hypotension (14 subjects [93.3%]), nausea and muscle twitching (nine subjects [60.0%] each), and tachycardia and vomiting (eight subjects [53.3%] each). One additional subject was noted to have hypotension with onset before administration of study medication; thus, this event was not treatment emergent.

## Safety Results

An overview of TEAEs of all subjects who were exposed to study drug is presented in Table 47. In Group 1, 19 subjects (61.3%) in the EXPAREL group and 22 subjects (73.3%) in the bupivacaine HCl group experienced a TEAE during the study. Most TEAEs in both groups were mild or moderate in severity. Two subjects  (6.5%)  in  the  EXPAREL  group  and  five  subjects  (15.7%)  in  the  bupivacaine  HCl  group experienced a TEAE considered related to study treatment. Two subjects (6.5%) in the EXPAREL group and three subjects (10.0%) in the bupivacaine HCl group experienced a TEAESI. No subject experienced a TESAE or discontinued the study because of a TEAE. In Group 2, all five subjects (100%) in the spine surgery group and nine subjects (31%) in the cardiac surgery group experienced a TEAE, all of which were considered mild or moderate in severity. Three subjects (60.0%) in the spine surgery group and none in the cardiac surgery had TEAEs considered related to study treatment. Two subjects (6.9%) in

## COMPARISON AND ANALYSES OF RESULTS ACROSS STUDIES

## Paediatric Clinical Study Pool

The Paediatric Clinical Study Pool combines the safety data from Studies 120 and 319.

## Overview of Adverse Events

An overview of TEAEs is provided in Table 55.

In the subjects treated with EXPAREL, the majority of subjects (60.0%) experienced at least one TEAE, and 25.0% of subjects experienced a TEAE that was considered related to study drug. No EXPARELtreated subjects experienced a severe TEAE. Five subjects (6.3%) experienced SAEs, none of which was considered related to study treatment, led to discontinuation or death. No subject discontinued the studies because of a TEAE and there were no deaths.

In the subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl, the majority of subjects (73.3%) experienced at least one TEAE, and 16.7% of subjects experienced a TEAE that was considered related to study drug. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity with the exception of one bupivacaine HCl-treated subject (3.3%) who experienced  a  severe  TEAE.  No  subjects  experienced  TESAEs.  No  subject  discontinued  the  studies because of a TEAE and there were no deaths.

## Common Adverse Events

The common TEAEs (incidence ≥two subjects in either group) in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and the Adult Clinical Study Pool are presented by group in Table 56. For subjects treated with EXPAREL in the  Paediatric  Clinical  Study  Pool,  nausea  (27.5%) and  vomiting  (27.5%)  were  the  most  frequently reported TEAEs. Other frequently reported TEAEs included constipation (25.0%), hypotension (22.5%), anemia  (18.8%),  muscle  twitching  (16.3%),  and  vision  blurred  (13.8%).  For  subjects  treated  with bupivacaine HCl in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, constipation (30.0%) was the most frequently reported  TEAE.  Other  frequently  reported  TEAE  included  muscle  twitching  (26.7%),  hypotension (23.3%), nausea (20.0%), vomiting (16.7%), and tachycardia (13.3%). Anemia was only reported in subjects treated with EXPAREL in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool. All cases of anemia were mild in severity and unrelated to EXPAREL.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

A summary of TEAESIs is provided in Table 57. The subject incidences are reported without regard to investigator-reported causality or timing of onset in relation to study drug administration. Narratives for TEAESIs are listed in Section 3.1.8. In the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, 25.0% of EXPAREL-treated subjects experienced at least one TEAESI. All TEAESI were considered mild or moderate in severity and none led to death or study discontinuation. Of the TEAESI that were pre-specified cardiac or neurological AEs, 20% of subjects experienced cardiac disorders and 7.5% of subjects experienced nervous system disorders. One (1.3%) fall occurred. All TEAESIs were considered not related to EXPAREL. In subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl, 20.0% of subjects experienced at least one TEAESI. Of the TEAESI that were pre-specified cardiac or neurological AEs, 13.3% of subjects experienced cardiac disorders and 10.0% of subjects experienced nervous system disorders. No falls were reported. All TEAESIs were mild in severity and considered not related to bupivacaine HCl.

## Summary of Adverse Events

In subjects treated with EXPAREL in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, 60% of subjects experienced at least one TEAE during the study. The most commonly reported TEAEs were nausea (27.5%), vomiting (27.5%), constipation (25.0%), hypotension (22.5%), anemia (18.8%), muscle twitching (16.3%), and vision blurred (13.8%). Twenty subjects (25.0%) experienced at least one TEAE that was considered related to study drug. Twenty subjects (25.0%) experienced pre-specified cardiac or neurological AEs, and one subject (1.3%) experienced a fall. All TEAESIs were considered not related to EXPAREL. There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. In subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, 73.3% of subjects experienced at least one TEAE during the study. The most commonly reported TEAEs were constipation (30.0%), muscle twitching (26.7%), hypotension (23.3%),  nausea  (20.0%),  vomiting  (16.7%),  and  tachycardia  (13.3%).  Five  subjects  (16.7%) experienced  at  least  one  TEAE  that  was  considered  related  to  study  drug.  Six  subjects  (20.0%) experienced pre-specified cardiac or neurological AEs and no subject reported falls. There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation.

## Comparison Between the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and the Adult Clinical Study Pool

The studies in each pool were selected with the intention of presenting matched surgery types in adult and paediatric studies to enable a comparison of the PK and safety across age groups and populations while limiting the differences in safety (and PK) arising from comparisons of significantly different surgical procedures. The surgical procedures selected for the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and the Adult Clinical Study Pool were chosen to be representative of subjects at high risk for safety events due to the high vascularity of the selected procedures. Paediatric cardiac surgeries are performed due to congenital heart conditions that do not commonly present themselves in adult patients and, thus, there is no exactly matching adult cardiac procedure. However, local anesthetic administration into the thoracic region is known to lead to rapid absorption of local anesthetics. In the paediatric cardiac patient cohort, EXPAREL is administered in and around the open surgical site that encompasses the superficial layers of skin and muscle as well as the intercostal spaces. Therefore, the data from Study 118, in which EXPAREL was administered into the tissues surrounding the thoracic space, are used to support a bridge between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cardiac surgical procedures as studied in Study 319. Given that Study 117 evaluated adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg via local wound infiltration in subjects undergoing a high-risk open posterior spinal fusion procedure or reconstructive surgery, data from Study 117 are used to support a bridge between adult and paediatric patients for spine surgical procedures as studied in Study 319. Table 58 shows the comparison of the overview of TEAEs in subjects exposed to EXPAREL in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool to the Adult Clinical Study Pool.

## Comparison of TESAEs in paediatric and adult patients

The incidence of TESAEs by SOC and preferred term in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool and Adult Clinical Study Pool is summarised in Table 63. The incidence of TESAEs in the Adult Clinical Study Pool was higher than those in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool. Within the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, the incidence of TESAEs was greater in subjects treated with EXPAREL (5 of 80, 6.3%) than bupivacaine HCl (0%). However, none of these TESAEs was considered to be related to EXPAREL and all were mild to moderate in severity.

## Deaths

There were no deaths reported in the studies included in the Adult Clinical Study Pool. There were no deaths reported in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool.

## Laboratory findings

## Clinical Laboratory Tests

Hematology and chemistry results were not collected in the Adult Clinical Study Pool.

The mean change from baseline in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit at 96 hours for EXPARELtreated subjects was comparable to bupivacaine-treated subjects.

ISS:Integrated Summary of Safety; SD: standard deviation

The mean change from baseline to 96 hours for white blood cells, white blood cell subpopulations, and platelets was comparable between the EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups.

Table 65 presents the shift from baseline to 96 hours for erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The percentage of subjects with a shift from 'normal' at baseline to 'low' at 96 hours for erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit was comparable EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups. No clinically relevant safety  issues  regarding  red  blood  cell  parameters  were  observed  for  EXPAREL  as  compared  with bupivacaine HCl in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool. All 15 subjects from Study 120 experienced a TEAE of anemia. All TEAEs of anemia were mild in severity, considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug, and ongoing at the end of the study. No TEAE of anemia required treatment, was serious, or resulted in discontinuation. Hemoglobin values past 96 hours after study drug administration were not available. The effect of surgery, including general anesthesia, blood loss, and bleeding as a part of invasive surgical procedure, may have resulted in loss of red blood cells and the resultant incidence of mild anemia in all subjects.

ISS: Integrated Summary of Safety

The  mean  change  and  shift  from  baseline  to  96  hours  post  dose  showed  no  clinically  meaningful differences between the EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups in chemistry results.

## Safety in special populations

Sex, Ethnicity, Race, ASA

Given the low sample size of the Adult Clinical Study Pool, a meaningful comparison of TEAEs by sex, ethnic, racial or ASA class subgroups could not be made. However, the overall incidence of TEAEs for the EXPAREL pediatric group in these subgroups was generally comparable to that for the Adult Clinical Study Pool.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation from both Exparel and Bupivacaine HCL group in the Paediatric pool.

## Post marketing experience

All the post-marketing experience to date comes from use of the product in the US. Based on internal sales data and the assumption that one sold vial of EXPAREL represents one treated patient, more than 6.5 million patients have received EXPAREL in the post-marketing setting to date. On an ongoing basis, Pacira's Pharmacovigilance/Medical group reviews the medical/scientific literature (using the Medline and Embase  databases)  for  abstracts/articles  describing  adverse  experience  reports  with  EXPAREL. Healthcare professionals, consumers, and company representatives report AEs via company hotlines or email at drugsafety@pacira.com. Medical Information and license partners/company affiliates also report AE information via the drug safety email address. The procedures by which the information from these sources  is  evaluated  and  appropriate  information  entered  into  Pacira's  global  safety  database  are described in the company's Pharmacovigilance standard operating procedures (i.e., Management and Reporting  of  Spontaneous  Adverse  Reports,  Pharmacovigilance  Literature  Searches),  and,  when applicable, in safety data exchange agreements with Pacira partners. EXPAREL is not subject to enhanced or special pharmacovigilance activities and there are no risk minimization programs ongoing for EXPAREL in the US. Because adverse reactions reported during post-marketing are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The adverse reactions reported during post-marketing are consistent with those observed in clinical studies and most commonly involve the following SOCs: Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications (e.g., drug-drug interaction, procedural pain), Nervous System Disorders (e.g., palsy, seizure), General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions (e.g., lack of efficacy, pain), Skin And Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (e.g., erythema, rash), and Cardiac Disorders (e.g., bradycardia, cardiac arrest). Review of these events against the current approved US labelling for EXPAREL has not identified any new safety concerns and no changes to the product labelling have been required for safety reasons since initial approval.

Two spontaneous ADRs pertaining to the Eye Disorders SOC were reported during the postmarketing period up to 8 Jun 2021.

2020000052 (Product administered to patient of inappropriate age, Vision blurred) from a pharmacist concerns a 16-year-old patient of unknown gender who received EXPAREL (batch#, dosage and route unknown) for an unspecified indication and experienced near and far blurred vision.

2018000013 (Hypoventilation, Oxygen saturation decreased, Vision blurred, Tachycardia, Somnolence, Agitation,  Product  administered  to  patient  of  inappropriate  age)  was  from  a  literature  article  that evaluated the incidence of LAST in paediatric surgical patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine compared to plain bupivacaine for surgical wound infiltration (Cohen et al, 2018).

Post-marketing spontaneous ADRs in patients &lt;18 years were reviewed up to 8 Jun 2021 for inclusion in Table ADR in children.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH is seeking to extend the Exparel liposomal indication to children from 6 -17 years for a field block  for  treatment  of  somatic  postoperative  pain  from  small-  to  medium-sized  surgical  wounds.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Paediatric studies were conducted according to the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan. The overall safety pool comprises data from both paediatric and adult clinical studies. The MAH provided paediatric safety  data  from  conducted  studies  and  post-marketing  experience.  Paediatric  safety  pool  is  rather limited (N=80) bearing in mind proposed broad paediatric indication. The patients were exposed to the proposed Exparel dose of 4 mg/kg (up to 266 mg). Primary focus of assessment is paediatric safety pool. The adult safety pool data are also presented in the dossier. It is claimed that adult studies (117, phase I,  open  posterior  spinal  fusion  or  reconstructive  surgery  setting;  and  118,  phase  I,  posterolateral thoracotomy) are chosen as similar and thus comparable to paediatric studies (319 and 120). Adult safety pool comprises of only 19 patients. For age group ≥ 12 to 17 years of age there are comparative data from Study 319, Group 1 (Exparel vs bupivacaine HCl), but with a very limited sample sizes (N=30 per study arm). For lower age group of ≥ 6 to 12 years of age, there are no comparative data. Some comparison is possible to adult studies.

The MAH provided additional discussion on the safety profile in paediatric population in relation to the standard of care in the EU, ropivacaine. A comparison to bupivacaine and to theoretical similarities of PK profiles for ropivacaine and Exparel were discussed. Data revealed no major safety difference between bupivacaine and ropivacaine. Conclusions on no immediate safety issue identified are based on expected similarities of PK profiles of Exparel and ropivacaine.

Safety database for the lower age subgroup ≥6 to 12 years of age is rather limited (N=34). It is argued that a size of paediatric database has been agreed within the PIP and SAs. The MAH explanation on the safety data for lower age subgroup ≥6 to 12 years of age relies on the predicted similarity of PK profiles for  adults  receiving  Exparel  266  mg  and  paediatric  patients  receiving  Exparel  4  mg/kg  in  matching surgical procedures.

Additionally, historical safety data pool has been presented and analysed offering relatively large safety population of 998 adult patients exposed to EXPAREL. Paediatric safety pool included male and female patients stratified  in  two  age  groups  -  6  to  12  years  and  12  to  17  years  old.  The  presented  safety population is in line with the key binding elements of the approved PIP and is deemed appropriate for the purpose of this procedure.

Bupivacaine is an active substance with well known safety profile. As agreed with PDCO during review of the PIP for EXPAREL, the focus of the Exparel paediatric development was to obtain pharmacokinetic data in children. If the PK profile in adults and children are similar, then the extrapolation exercise can support safety.

## Adverse events

TEAEs were more frequently reported in adult safety pool compared to paediatric patients, and most frequently in EXPAREL group compared to Bupivacaine HCI group, though all were mild to moderate.

Pooled safety data from the two studies in the paediatric population and the two studies in adults has been presented. All studies were reviewed for major safety events and safety events of special interest. The MAH has presented safety data from individual paediatric studies and adult studies, as well as pooled safety analysis for paediatric population and comparison of paediatric and adult pools. Paediatric safety population has two age subgroups - 6-12 years and 12 to 17 years, as well as patients were stratified by surgery type.

In the Study 120 EXPAREL 4 mg/kg has been administered in paediatric patients from 12 to less than 17 years for postsurgical local analgesia following spine surgery. All patients experienced at least one TEAE. All AEs were mild to moderate. Most frequently reported AE was anaemia that was likely due to blood loss during the surgery. Other most commonly reported AEs were hypotension, nausea, vomiting and muscle twitching.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Study 319 EXPAREL has been administered in paediatric patients from 12 to less than 17 years (Group 1) and 6 to 12 years (Group 2). In Group 1 patients were randomised 1:1 either to EXPAREL 4 mg/kg arm or Bupivacaine HCI 2 mg/kg arm. In Group 2 all patients were exposed to EXPAREL 4 mg/kg dose. Safety findings from this study were rather similar to those reported from Study 120. In Group 1 slightly  lower  incidence  of  TEAEs  were  reported  in  the  EXPAREL  group  (61.3%)  compared  to  the Bupivacaine HCI (73.3%). All but one AE in the Bupivacaine HCI group were moderate or mild. TEAEs reported  from  Study  319  were  generally  similar  to  those  reported  from  Study  120.  In  the  SOC  of Gastrointestinal  disorders  markedly  higher  incidence  of  nausea  (32.3%)  and  vomiting  (29%)  were reported  in  the  EXPAREL  group  compared  to  Bupivacaine  HCI  group  -  nausea  (20%)  and  vomiting (16.7%). While the proportions of patients reporting nausea and vomiting were numerically higher in the EXPAREL group than the Bupivacaine HCl group in Group 1 (12 to &lt;17 years) of Study 319, the differences for both nausea and vomiting represent an absolute difference of only 4 patients per group (i.e., 10 vs 6 for nausea, and 9 vs 5 for vomiting). The MAH provided additional analyses of the Local Analgesia Pool in adults from the original MAA to compare the incidence of nausea and vomiting with EXPAREL and Bupivacaine HCl. With a much larger sample size (1,109 EXPAREL, 604 Bupivacaine  HCl), there was no evidence of an imbalance between  EXPAREL and Bupivacaine  HCl in  nausea or vomiting, specifically, or for the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC.

In Adult studies most of patients experienced at least one TEAE. None of them were considered related to EXPAREL exposure.

The MAH presented a good comparison of safety data across studies, as well as between Paediatric safety pool and Adult safety pool. Most common AEs in Paediatric Clinical Study Pool were nausea (27.5%), vomiting  (27.5%),  constipation  (25%),  hypotension  (22.5%),  anaemia  (18.8%),  muscle  twitching (16.3%). There were some TEAEs such as pruritus (11.6% vs 6.7%), bradycardia (8.8% vs 0), muscle spasms (8.8% vs 0), tachypnoea (8.8% vs 3.3%) reported with higher incidence in the EXPAREL group compared to the Bupivacaine HCI group. However, these differences appear to be likely related to the site-effect. Some AEs were more frequently reported with Exparel for single site study compared to multi-centre study suggesting that these findings might be affected by AE's reporting bias.

## Serious adverse events and death

Three TEASAEs were reported in two subjects in the younger age group (6 - 12 y) from Study 319 . Both patients were in the cardiac surgery group. The MAH argues that none of them were considered as related to Exparel. In the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders, vomiting vas reported in one patient as a TESAE. According to narrative, this SAE indeed unlikely was related EXPAREL exposure as it started on day 8 post-surgery. No TESAEs were reported in Spinal surgery group and Group 1 (12 - 17 y).

TESAEs were reported in three subjects from Study 120 in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and Nervous system disorders. The MAH provided details on these reported cases and there appears no plausible relationship with Exparel and SAEs.

Overall incidence of TESAEs was rather low in both adult and paediatric pools. There were no significant differences observed between both pools. Based on available data, no increased risk to LAST related AEs was identified in EXPAREL exposed paediatric patients. However, due to a very small sample size, definite conclusion on LAST incidence in Exparel exposed patients compared to overall bupivacaine data cannot be driven.

## AEs of special interest

Incidences of AESIs (25%) were not negligible in the paediatric safety pool; with most frequent those pertaining to SOC Cardiac disorders (20%) and SOC Neurologic disorders (7.5%).

## Laboratory findings

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Haematology and chemistry tests were collected only in paediatric patients. Shift from baseline was assessed  96  hours  post-surgery.  TEAE  of  anaemia  was  reported  in  all  patients  and  the  Applicant's arguments that this AE is likely due to blood loss during the surgery is generally supported.

The MAH provided detailed analysis of the clinical biochemistry findings. No systemic exposure related safety concerns for Exparel exposed patients were identified.

## Discontinuation due to AEs

Four  patients  discontinued  from  study  in  the  Paediatric  pool  (2  from  EXPAREL  group  and  2  from Bupivacaine HCL group) due to lost to follow-up. No patients discontinued from study due to TEAEs. There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation in Adult clinical study pool.

## Postmarketing experience

Bupivacaine is a well known active substance widely used in paediatric patients therefore postmarketing safety data reported for conventional bupivacaine formulation might also be relevant and collaborate to establishing safety profile for liposomal bupivacaine.

As for this application, available postmarketing safety data on liposomal bupivacaine is of particular interest. Post-marketing paediatric cases are discussed in the dossier in relation to ADRs determination process. 61 individual case histories pertaining to number of SOCs were submitted and two spontaneous ADR reports for liposomal bupivacaine were identified in paediatric patients. Exparel was administered in paediatric patients off-label as it was not authorised for paediatric patients at the time of procedure submission, and exact details are missing. In light of this, it is not possible to adequately assess clinical relevance of safety findings from the above reports.

## Adverse Drug Reactions

The proposed ADR table in paediatric population is based on an evaluation of treatment-related TEAEs and TEAEs observed in children treated with Exparel in the Paediatric Clinical Study Pool, spontaneous post-marketing ADRs in patients &lt;18 years up to 8 Jun 2021 and what is known about the safety of Exparel  and  bupivacaine  in  adults.  Anaemia  was  also  added  to  the  ADRs  table  (in  children)  in  the proposed PI, with frequency 'very common', due to the high incidences of anaemia observed in Exparel treated patients, and as at least suspected causality cannot be ruled out based on the comparative incidences from clinical trials.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Submitted safety data in paediatric patients does not indicate any serious safety concerns and overall EXPAREL safety profile in paediatric patients seems not markedly different compared to safety profile in adult patients. The overall safety data did not reveal any specific safety issues in paediatric patients compared to Bupivacaine HCL group and adult population exposed to liposomal bupivacaine. However, it should be noted that paediatric safety database is very limited and therefore conclusions should be made with great caution especially for lower age subgroup of ≥ 6 to 12 years of age.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No changes have been made to the list of safety concerns and there have been no changes to the risk minimisation measures or pharmacovigilance activities.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1,4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

See attachment 1 for full details on the Product Information as adopted by the CHMP.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the key safety information in the PIL remain the same. Furthermore, the design, layout and format of the package leaflet will not be affected by the proposed revisions.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage and postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury or nerve injury, or both. The aetiology and underlying physiology of postsurgical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pain is similar in paediatric and adult patients. During the postoperative period, pain manifests itself with maximum intensity during the first 24 hours, reducing progressively.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

In both paediatric and adult patients, multimodal analgesia which incorporates two or more agents, is the standard of care for postoperative pain management. The current treatment options for postsurgical analgesia include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local anaesthetics, acetaminophen, opioids,  N-methyl-Daspartate  antagonists,  and  α2 -adrenergic  agonists;  the  specific  components  of effective multimodal care vary depending on the patient, setting, and surgical procedure.

Bupivacaine is a well-known active substance widely used in paediatric patients. It is one of the longeracting local anaesthetics, but it has a duration of action of approximately 4-8 hours.  The expected benefits of Exparel (bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicual liposomes) administration would include extended duration of post-surgical pain relief.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Efficacy is extrapolated from adults to paediatric patients based on:

- Similarity of pathophysiology of postsurgical pain in paediatric and adult patients
- Similarity of mechanism of action, metabolism and response to treatment with bupivacaine HCl in paediatric and adult patients
- Demonstration of efficacy of Exparel in two Phase 3 randomized, controlled studies (bunionectomy,  haemorrhoidectomy)  that  supported  approval  of  field  block  indication  for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds
- Similarity  of  the  exposures  achieved  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  in  matching  surgical procedures and assumed similar effect site exposure
- Similarity of systemic absorption of bupivacaine from Exparel in paediatric and adult patients in matching surgical procedures that support similar local release of bupivacaine from Exparel.

The MAH submitted two paediatric studies and two previously assessed adult studies to support extension of indication to patients from 6 years of age:

- Study 120: a phase 1, open-label, pharmacokinetic and safety study used to support the dosing of  4  mg/kg  (up  to  maximum  dose  of  266  mg)  in  Study  319  and  to  provide  supportive pharmacokinetic and safety data on EXPAREL for the proposed indication. All paediatric patients (12 to &lt; 17 years) treated in this study underwent a spinal surgery.
- Study  319:  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  supporting  the  use  of EXPAREL for local infiltration. Paediatric subjects aged 12 to &lt; 17 years underwent spinal surgery (Group 1). 6 to &lt; 12 years participants underwent spinal or cardiac surgery (Group 2). Group 1 included bupivacaine HCL as a comparator. The study was used as basis for extrapolation of efficacy.

Two additional studies in matching surgical procedures in adult subjects who received EXPAREL 266 mg via local infiltration were submitted:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study 117: a phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of local administration of EXPAREL when administered for prolonged postsurgical analgesia in subjects undergoing open posterior spinal fusion or reconstructive surgery.
- Study 118:a phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of EXPAREL when administered for postsurgical analgesia in subjects undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

PK comparison of Exparel 4 mg/kg vs bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg in Study 319, Group 1 showed that Exparel exhibits similar PK properties as already observed in adult subjects; slower absorption and more sustained  bupivacaine  concentrations,  in  line  with  the  extended  release  of  bupivacaine  from  the multivesicular liposomes. The observed Cmax was lower and Tmax later in the Exparel group, with two maximums present in most subjects.

Descriptive comparison of exploratory endpoints of AUC values of NRS-R pain intensity score in Study 319, Group 1 (spine surgery in adolescents 12-17 years old) showed generally similar results between Exparel and bupivacaine HCl groups.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Submitted studies were not designed and powered to make any conclusions about the efficacy.

There  is  no  direct  correlation  between  the  absolute  plasma  concentration  of  bupivacaine  and concentration at the site of action. It is assumed that a similar plasma pharmacokinetic profile observed in adults and children would lead to similar local tissue site concentrations and thus indicate a similar therapeutic efficacy.

There was no formal dose selection studies. Instead, the dose of 4 mg/kg (up to 266 mg) was selected based on registry data and modelling. The actual administered dose in the clinical practice will depend on the clinician's judgement of the size of the surgical wound, the volume required to cover the area and individual patient factors.

Due to the sparse PK sampling schemes, all PK comparisons were based on population PK modelling rather  than  direct  comparison  of  observed  values  across  groups.  Lower  systemic  exposures  were observed in pediatric population compared to adult population, thus similarity of systemic exposures and the impact on efficacy extrapolation was questioned. The applicant provided new population PK modeling to demonstrate that the differences observed are due to different absolute dose administered in adults (a fixed dose of 266 mg) and children (4 mg/kg dose, up to a maximum of 266 mg).

No statistical analysis was performed to evaluate similarity of the exposure between paediatric and adult population in matching surgical procedures. The comparison is rather of descriptive manner and there were no pre-defined criteria to establish similarity in exposures. It is acknowledged that no therapeutic range exists for systemic bupivacaine and therefore formal demonstration of statistical similarity in PK parameters would not be informative.

Based  on  Pop  PK  model  simulations,  the  characteristic  shape  of  the  PK  profile  between  adults  and paediatric subjects appears similar. The exposure based on both Cmax and AUC was lower in children and adolescents compared to adult subjects for both surgical models (spine and cardiac) however this might be more indicative of safety rather than efficacy.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The purpose of the safety assessment is to determine safety profile for a new formulation of liposomal bupivacaine. The overall safety data does not reveal any specific safety issues in paediatric patients compared to Bupivacaine HCL and adult population.

Both paediatric surgical models (spine and cardiac surgery) are highly vascular and can be regarded as procedures of highest risk for systemic toxicity. Therefore, it is considered acceptable to extrapolate safety results to the less invasive procedures included in the indication. Provided PK data suggest that highest Cmax observed was below the levels associated with safety concerns in adult.

In the pooled paediatric data, the most frequently reported AEs were nausea (27.5%), vomiting (27.5%), constipation (25.0%), hypotension (22.5%), muscle twitching (16.3%), and vision blurred (13.8%).

In the pooled paediatric set in Exparel-treated subjects, five (6.3%) subjects had serious adverse events: flank pain, muscular weakness, vomiting, wound infection fungal, paraesthesia, and dyspnoea. None of the TESAEs resulted in study discontinuation or death.

Incidences of AEs of special interest (25%) were not negligible in the paediatric safety pool; with most frequent those pertaining to SOC Cardiac disorders (20%) and SOC Neurologic disorders (7.5%).

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Paediatric safety pool is rather limited (N=80), especially for children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age. Additionaly, for lower age subgroup there are no comparative safety data. Only some comparison to adult studies is possible.

## 3.6. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.6.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The paediatric studies were not designed nor powered to evaluate efficacy.

The efficacy is extrapolated from adults based on the assumption that similar plasma PK profiles between children and adults in matching surgeries would mean similar local release of bupivacaine from Exparel liposomal. It is acknowledged that systemic concentrations are not directly correlated to a magnitude of analgesic effect.

There is similar pathophysiology of postsurgical pain between paediatric and adult patients based on data from literature. Mechanism of action, metabolic pathway and response to bupivacaine is also similar between paediatric and adult patients based on data from literature. Efficacy of Exparel in adults has been demonstrated in two Phase 3 randomized, controlled studies (bunionectomy, haemorrhoidectomy) that supported its approval as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds.

PK profiles of bupivacaine following field block with Exparel in paediatric and adult subjects in matched surgical  models  suggest  similar  and  characteristic  local  release  of  bupivacaine  from  Exparel.  The magnitude  of  differences  in  PK  parameters  observed  between  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  can  be regarded  as  largely  similar  to  the  differences  expected  in  adults  due  to  different  absolute  dose administered and are not expected to influence efficacy. Paediatric exposure remaining below the adult exposure supports the safety of the proposed paediatric 4 mg/kg dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both paediatric surgical models (spine and cardiac surgery) are highly vascular and can be regarded as procedures of highest risk for systemic toxicity. Therefore, it is considered acceptable to extrapolate safety results to the less invasive procedures included in the indication.

Safety profile in paediatric patients seems not markedly different compared to safety profile in adult patients. However, paediatric safety database is limited, what is particularly emphasized for the younger age subgroup of 6 to &lt; 12 years of age.

Based on the data provided, the efficacy of Exparel as a field block for treatment of somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults can be extrapolated to paediatric patients 6 years and older.

## 3.6.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Based on the presented data, it can be concluded that benefit-risk balance for Exparel liposomal use in children aged 6 years or older to reduce somatic postoperative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds is favourable.

## 3.6.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

During the procedure, CHMP asked for the PDCO consultation. PDCO was invited to comment if provided PK data along with findings of exploratory clinical data endpoints could be considered sufficient evidence to support extension of indication to paediatric patients, in particular for the 6-12 years age group. In response, PDCO supported proposed extrapolation concept and considered that the PK profiles were sufficiently  similar,  whereas  predicted  lower  Cmax  was  considered  indicative  of  safety.  PDCO acknowledged  that  controlled  efficacy  study  is  not  feasible  in  paediatric  population.  In  addition, therapeutic need for children was emphasised by the PDCO, considering prolonged-release formulation allows to decrease adverse effects, which is even more important in younger age groups.

## 3.7. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Exparel liposomal is positive.
