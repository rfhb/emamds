| II/0099 | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, based on final results from study C25006, a multi-centre open-label, phase 4 study of 50 patients with r/r sALCL undertaken to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in adult patients who had previously received at least 1 multiagent chemotherapy regimen. This study was listed as an interventional category 2 PASS in the RMP (SOB 010). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to request the granting of a marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations and valid for five years, in accordance with Article 14- a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, thereby deleting SOB 010 from the annex II and of the reference to the conditional marketing authorisation from annex II and the package leaflet. The revised RMP version 16.1 has also been submitted. An editorial update under section 5.1 of the SmPC (update of the ATC code) has been implemented.

As of study closure, approximately 10 years after enrollment of the first patient, PFS per investigator continued to show a benefit (HR = 0.51 [95% CI (0.37, 0.71)]). Overall survival results were consistent with those reported at the time of primary analysis (HR = 1.11 [95% CI (0.72, 1.70)]). The hazard ratio for PFS per investigator for patients with 2 or more risk factors was 0.41 (95% CI [0.29, 0.58]). The hazard ratio for PFS per investigator for patients with 3 or more risk factors was 0.38 (95% CI [0.25, 0.59]). Overall survival results remained consistent with those observed as of the primary analysis. For more information, please refer to the Summary of |

Based on the information provided by the MAH, this statement is not considered adequate. The incidences of pneumonia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenia were shown to be considerable different for patients ≥ 65 years as compared to patients <65 years. Furthermore, as also mentioned by the MAH older age is an important risk factor for, among others, the occurrence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Therefore, in view of available data regarding the PASS final study report, the PRAC Rapporteur considered that changes to the product information were warranted. |

There was a trend of increased clearance of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients confirmed positive for anti- drug antibodies (ADAs). No patients aged <12 years and 2 patients aged ≥ 12 became persistently ADA positive. The overall response rate was 47% in response-evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (r/r HL), 53% in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (r/r sALCL) and 60% in sALCL patients in first relapse.

In Study C25005 the company has evaluated the exposure to MMAE and its metabolites in the absence and presence of rifampicin, after administration of multiple doses of brentuximab vedotin, in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Though PK data are limited, co administration of rifampicin appeared to reduce plasma concentrations of MMAE metabolites that could be assayed. MMAE is further metabolized mainly to an equally potent metabolite; however, its exposure is an order of magnitude lower than that of MMAE. Thus, it is not likely to have any substantial contribution to the systemic effects of MMAE. Overall, the safety findings for the 20 adult patients in Study C25005 were consistent with the known toxicity profile of brentuximab vedotin. No new safety signals were observed. |

Although a causal association with brentuximab vedotin has not been established, the risk of pulmonary toxicity cannot be ruled out. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic evaluation should be performed and patients should be treated appropriately. Consider holding brentuximab vedotin dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement. Gastrointestinal (GI) complications including intestinal obstruction, ileus, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, erosion, ulcer, perforation and haemorrhage, some with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with brentuximab vedotin. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately. Hepatotoxicity in the form of elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) has been reported with brentuximab vedotin. Serious cases of hepatotoxicity, including fatal outcomes, have also occurred. Pre-existing liver disease, comorbidities, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Liver function should be tested before initiating the treatment and routinely monitored in patients receiving brentuximab vedotin. Patients experiencing hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose or discontinuation of brentuximab vedotin.   |

Twenty patients with relapsed or refractory HL received a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg and one patient received a starting dose of 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. The median number of cycles was 7 (range, 2 to 37 cycles). Of the 20 evaluable patients with HL, 6 patients (30%) achieved a CR and 6 patients (30%) achieved a PR with brentuximab vedotin retreatment, for an ORR of 60%. The median duration of response was 9.2 and 9.4 months in patients who achieved OR (CR+PR) and CR, respectively. Seven patients with relapsed sALCL received a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg and one patient received a starting dose of 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. The median number of cycles was 8.5 (range, 2 to 30 cycles). Of the 8 sALCL patients, 3 were retreated twice for a total of 11 retreatment experiences.

The types and rates of adverse reactions reported for patients retreated with ADCETRIS were consistent with those observed in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies, with the exception of peripheral motor neuropathy, which had a higher incidence (28% vs. 9% in the pivotal phase 2 studies) and was primarily Grade 1 or 2. Patients also had a higher incidence of arthralgia, Grade 3 anaemia, and back pain compared to patients observed in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies. The incidence of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy in patients with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL who were retreated with brentuximab vedotin was 48%. Treatment emergent neuropathy occurred in 69% of the population. At the time of last evaluation, the majority of patients who were retreated and experienced treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy (80%) had improvement or resolution of their peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation in 21% and dose modifications in 34% of patients who were retreated. In view of these data, the recommended starting dose for the retreatment of patients with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL who have previously responded to treatment with ADCETRIS is 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.

| II/0012 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to present updated advice to physicians on treatment with Adcetris of patients with hepatic or renal impairment based on data from study SGN-35- 008b. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 26/06/2014 | 22/08/2014 | SmPC and PL | Study SGN35-008 evaluated the pharmacokinetic of brentuximab and antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) after administration of 1.2 mg/kg of Adcetris to patients with hepatic impairment and to patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic data from this study were submitted to support the proposal for an updated advice to physicians on treatment of patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Available data indicate that antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) clearance might be affected by severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and by low serum albumin concentrations. Compared to patients with normal renal function, MMAE exposure increased approximately 1.9-fold in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and no effect was observed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment; compared to patients with normal hepatic function, MMAE exposure increased approximately 2.3- fold in patients with hepatic impairment. The proposed recommended starting dose in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients with hepatic impairment is 1.2 mg/kg is therefore considered acceptable. |

| II/0011 | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the updated overall survival (OS) and Progression Free survival (PFS) analyses from both pivotal studies SG035-0003 and SG035-0004 in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) patients respectively. Annex II has been updated accordingly to remove part of the SOB-001. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to add the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/01/2014 | 22/08/2014 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Based on the updated results of SG035-0003 study in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients the median overall survival (OS) is 40.5 months (the median observation follow-up time (time to death or last contact) from first dose was 32.7 months). An exploratory intra-patient analysis showed that approximately 64% of the HL and the sALCL patients treated with brentuximab vedotin as part of the SG035- 0003 and SG035-0004 clinical study studies, respectively, experienced an improvement in clinical benefit as measured by longer progression free survival (PFS) compared with their most recent prior line of therapy. Based on the updated results of SG035-0004 study in systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) patients the estimated 36 month overall survival was 63% (the median observation follow-up time (time to death or last contact) from first dose was 33.4 months). An exploratory intra-patient analysis showed that approximately 69% of the HL and the sALCL patients treated with brentuximab vedotin as part of the SG035-0003 and SG035-0004 clinical study studies, respectively, experienced an improvement in clinical benefit as measured by longer progression free survival (PFS) compared with their most recent prior line of therapy.

| II/0002   | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to clarify the sources of the safety data (adverse drug reactions) presented, and to add the adverse reactions of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), anaphylactic reactions and febrile neutropenia that occurred outside of the phase 2 pivotal studies in the tabulated list of adverse reactions. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH has taken this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template | 21/02/2013 | 26/08/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL  | In this variation section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated in order to clarify the sources of the safety data presented. The safety profile of ADCETRIS is based on available clinical trial data, the Named Patient Program (NPP), and post- marketing experience to date. In addition, adverse drug reactions solely reported outside of the phase 2 population which were described as selected events of interest have now been also included in Table 3 under the frequency category 'not known' (cannot be estimated from the available data). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. |
