## 3 Scientific discussion

## 3.1 Introduction

M-M-RVAXPRO (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live) is a live virus vaccine for vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which is produced using recombinant human serum albumin (rHA).

The reconstituted vaccine is for subcutaneous and intramuscular administration. When reconstituted as directed, the dose for injection is 0.5 ml.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for M-M-RVAXPRO on 5 May 2006.

M-M-RVAXPRO is currently indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella in individuals 12 months of age or older. It is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.

The modification sought in this application is to obtain approval for the extension of the indication to include administration to healthy children from 9 months of age under special circumstances, in accordance with official recommendations or when an early protection is considered necessary.

This application is supported by the results of study MRV02C, an open-label, randomised, comparative, multi-centre study of the immunogenicity and safety of a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (a live vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella manufactured by Merck &amp; Co., Inc.containing the same MMR components of M-M-RVAXPRO) manufactured with rHA administered to healthy children from 9 months of age.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Not applicable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP

All studies fully adhered to GCP guidelines of the CHMP and Directive 91/507/EEC of the European Union. All studies were closely monitored by the MAH or a contract organisation for compliance to the protocols and procedures described in them.

## 3.2 Clinical aspects

In some European countries, the current official recommendations for measles, mumps and rubella vaccination are below 12 months of age. In France for instance, it is recommended to administer the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines from 9 months of age for children in day care. In Germany, the standing committee on vaccination recommends measles, mumps and rubella vaccination from 11 months of age and the WHO recommends vaccinating children from 9 months of age against measles.

In order to support the proposed change data from one clinical trial (study MRV02C) were submitted. Study MRV02C compared immunogenicity and safety at different ages at the time of Dose 1, using a 2dose schedule of ProQuad, an MMRV vaccine, which consists of the same measles, mumps and rubella components as contained in M-M-RVAXPRO.

## Clinical efficacy

## Study: MRV02C

Study MRV02C is an open-label, randomised, comparative, multi-centre study designed to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3 month interval to different age groups of healthy children at the time of the first dose (9 months or 11 months of age) is non-inferior to those who received the first dose at 12 months of age in terms of antibody response rates. The study was conducted in 3 countries (Finland, Germany, France) between November 2007 and December 2008.

## Study design

In this phase 3b study, a total of 1,620 subjects were randomised in one of 3 groups (first dose at 9, 11 or 12 months of age, 1:1:1; 540 subjects per group), to receive 2 doses of ProQuad at a 3-month interval. The same interval of time was to be respected between Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad in each group in order to solely evaluate the impact of the vaccination age on a unique vaccination pattern.

The schedule of vaccinations and blood sample collections is shown in Table 1. Blood samples were obtained from subjects just prior to ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 1), 42 days (±14) after ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 2), and 42 days (±14) after ProQuad dose 2 vaccination (blood sample 3).

## Study objectives

The objectives of study MRV02C were as follows:

-  The first primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age at the time of Dose 1 (group 2) is as immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1 (group 3), in terms of antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2.
-  The second primary objective, which was to be evaluated only if the first primary objective was reached, was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 (group 1) is as immunogenic as in healthy  children  of  12  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  Dose  1  (group  3),  in  terms  of  antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and to varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2.
-  The third primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age (group 2) and 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 (group 1) is well tolerated compared to healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1.
-  The secondary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad administered to healthy children from 9 months of age.
-  The secondary  safety  objectives were  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  Dose  1  and  Dose  2  of ProQuad administered to healthy children from 9 months of age.

The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the antibody response rates, which were defined as:

-  Measles antibody titre &gt;=255 mIU/mL in subjects with baseline titre &lt;255 mIU/mL.
-  Mumps antibody titre &gt;=10 ELISA Ab units/mL in subjects with baseline titre &lt;10 ELISA Ab units/mL.
-  Rubella antibody titre &gt;=10 IU/mL in subjects with baseline titre &lt;10 IU/mL.
-  Varicella antibody titre &gt;=5 gpELISA/mL in subjects with baseline titre &lt;1.25 gpELISA/mL.

## Serology Assays

Antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella were determined by validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and with any postvaccination immunogenicity evaluation.

The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was defined as all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violations which may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation.

Two subsets of the Per Protocol Set were defined for the immunogenicity evaluation at the corresponding time point, i.e.:

-  PPS1 consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 1.
-  PPS2 consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 2.

## Analysis of the immunogenicity

The immunogenicity analysis of the primary criteria was performed on the PPS1 in initially seronegative subjects (main analysis) and on the FAS (supportive analysis).

For the Per Protocol analysis, only initially seronegative subjects were included in the analyses of the corresponding valence:

-  For  measles,  subjects  with  baseline  (BS1)  measles  antibody  titres  &lt;255  mIU/mL  (i.e.  initially seronegative to measles),
-  For  mumps, subjects with baseline (BS1) mumps antibody titres &lt;10.0 ELISA Ab units/mL (i.e. initially seronegative to mumps),
-  For  rubella,  subjects  with  baseline  (BS1)  rubella  antibody  titres  &lt;10.0  IU/mL  (i.e.  initially seronegative to rubella),
-  For varicella, subjects with baseline (BS1) varicella antibody titres &lt;1.25 gpELISA units/mL (i.e. initially seronegative to varicella).

The immunogenicity analysis of the secondary criteria was performed on both PPS in initially seronegative subjects and FAS. Also, descriptive statistics were provided on initially seropositive subjects at inclusion, if seropositive subjects represent at least 5% of the FAS.

All subjects with serology results following Dose 2 of ProQuad were included in the FAS whatever antibody titres at baseline (BS1).

In relation with the first primary hypothesis, the estimates of the between groups differences in response rates (Group 2 - Group 3) were calculated together with their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower bounds of the CI were greater than -5% for measles, mumps and rubella response rates and greater than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the Group 2 response rates are noninferior to the Group 3 response rates.

If the first primary objective was reached, the second primary hypothesis was tested. The estimates of the between groups differences in response rates (Group 1 - Group 3) were calculated together with their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower bounds of the CI were greater than -5% for measles, mumps and rubella response rates and greater than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the Group 1 response rates are non-inferior to the Group 3 response rates.

## Results

## Disposition of subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 1,626 subjects were enrolled between 29 November 2007 and 14 April 2008. Six subjects were not randomised either due to protocol deviation or due to other reasons.

Randomised subjects were enrolled in three countries: 1,290 subjects (79.6%) into 15 centres in Finland, 140 subjects (8.6%) into 14 centres in France, and 190 subjects (11.7%) into 19 centres in Germany.

A total of 161 subjects (9.9%) were withdrawn from the study. The majority of subjects (137; 8.5%) were withdrawn before first vaccination, 18 subjects (1.1%) between first and second vaccination and six subjects (0.4%) after receiving the second vaccine dose. Given the differences in time between randomisation and first vaccination in the 3 groups, and taken into account in the determination of the sample size, the number of subjects withdrew from the study before Dose 1 was higher in Group 2 (first dose at 11 months) and Group 3 (first dose at 12 months), 10.4% and 12.8% of subjects respectively, than in Group 1 (first dose at 9 months), 2.2% of subjects.The main reason for withdrawal was for personal reason but 3 subjects were withdrawn for adverse events: 1 subject from Group 3 before Dose 1 (viral infection), and 2 subjects from Group 1 after Dose 1 due to serious adverse events assessed by the investigator as non-related to study vaccine (one subject for convulsion 2 months after vaccination and one subject for gastroenteritis rotavirus).The Full Analysis Set consisted of 1,473 subjects (90.9%): 527 subjects in Group 1, 480 subjects in Group 2 and 466 subjects in Group 3.

The PPS consisted of 1,446 subjects (89.3%) and the PPS1 consisted of 1,426 subjects (88.0%) including 519 subjects in Group 1, 460 subjects in Group 2 and 447 subjects in Group 3.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable between groups except for gender: Groups 1 and 2 were constituted of 48% of boys and 52% of girls whereas in Group 3, the gender distribution was 52% of boys and 48% of girls. Overall, mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) age at inclusion was 9.48 (+/-0.30) months, mean weight was 9.22 (+/-1.14) kg, and mean height was 72.96 (+/-2.64) cm.

At first vaccination, mean (+/- SD) age was 9.51 months (+/-0.30) in Group 1, 11.26 months (+/0.23) in Group 2, and 12.32 months (+/-0.24) in Group 3.

Regarding the serostatus at baseline, the percentage of subjects considered seropositive for measles, mumps and rubella at the time of first vaccination was comparable in the 3 groups (Table 2).

Table 2: Serostatus at the time of Dose 1 - FAS

Percentages are calculated based on the number of subjects of the Full Analysis Set with results available at baseline: Group 1: 527 subjects, Group 2: 479 subjects and Group 3: 465 subjects

Second primary objective: immunogenicity after the second dose of ProQuad when first dose was given at 9 months (Group 1) compared to 12 months (Group 3)

For both Group 1 (first dose at 9 months) and Group 3 (first dose at 12 months) the response rates after the second dose of ProQuad were ≥ 99.2% for mumps, rubella and varicella in the antigen-specific PPS. For measles, the response rate was 94.9% in Group 1 and 98.8% in Group 3 (Table 5).

## Antibody response in initially seropositive subjects

Response rates and geometric means of measles, mumps, and rubella antibody titres at 6 weeks postdose 1 and post-dose 2 on antigen specific FAS in initially seropositive subjects were presented in the CSR. As regards measles 11 subjects in group 1 were found to be seropositive prior vaccination ( ≥ 255mUI/ml). Following vaccination a very heterogeneous immune response against measles was observed within and across the different groups (see below Table 9).

All subjects in group 2 and 3, who were seropositive for measles (titre &gt;255 mIU/ml) prior vaccination had also a measles antibody titre &gt;255 mIU/ml post dose 2. Only 81.9% of infants 9 months of age however were determined to have seroprotective antibody titres post dose 2.

## Discussion on immunogenicity

The CHMP considered that the composition of the clinical trial batch of ProQuad is in principle representative to that of the currently approved vaccine composition of M-M-RVAXPRO. As regards the measles component a slightly higher virus titer at release is routinely present in M-M-RVAXPRO batches. However, due to the stability profile and the clinical data available the same end-of shelf-life titres are approved for both vaccines as regards the measles, mumps and rubella component. Moreover, in previous clinical trials it was demonstrated that the immune responses to measles, mumps and rubella following vaccination with ProQuad are comparable to that following vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.

In conclusion the immunogenicity data obtained as regards the measles, mumps and rubella component of the clinical trial using ProQuad are regarded to be representative for M-M-RVAXPRO.

In view of the study design, the CHMP agreed that the non-inferiority margins were appropriately defined.

The CHMP further considered that data demonstrate that vaccination of infants 9 months of age results in lower response rates to the measles component. This observation is most likely due to circulating maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune system of the children. These results confirm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that a further dose of vaccine should be given later on as a catch-up to ensure protection for the respective individuals against measles.

For measles, a significant difference in the response rates and GMTs in baseline seronegative children is observed depending on the age at administration of the first vaccine dose. Moreover the increase in antibody geometric mean titres post dose 2 was highest in the youngest age category compared to Group 2 and 3. In group 1, an increase from 942 mIU/ml after the first dose to 1817 mIU/ml after the second dose was observed, which is still lower than the GMT reported after the first dose in older infants. The CHMP considered that this low response might be due to interfering low levels of circulating maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune system.

In summary the post dose 1 and 2 immune responses are significantly lower in children 9 months of age than in infants 11 or 12 months of age. These results corroborate the necessity of further vaccine doses, when children are vaccinated against measles already in their first year of life.

The CHMP noted that all subjects in group 2 and 3, who were seropositive for measles (titre &gt;255 mIU/ml) prior to vaccination also had a measles antibody titre &gt;255 mIU/ml post dose 2. However, only 81.9% of infants who had received their first dose at 9 months of age had seroprotective antibody titres post dose 2. Although the number of subjects in this subgroup analysis was very low these results suggest interference of maternal antibodies on the immune response to measles vaccination.

## Clinical safety

The Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and who had safety follow-up data. Subjects were analysed according to their real age at Dose 1. Subjects with an age outside group definitions were reallocated to the group with a closer age definition.

The schedule for the evaluation of safety parameters is given below in Table 10.

## Patient exposure

The Safety Set consisted of 1,483 subjects (91.5%). One subject randomised in Group 2 (subject 12016) was over 12 months of age at Dose 1; this subject was analysed in Group 3 for safety analyses (according to real age at Dose 1). The extent of exposure is summarised in Table 11

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 11: Overall extent of exposure

|            | Group 1 9 months (N=541)   | Group 2 11 months (N=540)   | Group 3 12 months (N=539)   | Total (N=1620)   |
|------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Safety Set | 529 (97.8%)                | 484 (89.6%)                 | 470 (87.2%)                 | 1483 (91.5%)     |

The median follow-up duration was 142 days (range 1; 189) in Group 1, 195 days (range 1; 255) in Group 2 and 225 days (range 1; 274) in Group 3.

## Adverse events

## Post dose 1:

In total, 81.3% of subjects in Group 1, 81.9% in Group 2 and 81.1% in Group 3 reported at least one injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 1. Most of these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 58.7% of subjects in Group 1, 60.8% in Group 2 and 63.9% in Group 3.

Regarding fever, 8.8%, 10.3% and 14.8% of subjects reported rectal temperature ≥ 39.4°C in Groups 1, 2 and 3 following the first dose of ProQuad, i.e. statistically more in Group 3 (first injection at 12 months) compared to Group 1 (first injection at 9 months) and Group 2 (first injection at 11 months).

## Post dose 2:

In total, 72.5% of subjects in Group 1, 75.7% in Group 2 and 72.7% in Group 3 reported at least one injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 2. Most of these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 55.0% of subjects in Group 1, 57.8% in Group 2 and 54.8% in Group 3.

As regards the occurrence of fever comparable number of subjects reported rectal temperature ≥ 39.4°C in the three groups following the second dose.

In summary the incidence and intensity of injection-site adverse reactions from Day 0 to Day 28 postdose 1 and post dose 2 was comparable between groups.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

Before the first administration of ProQuad, no serious adverse event was reported in Group 1, 1 serious adverse event was reported by 1 subject (0.2%) in Group 2 (gastroenteritis rotavirus), and 10 serious adverse events were reported by 7 subjects (1.5%) in Group 3 (bronchitis, gastroenteritis, laryngitis and concussion were reported by 1 subject each and gastroenteritis rotavirus, otitis media and tonsillitis were reported by 2 subjects each).

Serious adverse events occurring between the Dose 1 and 2 of ProQuad were more frequently reported by subjects from Group 1 (3.4%) than those from Group 2 and Group 3 (1.7% in each group). Serious adverse events included cardiac disorders, infections and infestations (mainly gastroenteritis rotavirus, gastroenteritis and bronchitis), injury, poisoning and procedural complications, nervous system disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. No serious adverse event occurring between Dose 1 and 2 or reported after the second dose were assessed by neither the investigator nor the sponsor to be related to the study vaccine.

No death was reported during the course of the study.

## Discussion on safety

The CHMP considered that the safety profile is comparable across the different age groups following the first and second vaccination with ProQuad, indicating that in principle no safety concern is anticipated by vaccinating children from 9 months of age onwards with M-M-RVAXPRO.

## Pharmacovigilance plan and Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The elements of the proposed risk management plan (RMP) are consistent with the recommendations made in the ICH E2E Guideline on Pharmacovigilance and the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for Human Use (November 20, 2005). The CHMP considered that the structure of the RMP was satisfactory, and the current version follows the current template for EU RMP.

## Changes to the Product Information

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH.

## Summary of Product Characteristics

## Section 4.2 - Posology and method of administration

The  initially  proposed  posology  information  was  revised  to  include  all  new  information  in  one  subsection  'Infants  between  9  and  12  months  of  age'  and  to  clearly  state  that  such  infants  should  be revaccinated  at  12  to  15  months.  An  additional  dose  with  a  measles-containing  vaccine  should  be considered  according  to  official  recommendations  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.1).  This  sub-section  was further revised to enhance readability.

## Section 5.1 - Pharmacodynamic properties

This section was revised to include the seroprotection rates to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 6 Weeks Post-Dose 1 and 6 Weeks Post-Dose 2 by age group in a table, and to reflect the safety data from the trial.

The PL was updated accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

The immunogenicity data from study MRV02C investigating a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (MMRV with rHA) in different age groups support the extension of the age indication of M-M-RVAXPRO to children 9 months of age under special circumstances, i.e. outbreak control. The CHMP noted further that vaccination of infants at 9 months of age results however in lower antibody responses especially as regards measles. The lower antibody responses were considered to likely be due to interfering preexisting maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune response of these children. Therefore additional vaccine doses are warranted later on in life for this population. As regards safety the incidence and intensity of adverse reactions was comparable in infants 9 months of age with infants 12 months of age. The CHMP agreed that the Product Information was updated accordingly.

Taken together, the data on immunogenicity and safety are supporting a positive benefit/risk balance in the populations reflected in the new indication as outlined below:

M-M-RVAXPRO is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella in individuals 12 months or older (see section 4.2).

M-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

For use in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or, for use in previously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1.'

## 4 Conclusion

On 22 July 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet.
