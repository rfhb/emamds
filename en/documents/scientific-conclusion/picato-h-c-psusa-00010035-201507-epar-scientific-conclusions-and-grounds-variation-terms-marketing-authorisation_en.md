## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for ingenol mebutate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Following  a  cumulative  review,  cases  strongly  suggestive  of  hypersensitivity  to  ingenol  mebutate, including  cases  with  features  of  angioedema,  have  been  documented.  It  is  considered  that  the product information should be updated to add hypersensitivity including angioedema.

Furthermore, following reports of chemical conjunctivitis and corneal burns on inadvertent contact of ingenol mebutate with the eyes, the product information should be updated to provide prescribers and patients with warnings regarding this risk. In addition, post-marketing reports of pigmentation change following use of ingenol mebutate have been  received,  including  both  hypo-  and  hyperpigmentation.  In  some  cases  the  changes  remain unresolved more than one year after treatment. Following a cumulative review by the MAH, the PRAC agreed that the product information should be updated to add this adverse event. Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considers that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing ingenol mebutate are warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ingenol mebutate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing ingenol mebutate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
