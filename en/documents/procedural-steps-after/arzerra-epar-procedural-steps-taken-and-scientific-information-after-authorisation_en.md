Update to the section 4.5 of the SmPC based on results from clinical study OMB11360 investigating pharmacokinetic interactions between ofatumumab and bendamustine.

Updates to sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC were made to simplify them and ease their understanding. Editorial updates were made to sections 4.4 and 4.8.

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to combine the SmPCs of the different strengths (100 mg and 1000 mg concentrate for solution for infusion), to introduce editorial changes and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10. In addition, the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet has been updated.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add a recommendation to permanently discontinue Arzerra in case of anaphylactic reaction and revise the adverse drug reaction profile based on cumulative safety pool data analysis from clinical trials, the company safety database and updated company core data sheet.

Ofatumumab may cause foetal B-cell depletion based on findings from animal studies and on its mechanism of action. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women to inform a product-associated risk. No teratogenicity or maternal toxicity were observed in an animal reproduction study with administration of in utero should be avoided until B-cell recovery occurs.

Administration of live vaccines to neonates and infants exposed to ofatumumab preclinical safety section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated to reflect data on embryofoetal development in cynomolgus monkeys.

Results from clinical study OMB157D2101 (OMB113603) showed no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between ofatumumab and bendamustine.

Arzerra should be immediately and permanently discontinued in patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction to the medicinal product and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. Section 4.8 has been revised to update the adverse drug reaction profile: to add 'progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy' with frequency 'uncommon'. As a serious condition, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is already included in the 'Special warnings and precautions for use' Section of the SmPC. The following adverse drug reactions were also added: 'headache' and 'infusion-related reactions' with frequency

Patients with active/current hepatitis B infection should not be treated with ofatumumab. For patients with positive hepatitis B serology (but no active/current disease), a liver disease expert should be consulted regarding monitoring and initiation of HBV antiviral therapy. In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving ofatumumab, ofatumumab and any concomitant chemotherapy should be interrupted immediately, and appropriate treatment instituted. authorised |

As anaphylactic reactions are a type of infusion reactions, adequate information on the prevention and handling of such events was already included in the 'Special warnings and precautions for use' and the 'Undesirable effects' sections of the SmPC. authorised   |

| II/0009   | To update section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding potential Hepatitis B reactivation. The MAH took the opportunity to amend a subheading in section 4.6 of the SmPC according to the QRD template as requested by the CHMP in conclusion to the assessment of PSUR 2 (PSU 009) and further amendments to the wording of this section of the SmPC were made. Finally the MAH took the opportunity to make minor changes in the Labelling. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- product | 17/11/2011   | 22/12/2011 no | SmPC and Labelling longer | Following a post-marketing report of Hepatitis B reactivation in the course of Arzerra treament, which was not thought to be connected to the medicine, the existing warning that Hepatitis B infection can occur in the course of treatment was amended to also warn against Hepatitis B reactivation during treatment with Arzerra. This was also due to the fact that such reactivation is known to occur with other medicines with the same mechanism of action.                                                                                                                                                  |
