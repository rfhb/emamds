Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 2 September 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Sephience, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The data from PTC923-PKU-301 study has impact on the benefit/risk profile of Sephience™ ( c ) labelling. Information of this study should be added to section 5.1 of the SmPC as it is supportive of the efficacy in the target population.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study PTC923-PKU-301, 'A Phase 3, Randomized, Crossover, Open-Label, ActiveControlled Study of Sepiapterin versus Sapropterin in Participants With Phenylketonuria Greater Than or Equal to 2 Years of Age' is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Sepiapterin Powder for Oral Use is a powder for oral use with a yellow to orange colour and intended to be mixed with water, apple juice, or small amount of soft food such as apple sauce and jams prior to administration. Dosing of sepiapterin is based on age and participant body weight.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for:

- PTC923-PKU-301,  'A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Crossover,  Open-Label,  Active-Controlled  Study  of Sepiapterin versus Sapropterin in Participants With Phenylketonuria Greater Than or Equal to 2 Years of Age'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

PTC923-PKU-301, 'A Phase 3, Randomized, Crossover, Open-Label, Active-Controlled Study of Sepiapterin versus Sapropterin in Participants With Phenylketonuria Greater Than or Equal to 2 Years of Age'

## Description

Study  301  was  a  Phase  3,  2-part,  open-label,  randomised,  active-controlled  crossover  study  of sepiapterin versus sapropterin in participants with PKU aged ≥2 years. Participants with biochemically diagnosed classic PKU were eligible, but enrollment in this group was capped at 30% of the total study population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After providing consent and/or assent (as applicable), participants entered the Screening/Washout/Dietary Control Observation Period (up to 45 days in duration). Participants who were  receiving  exogenous  tetrahydrobiopterin  supplementation  (i.e.,  sapropterin  [KUVAN®])  at  the Screening Visit completed a 7-day washout period. During the 24- to 30-day Dietary Control Observation Period, participants continued their usual diet, with no change in total protein, non-Phe protein from medical formula, or daily Phe consumption, and maintained a weekly 3-day diet record for 4 consecutive weeks.  Participants  with  a  &gt;20%  variance  in  dietary  Phe  consumption  during  the  Dietary  Control Observation Period were considered screen failures. Eligible participants entered Part 1 at the end of the Dietary Control Observation Period. Throughout the study, participants continued their usual diet without modification  (i.e.,  no  change  in  total  protein,  non-Phe  protein  from  medical  formula,  or  dietary  Phe consumption).

Part 1 consisted of an open-label assessment of responsiveness to sepiapterin wherein all participants received 14 days of oral sepiapterin treatment. Participants who experienced a ≥20% reduction in blood Phe levels were classified as responsive and progressed to Part 2. Nonresponsive participants did not enter Part 2 of the study.

Part 2 was a 2-period crossover study wherein each participant was randomised 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: 20 mg/kg sapropterin-60 mg/kg sepiapterin (Sequence 1) or 60 mg/kg sepiapterin-20 mg/kg sapropterin (Sequence 2). Randomisation was stratified based on mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels from Part 1 (i.e. , participants with mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥20% to &lt;30% and participants with mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥30%). Participants received each open -label treatment for 4 weeks. Each 4-week treatment period was followed by a 14-day washout.

After completing the study, eligible participants had the option to continue treatment in an open-label Study PTC923-MD-004-PKU.

## Methods

## Study participants

Planned:

- Part 1: approximately 100 participants
- Part 2: 42 participants analysed:
- Part 1: 82 participants enrolled and treated with sepiapterin
- Part 2: 62 participants randomized and treated (30 participants to Sequence 1 sapropterin/sepiapterin] and 32 participants to Sequence 2 [sepiapterin/sapropterin])

This study enrolled male and female participants aged ≥2 years with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of PKU. Participants were required to have had blood Phe levels ≥360 μmol/L while on current therapy at any time during Screening or when taking the average of the 3 most recent Phe levels from the participant's medical history (inclusive of the Screening value). Enrolment of participants with biochemically defined classic PKU was capped at 30% of the total study population.

## Treatments

Part 1 All participants received sepiapterin 60 mg/kg for 14 days starting on Day 1. Part 2 Participants who experienced a ≥20% reduction in blood Phe following therapy were classified as responsive and were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences:

- Sequence 1: Sapropterin 20 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks followed by sepiapterin 60 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks (each treatment period followed by a 14-day [+3-day window] washout period)
- Sequence 2: Sepiapterin 60 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks followed by sapropterin 20 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks (each treatment period followed by a 14-day [+3-day window] washout period)

## Duration of Treatment:

Observation Period: 24 to 30 days

Part 1: 28 to 35 days

Part 2: 84 days

## Objective(s)

## Primary:

- To compare the efficacy of sepiapterin to sapropterin in reducing blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in participants with phenylketonuria (PKU)

## Secondary:

- To evaluate the efficacy of sepiapterin in reducing blood Phe levels
- To assess the safety and tolerability of sepiapterin

## Exploratory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To evaluate changes in blood tyrosine (Tyr) over time, including the Phe:Tyr ratio
- To assess the taste, palatability, and acceptability (&lt;18 years) of sepiapterin
- To evaluate sepiapterin effect  on  quality  of  life  (QOL)  using  the  Phenylketonuria  Quality  of  Life questionnaire (PKU-QOL) in the subset of participants who are able to complete the PKU-QOL (ie, participants  whose  primary  language  is  English,  Turkish,  Dutch,  German,  Spanish,  Italian, Portuguese, or French) (ages 6 to 8 years, Parent PKU-QOL; ages 9 to 11 years, Child PKU-QOL; ages 12 to 17 years Adolescent PKUQOL; and ages ≥18 years Adult PKU -QOL)
- To evaluate sepiapterin effect of QOL using the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-Y Proxy Version 1 [3 to 7 years]; EQ-5D-Y [8 to 15 years]; and EQ 5D5L ([≥16 years])

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in blood Phe level from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 of each treatment period (the average of the last 2 weeks of each treatment period) in Part 2.

The primary analysis was performed on Primary Analysis Set (PAS), which was defined as the stratum of participants with a mean percent reduction in Phe level of ≥30% during Part 1.

## Secondary

- Proportion of participants with baseline blood Phe levels ≥600 µmol/L who achieve Phe levels &lt;600 µmol/L after each treatment period in Part 2
- Proportion of participants reaching blood Phe &lt;360 µmol/L after each treatment period in Part 2
- Adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and routine clinical laboratory assessments

## Exploratory

- Changes in blood Tyr over time, including the Phe:Tyr ratio
- Taste, palatability, and acceptability scores (&lt;18 years)
- Changes from baseline in QOL using PKU-QOL questionnaire in the subset of participants that are able to complete the PKU-QOL (ie, participants whose primary language is English, Turkish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or French) (ages 6 to 8 years, Parent PKU-QOL; ages 9 to 11 years, Child PKU-QOL; ages 12 to 17 years, Adolescent PKUQOL; and ages ≥18 years Adult PKU-QOL)
- Changes from baseline in QOL using the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-Y Proxy Version 1 [3 to 7 years]; EQ-5D-Y [8 to 15 years]; and EQ-5D5L ([≥16 years])

## Sample size

82 patients were enrolled in the study.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Statistical Methods

The following datasets were defined for this study:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Primary  Analysis  Set  (PAS):  All  participants  who  achieved  a  ≥30%  reduction  in  blood  Phe concentrations in Part 1, were randomized, and took at least 1 dose of study drug in Part 2 were included in the PAS. Participants were analysed according to their randomized treatment.
- Full Analysis Set (FAS): All participants who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study drug in  Part  2  were  included  in  the  FAS.  Participants  were  analysed  according  to  their  randomized treatment. All efficacy analyses were based on the FAS.
- Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: The PP Analysis Set included all participants in the FAS who met the study eligibility requirements and had no major protocol deviations that affected the validity of the efficacy measurements. The PP Analysis Set was used for sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. The criteria for inclusion in the PP Analysis Set were detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and finalized prior to study unblinding.
- Safety Analysis Set: All participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, including during Part 1, were included in the Safety Analysis Set. Participants were analysed according to actual treatment received.

Primary Efficacy Analysis: The primary endpoint was the mean change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 of each treatment period (the average of the last 2 weeks of each treatment period) in Part 2, with baseline defined as the average of Day -1 and Day 1 predose blood Phe concentration of each respective treatment period in Part 2. Phe level after each treatment period refers to the average of blood Phe concentration collected during the Week 3-4 analysis visit window of each treatment period. Mean level at Weeks 3 and 4 was calculated as the average of blood Phe concentration collected during the Week 3-4 analysis visit window of each treatment period. The null hypothesis was that the mean change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 was the same between sepiapterin and sapropterin, versus the alternative that they were different, at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. For the primary efficacy endpoint, a gatekeeping procedure was used to control the familywise error rate. The stratum of participants with mean percent reduction in Phe leve l of ≥30% durin g Part 1 (i.e., PAS) was tested at the significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). If p was &lt;0.05, then the study was to be declared positive;  otherwise,  the  study  would  be  declared  negative.  Only  if  the  test  based  on  the  PAS  was statistically significant at the 0.05 level would the FAS be tested, also at the 0.05 significance level. A mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model was fitted on the calculated mean change in blood Phe from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 of each treatment period in Part 2 for each participant. The model included fixed effects for treatment group, sequence, period, visit (Weeks 1 and 2 and Weeks 3 and 4), treatment-by-visit interaction, and the baseline blood Phe (for each period) as a covariate. In addition, participant nested within sequence was included as a random effect. The MMRM model was used on available data assuming the missing assessments were missing at random; no explicit imputation was involved. An unstructured within-participant covariance structure was assumed. If the model did not converge  under  the  unstructured  covariance  matrix,  the  following  covariance  structures  were  to  be employed  in  order  until  convergence  is  reached:  heterogeneous  Toeplitz,  heterogeneous  Compound Symmetry, heterogeneous first-order autoregressive, Toeplitz, Compound Symmetry, and first-order autoregressive. The least squares (LS) mean estimate for the change in blood Phe levels from baseline to  Weeks  3  and  4  was  used  to  perform  treatment  group  comparisons.  For  the  analysis  on  FAS,  an additional fixed-eff ect term, the randomization stratum (mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥20% to &lt;30% or ≥30% in Part 1), was included in the model.

The following sensitivity analyses were performed:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. The MMRM model described above for the primary endpoint on the FAS was also performed on the PP Analysis Set.

2. Completer analysis with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model: only the completers who had the assessments at Weeks 3 and 4 in each period of Part 2 were included in the ANCOVA model.

For the analysis on PAS, the model included fixed effects for treatment group, sequence, and period; the baseline blood Phe (for each period) was used as a covariate. The randomization stratum was also added to the analysis on FAS.

The following subgroup analyses were performed for the change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 for both PAS and FAS:

- Sex (male, female)
- Age: ( &lt;18 years, ≥18 years; 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, 12 to 18 years, ≥18 years)
- Response to sapropterin challenge (yes, no)
- Participants who were receiving supplementation treatment (pegvaliase pqpz, sapropterin, or none) at study entry
- Classic PKU (yes, no)
- Baseline  Phe  level  of  Part  2 (≥600  μmol/L,  &lt;600μmol/L;  ≥ 360 μmol/L,  &lt; 360 μmol/L;  ≥ 120 μmol/L, &lt; 120 μmol/L )

(the protocol includes statistical plan for secondary endpoints)

## Results

## Participant flow

Eighty-two participants were tested for responsiveness in Part 1. Of those 82 participants, 67 participants (81.7%) demonstrated a ≥20% reduction in blood Phe in response to sepiapterin during Part 1. Five of these 67 participants were not randomised to Part 2 because it was discovered that these participants did not meet the study eligibility criteria.

Thus,  62  participants  were  randomised  to  receive  either  Sequence  1  (sapropterin-sepiapterin) (subsample size [n]=30) or Sequence 2 (sepiapterin-sapropterin) (n=32) during Part 2.

## Recruitment

## Baseline data

The median age of the Part 2 participants (i.e., the PAS) at Screening was 14.0 years (range: 2 to 66 years) with the majority (79.0%) of the study population being children or adolescents (&lt;18 years). In terms of race, participants were predominantly white (85.5%). Relatively equal proportions of men and women were enrolled in Part 2 of the study. Most (96.8%) participants in Part 2 had PKU diagnosed at newborn screening, and the majority (83.9%) presented with phenotypically defined non-classic PKU. In Part 2, disease characteristics were similar between participants in Sequence 1 and Sequence 2.

## Number analysed

## Efficacy results

## Part 1

In Part 1, 70 of 82 participants (85.4%) achieved a Phe value &lt; 6 00 μmol/L, 56 of 82 participants (68.3%) achieved a Phe value &lt; 360 μmol/L, and 6 of 82 participants (7.3%) achieved a Phe value &lt; 120 μmol/L at Weeks 1 and 2.

For the 38 participants who were on sapropterin at study enrolment, blood Phe decreased by 449.8 μmol/L from a mean baseline of 766.9 μmol/L to a mean of 317.2 μmol/L at Weeks 1 and 2. This change represents a 54.1% decrease in blood Phe from baseline after only 2 weeks of sepiapterin treatment. Among  these  participants,  27  (71.1%)  participants  achieved  a  blood  Phe  of  &lt; 360  μmol/L  and  35 (92.1%) participants achieved a blood Phe &lt;600 μmol/L at Weeks 1 and 2 of Part 1.

## Part 2

In the PAS, mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline blood Phe concentrations for participants entering treatment  were  790.4  μmol/L  (370.01)  and  725.8  μmol/L  (302.09)  for  sapropterin  and  sepiapterin, respectively. Least square (LS) mean (SE) changes from baseline in blood Phe concentrations were 256.6 μmol/L (28.22) and -437.0 μmol/L (27.95) for sapropterin and sepiapterin, respectively. The LS

mean difference between sepiapterin and sapropterin was 180.4 μmol/L, p &lt; 0.0001, indicating that sepiapterin was superior to sapropterin at lowering blood Phe in patients with PKU.

The same test was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which was defined as all participants who were  randomised  and  took  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug  in  Part  2.  Sepiapterin  had  a  statistically significant (p&lt; 0.0001) greater treatment effect than sapropterin on mean change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 when the analysis was repeated on the FAS.

Results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  (sex,  age  group,  response  to  sapropterin  challenge,  participants receiving sapropterin supplementation at study entry, biochemically diagnosed classic PKU, baseline Phe level of Part 2) on the primary efficacy endpoint were generally consistent with the results of the primary analysis showing treatment benefit favouring sepiapterin relative to sapropterin across all subgroups.

Across all secondary efficacy endpoints, sepiapterin 60 mg/kg had a statistically significant treatment effect  that  was  superior  to  sapropterin  20  mg/kg.  Treatment  with  sepiapterin  60  mg/kg  resulted  in consistently greater proportions of participants in the PAS who achieved reductions in Phe levels &lt;120, &lt;3 60, &lt;600 μmol/L compared with sapropterin 20 mg/kg. At Weeks 3 and 4 in Part 2, the proportion of participants treated with sepiapterin achieving a Phe level &lt;120, &lt;360, &lt;600 μmol/L was 6.9%, 72.4%, and 89.7% versus 1.8%, 44.6%, and 64.3% in the sapropterin group.

The proportion of participants with baseline Phe ≥600 μmol/L who achieved Phe levels &lt;600 μmol /L in Part 2 was significantly greater (p=0.0028) following treatment with sepiapterin (89.2%) compared with sapropterin (51.3%) in the PAS. Similar results were observed when the analysis was repeated on the FAS.

Among participants who were ≥12 years in the stratum of participants with a baseline blood Phe of ≥600 μmol/L,  a  statistically  significantly  greater  proportion  of  participants  achieved  the  age -appropriate European target blood Phe level of &lt;600 μmol/L at Weeks 3 and 4 with sepiapterin (88.5%) versus sapropterin (44.0%) in the PAS and FAS.

The proportion of participants with baseline Phe ≥360 μmol/L in the PAS who achieved Phe levels &lt; 360 μmol/L  in  Part  2  was  significantly  greater  (p=0.0048)  following  treatment  with  sepiapterin  (69.2%) compared with sapropterin (39.2%) in the PAS. Consistent results were observed when the analysis was repeated on the FAS.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 EMADOC-1700519818-2426689

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the subset of participants &lt;12 years of age who had a baseline blood Phe of ≥360 μmol/L, a greater proportion of participants who were treated with sepiapterin achieved the age-appropriate European target blood Phe level of &lt;360 μmol/L at Weeks 3 and 4 compared with sapropterin treatment (76.5% versus 47.4%, respectively). The treatment difference favouring sepiapterin was numerically superior, approaching statistical significance (p=0.0594) in the PAS and the FAS.

The proportion of participants with baseline Phe ≥120 μmol/L who achieved Phe levels &lt;120 μmol/L in Part 2 was greater following treatment with sepiapterin (6.9%) compared with sapropterin (1.8%) in the PAS,  but  the  p  value  was  not  estimable.  Consistent  results  were  observed  when  the  analysis  was repeated on the FAS.

The Phe:Tyr concentration ratio followed a similar pattern of change as blood Phe after treatment with sepiapterin and sapropterin. Both treatments elicited a rapid reduction in the Phe:Tyr ratio from baseline that was sustained throughout the 28-day treatment period, but sepiapterin had a more profound effect. The Phe:Tyr ratio was approximately 17 at baseline and decreased by a mean of -10.1 after 28 days of sepiapterin treatment compared with -5.7 with 28 days of sapropterin treatment. Minimal changes in blood Tyr concentration were observed in Part 1 or Part 2.

Palatability of sepiapterin was favourable in 5 (83.3%) of 6 participants &lt;5 years of age, and taste was rated as 'good' or 'really good' in more than half of the participants of ≥5 to &lt; 18 years of age (39/60 [65%]).  Acceptability  or  ease  of  administration  of  the  first  dose  of  sepiapterin  was  considered unfavourable  or  difficult  by  22  (88%)  of  25  parents  or  caregivers  of  children  &lt;12  years  of  age. Considering acceptability was assessed at the first dose only, in young children, ease of administration of  drug  product  is  expected  to  improve  with  repeat  dosing,  and  there  were  no  participants  who discontinued from the study due to difficulty in administering the study drug.

## Safety results

All participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, including during Part 1, were included in the Safety Analysis Set.

There were no unanticipated safety findings in this study. Sepiapterin 60 mg/kg/day was well tolerated in this study population of participants with PKU ≥2 years of age.

There were no deaths, serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), or discontinuations due to TEAEs in the study. The majority of TEAEs were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity. No severe (Grade 3) TEAEs were considered related to study drug in either part of the study.

In Part 1, 44 participants (53.7%) had at least 1 TEAE, and 17 participants (20.7%) had at least 1 treatment-related TEAE. The most frequent treatment-related TEAEs by System Organ Class (SOC) were diarrhoea (5 participants [6.1%]), abdominal pain (3 participants [3.7%]), and headache (3 participants [3.7%]).

In  Part  2,  41  participants  (66.1%)  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  while  receiving  sepiapterin,  and  37 participants  (61.7%)  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  while  receiving  sapropterin.  The  most  frequent treatment-related TEAEs  by  SOC  during  sepiapterin treatment were  Gastrointestinal disorders (sepiapterin  11.3%,  sapropterin  1.7%).  The  most  frequent  treatment-related  TEAEs  by  SOC  during sapropterin treatment were nervous system disorders (sepiapterin 1.6%, sapropterin 3.3%). Treatmentemergent adverse events prefer red terms reported in ≥5% of participants during sepiapterin treatment and  at  rates  of  at  least  2%  higher  compared  with  during  sapropterin  treatment  were  diarrhoea (sepiapterin  9.7%,  sapropterin  1.7%)  and  nausea  (sepiapterin  9.7%,  sapropterin  3.3%),  which  are consistent with the known safety profile of sepiapterin. Treatment emergent adverse events preferred

terms reported in ≥5% of participants during sapropterin treatment and at higher rates compared with during  sepiapterin  treatment  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (sepiapterin  12.9%,  sapropterin 15.0%) and headache (sepiapterin 8.1%, sapropterin 13.3%), which are consistent with the known safety profile of sapropterin.

Clinical laboratory values were generally stable and within the normal range throughout Part 1 and Part 2. There were no participants with any postbaseline abnormal liver function results meeting the criteria of Hy's Law. All abnormal electrocardiogram results were not clinically significant, and the proportion of abnormal not clinically significant results was similar between the sepiapterin and sapropterin treatment periods.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study 301 was designed to demonstrate superiority of sepiapterin treatment over sapropterin treatment in patients with PKU aged ≥2 years. Results of this study showed that sepiapterin imparted clinically significant and highly statistically significant greater magnitude of mean blood Phe reduction compared with sapropterin in patients with PKU ≥2 years of age. By Day 28 of treatment, the LS mean change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Weeks 3 and 4 was 437.0 μmol/L with sepiapterin and -256.6 μmol/L wi th sapropterin for an LS mean treatment difference of 180.4 μmol/L (p &lt;0.0001).

The superior treatment benefit of sepiapterin relative to sapropterin was demonstrated across all subgroups, including subpopulations nonresponsive to sapropterin therapy and those with classic PKU, supporting its use in a broad patient population. Considering the study population comprised a larger proportion of patients who were responsive to sapropterin (&gt;50%) than typically observed in clinical practice, the treatment difference measured in this study likely underestimates what may be observed in a general population, including patients who are treatment-naive. The substantial reduction in Phe level with sepiapterin treatment allowed a greater proportion of participants to achieve the targeted European guidelines ( &lt;600 μmol/L in participants ≥12 years of age) for blood Phe levels in PKU compared with sapropterin. Among participants who were ≥12 years in the stratum of participants with a baseline blood Phe of ≥600 μmol/L, a statistically significantly greater propor tion of participants achieved the target blood Phe level of &lt;600 μmol/L at Weeks 3 and 4 with sepiapterin (88.5%) versus sapropterin (44.0%).

There were no unanticipated safety findings in this study. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity and consistent with the known safety profiles of both sepiapterin and sapropterin. Data from this study indicate consistency of the safety pr ofile of sepiapterin in children ≥2 years of age with that of adults with PKU in Studies PTC923-MD-003-PKU and PTC923-MD-004-PKU. The data from Study 301 has no impact on the benefit/risk profile of Sephience™ (c) labelling; therefore, no changes were proposed to the current approved sepiapterin Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The study provides further insight on the response to Sephience (sepiapterin) in different subgroups, including subpopulations non-responsive to sapropterin therapy and those with classic PKU, supporting its use in a broad patient population. No new safety data was generated.

The results obtained from Study 301 indicate that its primary endpoint was met. It was demonstrated that sepiapterin treatment is superior to sapropterin treatment in patients with PKU above 2 years with statistically significant reduction of the mean blood Phe by day 28 in all subgroups studied, including patients  that  were  reported  as  non-responsive  to  sapropterin  (&gt;  50%  population  of  the  study)  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients treatment-naïve as well as patients with different Phe values at baseline (≥600 μmol/L, Phe ≥360 μmol/L,  and  Phe  ≥120  μmol/L).  The  reduction  in  plasma  Phe  levels  was  accompanied  by  a n increase in Phe:Tyr ratio that was maintained during the 28-day treatment. This has been along with a favourable acceptability of the treatment and not compromising safety. Facing this, it is not agreed with the MAH in that the data from Study 301 has no impact on the benefit/risk profile of Sephience ( c ) labelling.  Information  of  this  study  should  be  added  to  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  as  it  is  considered supportive of the efficacy in the target population and of relevance to the prescriber.

## Fulfilled:

In view of the available data regarding Study 301 the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions. The scope of the variation should be the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC as information of the outcome of Study 301 is considered supportive of the efficacy in the target population and of relevance to the prescriber.
