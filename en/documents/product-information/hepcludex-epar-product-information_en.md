## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

HEPCLUDEX 2 mg powder for solution for injection

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each vial contains bulevirtide acetate equivalent to 2 mg bulevirtide.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder for solution for injection (powder for injection).

The powder is white to off-white.

After reconstitution, solution with a pH of approximately 9.0 and osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Hepcludex is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in plasma (or serum) HDV-RNA positive adult and paediatric patients 3 years of age and older weighing at least 10 kg with compensated liver disease.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated only by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with HDV infection.

## Posology

Bulevirtide should be administered once daily (every 24 hours ± 4 hours) by subcutaneous injection as monotherapy  or  in co-administration with a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue for treatment of underlying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

The recommended dose of bulevirtide in adult patients is 2 mg once daily.

The recommended dose of bulevirtide in paediatric patients is based on weight as detailed in the Table below.

Dosing for paediatric patients using bulevirtide 2 mg powder for solution for injection

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Body Weight (kg)   | Dosing of reconstituted bulevirtide 2 mg powder for solution for injection (ml)   | Bulevirtide Daily Dose   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 35 kg and above    | 1 ml                                                                              | 2 mg                     |

Concerning co-administration with nucleoside-nucleotide analogues for treatment of HBV infection, refer to section 4.4.

## Duration of treatment

The optimal treatment duration is unknown. Treatment should be continued as long as associated with clinical benefit.

Consideration to discontinue the treatment should be given in case of sustained (6 months) HBsAg seroconversion or loss of virological and biochemical response.

## Missed doses

If an injection has been omitted and less than 4 hours have elapsed since the scheduled time, the injection must be performed as soon as possible. The time of the next injection will not be calculated from the time of the \"rescue\" injection, but according to the injection schedule previously established. It is, therefore, necessary to return to the usual pattern of administration, at the appointed time, the following day.

If an injection has been missed and more than 4 hours have elapsed since the scheduled time, the missed dose should not be administered.

The next injection will take place according to the usual schedule (injection of the prescribed dose without doubling), at the appointed time the next day.

If the injection has been made by mistake more than 4 hours after the scheduled time, the next administration must take place in the usual way (i.e. in accordance with the original schedule).

## Special populations

## Elderly

No data is available in patients &gt; 65 years.

## Renal impairment

No studies have been conducted with bulevirtide in patients with renal impairment.

Renal function should be carefully monitored. Elevation of bile salts may occur during treatment. Due to renal excretion of bile salts, elevation of bile salts may be greater in patients with renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte class A). The safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not been established (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in patients younger than 18 years of age have not been established in clinical studies. The recommended dosage of bulevirtide for paediatric patients 3 years of age and older weighing at least 10 kg with compensated liver disease is based on population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2).

## Method of administration

For subcutaneous use only. Bulevirtide may be injected into sites such as the upper thigh, or abdomen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Appropriate training should be given to the patients self-administering the product or to the caregivers administering the product to minimise the risk of the injection site reactions.

The 'Step-by-step injection guide', provided in the carton, must be followed carefully by the patient or the caregiver.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## HDV and HBV genotype

HDV genotype 1 was predominant in the clinical trials population. It is not known whether HDV or HBV genotype affects the clinical efficacy of bulevirtide.

## Decompensated liver disease

The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in patients with decompensated cirrhosis has not been established. The use in patients with decompensated liver disease is not recommended.

## Co-infection with HBV

The underlying HBV infection should be simultaneously managed according to current treatment guidelines. In the clinical study of bulevirtide MYR202, only patients with signs of active hepatitis despite nucleoside/nucleotide analogue treatment were included; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was coadministered with bulevirtide. Close monitoring of HBV-DNA levels is recommended.

## Hepatitis exacerbations after treatment cessation

Discontinuation of treatment with bulevirtide can lead to reactivation of HDV and HBV infections and exacerbation of hepatitis. In case of treatment discontinuation, careful monitoring of liver function tests including transaminase levels, as well as HBV DNA and HDV RNA viral load should be performed.

## Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)

No data are available from HIV or HCV co-infected patients.

## Excipients

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially \"sodium-free\".

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro , it has been shown, that certain medicinal products can inhibit bulevirtide target sodiumtaurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). The co-administration of such medicinal products (e.g. sulfasalazin, irbesartan, ezetimibe, ritonavir, and ciclosporin A) is not recommended.

As a precautionary measure, close clinical monitoring is warranted when NTCP substrates (e.g. estrone-3-sulfate, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and thyroid

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hormones) are co-administered with bulevirtide. When possible, co-administration of these substrates should be avoided.

In vitro an inhibition of OATP1B1/3 transporters by bulevirtide was observed, albeit only at a concentration ≥ 0.5 µM, which is only reached in vivo after administration of high bulevirtide doses (10 mg subcutaneous). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. As a precautionary measure, close clinical monitoring is warranted when OATP1B1/3 substrates (e.g. atorvastatin, bosentan, docetaxel, fexofenadine, glecaprevir, glyburide (glibenclamide), grazoprevir, nateglinide, paclitaxel, paritaprevir, pitavastatin, pravastatin, repaglinide, rosuvastatin, simeprevir, simvastatin, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, voxilaprevir) are co-administered. When possible, coadministration of these substrates should be avoided.

In a clinical study in healthy subjects, co-administration of tenofovir and bulevirtide revealed no impact on tenofovir pharmacokinetics.

No CYP inhibition by bulevirtide was observed in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. However, in a clinical study, an approximately 40% increase in geometric mean of partial AUC2-4h values of co-administered midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) was observed in combination of high dose bulevirtide (10 mg) and tenofovir (245 mg), whereas no significant influence on midazolam AUC2-4h was detected for tenofovir alone. As a precautionary measure, close clinical monitoring is warranted for co-administered narrow-therapeutic-index drugs which are sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. cyclosporine, carbamazepine, simvastatin, sirolimus, and tacrolimus).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of bulevirtide in pregnant women.

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.

As a precautious measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of bulevirtide during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It  is  unknown  whether  bulevirtide  is  excreted  in  human  milk.  Therefore,  a  decision  must  be  made whether  to  discontinue  breast-feeding  or  to  discontinue  /  abstain  from  treatment  with  bulevirtide, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of bulevirtide on fertility are available. In animal studies, no effects of bulevirtide on male or female mating and fertility were noted.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The product has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with bulevirtide (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are increase in bile salts (very common), headache (very common), pruritus (very common) and injection site reactions (very common). Increases in bile salts were usually asymptomatic and reversible upon treatment discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction is an exacerbation of hepatitis after discontinuation of bulevirtide, possibly related to virologic rebound after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Total Bile Salts Increased

Asymptomatic bile salt elevations, associated with the mechanism of action of bulevirtide, were very commonly observed in clinical studies of bulevirtide; the bile salt elevations resolved upon discontinuation of bulevirtide treatment.

Due to renal excretion of bile salts, elevation of bile salts may be greater in patients with renal impairment.

There are no data available on the long-term impact (&gt; 96 weeks) of this bile salt increase induced by bulevirtide.

## Injection Site Reactions

Bulevirtide is intended for subcutaneous injection which is associated with risks for injection site reactions including swelling, redness, irritation, itchiness, infection, haematoma, rash, induration and local pain. These local reactions are more likely to appear if the injection is accidentally misplaced or the solution is accidentally misdirected to the soft tissue.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Eosinophilia

Increases in eosinophil counts were commonly observed in patients receiving bulevirtide treatment; there were no associated clinical sequelae, hepatic adverse reactions, or significant liver-related laboratory abnormalities.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are no data on human overdose with bulevirtide. If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity and given standard supportive treatment as necessary.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals. ATC code: J05AX28

## Mechanism of action

Bulevirtide blocks the entry of HBV and HDV into hepatocytes by binding to and inactivating NTCP, a bile salt liver transporter serving as essential HBV/HDV entry receptor.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The clinical efficacy and safety of bulevirtide was investigated in one Phase 3 study and two Phase 2 studies. Patients with chronic HDV infection and active hepatitis were included. The population of these three studies was mainly Caucasian, HDV genotype 1 was predominant.

## MYR301 study

In Study 301, 100 of 150 patients with chronic HDV infection were randomised to receive immediate treatment with once daily bulevirtide 2 mg (N=49) or to have treatment delayed for 48 weeks (N=51). Randomisation was stratified by the presence or absence of compensated cirrhosis.

Of the 49 patients in the immediate treatment group, mean age was 44 years; 61% were male, 84% were White, and 16% were Asian. Of the 51 patients in the delayed treatment group, mean age was 41 years; 51% were male, 78% were White and 22% were Asian. All 100 patients had infection with HDV genotype 1.

Baseline characteristics were balanced among the immediate and delayed treatment groups. Of the patients who received 2 mg bulevirtide at baseline, mean plasma HDV RNA was 5.1 log10 IU/mL, mean ALT was 108 U/L, 47% of patients had a history of cirrhosis, and 53% were interferon experienced. During the study (through Week 48), 63% of these patients, received concomitant therapy according to the standard care for their underlying HBV infection: the most common concomitant medications were tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing or tenofovir alafenamidecontaining products (49%) and entecavir (14%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The table below presents the virologic and biochemical outcomes for immediate treatment with bulevirtide 2 mg once daily and delayed treatment at Week 48.

## MYR202 study

In Study MYR202, 56 of 118 patients with chronic HDV infection and ongoing viral replication who were interferon experienced, had a contraindication to interferon, or were cirrhotic, were randomised to receive bulevirtide 2 mg + TDF (N=28) or TDF alone (N=28) for 24 weeks. At Week 24, 21% of patients in the bulevirtide 2 mg + TDF group achieved a combined response, 54% achieved undetectable HDV RNA (defined as &lt; limit of detection [LOD], where LOD was 14 IU/mL) or decrease by ≥ 2 log 10  IU/mL, and 43% achieved ALT normalisation. At Week 24, no patients in the TDF group achieved a combined response, 4% achieved undetectable HDV RNA or decrease in HDV RNA by ≥ 2 log 10 IU/mL, and 7% achieved ALT normalisation (normal ALT was defined as ≤ 31 U/L for females and ≤ 41 U/L for males).

## MYR203 study

In Study MYR203, a total of 15 patients were treated with bulevirtide 2 mg daily for 48 weeks. In this limited dataset, the efficacy and safety profiles were not substantially different than for patients treated for 24 weeks. Two patients developed virological breakthrough, possibly related to medication nonadherence.

## Immunogenicity

Bulevirtide has the potential to induce antidrug antibodies (ADA), as detected in clinical studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In Studies MYR203 and MYR301, a total of 64 patients who were treated with bulevirtide 2 mg monotherapy for 48 weeks were eligible for assessment of ADA prevalence; 18 of these patients (28.1%) were positive for ADA prevalence, of which 3 patients (4.7%) were positive for ADA at baseline.

There is no evidence that the pharmacokinetics, safety, or effectiveness of bulevirtide were altered in these patients.

## Paediatric population

See section 4.2 and 5.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic properties of bulevirtide were characterised after intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The exposure of bulevirtide increased disproportionally while the apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution decreased with higher doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

The estimated volume of distribution is smaller than total body water. In vitro plasma protein binding is high with &gt; 99% of bulevirtide bound to plasma proteins.

## Biotransformation

No biotransformation study was performed for bulevirtide. Bulevirtide is a linear peptide consisting of L-amino acids, and it is expected to be degraded to smaller peptides and individual amino acids. No active metabolites are expected.

Based  on  the  results  of in vitro interaction  studies,  bulevirtide  did  not  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.

No in vitro induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 by bulevirtide was observed.

Based on the in vitro studies, no clinically relevant interaction is expected for most common efflux transporters (MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2K) and uptake transporters (OATP2B1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1 and OCT2). A specific in vitro interaction was identified with the organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 with IC50 values of 0.5 and 8.7 µM , respectively.

## Elimination

No bulevirtide excretion into urine was detected in healthy volunteers. Elimination via target (NTCP) binding is assumed to be the main route. Both distribution and elimination after multiple dosing were reduced compared to values estimated after the first dose. Accumulation ratios for 2 mg dose for Cmax and AUC were approximately 2-fold. Steady state is assumed to be achieved within the first weeks of administration. After reaching peak concentrations, plasma levels declined with t1/2 of 4-7 hours.

## Other special populations

## Renal impairment

No studies have been conducted with bulevirtide in patients with renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

No studies have been conducted with bulevirtide in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.

## Elderly

No data is available in patients older than 65 years of age.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of bulevirtide in paediatric patients have not been evaluated in a clinical study. Dosing recommendations for paediatric patients 3 years of age and older weighing at least 10 kg are based on exposure matching the paediatric bulevirtide concentration to concentrations observed in adults with HDV infection treated with bulevirtide 2 mg once daily. Simulated steady-state plasma exposures of bulevirtide weight-based dosing (see section 4.2) once daily by subcutaneous injection in paediatric patients are predicted to be within the safe and efficacious exposures associated with 2 mg bulevirtide once daily by subcutaneous injection in adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development.

No genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted due to the nature and mechanism of action of the product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A pre and post-natal development study (PPND) has been completed in rats and did not show any bulevirtide-related toxicity.

## Instructions for use

The bulevirtide vial should be taken from the refrigerator shortly before the injection and the blue flipoff cap has to be removed. A single-use syringe should be taken and a needle tip attached to the syringe head in order to extract 1 ml of sterile water for injection into the syringe. The syringe needle with the syringe containing the sterile water for injection should then be inserted into the bulevirtide vial through the rubber stopper. The sterile water for injection inside the syringe will then be injected into the bulevirtide vial and the bulevirtide vial has to be carefully swayed until a clear solution is obtained. The required content for the dose to be administered from the bulevirtide vial has to be extracted back into the same syringe with the same needle tip (See Table below).

## Required dose volumes to be extracted for administration of bulevirtide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Bulevirtide Dose   | Required volume of reconstituted bulevirtide to be extracted   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 mg               | 0.5 ml                                                         |
| 1.5 mg             | 0.75 ml                                                        |
| 2 mg               | 1 ml                                                           |

The needle tip has then to be detached from the syringe. To this syringe, a needle tip for subcutaneous injection has to be attached and any remaining air bubbles have to be removed from the syringe prior to injection. The content of the bulevirtide vial will then be administered subcutaneously.

If Hepcludex has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet is addressed to your child (in this case please read 'your child' instead of 'you').

## 1. What Hepcludex is and what it is used for

## What Hepcludex is

Hepcludex contains the active substance bulevirtide, which is an antiviral medicine.

## What Hepcludex is used for

Hepcludex is used to treat long-term (chronic) hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in adults and children 3 years of age and older weighing at least 10 kg with compensated liver disease (when the liver is still working well enough).

Infection with hepatitis delta virus causes inflammation of the liver.

## How Hepcludex works

HDV uses a particular protein in liver cells to enter the cells. Bulevirtide, the active substance in this medicine blocks the protein and so prevents the HDV from getting into liver cells. This reduces the spread of HDV in the liver and reduces inflammation.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Hepcludex

## Do not use Hepcludex:

1. if you are allergic to bulevirtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, speak to your doctor before using this medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Do not stop your treatment with Hepcludex unless your doctor advises you to do so. Stopping the treatment can reactivate the infection and worsen your disease.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Hepcludex:

1. if your liver is not working well enough - it is not known how well Hepcludex works in these circumstances; if your liver is not functioning well, using Hepcludex is not recommended.
2. if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys. Before and during treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working;
3. if you have HIV infection or hepatitis C - it is not known how well Hepcludex works in these circumstances; your doctor may order blood tests to check the status of your HIV or hepatitis C infection

## 7. Step-by-step injection guide for patients/caregivers

Before using Hepcludex, you must first read sections 1 - 6 of this package leaflet.

Before you begin treatment with this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will show you how to prepare and inject Hepcludex. This guide shows how to prepare and inject Hepcludex. Speak with your  doctor  or  nurse  if  you  are  unclear  about  anything  or  you  have  questions  or  need  more information or help. Take your time to carefully prepare and inject Hepcludex.

If your child has been prescribed Hepcludex , but is unable to administer it themselves, please note that  all  the  information  in  this  step-by-step  injection  guide  for  administration  of  Hepcludex  is addressed to you, as the child's caregiver.

Children  or  adolescents  should  only  inject  themselves  following  training  from  a healthcare professional and under supervision of an adult caregiver.

## Injection sites

The best places to inject are the abdomen and upper thighs, shown in the pictures. In order to reduce injection site reactions, you may change the site of Hepcludex injection regularly.

Do not inject Hepcludex into the following areas: knee, groin, the lower or inner buttocks, directly over a blood vessel, around the navel (belly button), on scar tissue, a bruise, a mole, a surgical scar, tattoo or burn site, or where there is an injection site reaction.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Before you inject

<!-- image -->

Hepcludex vials must be stored in the original packaging in the refrigerator (28 °C) in order to protect Hepcludex from light.

1B Preparing doses

<!-- image -->

The following instructions are for dissolving a single dose.

1C Wash hands

<!-- image -->

Wash your hands well using soap and warm water and dry them with a clean towel.

Once your hands are clean, do not touch anything else other than the medicine, supplies and the area around the injection site.

1D Clean vial

<!-- image -->

Wipe the vial top with a new alcohol pad and let the top air-dry.

If you touch the rubber top after cleaning it, clean it again with a new alcohol pad.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Mix the injection

2A Draw up sterile water

<!-- image -->

Pick up the syringe. Put the longer needle on.

Important! Be sure the capped needle is tight by pushing it down slightly while twisting it clockwise.

Pull off the plastic cap.

Open the vial of sterile water for injection. Insert the needle in the vial and gently turn the water vial upside down. Make sure the tip of the needle is always below the surface of the water to help keep air bubbles from entering the syringe.

Slowly pull the plunger back to get 1.0 ml of sterile water into the syringe. Carefully remove the needle and syringe from the vial.

2B Inject sterile water into the powder

<!-- image -->

Gently tap the Hepcludex vial to loosen the powder.

Insert the needle with sterile water into the vial at an angle.

Inject the sterile water slowly, so it can drip down the side of the vial into the powder.

Remove the needle from the vial and put the syringe and needle somewhere safe.

2C Gently mix Hepcludex

<!-- image -->

Gently tap the Hepcludex vial with your fingertip for 10 seconds to start dissolving the powder.

Then gently roll the vial between your hands to ensure thorough mixing. Make sure no powder is stuck to the vial wall.

Important! Do not shake the vial. Shaking will make the medicine foam and it will take much longer to dissolve.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2D Inspect Hepcludex

<!-- image -->

Once the powder starts to dissolve, just set it aside and it completely will dissolve.

After tapping, it could take up to 3 min to dissolve.

2E Hepcludex ready for injection

<!-- image -->

When mixed completely, the Hepcludex solution should be clear.

Important! Completely dissolved Hepcludex should be clear and without foam.

If the solution appears foamy or yellowish, allow more time for it to dissolve.If you see bubbles, gently tap the vial until they disappear.

If you see any particles in the solution once it is (completely) dissolved, do not use that vial. Contact your doctor or pharmacist that provided it.

Reconstituted Hepcludex must be used immediately.

2F Clean vial

<!-- image -->

Clean the Hepcludex vial top again, using a new alcohol pad.

Allow it to air dry.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Inject a dose

3A Insert needle into vial

<!-- image -->

Pick up the syringe.

Insert the needle into the vial of liquid Hepcludex .

3B Draw up Hepcludex

<!-- image -->
