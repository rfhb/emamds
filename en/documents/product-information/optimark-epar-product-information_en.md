## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.

Optimark is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) and liver. It provides contrast enhancement and facilitates visualization and helps with the characterization of focal lesions and abnormal structures in the CNS and liver in adult patients and in children of two years and older with known or highly suspected pathology.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Optimark should only be administered by physicians experienced in clinical MRI practice. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine/ adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available.

<!-- image -->

No dose adjustment is considered necessary in children more than 2 years of age. Optimark is contraindicated in neonates up to 4 weeks of age (see section 4.3). Use of Optimark is not recommended in children less than 2 years of age because the safety, efficacy, and impact of immature kidney function have not been studied in this age group.

Posology The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection at a dose of 0.2 ml/kg (100 micromol/kg) body weight. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. The imaging procedure should be completed within 1 hour of administration of the contrast medium. Repeat dose In cranial MRI, if a strong clinical suspicion of a lesion persists despite a single dose contrastenhanced MRI or when more accurate information on the number, size or extent of lesions might influence management or therapy of the patient, in subjects with normal renal function, a second bolus injection of 0.2ml/kg (100 micromol/kg) may be administered within 30 minutes of the first injection as it may increase the diagnostic yield of the examination. The safety of repeat doses has not been established in children and adolescents (2 years and older), in patients with renal impairment, or the elderly. The repeat dose is not recommended in these populations. Limited data with other gadolinium contrast agents suggests that for the exclusion of additional cranial metastases in a patient with a known solitary resectable metastasis, an MR exam with the injection of the dose of 300 micromol/kg body weight of Optimark may lead to higher diagnostic confidence. Paediactric population Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Elderly (aged 65 years and above)

No dose adjustment is considered necessary. Caution should be exercised in elderly patients (see section 4.4).

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) and/or acute renal injury and in patients who have had liver transplantation or in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period (see section 4.3). Optimark should only be used after careful risk/benefit evaluation in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) at a dose not exceeding 100 micromol/kg body weight (see section 4.4). More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated administration, Optimark injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. Insertion of a flexible in-dwelling venous catheter is recommended, see section 4.4.

Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector to children of 2 to 11 years (see section 4.4).

## Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

The container and the solution should be inspected prior to use as described in section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to gadoversetamide or to other gadolinium containing products, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Optimark is contraindicated

- in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30ml/min/1.73m 2 ) and/or acute kidney injury,

<!-- image -->

· in patients who have had liver transplantation or · in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period and · in neonates up to 4 weeks of age (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use As with any paramagnetic contrast agent, enhancement of MRI with gadoversetamide may impair the visualization of existing lesions. Some of these lesions may be seen on unenhanced, non-contrast MRI. Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrast enhanced scan interpretation is made in the absence of a companion unenhanced MRI. Before the examination, care must be taken that patients are sufficiently hydrated. Hypersensitivity Allergoid and other idiosyncratic reactions also may occur with gadoversetamide, which could become manifest in form of cardiovascular, respiratory and skin reactions (see section 4.8). Most of these reactions occur within half an hour after administering the contrast medium. As with all other contrast media of the same class, late reactions may occur (after hours or days) in rare cases; however, none were reported in the completed clinical trials. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. During the examination, supervision by a physician is necessary and insertion of a flexible in-dwelling catheter is recommended. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine/adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is increased in the following cases:

- -patients with allergic predisposition
- -patients with bronchial asthma; in these patients it is especially the risk of bronchospasm which is increased
- -patients with a history of reactions to contrast agents, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents

Before the injection of contrast media, patients should be asked whether they have any allergies (e.g. allergies to seafood or medicinal products, hay fever, urticaria), whether they are hypersensitive to contrast media and whether they have bronchial asthma. Premedication with antihistamines and/or glucocorticoids may be considered.

## Patients taking beta-blockers

It should be noted that patients using beta-blockers do not necessarily respond to the beta-agonists usually used for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with cardiovascular disease

In this group of patients hypersensitivity reactions may be severe. Especially in patients with serious heart diseases (e.g. severe heart failure, coronary artery disease) cardiovascular reactions may deteriorate. However, these were not evident from clinical trials with Optimark.

## Central nervous system disorders

In patients suffering from epilepsy or brain lesions the likelihood of convulsions during the examination may be increased. Precautions are necessary when examining these patients (e.g. monitoring of the patient) and the equipment and medicinal products needed for the rapid treatment of possible convulsions should be available.

## Patients with impaired renal function

Prior to administration of Optimark, all patients should be screened for renal dysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests.

<!-- image -->

As the renal clearance of gadoversetamide may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to screen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction.

There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of Optimark and some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30ml/min/1.73m 2 ) and/or acute kidney injury. Optimark is contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). Patients who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the incidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. Therefore, Optimark must not be used in patients who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation and in neonates (see section 4.3). The risk for development of NSF in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m²) is unknown; therefore Optimark should only be used after careful risk-benefit evaluation in patients with moderate renal impairment. Gadoversetamide is dialysable. Haemodialysis shortly after Optimark administration may be useful at removing Optimark from the body. There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis. In patients with baseline renal impairment, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of Optimark. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with an increased dose of the contrast agent. Administer the lowest dose possible for adequate imaging. Children and adolescents Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector. The required dose should be administered by hand to children of 2 to 11 years to avoid overdosage by mistake. Neonates and infants Optimark should not be used in children below the age of two years. Safety and efficacy have not been studied in this age group. Elderly Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

10 ml vials and 15 ml vials contain less than 1 mmol sodium; i.e. they are essentially 'sodium free'. Higher doses contain 1 mmol sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.

## Pre-filled syringe

20 ml of the solution contain 28.75 mg sodium. 30 ml of the solution contain 43.13 mg sodium.

## Vial

20 ml of the solution contain 28.75 mg sodium.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serum iron and zinc

Caution should be exercised because transient decreases in serum iron and zinc parameters have been observed in clinical trials. The clinical significance of this is unknown.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal interaction studies have been performed.

Optimark has been shown to cause interference in the measurement of serum calcium using the orthocresolphthalein complexone (OCP) colorimetric method. However, the administration of gadoversetamide does not cause a true decrease in serum calcium. In the presence of gadoversetamide, the OCP technique produces an erroneous, low value for plasma calcium. The magnitude of this measurement artefact is proportional to the concentration of gadoversetamide in the blood, and in patients with normal renal clearance accurate values can be obtained approximately 90 minutes following injection. In patients with compromised renal function, clearance of gadoversetamide will be slowed and the interference with calcium determination by OCP prolonged.  Gadoversetamide does not affect other methods of measuring serum calcium, such as the arsenazo III colorimetric method, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of gadoversetamide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Optimark should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use of gadoversetamide.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether gadoversetamide is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the excretion of gadoversetamide in animal milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued for at least 24 hours after the administration of Optimark.

## Fertility

Non-clinical data did not reveal special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of reproductive toxicity. Clinical studies on fertility have not been performed

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Optimark has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Ambulant patients while driving vehicles or operating machinery should take into account that acute dizziness may uncommonly (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) occur (see section 4.8).

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.8 Undesirable Effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Most of the adverse reactions were of mild to moderate intensity and transient in nature. The most common adverse reactions were dysgeusia, feeling hot, headache and dizziness.

The majority of adverse reactions observed after the use of gadoversetamide were found to be adverse reactions of the nervous system, followed by general adverse reactions, gastrointestinal disorders/skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Serious adverse reactions have been reported and include anaphylactic reactions, cardiovascular reactions, and allergic respiratory disorders. Treatment should be symptomatic and immediate access to necessary medicinal products and emergency equipment should be available should a serious event occur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions have been reported from clinical trials and from post-marketing use of gadoversetamide. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Local reactions have occurred at the injection site and may lead to local irritation type reactions.

Cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) have been reported with Optimark (see section 4.4). Cases of gadolinium associated skin plaques, with demonstrated sclerotic bodies on histology, have been reported with some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients who do not otherwise have symptoms or signs of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

## Paediatric population

Optimark has been studied in children of 2 years and older with a similar safety profile as shown in the adult population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

4.9 Overdose Gadoversetamide has been tested in humans in doses up to 700 micromol/kg (seven times the standard dose). Clinical consequences of an overdose have not been reported. Acute toxicity symptoms are unlikely to occur in patients with normal renal function. Optimark can be removed by haemodialysis. However, there is no evidence that haemodialysis is suitable for prevention of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic Group: MRI contrast media, ATC code: V08CA06 Gadoversetamide is a chelate containing gadolinium - which has paramagnetic properties and is responsible for the contrast enhancement effect in MRI - and the ligand versetamide. The purpose of an MRI contrast agent is to induce signal intensity changes within the lesion thereby facilitating its recognition from the surrounding normal structures. The use of a contrast agent may therefore reduce the threshold for lesion detection and visualization. Gadolinium containing MRI contrast agents (gadolinium-based chelates) are designed to act indirectly on the local magnetic environment by altering proton T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times and at the usual concentration of 100 micromol/kg, the T1 shortening predominates, and the T2 shortening is not significant using T1-weighted sequences. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Gadoversetamide, an extracellular gadolinium chelate, after intravenous administration, equilibrates rapidly within the extracellular fluid/space and is eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration. As a result of these characteristics, the timing of the image acquisition after contrast administration is critical in liver imaging. For liver metastases, the signal difference between the tumour and surrounding liver tissue is significantly improved during the first 90 seconds after an extracellular gadolinium contrast agent is administered. Therefore, a rapid imaging sequence should be initiated 20 seconds after bolus injection of the contrast agent when the agent is predominately in the hepatic arteries and then again at 60 seconds after injection during the dominant portal venous phase. Since the hepatic artery and portal venous system supply approximately 20% and 80% of the hepatic blood supply, respectively, the earlier (hepatic arterial phase) images provide optimal lesion conspicuity for hypervascular lesions and the portal venous phase images are useful for hypovascular lesions (most metastatic lesions are relatively hypovascular and are better demonstrated during the portal venous phase, manifesting as areas of lower signal intensity compared with the markedly enhanced liver). Lesion conspicuity of hypo- and hypervascular lesions may be reduced if imaging is delayed more

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

than 3 minutes due to the diffusion of the contrast agent into the interstitial spaces of both the liver parenchyma and lesion (e.g. metastasis) making the lesion isointense with the normal liver parenchyma. Delayed post-contrast or equilibrium images (&gt; 5 minutes after dosing) assist in the characterization of lesions, e.g. the centre of a metastasis may accumulate contrast in the interstitial space of the lesion and become hyperintense to the normal liver. This difference in enhancement pattern is useful in formulating a differential diagnosis based on lesion characterization and diagnostic confidence.

The enhancement of brain tumours using a gadolinium (or iodine) containing contrast agent depends on the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB). As a result, these agents have been referred to as markers for sites of abnormal BBB breakdown. When the BBB is disrupted, the gadoversetamide molecules diffuse into the interstitial compartment thereby producing the characteristic paramagnetic effect of T1 and T2 shortening. In general, the addition of contrast to MRI, at the standard clinical dose of 100 micromol/kg, has led to a significantly improved lesion detection, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Distribution The pharmacokinetics of gadoversetamide conforms to a two compartment open-model. At the 100 micromol/kg dose, the mean distribution half life in normal subjects calculated by the method of residuals in 12 normal volunteers is 13.3 ± 6.8 min. Mean volume of distribution at the 100 micromol/kg dose in non-renally impaired patients (including both normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology) was 158.7 ± 29.0 to 214.3 (range 116.4 to 295.0) ml/kg. This volume of distribution (approximately 10-15 l for a body weight of 70 kg) is consistent with a medicinal product which distributes into the extracellular fluid. Dose level has no consistent effect on the volume of distribution in any of the studies. Gadoversetamide does not undergo protein binding in vitro. Elimination The elimination half life at the 100 micromol/kg dose ranges from 1.49 ± 0.15 h in healthy volunteers to 2.11 ± 0.62 h in non-renally impaired patients (including normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology). The mean plasma clearance of gadoversetamide in healthy subjects (111.0 ± 14.1 ml/min/1.73m² BSA) is not significantly different from the mean renal clearance. Similar results are obtained in normal subjects and patients with various combinations of liver, CNS and renal dysfunctions with renal clearance of gadoversetamide being approximately 95% of the total plasma clearance. Such results (ratio renal clearance/total plasma clearance close to 1) indicate that gadoversetamide is essentially cleared through the kidneys. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There was no systematic difference in any of the kinetic parameters as a function of dose level (100 to 700 micromol/kg). Therefore, within this dose range, the kinetics of gadoversetamide appear to be linear.

## Metabolism

The high accountability for the dose as intact complex in urine suggests that no significant metabolism of gadoversetamide occurs in humans.

## Special Populations

## Effect of Gender:

Adult male and female subjects were enrolled in two pharmacokinetic studies. No significant differences in pharmacokinetics based on gender were identified.

## Effects of Age:

When corrected for body weight, the total body clearance of gadoversetamide is greater in the 2 to 11 year age group (143 ± 27.9 ml/h/kg) than that observed in the 12 to 18 year age group (117 ± 26.1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ml/h/kg) and the two adult populations (82.1 ± 16.8 and 56.5 ± 9.7 ml/h/kg in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively).

The elimination half life in the 2 to 11 and 12 to 18 year age groups (1.4 ± 0.3 and 1.6± 0.3 h -1 , respectively) is shorter than that observed in the two adult populations (1.9 ± 0.5 and 2.5± 0.5 h -1 in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively). The number of elderly patients in whom the pharmacokinetics were determined was limited (over 65 years, N=3).

## Effect of Renal Impairment

Gadoversetamide plasma levels increase linearly with decreasing renal function; in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl&lt;30 ml/min) this even leads to a six-fold decreased gadoversetamide clearance and a corresponding six-fold increased extent of exposure AUC and t½.  Since gadoversetamide is only administered as a single dose this will lead to a longer and higher exposure for a limited duration. Still, after 72 hours even in patients with severe renal impairment nearly the whole dose is recovered in the urine and in healthy populations up to 500 micromol/kg doses were administered without safety issues. Nevertheless, because of reported cases of NSF that may be associated with renal impairment for other gadolinium containing contrast agents and for gadoversetamide, Optimark should not be used in these patients.

5.3 Preclinical safety data Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute toxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance, antigenicity, and genotoxicity. No carcinogenicity studies were performed. Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed vacuolation of the tubular cells of the kidneys, with strong evidence for reversibility of the effect. No functional impairment was observed. The elimination of Optimark in dogs younger than 3 months of age was significantly delayed because of immature renal function and resulted in a high systemic exposure to Optimark.  Weekly repeated dosing of two to twenty times the clinical dose from one week of age through maturation resulted in extensive mineralization of tissues, which produced localized effects, such as ulcerative dermatitis, compromised circulation and hepatic dysfunction. 6.

## 1. What Optimark is and what it is used for

<!-- image -->

Optimark contains the active substance gadoversetamide. Gadoversetamide is used as a 'contrast agent' in magnetic resonance imaging.

Optimark is for diagnostic use, only. It is used in adult patients and children of two years and older, who are undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a type of scan where images of the internal organs are taken. Optimark is used to obtain a clearer scan in patients who have or are thought to have abnormalities in the brain, spine or liver.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Optimark

## Do not use Optimark

if you are allergic

- to the active substance gadoversetamide or

Medicinal product no longer authorised

- to any of the other ingredients of Optimark (see section 6), or
- to other gadolinium contrast agents.

## You must not be given Optimark if

- you suffer from severe and/or acute kidney impairment, or
- if you are a patient who is about to have or has had a liver transplant as use of Optimark in patients with these conditions has been associated with a disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF is a disease involving thickening of the skin and connective tissues. NSF may result in debilitating joint immobility, muscle weakness or may affect the normal working of internal organs which may potentially be life-threatening.
- Optimark must not be used in newborn babies up to the age of 4 weeks.

Before you receive Optimark, you will need to have a blood test to check how well your kidneys are working.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor before Optimark is used, if:

- you suffer from allergies (e.g. medicinal products, seafood, hay fever, hives) or asthma
- you had any reactions to previous injections of a contrast agent, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents
- your kidneys do not work properly
- you have recently had, or soon expect to have, a liver transplant
- you are feeling thirsty and/or if you have only had small quantities or nothing to drink before the examination
- you are taking a special kind of antihypertensive medicine, i.e. a beta-blocker
- you have heart disease
- you suffer from epilepsy or brain lesions
- you are on a controlled sodium diet

If any of these apply to you, your doctor will decide whether the intended examination is possible or not.

## Children and adolescents

Optimark is not recommended in children who are below the age of two years.

## Other medicines and Optimark

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Optimark should not be used during pregnancy unless strictly necessary.

Breast-feeding should be discontinued for at least 24 hours after you receive Optimark.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

If you are an ambulant patient and plan to drive or use tools or machines, take into account that dizziness may incidentally occur after you undergo a procedure involving the injection of Optimark. Up to 1 in 100 people may be affected.

## Optimark contains sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

10 ml vials and 15 ml vials contain less than 1 mmol sodium; i.e. they are essentially 'sodium free'. Higher doses contain 1 mmol sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

20 ml of the solution contain 28.75 mg sodium.

30 ml of the solution contain 43.13 mg sodium.

## 3. How Optimark is given

Diagnostic procedures involving the use of contrast agents should be conducted under supervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed.

## The usual dose

The usual dose of 0.2 ml/kg body weight is the same in adults and children of 2 years and older. It would account for 14 ml for a 70 kg individual, and this volume would be injected over about 7-14 seconds into a vein, usually a vein in an arm. The injection is then flushed through with a saline injection to make sure none is left in the needle or tube used for the injection. In adults, a second dose may be given within 30 minutes of the first injection. When looking at certain abnormalities in the brain, Optimark may need to be used at three times the usual dose in one injection in adults. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

doctor will decide how much Optimark is needed for your examination. You must tell the doctor or nurse/technologist immediately if you feel pain around the area where the needle is placed.

## Dosage in special patient groups

In patients with moderate kidney problems, more than one dose of Optimark should not be used during a scan. Optimark injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

It is not necessary to adjust your dose if you are 65 years of age or older but you will have a blood test to check how well your kidneys are working.

## If you are given more Optimark than you should have been

If too much Optimark was injected it is unlikely that it will do you much harm, as much higher doses did not lead to any problems when some people received them. If your kidneys are working normally it is unlikely you will have any problems. Optimark can be removed using dialysis. If you think you have been injected with too much Optimark, tell the doctor or nurse/technologist immediately.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

You must report any of the following symptoms immediately to the doctor or nurse/technologist, and get immediate treatment as they can be or can become very serious: side effects affecting the heart (fainting, extra heart beats, chest pain) or the respiratory system (shortness of breath, tightening of the airways, swollen or tight throat, itchy or runny nose, sneezing).

Most of the side effects observed after the use of Optimark were of mild to moderate intensity and transient in nature. The most common side effects were a strange taste in the mouth, feeling hot, headache and dizziness.

Possible side effects are described in greater detail below.

The frequencies below and the following symptoms are based on clinical trials, and on the experience in using Optimark after it was on the market:

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) web site http://www.ema.europa.eu.

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Therapeutic indications

Optimark is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) and liver. It provides contrast enhancement and facilitates visualization and helps with characterization of focal lesions and abnormal structures in the CNS and liver in adult patients and in children of two years and older with known or highly suspected pathology.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to gadoversetamide or to other gadolinium containing products or to any of the excipients.
- Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and/or acute kidney injury, in
- patients who have had liver transplantation or in
- patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period and in
- neonates up to 4 weeks of age.

## Special warnings and precautions for use

As with any paramagnetic contrast agent, enhancement of MRI with Optimark may impair the visualization of existing lesions. Some of these lesions may be seen on unenhanced, non-contrast MRI. Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrast enhanced scan interpretation is made in the absence of a companion unenhanced MRI.

Before the examination, care must be taken that patients are sufficiently hydrated.

## Hypersensitivity

It should be noted that patients using beta-blockers do not necessarily respond to the beta-agonists usually used for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.

Allergoid and other idiosyncratic reactions also may occur with gadoversetamide, which could become manifest in form of cardiovascular, respiratory and skin reactions. Most of these reactions occur within half an hour after administering the contrast medium. As with all other contrast media of the same class, late reactions may occur (after hours or days) in rare cases; however, none were reported in the completed clinical trials. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. During the examination, supervision by a physician is necessary and insertion of a flexible in-dwelling catheter is recommended. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine/adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available. The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is increased in the following cases: -patients with allergic predisposition -patients with bronchial asthma; in these patients it is especially the risk of bronchospasm which is increased -patients with a history of reactions to contrast agents, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents Before the injection of contrast media, patients should be asked whether they have any allergies (e.g. allergies to seafood or medicinal products, hay fever, urticaria), whether they are hypersensitive to contrast media and whether they have bronchial asthma. Premedication with antihistamines and/or glucocorticoids may be considered. Patients taking beta-blockers Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Patients with cardiovascular disease

In this group of patients hypersensitivity reactions may be severe. Especially in patients with serious heart diseases (e.g. severe heart failure, coronary artery disease) cardiovascular reactions may deteriorate. However, these were not evident from clinical trials with Optimark.

## Central nervous system disorders

In patients suffering from epilepsy or brain lesions the likelihood of convulsions during the examination may be increased. Precautions are necessary when examining these patients (e.g. monitoring of the patient) and the equipment and medicinal products needed for the rapid treatment of possible convulsions should be available.

## Patients with impaired renal function

Prior to administration of Optimark, all patients should be screened for renal dysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of Optimark and some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73 m²) and/or acute kidney injury. Optimark is contraindicated in these patients (see section Contraindications). Patients who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the incidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. Therefore, Optimark must not be used in patients who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation and in neonates. The risk for development of NSF in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m²) is unknown; therefore, Optimark should only be used after careful risk-benefit evaluation in patients with moderate renal impairment. Gadoversetamide is dialysable. Haemodialysis shortly after Optimark administration may be useful at removing Optimark from the body. There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis.

In patients with baseline renal impairment, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of Optimark. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with an increased dose of the contrast agent. Administer the lowest dose possible for adequate imaging.

## Children and adolescents

Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector. The required dose should be administered by hand to children of 2 to 11 years to avoid overdosage by mistake.

## Neonates and infants

Optimark should not be used in children below the age of two years. Safety and efficacy have not been studied in this age group.

## Elderly

As the renal clearance of gadoversetamide may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to screen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

10 ml vials and 15 ml vials contain less than 1 mmol sodium; i.e. they are essentially 'sodium free'. Higher doses contain 1 mmol sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.

20 ml of the solution contain 28.75 mg sodium.

30 ml of the solution contain 43.13 mg sodium.

## Serum iron and zinc

Caution should be exercised because transient decreases in serum iron and zinc parameters have been observed in clinical trials. The clinical significance of this is unknown.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of gadoversetamide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Optimark should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use of gadoversetamide.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether gadoversetamide is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the excretion of gadoversetamide in animal milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued for at least 24 hours after the administration of Optimark.

## Fertility

Nonclinical data did not reveal special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of reproductive toxicity. Clinical studies on fertility have not been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology and method of administration

Optimark should only be administered by physicians experienced in clinical MRI practice. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine/ adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available.

## Posology

The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection at a dose of 0.2 ml/kg (100 micromol/kg) body weight. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. The imaging procedure should be completed within 1 hour of administration of the contrast medium.

## Repeat dose

In cranial MRI, if a strong clinical suspicion of a lesion persists despite a single dose contrastenhanced MRI or when more accurate information on the number, size or extent of lesions might influence management or therapy of the patient, in subjects with normal renal function, a second bolus injection of 0.2 ml/kg (100 micromol/kg) may be administered within 30 minutes of the first injection as it may increase the diagnostic yield of the examination.

The safety of repeat doses has not been established in children and adolescents (2 years and older), in patients with renal impairment, or the elderly. The repeat dose is not recommended in these populations.

Limited data with other gadolinium contrast agents suggests that for the exclusion of additional cranial metastases in a patient with a known solitary resectable metastasis, an MR exam with the injection of 300 micromol/kg body weight of Optimark may lead to higher diagnostic confidence.

## Paediatric population

No dose adjustment is considered necessary in children more than 2 years of age. Optimark is contraindicated in neonates up to 4 weeks of age. Use of Optimark is not recommended in children less than 2 years of age because the safety, efficacy, and impact of immature kidney function have not been studied in this age group.

## Elderly (aged 65 years and above)

No dosage adjustment is considered necessary. Caution should be exercised in elderly patients.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and/or acute renal injury and in patients who have had liver transplantation or in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period. Optimark should only be used after careful risk/benefit evaluation in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) at a dose not exceeding 100 micromol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated administration, Optimark injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Method of administration

The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. Insertion of a flexible in-dwelling venous catheter is recommended.

Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector to children of 2 to 11 years.

Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product The container and the solution should be inspected prior to use.

## Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal interaction studies have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Gadoversetamide has been shown to cause interference in the measurement of serum calcium using the ortho-cresolphthalein complexone (OCP) colorimetric method. However, the administration of gadoversetamide does not cause a true decrease in serum calcium. In the presence of gadoversetamide, the OCP technique produces an erroneous, low value for plasma calcium. The magnitude of this measurement artefact is proportional to the concentration of gadoversetamide in the blood, and in patients with normal renal clearance accurate values can be obtained approximately 90 minutes following injection. In patients with compromised renal function, clearance of gadoversetamide will be slowed and the interference with calcium determination by OCP prolonged.  Gadoversetamide does not affect other methods of measuring serum calcium, such as the arsenazo III colorimetric method, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy.

## Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Optimark is intended for single use only; any unused portions should be discarded.

Do not use the solution if it is discoloured or particulate matter is present. If non-disposable equipment is used, scrupulous care should be taken to prevent residual contamination with traces of cleansing agents.

<!-- image -->

Discard syringe and unused portion of the solution after use.

Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. The peel-off tracking label on the pre-filled syringes should be stuck onto the patients record to enable accurate recording of the gadolinium contrast agent used. The dose used should also be recorded. If electronic patient records are used, the name of the product, the batch number and the dose should be entered into the patient record.

## 1. What Optimark is and what it is used for

<!-- image -->

Optimark contains the active substance gadoversetamide. Gadoversetamide is used as a 'contrast agent' in magnetic resonance imaging.

Optimark is for diagnostic use, only. It is used in adult patients and children of two years and older, who are undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a type of scan where images of the internal organs are taken. Optimark is used to obtain a clearer scan in patients who have or are thought to have abnormalities in the brain, spine or liver.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Optimark

## Do not use Optimark

if you are allergic

- to the active substance gadoversetamide or

Medicinal product no longer authorised

- to any of the other ingredients of Optimark (see section 6), or
- to other gadolinium contrast agents.

## You must not be given Optimark if

- you suffer from severe and/or acute kidney impairment, or
- if you are a patient who is about to have or has had a liver transplant as use of Optimark in patients with these conditions has been associated with a disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF is a disease involving thickening of the skin and connective tissues. NSF may result in debilitating joint immobility, muscle weakness or may affect the normal working of internal organs which may potentially be life-threatening.
- Optimark must not be used in newborn babies up to the age of 4 weeks.

Before you receive Optimark, you will need to have a blood test to check how well your kidneys are working.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor before Optimark is used, if:

- you suffer from allergies (e.g. medicinal products, seafood, hay fever, hives) or asthma
- you had any reactions to previous injections of a contrast agent, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents
- your kidneys do not work properly
- you have recently had, or soon expect to have, a liver transplant
- you are feeling thirsty and/or if you have only had small quantities or nothing to drink before the examination
- you are taking a special kind of antihypertensive medicine, i.e. a beta-blocker
- you have heart disease
- you suffer from epilepsy or brain lesions
- you are on a controlled sodium diet

If any of these apply to you, your doctor will decide whether the intended examination is possible or not.

## Children and adolescents

Optimark is not recommended in children who are below the age of two years.

## Other medicines and Optimark

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Optimark should not be used during pregnancy unless strictly necessary. Breast-feeding should be discontinued for at least 24 hours after you receive Optimark. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

If you are an ambulant patient and plan to drive or use tools or machines, take into account that dizziness may incidentally occur after you undergo a procedure involving the injection of Optimark. Up to 1 in 100 people may be affected.

## Optimark contains sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

10 ml vials and 15 ml vials contain less than 1 mmol sodium; i.e. they are essentially 'sodium free'. Higher doses contain 1 mmol sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

20 ml of the solution contain 28.75 mg sodium.

## 3. How Optimark is given

Diagnostic procedures involving the use of contrast agents should be conducted under supervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed.

## The usual dose

The usual dose of 0.2 ml/kg body weight is the same in adults and children of 2 years and older. It would account for 14 ml for a 70 kg individual, and this volume would be injected over about 7-14 seconds into a vein, usually a vein in an arm. The injection is then flushed through with a saline injection to make sure none is left in the needle or tube used for the injection.

In adults, a second dose may be given within 30 minutes of the first injection. When looking at certain abnormalities in the brain, Optimark may need to be used at three times the usual dose in one injection in adults. The doctor will decide how much Optimark is needed for your examination. You must tell

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the doctor or nurse/technologist immediately if you feel pain around the area where the needle is placed.

## Dosage in special patient groups

In patients with moderate kidney problems, more than one dose of Optimark should not be used during a scan. Optimark injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

It is not necessary to adjust your dose if you are 65 years of age or older but you will have a blood test to check how well your kidneys are working.

## If you are given more Optimark than you should have been

If too much Optimark was injected it is unlikely that it will do you much harm, as much higher doses did not lead to any problems when some people received them. If your kidneys are working normally it is unlikely you will have any problems. Optimark can be removed using dialysis. If you think you have been injected with too much Optimark, tell the doctor or nurse/technologist immediately.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

You must report any of the following symptoms immediately to the doctor or nurse/technologist, and get immediate treatment as they can be or can become very serious: side effects affecting the heart (fainting, extra heart beats, chest pain) or the respiratory system (shortness of breath, tightening of the airways, swollen or tight throat, itchy or runny nose, sneezing).

Most of the side effects observed after the use of Optimark were of mild to moderate intensity and transient in nature. The most common side effects were a strange taste in the mouth, feeling hot, headache and dizziness.

Possible side effects are described in greater detail below.

The frequencies below and the following symptoms are based on clinical trials, and on the experience in using Optimark after it was on the market:

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Therapeutic indications

Optimark is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) and liver. It provides contrast enhancement and facilitates visualization and helps with characterization of focal lesions and abnormal structures in the CNS and liver in adult patients and in children of two years and older with known or highly suspected pathology.

## Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to gadoversetamide or to other gadolinium containing products or to any of the excipients.
- Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73 m²) and/or acute kidney injury, in
- patients who have had liver transplantation or in
- patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period and in
- neonates up to 4 weeks of age.

## Special warnings and precautions for use

As with any paramagnetic contrast agent, enhancement of MRI with Optimark may impair the visualization of existing lesions. Some of these lesions may be seen on unenhanced, non-contrast MRI. Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrast enhanced scan interpretation is made in the absence of a companion unenhanced MRI.

Before the examination, care must be taken that patients are sufficiently hydrated.

## Hypersensitivity

It should be noted that patients using beta-blockers do not necessarily respond to the beta-agonists usually used for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.

Allergoid and other idiosyncratic reactions also may occur with gadoversetamide, which could become manifest in form of cardiovascular, respiratory and skin reactions. Most of these reactions occur within half an hour after administering the contrast medium. As with all other contrast media of the same class, late reactions may occur (after hours or days) in rare cases; however, none were reported in the completed clinical trials. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. During the examination, supervision by a physician is necessary and insertion of a flexible in-dwelling catheter is recommended. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine/adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available. The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is increased in the following cases: -patients with allergic predisposition -patients with bronchial asthma; in these patients it is especially the risk of bronchospasm which is increased -patients with a history of reactions to contrast agents, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents Before the injection of contrast media, patients should be asked whether they have any allergies (e.g. allergies to seafood or medicinal products, hay fever, urticaria), whether they are hypersensitive to contrast media and whether they have bronchial asthma. Premedication with antihistamines and/or glucocorticoids may be considered. Patients taking beta-blockers Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Patients with cardiovascular disease

In this group of patients hypersensitivity reactions may be severe. Especially in patients with serious heart diseases (e.g. severe heart failure, coronary artery disease) cardiovascular reactions may deteriorate. However, these were not evident from clinical trials with Optimark.

## Central nervous system disorders

In patients suffering from epilepsy or brain lesions the likelihood of convulsions during the examination may be increased. Precautions are necessary when examining these patients (e.g. monitoring of the patient) and the equipment and medicinal products needed for the rapid treatment of possible convulsions should be available.

## Patients with impaired renal function

Prior to administration of Optimark, all patients should be screened for renal dysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of Optimark and some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73 m²) and/or acute kidney injury. Optimark is contraindicated in these patients (see section Contraindications). Patients who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the incidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. Therefore, Optimark must not be used in patients who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation and in neonates. The risk for development of NSF in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) is unknown; therefore, Optimark should only be used after careful risk-benefit evaluation in patients with moderate renal impairment. Gadoversetamide is dialysable. Haemodialysis shortly after Optimark administration may be useful at removing Optimark from the body. There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis.

In patients with baseline renal impairment, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of Optimark. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with an increased dose of the contrast agent. Administer the lowest dose possible for adequate imaging.

## Children and adolescents

Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector. The required dose should be administered by hand to children of 2 to 11 years to avoid overdosage by mistake.

## Neonates and infants

Optimark should not be used in children below the age of two years. Safety and efficacy have not been studied in this age group.

## Elderly

As the renal clearance of gadoversetamide may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to screen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

10 ml vials and 15 ml vials contain less than 1 mmol sodium; i.e. they are essentially 'sodium free'. Higher doses contain 1 mmol sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.

20 ml of the solution contain 28.75 mg sodium.

## Serum iron and zinc

Caution should be exercised because transient decreases in serum iron and zinc parameters have been observed in clinical trials. The clinical significance of this is unknown.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of gadoversetamide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Optimark should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use of gadoversetamide.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether gadoversetamide is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the excretion of gadoversetamide in animal milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued for at least 24 hours after the administration of Optimark.

## Fertility

Nonclinical data did not reveal special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of reproductive toxicity. Clinical studies on fertility have not been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology and method of administration

Optimark should only be administered by physicians experienced in clinical MRI practice. To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine/ adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available.

## Posology

The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection at a dose of 0.2 ml/kg (100 micromol/kg) body weight. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for  injection. The imaging procedure should be completed within 1 hour of administration of the contrast medium.

## Repeat dose

In cranial MRI, if a strong clinical suspicion of a lesion persists despite a single dose contrastenhanced MRI or when more accurate information on the number, size or extent of lesions might influence management or therapy of the patient, in subjects with normal renal function, a second bolus injection of 0.2 ml/kg (100 micromol/kg) may be administered within 30 minutes of the first injection as it may increase the diagnostic yield of the examination.

The safety of repeat doses has not been established in children and adolescents (2 years and older), in patients with renal impairment, or the elderly. The repeat dose is not recommended in these populations.

Limited data with other gadolinium contrast agents suggests that for the exclusion of additional cranial metastases in a patient with a known solitary resectable metastasis, an MR exam with the injection of 300 micromol/kg body weight of Optimark may lead to higher diagnostic confidence.

## Paediatric population

No dose adjustment is considered necessary in children more than 2 years of age. Optimark is contraindicated in neonates up to 4 weeks of age. Use of Optimark is not recommended in children less than 2 years of age because the safety, efficacy, and impact of immature kidney function have not been studied in this age group.

## Elderly (aged 65 years and above)

No dosage adjustment is considered necessary. Caution should be exercised in elderly patients.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) and/or acute renal injury and in patients who have had liver transplantation or in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period. Optimark should only be used after careful risk/benefit evaluation in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) at a dose not exceeding 100 micromol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated administration, Optimark injections should not be repeated unless the interval between injections is at least 7 days.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Method of administration

The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection. To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. Insertion of a flexible in-dwelling venous catheter is recommended.

Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector to children of 2 to 11 years.

Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product The container and the solution should be inspected prior to use.

## Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal interaction studies have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Gadoversetamide has been shown to cause interference in the measurement of serum calcium using the ortho-cresolphthalein complexone (OCP) colorimetric method. However, the administration of gadoversetamide does not cause a true decrease in serum calcium. In the presence of gadoversetamide, the OCP technique produces an erroneous, low value for plasma calcium. The magnitude of this measurement artefact is proportional to the concentration of gadoversetamide in the blood, and in patients with normal renal clearance accurate values can be obtained approximately 90 minutes following injection. In patients with compromised renal function, clearance of gadoversetamide will be slowed and the interference with calcium determination by OCP prolonged.  Gadoversetamide does not affect other methods of measuring serum calcium, such as the arsenazo III colorimetric method, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy.

## Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Optimark is intended for single use only; any unused portions should be discarded.

## Optimark should be drawn into the syringe and used immediately.

Do not use the solution if it is discoloured or particulate matter is present. If non-disposable equipment is used, scrupulous care should be taken to prevent residual contamination with traces of cleansing agents.
