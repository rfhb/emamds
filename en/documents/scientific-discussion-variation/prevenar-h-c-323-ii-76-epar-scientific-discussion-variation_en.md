## 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1.1. Introduction

Prevenar was approved in the EU  in the indication active immunisation of infants and young children from 2 months of age up to 2 years of age against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (including sepsis, meningitis, bacteraemic pneumonia, bacteraemia) caused by the 7 pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F contained in the vaccine. . In 2004, the CHMP adopted a positive opion to extend the therapeutic indications to the age range from 2 to 5 years of age.

The scope of this extension of the indication application was to include acute otitis media (AOM. The target population was deemed the same for the current indications and AOM and it was not anticipated that the additional indication would result in any change in the use of the vaccine. The CHMP considered that the supplementary follow-up data from the pivotal pre-licensure clinical trials  demonstrated  that  Prevenar  has  effects  on  the  incidence  of  AOM,  pneumococcal  AOM,  and serotype-specific  pneumococcal  AOM  in  young  children  aged  &lt;2  years,  in  particular,  on  the  more severe forms of the disease. In addition, post-marketing data from the United States (US) indicated significant public health benefit by reductions of hospital and outpatients visits, antibiotic prescriptions  and  tympanostomy  tube  placement  since  the  implementation  of  Prevenar  for  routine infant immunisation. These data have been further supported by a very recent large ecological study which showed that AOM visits rates declined by 20% in children &lt;2 years of age after the introduction of Prevenar (Grijalva CG et al. 2006) . After the assessment of the data included in the submission of the variation application, the CHMP requested  the  MAH  to  respond  to  a  request  for  supplementary  information.  The  main  points  that needed to be clarified were as follows: -The MAH was asked to perform a recalculation of data to show absolute benefits -The extrapolation of US data to a European setting needed to be justified -The MAH was asked to present plans for surveillance serotype replacement in NPH carriage/AOM, shifts in microbiology and resistance patterns -Furthermore, the MAH was asked to discuss a selection of publications with negative results -The MAH was also asked to present an update on serotype epidemiology/coverage in the EU The MAH responded in November 2006 and the responses were assessed by the CHMP. The  Vaccine  Working  Party  (VWP)  also  discussed  the  variation  procedure  in  the  light  of  the assessment  of  the  MAH's  responses  on  its  January  2007  meeting.  The  VWP  supported  the Rapporteur's and Co-Rapporteur's conclusions, however recommended a revised wording of the SPC sections  41.  and  4.4.  The  VWP  recommended  to  revise  the  indication  by  including  the  AOM indication as a part of the overall indication and to revise section 4.4 by including information with regards to the immune response following the administration a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine after priming with Prevenar. Clinical aspects S. pneumoniae is one of the three bacterial pathogens most commonly encountered in AOM, with the seven vaccine serotypes contributing to approximately 60 to 80 % of pneumococcal-associated AOM.

Furthermore, these serotypes account for most of the antibiotic- resistant clinical isolates. Most children will experience AOM, defined as the acute infection of the middle ear with rapid onset of signs and symptoms.

Differences  in  case  definitions,  observation  time  periods  and  population  characteristics  between studies explain the diversity of published data on incidence rates of AOM. For these reasons, studies are  not  usually  comparable.  Nevertheless,  it  is  commonly  acknowledged  that  approximately  20  to

60 % of infants experience an episode of AOM by the age 12 months, and most children, 40 to 85 %, by the time that they reach 2 years of age. The greatest incidence of AOM occurs between 6 and 12 months of age.

Before the introduction of Prevenar into the US, 40 to 50% of samples from children with AOM grew S.  pneumoniae.  The  Finnish  Otitis  Media  (FinOM)  trial,  which  was  assessed  for  the  initial  MA, showed that approximately 60% of pneumococcal isolates from the controls were vaccine serotypes.

Based on available data in the  scientific  literature,  the  CHMP  considered  that  although  the  clinical effect appeared to be limited, the disease burden that is potentially vaccine preventable is substantial because of the high incidence of AOM among children. At the time of the initial evaluation of the Marketing Authorisation, taking into account the available data from trials at this time point, the CHMP  was of the opinion that although Prevenar had a clear effect against AOM caused by the vaccine serotypes (VE of 57 %), the overall impact on otitis media of 6-7 % was too low to grant the indication of AOM prevention. However, the protection afforded by the vaccine against otitis was understood as an add-on beneficial effect by the CHMP that was to be described in the SPC section 5.1. 1.2.1. Clinical data: To  support  the  extension  of  the  indication  for  this  variation,  the  MAH  used  the  data  from  several published studies. Two pre-licensure pivotal studies evaluated the role of Prevenar in the prevention of AOM in infants and toddlers in California (NCKP) and Finland (FinOM), respectively. These studies were fully assessed by the CHMP for the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation of Prevenar. FinOM trial: This trial was conducted in 1662 healthy infants in Finland randomised to receive either Prevenar or a control  vaccine  (hepatitis  B  vaccine),  at  2,  4,  6  and  12  months  of  age,  alongside  with  the  other vaccines recommended for infants in Finland ( Eskola J et al, 2001 ). Parents were instructed to bring their  child  to  the  study  clinic  whenever  the  child  presented  with  clinical  signs  and  symptoms suggesting  a  respiratory  tract  infection  or  an  AOM.  When  middle  ear  effusion  was  suspected, myringotomy was systematically performed, and a middle ear fluid sample was obtained for 93% of patients' visits due to AOM. FinOM follow up study Children originally enrolled in the FinOM trial that had completed 24 months of follow-up and were still living within the study area were invited to participate in this follow- up study at 4- 5 years of age, which primarily  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  Prevenar  for  tympanostomy  tube  placement.  The  clinical phase of the FinOM vaccine trial ended in March 1999, and subjects' parents were informed of their child's vaccination status (Prevenar or control) in late September 1999. Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) trial The effectiveness of Prevenar in reducing the incidence of AOM was also investigated in the NCKP trial, which was primarily designed to assess vaccine efficacy against invasive pneumococcal diseases. Between October 1995 and August 1998, 37,868 healthy, 2- month- old infants were enrolled in this study,  and  received  either  Prevenar  or  a  control  vaccine  at  2,  4,  6  and  12-  15  months  of  age, concomitantly with other recommended infant vaccines (Black et al, 2000) .  Clinical  AOM (without microbiological confirmation) was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## NCKP follow up study

The impact of Prevenar on otitis media at NCKP was reported in a separate publication from the IPD efficacy trial, and included the experience in subjects followed for up to 3.5 years after immunisation. The  main  outcome  measures  for  AOM  included  visits  for  otitis,  frequent  visits  for  otitis,  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tympanostomy tube procedures. As in the main trial, the diagnosis of AOM was not standardized but was ascertained by review of physician exam checklists and healthcare databases.

The submission was also supported by the following published studies:

- -two US population-based surveillance studies ('Population based impact in Tennessee and New York' ( Poehling et al.) and 'Experience in a rural community in Kentucky' ( Block SL et al.)

-a study on the impact of Prevenar vaccination on the microbiology of AOM ('Changes in frequency and pathogens causing acute otitis media in 1995-2003. ( Casey JR, et al.), -a cohort comparison study to determine changes in the microbiology of otitis media before (1992- 1998) and after (2000- 2003) community- wide implementation of Prevenar as part of routine care for all infants in a large (6- 7 clinician) paediatric practice in central rural Kentucky ('Community- wide vaccination with the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate significantly alters the microbiology of otitis media', ( Block SL, et al.). -a study on AOM due to penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( McEllistrem MC  et al). The  MAH  further  submitted  a  review  of  post-marketing  surveillance  data  including  the  following studies: -Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -Post- introduction surveillance data of IPD caused by serotype 19A (publication by Pai et al.) -Data from the NCKP post- marketing study on serotype- specific IPD incidence 1.2.1.1 Efficacy data Table 1 gives an overview on the main trials submitted in this variation.

## FinOM trial

The  Finnish  Otitis  Media  (FinOM)  trial  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  active  control  tympanocentesis study specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of Prevenar in acute otitis media. In this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

trial,  1662  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  either  Prevenar  or  hepatitis  B  vaccine  (as placebo)  at  2,  4,  6,  and  12  months  of  age,  and  were  followed  for  otitis  media  outcomes  through 24 months of age.

The primary endpoint of this trial related to pneumococcal otitis media caused by vaccine serotypes. Vaccine efficacy against episodes of AOM caused by vaccine serotypes was 57 % (95 % CI: 44, 67). In view of the risk associated with an early onset of AOM in life, it was considered noteworthy that efficacy estimate for the interval between the third and fourth dose, representing the second semester of life, was 57 % (95 % CI: 36, 72) against episodes caused by vaccine serotypes.

The  CHMP  highlighted  that  in the assessment of the initial application for the  Marketing Authorisation it was acknowledged that Prevenar displayed efficacy against AOM caused by vaccine serotypes  (VE:  57%).  Although  the  MAH  argued  that  a  slight  reduction  in  percent  could  possibly translate  into  a  very  high  total  number  of  otitis  cases  prevented,  the  small  overall  impact  on  total number  of  otitis  media  episodes  (6%,  non-significant)  was  considered  insufficient  to  justify  an indication at the time of the initial MA.

Serotype- specific estimates ranged from 25 % for serotype 19F to 84 % for serotype 6B. A reduction of 51 % (95 % CI: 27, 67) was also demonstrated for AOM due to cross-reactive serotypes, with a serotype- specific efficacy estimate that was only significant for serotype 6A, 57 % (95 % CI: 24, 76). There was a statistically significant increase (33 %), in the number of episodes due to non- vaccine serogroups.  Overall,  vaccine  efficacy  was  34  %  (95  %  CI:  21,  45)  for  any  type  of  pneumococcal AOM. A total of 2596 episodes of AOM were recorded during the per-protocol (PP) specified followup from 6.5 to 24 months of age. A statistically non- significant 6 % reduction in the incidence of all clinical AOM episodes was noted among the vaccine group, 1.16 versus 1.24 episodes / child-year in the control group. Nevertheless, there were 118 clinical AOM episodes prevented per 1000 children vaccinated before they reached the age of 2 years. It  was  noted  that  the  observed 6 % reduction in the number of all AOM episodes contrasted to the higher efficacy rate of 15 to 20 %. When considering all microbiologically proven episodes in the FinOM trial, among the vaccine group there  were  186  less  cases  of  AOM  due  to  vaccine  serogroup  pneumococci,  whereas  there  were  30 more cases due to non-vaccine serogroup pneumococci and 30 more cases due to H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Consequently, the net reduction was 126 cases. Moreover, the fact that this 6 % vaccine efficacy estimate was not statistically significant could have been the result of the small size of the trial. The data from the FinOM trial were extrapolated to the population of children aged less than 2 years living in the 25 Member States of the EU (birth cohort statistics, preliminary estimates for 2005, Eurostat 01- 2006). Applied to a birth cohort of 4,816,400 infants, the number of clinical episodes of AOM would be 8,958,400 per year in the 6- to 24- monthold age group. The projected number of vaccine- prevented AOM episodes in this age group would be about 568,300 in any one year, considering that 118 clinical episodes of AOM would be prevented in the first two years of life per 1,000 vaccinated children. As  to  whether  serotype  replacement  occurred  or  whether  previously  co-colonising  serotypes  had actually increased in density with the absence of dominant serotypes could not be established. It was discussed  that  if  serotype  replacement  does  occur,  the  relatively  limited  number  of  serotypes associated  with  invasive  diseases  in  children  suggests  that  only  a  small  number  of  these  are intrinsically virulent. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance was associated with a few serotypes that are represented in Prevenar and it was considered that replacing serotypes are likely to be susceptible to most commonly used antibiotics.

The observed shifts in carriage of serotypes and AOM were considered as early warnings suggesting that the non-vaccine serotypes could increase, replace the vaccine serotypes and cause disease leading to a reduction in vaccine efficacy. The virulence/susceptibility to penicillin of the non-vaccine strains might change or increase in this scenario. The MAH therefore committed at the time of the initial MA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to closely monitor serotype replacement in the post-authorisation period. Furthermore, the MAH now committed to provide annual reports from the pneumococcal surveillance programmes run by public health institutions in the EU to CHMP (see section III of this report)

## FinOM follow-up trial ( Palmu AAI et al,)

All children enrolled in FinOM who were still living the study area in February 2001 (N= 1490) were invited to a single- follow- up visit. The Primary Analysis Data Set included 756 children (403 Prevenar recipients and 353 controls; mean age, 58 months; mean time since last vaccine dose, 46 months) who accepted the invitation for the follow-up visit  and  were  examined  at  the  study  clinic;  upon  examination  they  were  enrolled  in  the FinOM Follow- up Study. Additionally, to assess the effect of potential selection bias among subjects accepting  the  follow-up  invitation,  a  Secondary  Analysis  Data  Set  was  defined,  which  included  an analysis of tympanostomy tube procedures performed in all children enrolled in FinOM who were still living in the study area (through June 2001). Primary and secondary endpoints The primary endpoint was tympanostomy tube placement, whether unilateral or bilateral (considered as one event if both tubes were placed at the same time). A secondary endpoint was tympanostomy tube placement associated with chronic otitis media with effusion (cOME), representing the most severe cases. Results In this long-term follow-up, efficacy against at least one episode of AOM after the age of 24 months was only 8% (95% CI: -2 to 16%). However, efficacy increased with increasing disease frequency and increasing severity. In longer duration follow-up, efficacy for recurrent AOM (defined as at least 3 episodes) after 24 months was 18% (95% CI: 1 to 32%) and for chronic otitis media with effusion, 50% (95% CI: 15 to 71%). While in the clinical phase of the FinOM trial, there was no difference in the rate of tympanostomy tube  placements  between  vaccinees  and  controls  (12.0  events/100  person-years  vs.  12.7  events/100 person-years,  respectively,  vaccine  efficacy  (VE)  was  4%,  (95%  CI:  -19  to  23%)),  the  rate  of tympanostomy tube placement among Prevenar recipients in the Primary Analysis Data Set after the age of 24 months was 3.5 per 100 person-years and was 5.7 per 100 person-years among controls, for a vaccine efficacy for tympanostomy tube placement after age 24 months through 4-5 years of age of 39% (95% CI: 4 to 61%). In those associated with cOME, VE was 49% (95% CI: -7 to 76%). Similar results were observed for the  Secondary  Analysis  Data  Set  (which  included  all  children  at  risk  for  surgery  in  the  study  area hospitals, N=1490), with vaccine efficacy for all tympanostomy tube placements of 44% (95% CI: 19 to 62%), and for tympanostomy tube placement associated with cOME of 63% (95% CI: 28 to 81%). In the original assessment of infants during the period from 2 months up to 24 months, the vaccine did not show preventive efficacy against tympanostomy tube placement (VE: 4%). In contrast, the followup study of the FinOM trial demonstrated that Prevenar was associated with a significant reduction in tympanostomy  tube  placement  from  2  to  4-5  years  of  age  (VE:  39%-44%).  The  CHMP  therefore concluded that this finding indicated long-term persistence of vaccine efficacy until at least the age of 5 years. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  observed  difference  in  VE  between  the  follow-up  periods  could  be  explained  by  markedly different thresholds for surgery between the 2 time periods. The rate of surgery was 2.6 times higher in the  control  group  during  the  first  period,  possibly  due  to  the  strict  follow-up  of  children  during vaccination and easy access to tube surgery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The number of overall AOM events after the age of 24 months (VE 8%, p=NS) was concordant with the  primary  period  of  the  FinOM  (6%).  However,  for  the  children  with  recurrent  AOM  after  24 months,  VE  was  18%  (p=significant).  The  higher  vaccine  efficacy  (50%)  against  tube  placement associated with cOME suggests that pneumococci play an important role in this more severe form of otitis disease.

## NCKP trial:

Between October 1995 and August 1998, 37,868 healthy, 2-month-old infants were enrolled in this study,  and  they  received  either  Prevenar  or  a  control  vaccine  at  2,  4,  6  and  12-15  months  of  age, concomitantly with other recommended infant vaccines. With regard to otitis media, the NCKP study relied  on  healthcare  utilisation  databases  to  document  otitis  visits  and  did  not  use  standard  clinical criteria  for  the  diagnosis,  however  the  diagnosis  was  ascertained  by  review  of  physician  exam checklists. The primary endpoint of the study was efficacy for vaccine-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), though additional endpoints included a variety of AOM parameters such as number of visits and impact on recurrent disease. A planned interim evaluation by the Study Advisory Committee of 17 cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotype in fully vaccinated subjects revealed IPD efficacy of 100% in the Prevenar arm. Case ascertainment continued through 40 cases of IPD in fully vaccinated subjects, and final analysis demonstrated  a  per-protocol  efficacy  for  vaccine-serotype  IPD  of  97.4%  (95%  CI,  82.7  to  99.9%), with efficacy in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of 93% (95% CI, 79.6 to 98.5%). The per-protocol efficacy for AOM visits was 8.9% (95% CI, 5.8 to 11.8%). While this study was not designed to evaluate pneumococcal  otitis media  (because  tympanocentesis  was  not  routinely performed,  so  the  aetiology  of  any  given  AOM  episode  could  not  be  confirmed),  the  investigators were able to  report  a  66.7%  efficacy  against  vaccine-serotype  AOM  in  a  small  number  of  subjects with spontaneously draining ears (n=16 per-protocol cases, p=0.077). The primary analysis was the overall incidence of AOM episodes (new visits) during the per protocol follow-up. From the beginning of the study in October 1995 through the end of April 1998 a total of 16,124  AOM  episodes  were  identified  in  11,849  Prevenar  (7VPnC)  children  versus  17,405  AOM episodes in 11.897 children receiving control vaccine (Meningococcal C conjugate (MnCC) vaccine). The  overall  incidence  of  AOM  episodes  was  reduced  from  1.72  episodes  per  child  year  in  MnCC recipients  to  1.60  episodes  per  child-year  in  the  7VPnC  recipients,  a  7.0%  (95%  CI:  4.1  to  9.7%; p&lt;0.0001) overall reduction, which represents a prevention of 12 episodes per 100 child-years. The incidence  of  AOM decreased over time in both vaccine groups reflecting the increasing age of the subjects. A lower incidence was seen in the 7VPnC group for all but one time point throughout the follow-up period. In the assessment of the initial Marketing Authorisation it was acknowledged that the effectiveness of Prevenar  against  otitis  media  was  demonstrated  in  this  trial  across  all  endpoints  except  ruptured eardrums. The risk reduction (7% PP, 6.4% ITT) of the primary outcome measure was low although statistically significant, representing prevention of 12 episodes per 100 child-years.

The CHMP highlighted that AOM is an extremely common disease resulting in around 25 million visits to physicians (US) per year, which equates the reduction of 6% with 1.5 million visits. Efficacy  was  more  promising  in  the  group  with  recurrent  and  potentially  more  serious  otitis  (tube placement) (20.3%). However, the otitis part of the NCKP trial suffered from important deficiencies, since there were no pre-specified criteria for the diagnosis and no bacteriologic confirmation.

NCKP follow up study (Fireman B et al.)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In this study, the overall incidence of AOM among controls was higher than that reported in Finland, with  a  rate  of  1.8  otitis  media  visits/  person-year.  In  particular,  at  the  period  of  greatest  incidence, from 8 to 12 months of age, the rate for boys and girls together in the control group was 22 to 24 visits per 100 children per month.

Children receiving Prevenar had reduced number of otitis visits than controls in every age group, race, sex, and season examined. While the absolute reduction of otitis visits was modest (7.8%; 95% CI, 5.4 to 10.2% for the per- protocol analysis), efficacy improved with increasing severity, so that efficacy for  recurrent  otitis  increased  in  proportion  to  increasing  frequency  of  episodes  over  a  six-  month period - from 5% for prevention of a first otitis visit (95% CI, 3 to 7%), to 10% for at least 3 visits, to 26% for 10 or more visits in the previous 6 month period.

Tympanostomy tube placement, a surrogate marker for severe, recurrent, and/ or difficult-to-treat otitis media, was reduced by 23.2% (95% CI, 11.3 to 33.5%) in the ITT analysis, and by 24.2% (95% CI, 11.7 to 35%) in the PP analysis. Additionally,  the  investigators  were  able  to  document  reductions  in  antibiotic  prescriptions  among Prevenar recipients, by 5.4% (95% CI, 4 to 6.7%) in the follow- up starting after the first dose, and by 5.7%  (95%  CI,  4.2  to  7.2%)  after  the  primary  series.  Greater  reductions  were  observed  among Prevenar recipients in prescriptions for 'second-line' antibiotics, which included antimicrobials other than amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin ethylsuccinate/sulfisoxizole (12.6%  for  all  follow-  up  time;  95%  CI,  9.6  to  15.6%).  It  was  estimated  that  from  the  first  dose through 3.5 years, Prevenar prevented a total of 35 antibiotic prescriptions per 100 children vaccinated per protocol. This longer-term follow-up of the NCKP trial examined whether effectiveness of Prevenar waned after age 24 months and whether it varied by race, sex, clinic, season, year and partial immunization. As for the  'original'  trial  data  there  were  no  pre-specified  criteria  for  the  diagnosis  and  no  bacteriologic confirmation of the diagnosis. Thus, the results were considered applicable on clinically diagnosed otitis in usual care. From the submitted documentation for this variation application, it was not clear on which basis the participants for the NCKP were chosen. The MAH was therefore asked to clarify this item in order to exclude any bias.  The MAH responded that no significant differences between the groups with respect to age or level of compliance with the study protocol were observed. Additionally, the MAH pointed out that findings regarding otitis media at NCKP were reported in two separate publications that used different data lock points. The overall extent of reduction in otitis episodes (7% (95% CI: 4 to 9%)) observed in this follow-up study  was  consistent  with  that  of  the  primary  NCKP  trial  (7%)  and  that  of  the  FinOM  trial  (6%). Hence, there was no indication that vaccine effectiveness waned during the follow-up time. However, when examined by age and calendar month there was a tendency of waning with age, as the vaccine reduced  otitis  visits  by  3.7%  in  children  aged  24  to  42  months.  However,  when  this  finding  was examined  closer  it  was  not  monotonic  or  statistically  significant.  Children  in  the  vaccine  group followed up during ages 3 to 3.5 years had 11.3% fewer visits than controls. Similar to other studies, the otitis visits peaked at 8 to 12 months of age. The authors of this publication estimated that Prevenar prevented 43 otitis visits by 3.5 years of age for every 100 children vaccinated as recommended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  vaccine  reduced  frequent  AOM  by  a  percentage  that  increased  with  frequency.  The  effect  on frequent  otitis  visits  was  equal  to  that  on  tympanostomy  tube  placement  (23-24%),  which  however varied with sex and race due to different risks and thresholds for inserting tubes. The vaccine efficacy against  tympanostomy  tube  placement  was  consistent  with  that  of  the  first  follow-up  period  of  the NCKP trial (VE: 20%). The vaccine, thus, had a larger magnitude of efficacy against the most severe form of otitis  media.  A  decreased  use  of  antibiotics  in  vaccinated  subjects  has  also  been  observed,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which the CHMP considered as clinical relevant as AOM is currently the most common indication for antibiotic prescription for children.

In conclusion, the CHMP found no evidence of waning efficacy against AOM up to the age of 3 to 3.5 years. The vaccine efficacy was greater against complicated cases of AOM, i.e. recurrent otitis and otitis requiring tube surgery (VE: 23%).

The CHMP considered also that the results of the NCKP trial further suggest that age was not a factor, since VE was 20% in the initial period (2-24 months) and 23% in the second follow-up period in both the  per-protocol  (PP)  and  ITT  analyses.  Estimates  of  tube  replacement  efficacy,  thus,  seemed consistent in both follow-up trials (of NCKP and FinOM).

Additional supportive data The MAH submitted the following publications as additional supportive data: Population based impact in Tennessee and New York; ( Poehling K.A. et al) This study had the objective to determine the population impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) on pneumococcal-related diseases, including pneumonia and otitis media. Using administrative data from Tennessee Medicaid and 3 commercial insurance plans in upstate New York,  annual  rates  of  medical  visits  for  pneumococcal-related  diseases  (pneumococcal  and  nonspecific pneumonia and invasive disease; otitis media) and pneumococcal- unrelated diseases (other acute  respiratory  illnesses)  were  measured.  Disease  rates  before  (1995  -  2000  in  Tennessee;  19982000 in New York) and after (2000 - 2002) the licensure of Prevenar in the US were calculated for children aged &lt;2 years (eligible for PCV) and those 3 to 5 years (not routinely given PCV). Adding PCV to the childhood immunization schedule was associated with a 10-fold greater reduction in pneumonia and a 100-fold greater reduction in otitis media than the previously reported reduction in culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal diseases of 1.3 episodes per 1000 children aged &lt;2 years. The CHMP considered that although additional studies are needed to confirm the impact of routine immunization with PCV on pneumococcal-related disease, these results suggest that its impact was substantially greater than the effects on invasive disease alone. Experience in a rural community in Kentucky; (Block SL et al.) This study assessed the reduction in annual rates of acute otitis media (AOM) episodes and antibiotic days  during  the  first  three  years  of  life  before  and  after  widespread  use  of  conjugated  heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7) in a closed community. The study was carried out in a sole paediatric private practice, which cares for approximately 2/3 of all children born in a rural Kentucky community. The study was a retrospective case cohort comparison of all children consecutively born seeking routine ambulatory care during 2 intervals: Cohort 1 (n= 274) was born (1993- 1994) before and Cohort 2 (n= 221) was born (2000-2001) after the widespread use of pcv7 in the practice. The nearly uniform adequate dosing of pcv7 in a closed population of mostly daycare children was associated with 28% and 26% reduction in total antibiotic days and overall antibiotic days for AOM, respectively.  The  mean  total  of  AOM  episodes  was  also  significantly  reduced  by  19%,  with  pcv7 benefits persisting into Year 3 of life. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Changes in frequency and pathogens causing acute otitis media in 1995-2003. ( Casey JR, et al.)

This 9-year, prospective study (1995-2003) was undertaken in a community-based private practice in Rochester, USA, to evaluate trends in pathogens causing persistent or treatment-resistant AOM and the  antimicrobial susceptibilities in the context of both changes in AOM treatment guidelines (high dose  amoxicillin)  and  the  introduction  of  Prevenar.  551  children  with  persistent  AOM  (PAOM, defined as clinical failure within 30 days of an antibiotic treatment course) or treatment-resistant AOM (AOMTF,  defined  as  those  who  were  treatment  failures  after  48  hours  on  therapy)  underwent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tympanocentesis to identify bacterial isolates. Only children who had received amoxicillin as initial antimicrobial therapy were eligible to participate in the study.

The study had three general observations for primary care practitioners who manage children in the US:

- 1) The frequencies of PAOM and AOMTF have declined in the US in the period 2001-2003 when Prevenar was introduced compared with the 6 years prior,

<!-- image -->

2) Within this subgroup of children with PAOM and AOMTF, a shift in causative pathogens has been observed, with H. influenzae becoming predominant in this population (though S. pneumoniae was still important), and 3) The proportion of S. pneumoniae isolates resistant to penicillin also declined The authors noted that the decrease in both PAOM and AOMTF in their practice coincided with the introduction of Prevenar. No  information  is  available  regarding  the  serotypes  of  S.  pneumoniae  isolated  from  PAOM  and AOMTF  in  this  study.  However,  the  finding  that  penicillin  non-susceptibility  among  isolated pneumococci  declined  since  the  introduction  of  Prevenar  may  perhaps  be  expected.  Five  of  the  7 serotypes included in Prevenar are commonly penicillin resistant, and the vaccine has the potential to reduce the frequency of AOM caused by penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae overall. Community-wide vaccination with the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate significantly alters the microbiology of otitis media. (Block SL, et al.) The objective of this cohort comparison study was to determine changes in the microbiology of otitis media before (1992- 1998) and after (2000-2003) community- wide implementation of Prevenar as part  of  routine  care  for  all  infants  in  a  large  (6-7  clinician)  paediatric  practice  in  central  rural Kentucky,  USA.  For  each  cohort,  there  were  approximately  2600-  2900  visits  for  AOM  annually among  children  of  all  ages.  Convenience  samples  of  children  aged  7-24  months  who  underwent tympanocentesis were prospectively assessed. Clinical  criteria  for  tympanocentesis  included  a  visibly  abnormal  tympanic  membrane  plus  the addition of at least one of the following: 1) prominent severe symptoms of AOM (crying, fussiness, altered sleep, otalgia, and/ or fever); 2) recurrent symptomatic or asymptomatic AOM unresponsive to previous antimicrobial therapy; or 3) ill appearance. Middle ear fluid was also collected for culture from spontaneous otorrhea or otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes of &lt;48 hours' duration. The  CHMP considered  that  this  study  had  limitations  by  its  lack  of  a  randomised  placebo  control group,  the  small  sample  size,  particularly  regarding  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  recovered  and  a selected study population for tympanocentesis. Furthermore, the CHMP pointed out that historical data and bacteriological data from myringotomy (most often available in complicated otitis cases) have to be used to document the impact of Prevenar on bacterial AOM incidence. In the study only 10% of the children had received the 4th vaccine dose, which has to be taken in consideration since the booster dose was considered important for long-term protection, in particular for mucosal disease.

This study focused on children with severe or refractory AOM. There was a substantial drop in allbacterial AOM (rate difference -10.3; rate change -49%). Furthermore, there was a pronounced change in the proportion of otopathogens recovered in vaccinated children ages 7-24 months, particularly in children with known risk factors for AOM. Comparing pathogens pre- and post-PCV7, the proportion of S pneumoniae decreased from 48% to 31% and non-typable H. influenzae increased from 41% to 56%. Beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae increased primarily in the population who had recently been  treated  with  antibiotics.  Thus,  the  proportion  of  gram-negative  bacteria  became  2-fold  more

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

frequent than pneumococci in the post-Prevenar era, and three-fourths of organisms in AOM antibiotic failures were H. influenzae, which has implications for antibiotic selection to treat AOM.

The  combined  proportion  of  vaccine  plus  vaccine-related  serotypes  remained  unchanged  between cohorts. Although vaccine serotypes diminished by nearly half, this was offset by an increase of the vaccine-cross-reactive  serotypes  6A  and  19A.  Furthermore  these  2  serotypes  accounted  for  32%  of penicillin-resistant  strains.  Unlike  the  FinOM  trial  no  replacement  with  non-vaccine  serotype  was observed. However, the number of pneumoccocal isolates in the study was limited.

Multiple publications have described studies on the effect of administering Prevenar and 23-valent  pneumococcal  polysaccharide  vaccine  (23vPS)  on  recurrent  AOM  among  unvaccinated children 1 to 7 years of age who have had previous episodes of AOM (Veenhoven R, et al. 2003, van Heerbeek N et al. 2006, Brouwer et al. 2005 ). An Israeli study looked at the effect of a candidate 9valent pneumococcal vaccine (9vPnC) on respiratory infections among toddlers aged 12 to 35 months attending daycare. ( Dagan et al. 2001, Dagan et al. 2002 )  Both the authors Veenhoven and Dagan have raised the issue of 'replacement' by S. aureus after vaccinating with Prevenar.

In the post-marketing surveillance studies of invasive pneumococcal disease in the US, an increase of serotype  19A  disease  has  been  noted.  The  finding  of  an  increase  of  serotype  6A  was  unexpected, especially as cross-protection against this serotype was seen in the FinOM trial (VE: 57%) and in postlicensing IPD studies. Vaccine-induced cross-protection against IPD and AOM caused by serotype 6A has been shown in the pre-licensure efficacy trials and in the post-licensure surveillance studies. With respect to vaccine protection against Nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of serotype 6A, results have been conflicting but the accumulated evidence now suggests that Prevenar provided no protection. On the basis  of  these  observations,  the  SPC  has  been  amended  with  regards  to  use  of  vaccine  serotype coverage instead of serogroup, which was considered appropriate by the CHMP. Acute otitis media due to penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. ( McEllistrem et al. ) The primary focus of this study was to evaluate whether the proportions of AOM due to penicillin nonsusceptible  S.  pneumoniae  (PNSP),  Prevenar  serotypes,  vaccine-related  serotypes,  and  nonvaccine  serogroups  changed  over  the  period  1999-  2002.  Additionally,  molecular  analysis  was performed on a subset of isolates. Isolates were recovered from children with spontaneous otorrhea during an episode of AOM,  during  myringotomy  or  tympanostomy  tube  placement,  during tympanocentesis performed for treatment-resistant AOM, or during tympanocentesis performed after the clinical diagnosis of AOM in a clinical trial. Isolates were collected from 505 cases of AOM due to S. pneumoniae from 5 sites in the US. Overall,  this  multi-centre  observational  study  demonstrated  that  the  proportion  of  AOM  in  this population caused by PNSP did not change over this time period, and confirmed the findings of earlier studies in which an increase in the proportion of cases due to non-vaccine serogroups was observed. However, a significant decrease in the number of vaccine serotype isolates was observed over the time period overall (p&lt;0.01), and specifically for serotypes 6B (p= 0.03), 14 (p= 0.01), and 23F (p&lt; 0.01); no change was observed for serotypes 9V (6 isolates per year for 1999, 2000, and 2002, with 2 isolates in 2001) and 19F (21, 25, 26, and 28 isolates per year, respectively). Significant reductions in vaccine serotype disease correlated with number of doses of Prevenar received (= 1 dose vs. 2- 4 doses) overall (p&lt; 0.01) and for serotypes 6B (p= 0.02) and 14 (p= 0.03). The major limitation of this study was the select nature of the isolates evaluated; that is, only approximately half of isolates were from patients with  spontaneous  otorrhea,  and  the  remainder  were  from  tympanostomy  and/or  myringotomy procedures. While those isolates from patients with spontaneously draining ears may represent more 'typical' AOM, there was likely to be enrichment for pneumococcal AOM, and also PNSP and nonvaccine serogroups; in this study population, the true impact of pneumococcal vaccination on routine AOM could not be assessed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One  study  of Dagan  et  al studied  one  or  two  doses  of  9vPnC  in  older,  previously  unvaccinated, children who were already attending day care. In 2003, these investigators concluded their series of papers  by  suggesting  that  any  national  immunization  program  should  include  surveillance  for  the reduction  of  antibiotic  use,  reversal  of  the  current  increase  in  resistance  in  the  community  or replacement by non-vaccine serotype, antibiotic resistant S. pneumonia.

In the studies of Dagan et al , a high risk population for respiratory infections was studied namely day care  attendees.  In  this  population  a  17%  reduction  of  otitis  episodes  was  demonstrated,  which  was higher  than  in  the  FinOM  trial.  The  CHMP  considered  that  use  of  the  broader  9vPnC  was  not  an explanation for this finding, since serotypes 1 and 5 were not considered as otitis pathogens. Another important observation in the vaccinated cohort was a decrease in antibiotic treatment for respiratory illnesses  including  otitis  (20%  risk  reduction),  which  was  most  pronounced  in  children  below  36 months of age. It was noted that despite an increase in non-vaccine serotypes a reduced risk of lower and upper respiratory infections and AOM was observed.

Discussion of efficacy data The submitted literature data demonstrated that the efficacy estimates: -Against microbiologically-proven AOM caused by vaccine serotypes varied from 57 to 67 %, -Against all clinical AOM episodes ranged from 6 to 8 %, -Against recurrent clinical AOM episodes ranged from 9 to 23 %, and -Against tympanostomy tube placement ranged from 4 to 49 %. While in the NCKP and FinOM studies, clinical AOM reduction was modest overall (6-7%), frequent otitis was reduced by 20% in the NCKP study. The observed 24% reduction in PAOM and AOMTF observed in the study by Casey et al .  was consistent with the reduction observed in severe frequent otitis media in NCKP. The CHMP considered that Prevenar prevents 6-7% of all AOM and this was rather consistent in the presented data. This effect on AOM was rather small in the total reduction of AOM any cause. It was clear  that  Prevenar  was  not  an  AOM  preventing  vaccine,  Prevenar  prevents  'only'  pneumococcal AOM an thus, the CHMP discussed whether this clear effect should be mentioned in section 4.1 or should be mentioned as it was for the time being in section 5.1. Having seen the submitted data on both  severe  AOM,  e.g.  tube  placement  therapy,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  data  were  sufficient  to include  otitis  media  in  section  4.1  of  the  SPC  as  the  MAH  adequately  responded  to  the  RSI  and limited the indication to pneumococcal AOM only. The CHMP requested the MAH also to further study the available literature and to provide an in depth analysis  of  all  negative  trials.  The  MAH  responded  that  in  addition  to  the  pneumococcal  conjugate vaccine clinical trials and the post-introduction surveillance studies already described, further studies were reviewed to complete the description of the impact of Prevenar on AOM. Contradictory results on the efficacy of vaccination with Prevenar (followed by 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine) for recurrent AOM in older children (n=383, aged 1-7 years) were obtained in a Dutch study ( Veenhoven et al 2003) In this study 58% of the children in the vaccine group  had  at  least  one  AOM  episode  (recurrence  rate  1.1  episode  per  person-year)  vs.  56%  of  the controls (recurrence rate 0.83 episode per person-year). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Thus, there was no decrease of AOM in the pneumococcal vaccine group compared with controls. The number  treated  with  tympanostomy  tubes  during  the  18-month  follow-up  was  also  similar  in  both groups. Nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes fell substantially in the vaccine group, whereas overall carriage of pneumococci was not affected due to an increase of non-vaccine serotypes (types 11,  15  and  16).  However,  S.  pneumoniae  was  isolated  more  commonly  in  the  middle-ear  fluid  of controls (21% vs. 14%; vaccine serotypes 9% vs. 4%). The main differences between this trial and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

NCKP and FinOM studies were age at vaccination, booster vaccination with a polysaccharide vaccine and study population including only children with a history of recurrent otitis.

In the study by Veenhoven et al . a clinically relevant reduction of tube surgery was observed (-39%). The vaccine efficacy persisted long-term during the follow-up period up to age 5 years. However, the CHMP considered that the contradictory results described by Veenhoven et al needed to be further addressed by the MAH.

Following the assessment of the MAH's responses, the CHMP considered that the use of the 23-valent polysaccharide  vaccine  as  booster  in  the  study  by  Veenhoven  et  al  had  abrogated  the  effect  of  the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, since the number of episodes of AOM was significantly decreased during the 6 months after receipt of the 7-valent vaccine and before the booster vaccination, whereas no effect could be seen after the booster. The known hyporesponsiveness induced by polysaccharide vaccines  was  considered  to  be  a  potential  cause  of  this  phenomenon.  The  selection  of  high-risk children with recurrent AOM could also impact efficacy of the vaccine and it might be necessary to vaccinate at infant age before major otitis morbidity. The MAH submitted further publications in their response  describing similar studies on the effect of administering  Prevenar  and  23-valent  pneumococcal  polysaccharide  vaccine  (23vPS)  on  recurrent AOM among unvaccinated children 1 to 7 years of age who have had previous episodes of AOM. Based on the review of the additional data provided by the MAH, the CHMP considered that use of the 23vPS as booster seemed to have abrogated the effect of the conjugated vaccine, since the number of  episodes  was  significantly  decreased  during  the  6  months  after  the  7-valent  vaccine  and  before booster vaccination in one study. The CHMP highlighted that the known hyporesponsiveness induced by polysaccharide vaccines might be the cause of this phenomenon. Furthermore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  inclusion  of  older  children  with  an  already  established recurrent AOM disease also affected the vaccine efficacy negatively. No  change  in  the  overall  pneumococcal  carriage  rate  (50%  of  children  in  both  groups)  was  noted despite  a  substantial  decrease  of  vaccine  serotypes,  which  was  due  to  an  increase  in  non-vaccine serotypes. This shift in serotypes occurred mainly in the youngest children that received 2 doses of Prevenar. Less effect of vaccination on pneumococcal carriage was seen in older children. No  influence  on  the  carriage  rate  of  other  pathogens  such  as  H.  influenzae  or  M.  catarrhalis  was observed  in this study.  The van  Heerbeck study  likewise  showed  no  efficacy  of  combined pneumococcal conjugate/polysaccharide vaccination against recurrence of OME in older children 2 to 8 years of age. A recent study by Kempen et al 2006 in Belgian children using a similar design as the studies above confirmed the lack of beneficial effect of combined vaccination on AOM episodes in older children with recurrent AOM. The effect of 9vPnC on NP carriage described by Dagan et al. showed a marked protection against carriage  of  vaccine  serotypes,  but  this  was  coupled  with  an  increase  in  non-vaccine  serotypes.  The authors stated that the clinical significance of the replacement of non-vaccine serotypes was not clear. Antibiotic resistance was mainly found in the 5 serotypes included in the 7 and 9-valent vaccine (6B, 9V, 14, 19F and 23 F) and a significant decrease in carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci was observed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The CHMP highlighted that the results by Dagan et al. underline the need for close and long-term monitoring  of  pneumococcal  serotype  epidemiology  and  disease  during  widespread  use  of  the conjugated pneumoccocal vaccine.

Overall, the CHMP concluded that Prevenar should not be used as a therapeutic measure for older ´otitis prone´ children but as a prophylactic measure in infancy.

In the USA, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been actively monitored since 1995 by the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance system of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

CDC case- control effectiveness study To evaluate the impact of Prevenar since its launch, the CDC conducted a case-control study to assess the post-licensure effectiveness of Prevenar immunization program in young children, both overall as well as by serotype. In this study, a case was defined as IPD that occurred in a 3- to 59-month-old child residing in one of the regions under ABC active surveillance, with isolation of pneumococcus from a sterile site and serotyping of the isolate. Cases were identified from January 2001 to May 2004. At least three controls per case were matched by age and by mother's residence. Children were considered as vaccinated if they had received at least one dose of Prevenar and, for both cases and controls, a dose of vaccine had to have been administered at least 2 weeks before onset of the case to validate the case. Compared  to  no  vaccination,  effectiveness  against  invasive  disease  caused  by  vaccine-related serotypes was 43% (95 % CI: 6, 66). In particular, serotype-specific efficacy estimate was 76 % (95 % CI: 39, 90) for 6A. Although, this estimate is lower than that observed for 6B, 94 % (95 % CI: 77, 98), these  data  also  indicate  statistically  significant  cross-protection.  By  contrast,  for  serotype  19A, estimate  of  vaccine  efficacy  was  only  26  %  (95  %  CI:  -  45,  62),  revealing  an  absence  of  cross protection. Because of the small number of cases, it was not possible to assess whether cross-protection could be extended to related serotypes within vaccine serogroups other than serogroups 6 or 19. Post- introduction surveillance of IPD caused by serotype 19A A publication by Pai et al provided additional evidence for poor cross-protection against serotype 19A afforded by Prevenar. The incidence of IPD caused by serotype 19A in the CDC/ABC areas was under continuous surveillance from July 1999 to June 2004. While the rate of all IPD in children less than 5 years  of  age  decreased  from  88.7  in  July  1999  to  22.4  cases/  100,000  between  by  June  2004,  the estimated rate of IPD due to 19A increased over this period from 2.6 to 6.5 cases/ 100,000, with a rate ratio [RR] of 2.5 (95 % CI: 1.7, 3.7). This experience was accompanied by the expansion of a clonal complex (CC199) that already had predominated before the introduction of Prevenar, as well as an increased diversity of clonal types among the isolates of serotypes 19A. Clonal expansion may provide evidence of serotype switching from vaccine serotypes to serotype 19A. In conclusion, these findings confirm that Prevenar provided little or no cross-protection against serotype 19A IPD in children. Post-introduction surveillance at the NCKP organisation Data  from  the  NCKP  post-  marketing  study  on  serotype-specific  IPD  incidence  (rate  per  100,000 person years) is available for children less than 5 years of age from the pre- licensure (April 1996March 2000) to the post- licensure period (April 2000- March 2005) of Prevenar. For serotype 6A IPD, the incidence fell from 3.07 to 0.58 over this time (an 81 % reduction in rate). For 19A, by contrast, the incidence  increased  slightly  from  1.32  to  1.75  over  this  period,  indicative  of  no  cross-  protection against this  serotype.  There  were  insufficient  numbers  for  evaluation  of  cases  due  to  other  vaccinerelated serotypes, although overall there were fewer such cases in the post- licensure period.

Discussion of surveillance studies

Prevenar/H/C/323/II/76 15/19 The  CHMP  pointed  out  that  although  the  MAH  has  provided  argumentation  that  the  effect  size observed in the US may still be of substantial public health benefit for the US situation, in the absence of  any  relevant  epidemiological  data  and  effectiveness  data  from  the  European  Union,  these conclusions  could  not  be  extrapolated  to  the  European  setting.  The  MAH  was  therefore  asked  to submit data on the vaccine use in EU countries with respect to effectiveness against IPD and AOM following  widespread  use  of  Prevenar.  The  main  focus  was  on  possible  shifts  in  the  incidence  of vaccine serotypes, vaccine-related serotypes, non-vaccine serotypes and penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) strains.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH presented data from Spain ( Calbo  E,  et  al. ),  Germany  (ESPED),  France  (EPIBAC)  and presented  an  overview  on  further  national  surveillance  programs  in  Norway,  UK,Italy,  Switzerland (countries with 3-dose schedule) as well as further networks in France, Germany and Spain (countries with 4-dose schedule)

The CHMP considerered that there is no change to the safety profile. The vaccine will continue to be used in the same target population for which the vaccine is currently approved, and no increase in the extent of use of the product is foreseen, therefore no amendment to the Risk Management Plan was considered necessary.

Results of an EU wide survey funded by the EU project on pneumococcal disease (PnC - EURPO) has recently summarized all publicly funded national surveillance programs across the EU and presents, in tabular form, the data elements being collected by each program (Pebody RG et al. 2006) The  CHMP  considered  that  the  available  data  are  still  very  limited  since  few  countries  have implemented universal immunisation of children below 2 years of age. In Spain, vaccine uptake had remained low and IPD is not a reportable disease in all regions of Spain. In one Spanish study ( by Calbo E et al ), no overall decrease in the rate of IPD was observed despite reductions in disease caused by some vaccine serotypes. In contrast, serogroup 19 isolates were found in equal numbers before and after Prevenar introduction, but it was not known whether this was due to an increase in serotype 19A strains as has been seen in the US. An  unexpected  finding  was  an  increase  of  empyema  caused  by  non-vaccine  serotype  1,  which, however, also has been observed in other regions regardless of the use of Prevenar. The data from Spain were difficult to interpret due to limitations in the surveillance methods and the low percentage of children vaccinated. The data warrants further close monitoring of the effectiveness of the vaccine. Monitoring of IPD in Germany through the ESPED surveillance system was considered to provide valuable data after the introduction of universal vaccination of all infants in 2006. So  far epidemiological  data  have  shown  that  serotype  coverage  of  Prevenar  in  2004  was  66%  in  the  age group 0-23 months and 64% in the age group 24-59 months. The  EPIBAC  data  from  France  demonstrated  significant  reductions  for  pneumococcal  bacteremia (29%) and meningitis (39%) in children below 2 years of age during a period when Prevenar was only recommended for use in high-risk children. In conclusion, The MAH´s response was accepted by the CHMP. The limited data from Europe so far available  were  considered  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  low  vaccine  uptake,  which  precludes  any comparison  with  the  US  situation  at  this  time.  Since  routine  immunisation  has  only  recently  been implemented in several EU countries, data on long-term effectiveness and serotype replacement will have to be awaited. The MAH therefore agreed with the CHMP to commit that annual reports will be provided to CHMP for the national surveillance systems. 1.2.1.2 Safety Data The MAH did not submit new safety data for this type II variation. The pharmacovigilance plan has been previously reviewed during the r`enewal procedure and the PSUR cycle has been set on every two years. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.3 Overall Discussion and conclusion

Two major issues were initially identified by the CHMP pertaining to efficacy in AOM:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

firstly  the  extent  of  benefits  of  the  vaccine  in  the  otitis  indication  was  not  considered  sufficiently justified and data were to be presented as absolute benefit per 100 children vaccinated, and  secondly  in  the  absence  of  any  relevant  epidemiological  data  and  effectiveness  data  from  the European  Union,  the  CHMP  questioned  whether  the  US  experience  could  be  extrapolated  to  the European setting.

Other  concerns  included  potential  risks  with  7vPnC  vaccination  such  as  serotype  replacement  and microbiological shifts to gram-negative organisms in naso-pharyngeal carriage and AOM. Surveillance  studies  including  close  monitoring  of  AOM  and  carriage  with  respect  to  serotype replacement and bacteriological shifts as well as patterns of antibiotic resistance in the EU also needed to be outlined by the MAH.

The  MAH  responded  that  the  absolute  benefit  per  100  children  vaccinated,  with  18  to  25  AOM episodes prevented per 100 children vaccinated as well as a reduction of outpatient medical visits for AOM with 20%, was deemed clinically relevant considering the high disease burden that otitis media represents in clinical practice. It has been estimated that up to 90% of all children will experience an episode of AOM before the age of 5 years. The  MAH  provided  also  an  update  on  studies  with  'negative'  results.  The  main  features  of  these studies enrolling older children (1-8 years) were that i) the children had established recurrent or severe AOM disease and/or ii) the use of mixed vaccination schedules. The administration of a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine as booster after priming with the 7-valent conjugate vaccine is known to induce hyporesponsiveness and was a plausible cause of the negative study outcomes. Considering  the  accumulated  data,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  propose  a  modification  of  the  SPC section 4.4 to warn against the possible negative effects of using mixed vaccination schedules with conjugated  and  polysaccharide  vaccines.  In  the  MAH´s  response  to  the  RSI,  a  modified  text  was proposed, which was agreed after further revision. A consistent observation in the NP carriage studies was the replacement of vaccine serotype with nonvaccine  types  after  vaccination  and  in  the  FinOM  trial  it  was  shown  that  some  of  these  serotypes resulted in middle-ear disease. Further studies have shown that replacement disease with nonvaccine serotypes has only occurred at low frequencies. The magnitude of the benefit of vaccination at this stage was considered to be higher than the risk of replacement. The extent of indirect effects (herd immunity) induced by the vaccine has been demonstrated in the US surveillance studies, as twice as many IPD cases were prevented as through direct effects. The herd effects were presumably attained by reduced carriage of vaccine serotypes in children &lt;2 years of age, who constitute the prime group for transmission of S. pneumoniae infection in the community. Thus, the  CHMP  considered  that  these  effectiveness  data  concerning  IPD  are  also  relevant  to  the  AOM indication. Since routine infant immunisation has only recently been implemented in several EU countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium and Norway), data on long-term effectiveness and serotype replacement will have to be awaited. An overview of all surveillance studies planned by the National Public Health authorities was provided. The majority of studies concerned IPD, but the one study in France that was considered relevant for the otitis indication is funded by the MAH. It was proposed to extend this study until 2011 and to expand with respect to bacteriologic and clinical endpoints. This was considered an important follow-up study to evaluate antibiotic resistance, bacteriological shifts and serotype replacement disease in AOM. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  conclusion,  the  AOM  indication  was  considered  approvable  and  the  MAH  agreed  to  the  final modifications required to the SPC as requested by the CHMP.

## 1.4 Benefit-Risk assessment.

Based on the presented data for the extension of the indication to include otitis media in infants and children  from  2  months  of  age  to  2  years  of  age  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit/risk  remains unchanged. The target population was considered the same for both indications and an otitis indication will not result in any change in the use of the vaccine.

2. CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION As  this  variation  is  finalised  in  parallel  with  variation  EMEA/H/C/000323/II/0090,  the  changes adopted in parallel are also included in the Annexes. The MAH agreed with the CHMP on the following changes to the Product Information: SPC section 4.1 Following the VWP discussions, the CHMP agreed to include acute otitis media as part of the overall indication rather than including it under a separate paragraph. The MAH agreed with the CHMP on the revised wording. SPC section 4.4 The VWP and the CHMP agreed that the wording regarding hyporesponsiveness following vacination with a 23vPS vaccine needed to be revised to better reflect the current state of knowledge. Furthermore, the MAH agreed with the CHMP that a wording on the low vaccine efficacy in overall AOM has been included in this section. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Package Leaflet The CHMP discussed the appropriate wording reflecting the statement on the comparably low efficacy in all AOM in section 4.4 of the SPC and proposed to re-word the statement in order to reflect the fact more correctly. The MAH agreed with the change proposed by the CHMP. For detailed changes refer to the present/ proposed Appendix and final approved highlighted SPC/ PL attached to the CHMP AR. 3. CONCLUSION On 1 February 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet based on the observations and the appropriate conclusions.
