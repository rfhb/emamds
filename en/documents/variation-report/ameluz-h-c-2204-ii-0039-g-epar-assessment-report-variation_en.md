## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II group of variations

Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 28 August 2019 an application for a group of variations.

The following variations were requested in the group:

| Variations requested   | Variations requested                                                                                                           | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a                | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |
| C.I.4                  | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data              | Type II | I                  |

Extension of indication to include the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis on extremities, trunk and neck for Ameluz; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. In addition, section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated based on follow-up data from study ALA-AK-CT009, a randomised, observer-blind, intra-individual phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ameluz (5-aminolevulinic acid) in combination with daylight PDT (photodynamic therapy) in comparison with methyl-5-aminolevulinate for the treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis.

The group of variations requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/157/2009 on (product-specific) waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

Actinic keratosis (AK) is a skin lesion induced by ultraviolet light and is considered an in-situ squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. AK may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It is by far the most common lesion with malignant potential to arise in the skin.

## Epidemiology and risk factors

AK is mostly seen in fair-skinned persons on skin areas that have had long-term sun exposure. Epidemiological data show a high occurrence rate of AK. Regions with higher exposure to ultraviolet light have a higher prevalence of AK. In Europe, a prevalence of 15% in men and 6% in women has been documented. Over the age of 70 years, 34% of men and 18% of women were found to have AK. The USA show prevalences between 11 to 26% and in Australia, the country with the highest skin cancer rate in the world, the prevalence of actinic keratosis among adults older than 40 years has been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported to range from 40 to 60%. Current national and international guidelines recommend the treatment of AKs in order to prevent their potential progression into SCC.

## 2.1.2. About the product

Ameluz (5-aminolaevulinic acid) gel had been approved in the EU on 14 December 2011.

The current indications of Ameluz (gel) are:

- Treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate severity on the face and scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2; see section 5.1) and of field cancerization in adults

BF-200 ALA 10% (Ameluz) is a non-sterile, topical formulation of 10% 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride in a gel-matrix with nanoemulsion. BF-200 ALA 10% contains 10% ALA as hydrochloride salt, equaling 7.8% of the free acid.

BF-200 ALA 10% is used in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a red-light lamp or daylight.

## Chemical structure:

The chemical structure of 5-aminolevulinic acid is:

<!-- image -->

5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a delta-amino acid and occurs as an endogenous molecule of the heme biosynthesis pathway in almost every cell in humans, animals and plants. The hydrochloride salt is used as drug substance in the investigational and the to-be-marketed formulations.

ALA functions as a pro-drug and is metabolized to the photoactive substance protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in mitochondria, which are therefore the major sites of ROS-induced damage. PpIX is a natural metabolite of ALA within the heme pathway.

## Pharmacological class:

BF-200 ALA 10% (with 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride as active ingredient) belongs to the class of medications called 'photodynamic therapy photosensitizers'.

## Mode of action:

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) requires 3 components: (1) a photosensitizer, (2) light with a sufficient amount of energy at a suitable spectrum of wavelengths, and (3) oxygen. In PDT light energy is transferred through the photosensitizer to oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS oxidize cell membranes and other cellular compounds, causing necrosis or apoptosis of targeted cells.

## Dosage form, route of administration, and dosing regimen:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BF-200 ALA 10% gel is a white to yellowish gel for topical use delivered in a 2 g aluminum tube sufficient for the treatment of a total area of 20 cm².

Photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis with BF-200 ALA 10% gel is indicated for the treatment of single lesions or of an entire field affected by multiple lesions (field cancerization).

Treated lesions that have not completely resolved after 3 months shall be retreated with BF-200 ALA 10% gel.

For treatment of basal cell carcinoma, two sessions of photodynamic therapy shall be administered with an interval of about one week between sessions for one or multiple lesions. Basal cell carcinoma lesions shall be evaluated three months after treatment. Treated lesions that have not completely resolved after 3 months shall be retreated.

Two different sources of illumination for PDT are available:

- Illumination with a lamp (medical device) as a red light source for the treatment of AK, field cancerization and BCC: The entire treatment area, for both AK and BCC, shall be illuminated with a red light source, either with a narrow spectrum around 630 nm and a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm2 or a broader and continuous spectrum in the range between 570 and 670 nm with a light dose between 75 and 200 J/cm2.

- Daylight illumination as a source of light for PDT in combination with BF-200 ALA is approved for the treatment of AK and field cancerization. Daylight PDT comprises application of BF-200 ALA to mild to moderate AK lesions or fields, followed by 30 minutes incubation time and 2 hours exposure to full daylight.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Since the active substance 5-aminolevulinic acid is an amino acid and an intermediate in basic biochemical pathways, an environmental risk assessment is not deemed necessary. This is supported by the guideline on the environmental risk assessment where it is stated that amino acids are exempted from the requirement for a detailed environmental risk assessment as they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study

ALA-AK-CT010: A randomized, double-blind, intra-individual, multi-center phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) versus placebo in the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis on extremities, trunk/ neck with photodynamic therapy (PDT) when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp.

## Methods

Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, intra-individual Phase III study (n= 50 patients, intraindividual comparison). Depending on the response one or two PDTs were done.

The study was conducted in 6 centres in Germany.

The study was divided into 2 parts, the clinical observation period (screening, PDT-1, PDT-2, if applicable, and the 12 weeks following the last PDT), and the follow-up visits (approximately 6 and 12 months after last PDT, respectively).

Patients were screened for the study on Visit 1; randomization and PDT with red light were performed on Visit 2. BF-200 ALA and placebo gel were randomized to the respective sides of the patient's extremities and/or trunk/neck (1:1 ratio). Each patient received one entire tube of test product and placebo gel (2 g each) per treatment. The amount of each BF-200 ALA and placebo tube is sufficient to cover one treatment field (continuous field or discontinuous field with several patches) totalling approximately 20 cm 2 .

At baseline (Visit 2), 4 (Visit 3) and 12 weeks (Visit 4) after PDT, the target lesions were assessed (location/ side, number of lesions per side, size and severity of lesions). 12 weeks after PDT-1 final assessment of complete response was done. In case of non- or partial response PDT-2 was done.

These patients with remaining lesions on both sides 12 weeks after PDT-1 were re-treated with a second PDT (PDT-2). Their lesions were further assessed 4 weeks (Visit 5) and 12 weeks (Visit 6) after PDT-2.

Additionally, all patients were followed up for one year after their last PDT with 2 visits (6 and 12 months after last PDT) to assess recurrence of AK lesions. Skin quality was assessed at baseline, 12 weeks after the last PDT (Visit 4 or Visit 6) and at both follow-up visits.

Cosmetic outcome compared to baseline was calculated based on skin quality assessments. Patient's satisfaction regarding cosmetic outcome and PDT treatment were recorded 12 weeks after the last PDT and at the follow-up visits after 6 and 12 months. Mandatory biopsies of target lesions preselected at Visit 1 were taken for histopathological examination in a central accredited laboratory 12 weeks after the last PDT.

Optional biopsies were taken at the discretion of the investigator. Recurrent lesions had to be documented during FU.

At the time of the PDT, the treatment area was assessed for local skin reaction during PDT, local discomfort during PDT, and assessment of pain during PDT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adverse events (AEs), including new lesions, serious adverse events (SAEs) and local skin reactions were assessed at the time of the PDT, and 1, 4 and 12 weeks post-PDT. During FU (6 and 12 months post-PDT), any relevant local AEs including new AKs or non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or melanoma, or conditions that may have had impaired a proper assessment of the recurrence rate of the treated AK lesions as well as any SAE that had occurred since the end of the clinical observation period had to be documented.

Non-responders or partial responders 12 weeks after PDT (end of clinical observation period), i.e. patients with remaining (non-responding) lesions at Week 12, could receive further treatment at the discretion of the investigator.

## Study participants

## Main inclusion Criteria:

- -Males or females between 18 and 85 years of age (inclusive).
- -Presence of 4 to 10 clinically confirmed AK target lesions of mild to severe severity according to Olsen (Olsen et al. 1991) on one treatment field (continuously or in several patches) totalling about 20 cm 2  per comparable patient's side. Treatment fields could be located either on opposite sides of the extremities and/or the trunk/neck, but treatment fields on both sides of a patient had to be in comparable subareas within the same treatment area (e.g. both treatment fields on hands or upper arms or lower arms or upper legs or lower legs or décolleté or back, but not for instance hand on one side of the body and arm on the other). A treatment field could be continuous or consist of several patches. The number of lesions per patient's side were not to vary by more than 50% between the two sides for each patient and should be comparable regarding AK severity. AK lesions had to be discrete and measurable; the diameter of each AK lesion had to be between 0.3 cm and 1.5 cm. The size of each baseline AK lesion was determined by measuring the two largest perpendicular diameters. Lesions included in the study should be entirely located within the treatment fields, leaving a distance of ≥ 0.5 cm between the lesion margin and the treatment field border. At least one of the lesions on each side with a diameter of ≥ 0.5 cm was to be selected for 2 mm punch biopsies to be taken 12 weeks after the last PDT.
- -Willingness to undergo a 2 mm punch biopsy on each side at the end-of-study visit 12 weeks after the last PDT.
- -Free of significant physical abnormalities (e.g. tattoos, dermatoses) in the potential treatment fields that may complicate examinations or final evaluations.
- -Willingness to stop the use of moisturizers and any other non-medical topical treatments within the treatment fields within 24 h prior to the next clinical visit.
- -Accept to abstain from extensive sunbathing and the use of a solarium during the period of the clinical visits. Patients experiencing sunburn within the treatment fields cannot be randomized before they have fully recovered.
- -Good general health and/or stable health condition, as confirmed by a physical examination and medical history.
- -Healthy patients and patients with clinically stable medical conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Women of childbearing potential can participate in this study only if they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and are willing to use a highly effective method of contraception.

## Main exclusion Criteria:

- -History of hypersensitivity to 5-ALA or any ingredient of BF-200 ALA.
- -Presence of porphyria.
- -Hypersensitivity to porphyrins.
- -Presence of photodermatosis.
- -Start of intake of medication with hypericin or systemically-acting drugs with phototoxic or photoallergic potential.

## Treatments

Test product: Ameluz (gel), BF-200 ALA: BF-200 nanoemulsion containing 7.8% 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) as hydrochloride, with preservatives (sodium benzoate) and xanthan gum as the gel base.

Control product: Placebo (gel): Nanoemulsion without active ingredient, with preservatives (sodium benzoate) and xanthan gum as the gel base.

The study has been designed as an intra-individual comparison, and the treatments were equally randomized to the respective sides of the patient's extremities and/or trunk/neck (1:1 ratio). Depending on the response the patients received one or two PDTs. Each patient received one entire tube of each investigational medicinal product (IMP) (2 g). The amount of each BF-200 ALA and placebo tube is sufficient to cover one treatment field (continuous field or discontinuous field with several patches) totaling approximately 20 cm2. The IPs were only applied by study personnel.

## Duration of therapy:

The IPs were applied topically once (single application each) on the day of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT-1 and PDT-2, if applicable) depending on the AK lesion assessment 12 weeks after PDT-1.

Patients with remaining lesions on both sides 12 weeks after PDT-1 were retreated with a second PDT (PDT-2). The duration of the clinical observation period was approx. 14 weeks for patients receiving one PDT and approx. 26 weeks for patients receiving two PDTs.

On the day of PDT the skin was exposed to Ameluz resp. placebo gel for a mean of 185 minutes (range 177 to 200 minutes). Illumination with the BF-RhodoLED lamp was done for 10 minutes. The illumination time was automatically calculated, so that a total light does of 37J/cm² (per treatment field) was achieved.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study 010 was to compare the efficacy and safety of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) with placebo for the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis (AK) located on extremities and trunk/ neck with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy variable:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Total lesion clearance rate in percent per patient's side, defined as the percentage of individual lesions with complete remission on the respective side of the patient assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT.

Secondary efficacy variables (12 weeks after the last PDT unless otherwise stated; with hierarchical testing):

- -Patient complete clearance
- -Total lesion clearance rate of moderate (according to Olsen) lesions in percent
- -Total lesion clearance rate in percent in the treatment area extremities
- -Total lesion clearance rate in percent in the treatment area trunk/neck-
- -Histopathologically confirmed lesion response (HCR) rate
- -Total lesion clearance rate in percent 12 weeks after PDT-1
- -Patient complete clearance 12 weeks after PDT-1
- -Overall cosmetic outcome as assessed by the investigator.

Safety variables include frequency and extent of TEAEs including SAEs, application site skin reactions, application site discomfort and pain during PDT, and documentation of new lesions, as well as safety laboratory data and physical assessments at Visit 1 and Visit 4 or Visit 6, if retreated. Vital sign measurements were performed at all clinical visits.

## Sample size

An overall sample size of 52 patients was calculated considering:

- the study was to be conducted as split-body treatments in a ratio of 1:1.
- the treatment fields had to be comparable, and number of lesions were not allowed to differ more than 50% between patient's sides.
- A sample size of 44 patients (BF-200 ALA PDT vs. placebo PDT, ratio 1:1 split-body design)with a correlation between items of BF-200 ALA PDT and placebo PDT of 0.2 would ensure a power of 90% of a Wilcoxon rank sum test, one-sided, with a significance level of 0.025 to demonstrate a statistically significant superiority in response rates between patient ' s sides treated with BF-200 ALA PDT versus placebo PDT in the FAS.
- The additional N=8 patients were to be enrolled (screened but without screening failures) to ensure a) a sufficient number of patients in subgroups Olsen grade and treatment area, b) a sufficient number of patients in the per protocol analysis set, and c) to consider for possible diverging effects in treatment areas, for which actual efficacy results especially for area trunk/neck are not published.

In total, 56 patients enrolled (with screening failures) of which 50 were the randomized set and the safety analysis set (SAF), with 49 as full analysis set (FAS), and 43 per protocol set (PPS).

## Randomisation

As the study has been designed as an intra-individual comparison, the treatments were equally randomized to the respective sides of the patient's extremities and/or trunk/neck in a 1:1ratio. Each patient received one entire tube (2 g) of each BF-200 ALA and placebo gel, each tube sufficient to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cover one treatment field (continuous field or discontinuous field with several patches) totaling approximately 20 cm2.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was a double-blind design.

## Statistical methods

Statistical analyses were performed as soon as the 12 weeks after the last PDT data and histopathological assessments were available for analysis. Data from the FU period (6 months or 12 months after the last PDT) will be analyzed and reported separately, as the study is currently ongoing.

The primary null hypothesis (H01, one-sided) was that the total lesion clearance rate in percent per patient's side, assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT, on the patient's side treated with BF-200 ALA was not superior to the corresponding patient's side treated with placebo. The primary alternative hypothesis (H11, one-sided) was that the total lesion clearance rate in percent per patient's side assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT for the patient's side treated with BF-200 ALA was superior to the corresponding patient's side treated with placebo.

A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test the primary hypothesis on a significance level of 2.5% (alpha=0.025). The primary analysis was performed on the FAS.

Confirmatory hypothesis testing of secondary variables was to be done only if the test of the primary efficacy variable was passed (superiority of BF-200 ALA over placebo confirmed) and was to be done strictly in the given order to ensure the family-wise error rate (FWER). For secondary endpoint analyses, also a significance level of 2.5% (alpha=0.025) was applied.

Tertiary efficacy endpoints were to be analyzed descriptively and in an exploratory way. All efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS and were repeated, in the sense of sensitivity analyses, for the PPS.

Missing values for the efficacy endpoints were imputed by the last preceding non-missing assessment, if applicable, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach (FAS).

## Recruitment

The study period was from 18-Sep-2017 (first patient in) to 09-Jan-2019 (last patient completed clinical observation period).

## Conduct of the study

The Clinical Study Protocol dated 12-Apr-2017 was amended three times: substantial Protocol Amendment 1 resulting in CSP 2.0 dated 20-Jul-2017 to further define the extent of AEs that had to be documented during the FU period; non-substantial Protocol Amendment 2 resulting in CSP 2.1 dated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

31-Jan-2018 to adapt the number of study sites and study timelines; substantial Protocol Amendment 3 resulting in CSP 3.0 dated 23-Jul-2018 to change the order of two secondary endpoints. There were no substantive changes to the clinical conduct of the study.

One patient was excluded from the FAS and PPS because the application of IPs was reversed at PDT-1. Within the SAF, this patient was assigned to the treatment groups as actually treated.

Six patients were excluded from the PPS (alone) because of major protocol deviations:

- Two patients had a biopsy of a lesion not meeting inclusion criteria (too small).
- Two patients discontinued their study participation before their last Visit, thus no final efficacy assessment was performed.
- One patient was not treated as randomized at PDT-2; application of IPs was reversed.
- One patient had a biopsy of a lesion not meeting inclusion criteria (too small), and the treatment field did not meet inclusion criterium 3: all lesions of the side fit into the illumination area of 6 x16 cm, but the surrounding margin did not fit into the illumination area.

All further protocol deviations were minor.

## Numbers analysed

50 patients were in the safety analysis set (SAF), 49 patients in the full analysis set (FAS), and 43 patients in the per protocol set (PPS).

## Outcomes and estimation

The primary endpoint - the total lesion clearance rate in percent of AK on extremities and/or trunk/neck  per patient's side 12 weeks after the last PDT - was 86.0% ± 23.2% for BF-200 ALA and 32.9% ± 37.1% for placebo (FAS, LOCF).

The median of differences (BF-200 ALA minus placebo) was 60.0 [lower 97.5% confidence limit (CL) 33.3] (p&lt;0.0001, one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test), thus, demonstrating superiority of BF-200 ALA over placebo. The robustness of this result was confirmed by the PPS analysis (table 4).

The proportion of patients with improvement in skin quality due to treatment with BF-200 ALA ranged from 38.1% (hypopigmentation) to 69.2% of patients (skin surface) and for placebo from 13.8% (mottled pigmentation) to 35.7% (atrophy) [considering patients with skin quality of at least mild impairment at baseline].

More patients were more satisfied by the BF-200 ALA treatment than by the placebo treatment: 38 (82.6%) patients would choose the BF-200 ALA treatment again versus 32 (69.6%) patients for the placebo treatment.

A majority of patients was satisfied by the cosmetic outcome of the BF-200 ALA treatment: 38 (80.9%) patients rated their satisfaction as 'very good' or 'good' and only 6 (12.8%) patients were unsatisfied with their cosmetic outcome. For the placebo treatment, 'very good' or 'good' satisfaction with cosmetic outcome was reported by 23 (48.9%) patients and more than one third (19 [40.4%] patients) were unsatisfied by the treatment. One patient (2.1%) each rated the cosmetic outcome for BF-200 ALA and placebo as 'impaired'.

## · Clinical Versus Histopathological Assessment of Lesion Clearance

To evaluate the correspondence between clinical and histopathological assessment, the percentage of lesions assessed as fully cleared by the investigator 12 weeks after the last PDT but not fully cleared according to histopathology and the percentage of lesions assessed as not cleared by the investigator 12 weeks after the last PDT but fully cleared according to histopathology were analyzed. Most of the BF-200 ALA-treated biopsied lesions were clinically cleared according to the investigator as well as histopathologically cleared whereas a smaller number of placebo-treated biopsied lesions was both, clinically and histopathologically cleared (70.2% versus 19.1%). Only one (2.1%) of the BF-200 ALAtreated lesions, but 36.2% of the placebo-treated lesions were neither clinically nor histopathologically cleared. Results are summarized below.

## · Change in Skin Quality Assessments Per Patient's Side

Skin quality parameters (including skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy) were assessed by the investigator at baseline and 12 weeks after the last PDT using a 4-point scale, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe.

The changes in skin quality assessments from baseline to 12 weeks after the last PDT are summarized by skin quality parameter and severity for both treatment groups in Table 8. The overall cosmetic outcome (secondary endpoint no.7, see e.g. ' Summary of main studies ', below) is based on these assessments.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

In order to compare the efficacy of Ameluz/red-light PDT in study ALA-AK-CT010 (AK in extremities and/or trunk/neck) a pooled analysis of previously submitted phase III studies (study ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AK-CT007) in AK in the face and/or scalp were presented. These 3 studies included a placebo (vehicle control) as comparator arm and had the same main inclusion criteria. In all studies, up to two PDTs were applied. All three studies used the same primary endpoint, i.e. percentage of patients for whom all treated AK lesions were completely cleared 12 weeks after the last PDT. The main differences of these studies are that in study 007 a field-directed treatment of AK was applied, and in studies 002 and 003, different sources of red-light (narrow resp. broad spectrum lamps) were applied. Separate analysis of the different light sources revealed, that narrow spectrum lamps (e.g. BF-RhodolLED) was more efficacious compared to broad-spectrum lamps. Table 11 presents the pooled efficacy results of the studies 002, 003 and 007 (face and/or scalp).

## Study ALA-AK-CT009 (follow-up)

## Follow-up data of ALA-AK-CT009 (Phase III - reference therapy-controlled study): A

randomized, observer-blind, intra-individual phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BF200 ALA (Ameluz) in combination with daylight PDT (photodynamic therapy) in comparison with Metvix for the treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis.

This was a study on face/scalp that was included within variation EMEA/H/C/2204/II/0027/G (daylight therapy of AK was approved based on this study).

Within the current application the MAH submitted an 'Addendum to Clinical Study Report', dated 26 September 2018, covering the follow-up period of study ALA-AK-CT009.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, intra-individual Phase III study (n= 50 patients, intraindividual comparison). One single PDT was done.

3 centers in Spain, 4 centers in Germany.

Study 009 was divided into 2 parts, the clinical observation period (screening, PDT and the 12 weeks following the PDT), and the follow-up visits (approximately 6 and 12 months after the single PDT, respectively).

Patients were screened for the study on Visit 1; randomization and PDT were performed on Visit 2. The overall ratio for BF-200 ALA (gel)/daylight and Metvix (cream)/daylight was 1:1. Test product and active comparator were randomized to the respective sides of the patient's face and/or scalp (intraindividual comparison).

Identically to study 010, at baseline (Visit 2), 4 (Visit 3) and 12 weeks (Visit 4) after PDT, the target lesions were assessed (location/ side, number of lesions per side, size and severity of lesions).

Also identical to study 010, mandatory biopsies of target lesions preselected at Visit 1 were taken for histopathological examination in a central accredited laboratory 12 weeks after the PDT.

All patients were followed up for one year after their PDT with 2 visits (6 and 12 months after PDT) to assess recurrence of AK lesions. Timing of assessment of skin quality, cosmetic outcome, patient's satisfaction (via a questionnaire) and AE was nearly identical to study 010.

Skin quality, cosmetic outcome and patient's satisfaction were recorded 12 weeks after the single PDT and at the follow-up visits after 6 and 12 months. Moreover, patient's satisfaction was recorded the day of PDT, one week after PTD.

During FU (6 and 12 months post-PDT), any relevant local AEs including new AKs or non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or melanoma, or conditions that may have had impaired a proper assessment of the recurrence rate of the treated AK lesions as well as any SAE that had occurred since the end of the clinical observation period had to be documented.

## Study participants

Patient's age identical to study 010 (18 to 85 years). 3 to 9 clinically confirmed AK target lesions of only mild to moderate intensity, i.e. AK grade 1 or 2 according to Olsen et al. (1991), within each of two comparable treatment areas located either on opposite sides of the face and/or the scalp, i.e. right and left side of the face/scalp. Identical to study 010 the number of lesions per patient's side were not to vary by more than 50% between the two sides for each patient. AK lesions had to be discrete and measurable; the diameter of each AK lesion had to be between 0.5 cm and 1.5 cm. The treatment area per side included a margin of about 0.5-1.0 cm surrounding each lesion. The size of each baseline AK lesion was determined by measuring the two largest perpendicular diameters.

## Treatments

Test product: Ameluz (gel), BF-200 ALA

Control product: Metvix (cream), containing 160 mg/g of methyl-5-aminolevulinate (MAL) as hydrochloride equivalent to 16.0% of MAL. The excipients include cetostearyl alcohol (40 mg/g), methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 218; 2 mg/g), propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 216; 1 mg/g) and arachis oil (30 mg/g).

Intra-individual comparison. Application to right resp. left side of face and/or scalp. The patients in this study received one single daylight PDT. 12 weeks after PDT the response was evaluated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The follow-up of this study was identical to study 010. During the 1-year FU no investigational treatment was applied.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study 009 was to compare the efficacy and safety of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz®) treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis (AK) with Metvix when using daylight PDT.

The current application for variation refers to the 1-year follow-up period of this study only. Amongst others, the lesion recurrence rate is reported.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy:

For the FU, the following efficacy variables were analyzed:

- Lesion recurrence defined as the number of completely cleared individual lesions 12 weeks after the PDT according to the dedicated patient's side showing recurrence during follow-up
- Patient recurrence per patient's side defined as the number of patients with all lesions on a specific side completely cleared 12 weeks after the PDT with at least one recurrent lesion during follow-up
- Change in skin quality assessments compared to baseline assessed on follow-up visits per patient's side
- Overall cosmetic outcome on follow-up visits per patient's side
- Patient's satisfaction on follow-up visits regarding PDT treatment, in general and according to the dedicated patient's site, and cosmetic outcome (per patient's side)

## Safety:

For the FU, the following safety variables were analyzed:

- Any relevant local AEs or conditions that may impair a proper assessment of the recurrence rate of the treated AK lesions as well as any SAE that have occurred since the end of the clinical observation period
- New lesions (AK, NMSC, melanoma) on follow-up visits per patient's side

Data assigned to the clinical observation period of the study that were documented during FU (e.g. an AE reported during FU with start of onset during observation period) were listed separately and not used for descriptive analysis of FU data. AEs assigned to the clinical observation period but changed after data base lock for the clinical observation period were also listed separately.

## Sample size

Planned:

50 (enrolment); 44 (evaluable without major protocol deviation)

## Analyzed:

Clinical observation period (PTD-1 + PTD 2): 54 screened (enrolled) patients; 52 randomized; 52 safety analysis set (SAF), 51 full analysis set (FAS), 49 per protocol set (PPS).

All 52 randomized patients entered the FU period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Follow-up period: 49 completed FU, 3 patients discontinued FU; 52 SAF-FUP, 47 FAS-FUP, 46 PPS-FUP

## Randomisation

Intra-individual comparison; BF-200 ALA (gel)/daylight and Metvix® (cream)/daylight were randomized to the respective sides of the patient's face and/or scalp with a ratio 1.1

## Blinding (masking)

Observer-blind

## Statistical methods

## Follow-up efficacy variables

FU efficacy variables were analyzed descriptively and in an exploratory way with both sets, the FASFUP and the PPS-FUP. Continuous data in the FU were summarized by using descriptive statistics, i.e. number of lesions/ patients/ patients' sides, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. Categorical data in the FU were presented by using frequency (counts) and percentages. In addition, the life table method was used to analyze recurrence rates.

Lesions with missing FU assessments were set to 'recurrent' for sensitivity FU analyses (conservative approach). Missing patient's satisfaction, skin quality assessments and overall cosmetic outcome on FU visits were not imputed.

## Follow-up safety variables

All safety variables were analyzed descriptively and in an exploratory way with the safety analysis set (SAFFUP).

## Recruitment/ Conduct of the study

Three patients discontinued during FU. Two patients discontinued the follow-up due to their own decision, one patient due to SAEs that were assessed as not related to one of the IMPs. This means 49 patients completed FU.

52 patients formed the SAF-FUP. 47 patients were in the FAS-FUP, 46 in the PPS-FUP.

## Baseline data

In the PPS-FUP (N=46), the mean ± SD age was 72.8 ± 7.3 years, with 5 (10.9%) patients &lt;65 years old, and 41 (89.1%) patients ≥65 years old. 95.7% of the patients were male. The Fitzpatrick skin type was I-III for 42 (91.3%) patients and IV-V for 4 (8.7%) patients. Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar for the SAF-FUP and the FAS-FUP.

There were a mean ± SD of 6.4 ± 2.2 target AK lesions at baseline for both, the BF-200 ALA/daylight PDTand Metvix®/daylight PDT-treated sides (PPS-FUP). The mean total area of target lesions was 528.7 ± 270.9 and 503.0 ± 239.1 mm² for the BF-200 ALA- and the Metvix®-treated sides of face and scalp, respectively (PPS-FUP). The SAF-FUP and FAS-FUP showed similar target lesion attributes.

## Numbers analysed

All patients initially randomised into the study 52 entered the FU (follow-up) period; 52 safety analysis set (SAF-FUP), 47 full analysis set (FAS-FUP), 46 per protocol set (PPS-FUP).

## Outcomes and estimation

Lesion recurrence rate is defined as the percentage of completely cleared individual lesions (grade 0 according to Olsen criteria) 12 weeks affer the PDT per patient's side showing recurence dhuing follow-up.

Lesion recurrence rate is only calculated for patients’ sides with at least one cleared lesion in the preceding visit.

- Subgroup analyses by treatment area, total area of AK lesions at baseline, maximum severity grade of AK lesions at baseline, and maximum number of target AK lesions per side at baseline are summarized in Table 14 for the PPS-FUP. Results were similar for the FAS-FUP (data not show).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the entire FU period (FU1, FU2), similar lesion recurrence rates per patient's side were observed for the treatment area 'face' and for patients with only mild lesions. Lower lesion recurrence rates for BF-200 ALA-treated sides compared with Metvix-treated sides were seen regarding the treatment area 'scalp', for patients with at least one moderate lesion, for patients with a total treatment area o f ≤ 1000 mm² or &gt; 1000 mm², and for patients with ≤ 5 lesions.

Only patients with sum of all baseline skin quality assessments &gt; 0 for both sides are considered inrespective of their lesion status duringFU.

The cosmetic outcome is caleulated for each patient's side on the basis of the skin quality assessment and is caleulated as follows:

Very good: The sum of all ratings for each skin quality sign has improved by at least 2 points as compared to baseline. If at least one sign has worsened by l point, the sum score must have improved by at least 3 points; Good: Sum score has improved by at least l point; Satisfactory: Sum score is identical to the one at baseline; Unsatisfactory: Sum score has worsened by 1 point; Impaired: Sum score has worsened by at least 2 points.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

## Study 010

In the scope of the current application for variation the MAH intends to extend the indication to the treatment on the trunk/neck and extremities, based on the phase III study 010. This study compares ALA (Ameluz)/ BF-RhodoLED lamp to placebo/ BF-RhodoLED lamp in the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis on extremities, trunk/ neck. It is a randomised, double-blind, intra-individual comparison (test product vs. placebo), multi-center study.

There were 50 patients in the SAF (safety analysis set; 26 female, 24 male), N=49 patients in the FAS, and N=43 patients in the PPS. Two patients in the FAS withdrew their consent during the study, but after their first study treatment. Drop-out in this study was low.

In the FAS, the mean age was 70.9 ± 8.4 years (mean ± SD), with 10 (20.4%) patients &lt;65 years old, and 39 (79.6%) patients ≥65 years old, including 16 (32.7%) patients ≥75 years old).

The Fitzpatrick skin type was I-III for 47 (95.9%) patients and IV-VI for 2 (4.1%) patients. Demographics were very similar for the PPS.

Thirty-nine (79.6%) patients were treated on the extremities and 10 (20.4%) patients on the trunk/neck (FAS).

There was a mean of 5.3 ± 1.1 and 5.5 ± 1.2 target AK lesions at baseline for the Ameluz- and placebo-treated sides, respectively. The mean total area of target lesions was 254.3 ± 125.5 mm² and 262.0 ± 124.0 mm² for the Ameluz- and placebo-treated sides, respectively. Together, 258 lesions and 268 lesions were treated with Ameluz and placebo, respectively.

93 (36.0%) Ameluz-treated lesions had a mild, 158 (61.2%) a moderate, and 7 (2.7%) a severe grade at baseline (according to Olsen), which was similar to the placebo-treated lesions with 109 (40.7%) mild, 152 (56.7%) moderate, and 7 (2.6%) severe lesions at baseline. The mean size of the target lesions was 48 ± 28.8 mm² for the Ameluz-treated lesions and 47.9 ± 26.7 mm² for the placebotreated lesions (all in the FAS). The PPS showed very similar target lesion attributes.

The duration of the clinical observation period was approx. 14 weeks for patients receiving one PDT and approx. 26 weeks for patients receiving two PDTs. The duration of the follow-up phase was resp. is 1 year and has not been reported yet, as the study is ongoing.

The primary efficacy parameter (total lesion clearance rate in percent per patient's side) was evaluated 12 weeks after last PDT.

## Study 009

Moreover, in the scope of this application for variation the MAH submitted the results of the 1-year follow-up (without treatment) of study 009.  This study compares ALA (Ameluz)/ daylight to Metvix/ daylight in the treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis of face and/or scalp. It is a randomised, observer-blind, intra-individual comparison (test product vs. active comparator), multi-center study. 50 patients were randomized.

The timing of PDTs (one resp. two PDTs) was the same as in study 010.

All 52 patients, which were initially randomized into study 009 entered the FU (follow-up) period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

52 patients formed the safety analysis set (SAF-FUP* [*= Follow-up population]). Drop-out was low, 47 full analysis set (FAS-FUP) and 46 per protocol set (PPS-FUP).

In the PPS-FUP (N=46), the mean ± SD age was 72.8 ± 7.3 years, with 5 (10.9%) patients &lt;65 years old, and 41 (89.1%) patients ≥65 years old. 95.7% of the patients were male. The Fitzpatrick skin type was I-III for 42 (91.3%) patients and IV-V for 4 (8.7%) patients. Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar for the SAF-FUP and the FAS-FUP.

There were a mean ± SD of 6.4 ± 2.2 target AK lesions at baseline for both, the Ameluz/daylight PDT and Metvix/daylight PDT-treated sides (PPS-FUP). The mean total area of target lesions was 528.7 ± 270.9 and 503.0 ± 239.1 mm² for the Ameluz- and the Metvix-treated sides of face and scalp, respectively (PPS-FUP). The SAF-FUP and FAS-FUP showed similar target lesion attributes.

During follow-up, the lesion recurrence rate of patients BF-200 ALA-treated sides was compared to Metvix-treated sides. The follow-up phase was without treatment.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## Study 010

The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of Ameluz with placebo for the treatment of mild to severe AK located on extremities and trunk/neck with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp.

The patients received one or two PDTs, depending on the lesion clearance. Retreatment was done in case the patient's lesion were not cleared completely on one side 12 weeks after the first PDT. 56% of the patients received two PDTs.

The study was designed as an intra-individual comparison, thus demographics for both treatment groups were the same. Moreover, baseline disease characteristics (e.g. number of lesions, lesion severity, total treatment area) for both patients' sides were comparable and allowed the assessment of the efficacy of Ameluz compared with placebo.

The primary efficacy variable, the total lesion clearance rate in percent per patient's side 12 weeks after the last PDT, defined as the percentage of individual lesions with complete remission on the respective side of the patient, was significantly higher for Ameluz treated sides than for placebotreated sides (86.0% ± 23.2% versus 32.9% ± 37.1%; FAS, LOCF), clearly demonstrating superiority of Ameluz over placebo (p&lt;0.0001; Wilcoxon signed rank test). The robustness of this result was confirmed by the PPS analysis (90.0% ± 19.5% versus 28.5% ± 36.7%; p&lt;0.0001; Wilcoxon signed rank test). Total lesion clearance rates for the treatment area trunk/neck were generally higher than for the treatment area extremities. Exploratory subgroup analyses by sex, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type category, and baseline AK severity showed results consistent with the primary analysis. Most of the results showed a statistically significant difference between both treatments. Few subgroups (e.g. baseline AK severity 'severe') included a limited number of patients such that the differences were not statistically significant, but numerically in favor of BF-200 ALA.

All confirmatory hypothesis testing of the secondary efficacy variables (including patient complete clearance, total lesion clearance rate of moderate lesions, total lesion clearance rate by treatment area, histopathologically confirmed lesion response rate, total lesion clearance rate 12 weeks after PDT-1, patient complete clearance 12 weeks after PDT-1, and cosmetic outcome) in the given hierarchical order showed statistically significant superiority of Ameluz® over placebo and supported the results of the primary efficacy analysis; in all instances, the PPS showed similar results.

Analysis of the patient complete clearance per patient's side 12 weeks after the last PDT showed higher responder rates with Ameluz than with placebo: 33 (67.3%) BF-200 ALA-treated sides and 6

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(12.2%) placebo-treated sides showed complete clearance of all treated AK lesions (p&lt;0.0001; McNemar test).

The HCR rate (histologically confirmed response) 12 weeks after the last PDT was higher for Ameluzthan for placebo-treated biopsied lesions (85.1% versus 63.8%; p=0.0032; McNemar test). One (2.1%) of the Ameluz-treated lesions, but 36.2% of the placebo-treated lesions were neither clinically nor histopathologically cleared.

Analyses of the cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT showed a significantly better effect of the Ameluz treatment compared to placebo (p&lt;0.0001; Wilcoxon signed rank test). 'Very good' or 'good' cosmetic outcomes were calculated for 28 (57.1%) patients on the Ameluz-treated sides and for 10 (20.4%) patients on the placebo-treated sides. 'Unsatisfactory' or 'impaired' cosmetic outcomes were calculated for more patients on the placebo-treated sides (19 [38.8%] patients) than on the Ameluz treated sides (12 [24.5%] patients).

Assessment of skin quality 12 weeks after the last PDT showed numerically higher proportions of improvement in most of the skin quality parameters for Ameluz treated sides compared with placebotreated sides. Improvement of skin surface was in favor of Ameluz, as demonstrated by nonoverlapping 95% CIs. Other skin quality parameters showed overlapping 95% CIs.

This study demonstrated the efficacy of Ameluz PDT in the treatment of AK lesions on extremities and trunk/neck: the primary efficacy variable and all secondary efficacy variables showed statistically significant superiority of Ameluz over placebo. Additional exploratory subgroup analyses showed consistent results. For small subgroups (e.g. baseline AK severity 'severe') the differences were not statistically significant, but numerically in favour of Ameluz.

## Study 009

No confirmatory tests were performed for the FU analysis. All FU efficacy variables were analyzed descriptively.

For the entire FU period (FU1, FU2), subgroup analyses revealed lower mean lesion recurrence rates for BF-200 ALA compared with Metvix® for patients with at least one moderate AK lesion at baseline, for AKs on the scalp, when treated at &gt;20°C, and during sunny weather; for patients with a total treatment area of ≤ 1000 mm² or &gt; 1000 mm², and for patients with ≤ 5 lesions. The other subgroups showed similar results between both study treatments.

The accumulated lesion recurrence rates per IMP for the entire FU period were 19.7% for BF-200 ALAtreated lesions and 27.1% for Metvix®-treated lesions for the PPS-FUP. Subgroup analyses for lesion recurrence rate per IMP revealed similar recurrence rates for the treatment area 'face', for mild lesions, for lesions treated at outdoor temperatures ≤ 20°C, and at cloudy or mixed weather during PDT.

Lower recurrence rates for BF-200 ALA-treated lesions compared with Metvix®-treated lesions were seen regarding the treatment area 'scalp', moderate lesions, lesions treated at outdoor temperatures &gt; 20°C, and at sunny weather during PDT.

The lower recurrence rates achieved with BF-200 ALA/daylight PDT are reflected in the 1-year estimated lesion-based clearance rates (pi*RLC) that are in favor for BF-200 ALA. The probability that BF-200 ALA-treated lesions are cleared 1 year after daylight PDT was 62.9% compared with 56.6% for Metvix®-treated lesions. pi*RLC values for the more difficult-to-treat lesions were 56.8% vs. 47.0% for the scalp, and 53.1% vs. 43.4% for all moderate lesions for BF-200 ALA and Metvix®, respectively (PPS-FUP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both treatment groups showed similar results during FU for patient recurrence rates, improvement in skin quality, cosmetic outcome, and patient's satisfaction.

The efficacy variables analyzed in the FU (follow-up) period were: lesion recurrence, patient recurrence, changes from baseline in skin quality and cosmetic outcome during the FU as well as patient's satisfaction on FU visits regarding PDT treatment and cosmetic outcome. All FU efficacy variables were analyzed descriptively.

Lesion recurrence rate assessments were based on the number of completely cleared AK lesions (per patient's side or per IMP) 12 weeks after daylight PDT. Overall, 1-year lesion recurrence rates for patient sides treated with Ameluz® gel were lower than for sides treated with Metvix® cream (19.9% vs. 31.6%; PPS-FUP). Subgroups analyses revealed lower mean recurrence rates for BF-200 ALA compared with Metvix® for patients with at least one moderate AK lesion at baseline (20.5% vs. 34.3%), for AKs on the scalp (23.4% vs. 43.7%), when treated at &gt;20°C (18.6% vs. 36.1%), and during sunny weather (18.7% vs. 39.9%); for patients with a total treatment area of ≤ 1000 mm² (21.0% vs. 36.4%) or &gt; 1000 mm² (18.8% vs. 26.4%), and for patients with ≤ 5 lesions (16.3% vs. 36.7%). The other subgroups showed similar results between both study treatments. Of all mild AKs treated with Ameluz® gel that were cleared 12 weeks after daylight PDT, 17.7% were recurrent after 1 year, compared with 19.3% of the lesions treated with Metvix®. Of all cleared moderate lesions, 22.1% of the Ameluz® treated lesions recurred during FU compared with 36.4% of the Metvix®treated lesions (PPS-FUP).

Patient recurrence rate assessments were based on the number of patients with all lesions on a specific side completely cleared (Olsen score of 0) 12 weeks after daylight PDT. Overall, patient recurrence rates were slightly lower for Ameluz® than for Metvix®. Furthermore, lower recurrence rates were observed for the first 6-month period (fromV4 to FU1) than for the second 6-month period (from FU1 to FU2). The accumulated patient recurrence rates for the entire FU period were 52.4% for Ameluz® treated sides and 58.8% for Metvix®-treated sides for the PPS-FUP. Similar results were observed for the FAS-FUP.

The analysis of changes in skin quality during the FU (including assessments of skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy) showed a trend towards improvement in most skin parameters from FU1 to FU2 in both treatment groups. Values for the Ameluz® treated sides ranged from 31.8% to 55.6% (FU1) and from 35.3% to 60.0% (FU2); values for the Metvix®-treated sides ranged from 25.0% to 55.6% (FU1) and from 26.3% to 55.6% (FU2) (only patients with at least mild impairment at baseline are included; PPSFUP).

The overall cosmetic outcome for patients with sum of all baseline skin quality assessments &gt; 0 was comparable between the treatment groups and the FU visits in the Per Protocol Set. It was assessed as 'very good or good' for 11 (37.97%) and 12 (41.3%) patients for Ameluz® and Metvix®, respectively, at FU1 (6 months after PDT) and for 14 (50.0%) and 13 (46.4%) patients for Ameluz® and Metvix®, respectively, at FU2 (1 year after PDT).

Patient's satisfaction regarding overall cosmetic outcome was 'very good, good or satisfactory' for 44 (95.7%) patients for both treatments at FU1 and for 41 (91.1%) and 42 (93.3%) patients for Ameluz/daylight PDT and Metvix®/daylight PDT, respectively, at FU2 (PPS-FUP). Overall, 45 (97.8%) patients at FU1 and 42 (93.3%) patients at FU2 stated that they would choose daylight PDT again (PPS-FUP). Similar results were observed for the FAS-FUP and for the PDT treatment in respect of the applied IMP.

## Pooled Analysis of the phase III studies of actinic keratosis of face and/or scalp

The efficacy from study 010 in the body region 'extremities and/or trunk/neck' was lower compared to the results presented for the body region 'face and/or scalp'. In study 010 the percentage of patients for whom all treated AK lesions were completely cleared 12 weeks after the last PDT was evaluated as secondary efficacy parameter. Analysis of the patient complete clearance per patient's side 12 weeks after the last PDT showed higher responder rates with Ameluz® (BF-200 ALA) than with placebo: 67.3% BF-200 ALA-treated sides and 12.2% placebo-treated sides showed complete clearance of all treated AK lesions (p&lt;0.0001; McNemar test). The difference between both treatment arms was 55.1%. In study 007, which evaluated PDT also with the narrow spectrum BF-RhodoLED, but in field-directed treatment of face/scalp, the efficacy of Ameluz compared to placebo was more pronounced. Ameluz was superior to placebo with respect to the primary efficacy parameter patient complete clearance rates (90.9% vs. 21.9%) for Ameluz and placebo, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001). The difference between both treatment arms was 69%.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Topical application of Ameluz® with PDT using BF-RhodoLED® was superior to placebo PDT for the treatment of mild to severe AK on extremities and trunk/neck. Results of the confirmatory analyses of all secondary efficacy variables also supported the superiority of Ameluz® over placebo.

The follow-up data from study 009 demonstrate daylight PDT with Ameluz® to be highly efficacious. One year after a single treatment, Ameluz® treated lesions showed lower recurrence rates than lesions treated with the marketed product Metvix®, especially for lesions of moderate severity and lesions on the scalp.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

In clinical trials with Ameluz, local skin reactions at the application site were observed in most of the subjects treated for actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma. This is to be expected as the therapeutic principle of photodynamic therapy is based on phototoxic effects of protoporphyrin IX which is synthesized from the active ingredient 5-aminolaevulinic acid.

The most common currently listed signs and symptoms are application site irritation, erythema, pain (incl. burning pain), and oedema. But also pruritus, scab, exfoliation, induration, paraesthesia are very frequent. All of these ADRs are listed with the frequency 'very common' in the SmPC.

The intensity of these effects is dependent on the type of illumination used for photodynamic therapy. The increased effects correlate with the higher clearance rate of narrow spectrum lamps (see SmPC section 5.1). Intensity of adverse reactions, particularly pain, was lower when Ameluz was used in combination with daylight PDT.

Most adverse reactions occur during illumination or shortly afterwards. The symptoms are usually of mild or moderate intensity (investigator's assessment on a 4-point scale), and last for 1 to 4 days in most cases; in some cases, however, they may persist for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. In rare cases, the adverse reactions required interruption or discontinuation of the illumination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patient exposure

## Study 010

The 1-year follow-up of this study is ongoing. Thus, safety data from this study refer to the clinical observation period only (including 12 weeks after last PDT).

All 50 patients in the SAF (safety analysis set) were exposed to PDT in the first session (Visit 2). 22 (44%) of them were completely cleared on one side 12 weeks after their first PDT and 28 (56%) patients were retreated during this visit. This means 56% of the patients received two PDTs.

During PDT-2, one of the patients accidently received BF-200 ALA on the placebo-assigned side and placebo on the BF-200 ALA-assigned side. This crossover was documented, and the patient was allocated to BF-200 ALA for both sides for safety analyses. In the FAS, the assignment of patients' sides to the treatment groups is as randomized.

On the day of PDT the skin was exposed for a mean of 185 minutes (range 177 to 200 min) to Ameluz resp. placebo gel. The 10 min-illumination time with the BF-RhodoLED lamp could have been interrupted for pain management but was performed without interruptions for all patients.

## Study 009 - FU

Daylight-Study 009 of the face/scalp is completed. The safety data presented in the scope of the current application for variation refer to the 1-year follow-up period of this study only. The 1-year FU was without application of study drug. In the preceding clinical study period BF-200 ALA/ daylight PDT was compared in an intra-individual comparison to Metvix/ daylight PDT in 52 patients. One session of PDT was applied. Daylight PDT was performed for 2 continuous hours in full daylight.

52 patients formed the SAF-FUP (safety analysis set of follow-up period).

## Adverse events

## Study 010

All 50 patients had at least one TEAE on the Ameluz® (BF-200 ALA)-treated side and 28 (56%) had at least one TEAE on the placebo-treated side. Furthermore, there were 20 (40%) patients with TEAEs that were not allocated to one treatment side ('relation to side not applicable'), which means that the TEAE was a general TEAE, e.g. a cold; 5 (10%) patients had a TEAE with an unknown location.

Related TEAEs were reported for 50 (100%) BF-200 ALA-treated sides, 22 (44%) placebo-treated sides, and 1 (2%) patient had a related TEAE without allocation to a specific treatment side. There was no TEAE that was leading to discontinuation or to death during the study.

## TEAE (Treatment emergent adverse events)

The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher on the BF-200 ALA-treated sides (100%) than on the placebo-treated sides (56%). In both groups, the most commonly reported TEAEs were those of the application site. The incidences of these TEAEs were also higher on the BF-200 ALA-treated sides than on the placebo-treated sides. Application site pain was the most common individual TEAE on both sides, reported for 50 (100%) patients on the BF-200 ALA-treated side and for 20 (40%) patients on the placebo-treated side.

N: mumber of patients; n: number of patients/patients' sides with event; SAF: Safety analysis set; SOC: system organ class; TEAE: treatment emergent adverse event

Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as all AEs with time of onset or worsening on or after the time of first dug application. If unclear due to incomplete start time/date of AE or PDT, AEs will be assumed as TEAEs.

Related TEAEs with relationship to investigational drug possibly, probably or definitely related, or with missing relationship.

## TEAES of severe intensity

On the verum treated side 40% of the patients had application site pain of severe intensity, whereas on the placebo-treated side only 12% of the patients. For further TEAEs with severe intensity please see the table below.

N: number of patients; n: number of patients/patients' sides with event; SAF: Safety analysis set; SOC: system organ class; TEAE: treatment emergent adverse event

Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as all AEs with time of onset or worsening on or after the time of first drug application. If umclear due to incomplete start time/date of AE or PDT, AEs will be assumed as TEAEs.

## Local Skin Reactions (LSR)

LSRs were documented as 'application site skin reactions' that started during illumination or after illumination on PDT day.

LSRs were reported for 42 (84%) patients on the BF-200 ALA-treated sides and for 9 (18%) patients on the placebo-treated sides, respectively. The most frequently reported LSR was erythema, reported for 42 (84%) patients on the BF-200 ALA-treated side and 7 (14%) patients on the placebo-treated side, followed by oedema which was reported for 35.9% resp. 0% of the patients on the verum resp. placebo treated side.

As expected, due to the nature of the procedure, the incidence and intensity of LSRs occurring during and after PDT was higher on the BF-200 ALA-treated sides compared with the placebo-treated sides (see table below).

## Local Discomfort (Burning, Itching, Other)

Local discomfort during PDT-1 was reported by 49 (98%) patients for the BF-200 ALA treated sides and by 16 (32%) patients for the placebo-treated sides. The most frequently reported local discomfort during PDT-1 was burning, reported for 48 (96%) patients on the BF-200 ALA-treated side and 16 (32%) patients on the placebo-treated side. Local discomfort rates during PDT-2 were similar, but incidences shifted to less severe and more moderate TEAEs rated as discomfort during and after PDT-2 compared with PDT-1 for the BF-200 ALA-treated sides.

N: number of patients; PDT: photodymamic therapy; SAF: safety analysis set; SD: standard deviation Patient's pain intensity during PDT is assessed at the end of each illumination period using a numeric rating pain scale ranging from no pain at all (0) to worst possible pain (10).

Patients reported higher mean pain intensities for BF-200 ALA-treated sides compared with placebotreated sides for both, PDT-1 and PDT-2, but mean pain intensity for BF-200 ALA treated sides was lower during PDT-2 than during PDT-1. Actions taken against pain during/after PDT included cooling with the airstream integrated in the BF-RhodoLED® lamp and the use of cooling pads after the PDT. In no case, PDT had to be interrupted

The phase III study 010 included 50 patients with actinic keratosis. 12 weeks after last PDT the most common related TEAEs at the application site that had not resolved yet were erythema (16x), followed by application site pruritus (3x), application site scab (3x), exfoliation (2x), oedema (1x). Most of the application site TEAEs that had not recovered at week 12 were mild or moderate. Only single TEAEs that had not recovered at week 12 after PDT were of severe intensity: erythema (1x), pruritus (1x) and induration (1x), at the application site each.

## New Lesions

Three (6%) patients presented with new lesions on the side assigned to BF-200 ALA, all lesions were located outside the treatment field. One patient each had a new BCC, a new SCC, and a new AK lesion; the latter was located outside the treatment subarea but within the treatment area, all the others were located outside the treatment area.

Three (6%) patients presented with new lesions on the side assigned to placebo. One patient each had a new keratoacanthoma, a new BCC, and a new AK lesion; the latter was located inside the treatment field.

## Study 009, follow-up data

In total, 37 (71.2%) patients experienced at least one AE that started or worsened in the FU.

None of these was assessed by the investigator as possibly, probably, or definitely related to one of the IMPs. Three (5.8%) patients experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE); one discontinued due to SAEs, but none of the AEs was leading to death. Results were comparable between BF-200 ALA- and Metvix®-treated patient's sides (see table 25 below).

Only relevant AEs had to be reported during follow-up:

- Any relevant local adverse events (AEs) or conditions that may impair a proper assessment of the recurrence rate of the treated AK lesions as well as any SAE that have occurred since the end of the clinical study period
- New lesions (AK, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), melanoma) on follow-up visits per patient's side,

Therefore, the most frequently reported PT during FU was the underlying disease - actinic keratosis from the SOC 'skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders'. AK was reported for 23 (44.2%) patients' sides treated with BF-200 ALA or Metvix®, respectively, and for 9 (17.3%) patients, where the respective side was unknown.

Most of the AEs were of mild intensity. Only two patients (3.8%) experienced a total of three severe AEs (facial bones fracture, wrist fracture, actinic keratosis). None of the severe AEs was considered to be related to the IMPs. Most AEs resolved by the end of the FU.

Apart from actinic keratosis only few AEs were reported during FU:

1x hyperglycemia (resolved), 1x hypertonus (not resolved), dehydration (resolved), 1x impetigo lower arm (resolved), 1x application site dermatitis on scalp (resolved), 1x tinea versicolor (ongoing), 1x eczema asteatotic (resolved), 1x nasopharyngitis (resolved).

Further details on the occurrence of new lesions are provided below:

## Occurrence of new lesions

New lesions occurred in 33 (63.5%) patients. 32 (61.5%) patients presented new AK lesions and 4 (7.7%) patients had other NMSC lesions. 15 (28.8%) patients had new lesions that where not located in the treatment area (face, scalp); 21 (40.4%) patients that were treated on the scalp presented new lesion on the scalp and 9 (17.3%) patients that were treated on the face had new lesions on the face. Most of the new lesions that occurred inside the treatment area were ≥ 10 mm away from the nearest target lesion (data not shown); thus, the respective area with the new lesion was not treated during the study .

For new lesions inside the treated areas face and scalp during the FU period please see Table 26 below. None of the new lesions was considered to be related to one of the IMPs.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Study 010

There were no deaths. According to the investigator all 7 SAEs during the clinical observation period of the study were clearly unrelated to the study treatment:

Acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, humerus fracture, intervertebral disc protrusion, actinic keratosis, mechanical ileus, cervicobrachial syndrome) were reported for 5 (10%) patients during the clinical observation period of the study.

## Study 009 - FU

There were no deaths. All SAE - apart from vestibular neuronitis - during the follow-up were clearly unrelated to the study treatment.

Overall, 8 SAEs (anal abscess, pelvic abscess, urinary tract infection, vestibular neuronitis [8 months after treatment with Ameluz/PDT], facial bone fracture, wrist fracture, dehydration, cerebrovascular accident) were reported for 3 (8.5%) patients in the FU. All SAEs were assessed by the investigators as unrelated to study medication.

One patient (1.9%) discontinued the FU period due to SAEs (fracture of the cheekbone and the wrist as a consequence of a fall and hospitalization). It is agreed to the MAH and investigator that this SAE and the other SAE are not related to Ameluz/PDT.

SAEs associated to patients' side treated with Ameluz: 1 patient with vestibular neuronitis.

SAEs associated to patients' side treated with Metvix:  0

SAEs with relation to side not applicable: Seven SAEs: anal abscess, pelvic abscess, urinary tract infection, facial bones fracture, wrist fracture, dehydration, cerebrovascular accident.

All SAEs and severe AEs resolved by the end of the FU except for one event, that remained resolving at the end of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory findings

## Study 010

Hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis data were examined for changes that occurred during the clinical observation period. Clinical laboratory safety tests were performed at screening (Visit 1) and 12 weeks after PDT-1 (Visit 4) or 12 weeks after PDT-2 if patients were retreated (Visit 6).

There were no clinically meaningful findings at screening, whereas 12 weeks after the last PDT one patient had an abnormal glucose value.

Urinanalysis: There was one clinically meaningful finding at screening (specific gravity), which was due to a medical condition at that time, whereas 12 weeks after the last PDT no abnormal value was observed.

Vital signs: Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured at each clinical visit, after 5 minutes of rest in a sitting position. Mean values for blood pressure and heart rate were similar at all visits, and mean changes from baseline to week 12 were minimal.

## Study 009 - FU

No blood samples were taken during the follow-up.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No interaction studies have been performed (see SmPC).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Study 010

There was no AE leading to discontinuation of the study.

## Study 009 - FU

One patient (1.9%) discontinued in the FU period due to SAEs (fracture of the cheekbone and the wrist and hospitalization as a consequence of a fall).

## Post marketing experience

World-wide marketing safety experience

Ameluz (BF-200 ALA gel) was authorized for marketing in the EU on December 14, 2011. Ameluz is currently on the market in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Spain, and the UK.

Marketing authorization for the USA was granted on May 10, 2016; Ameluz was launched in October 2016.

Furthermore, Ameluz was approved in November 2015 in Switzerland (launch April 2016) and in April 2016 in Israel (launch June 2017).

The cumulative post-authorization exposure since the international birth date (IBD) has been estimated at 364,721 2g-units/patient (based on the available sales figures since IBD until July 3st, 2019). The AEs reported during post-marketing are in agreement with the main AEs observed during clinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

## Study 010

Safety data from the placebo-controlled phase III study 010 have been presented. This is the first study with Ameluz/BF-RhdoLED PTD in actinic keratosis in the region 'extremities/trunk/neck'. Up to now, the list of ADRs in the SmPC, section 4.8, refers to red-light PDT and daylight-PDT of actinic keratosis in the face/scalp and red-light PDT of basal cell carcinoma (face/scalp and/or all other body parts). Most of the treatment-related application site reactions reported for study 010 are listed in the SmPC, section 4.8, and most of them with the same frequency category.

The ADRs which were observed in study 010 but are not listed ADRs were:

In one patient (2.0%) 'eczema' was reported in the Ameluz/BF-RhdoLED PTD treatment site (application site reaction). For one patient each (2.0%) 'dry skin', 'swelling', resp. 'skin tightness' was observed on the Ameluz/BF-RhdoLED PTD treated site (but obviously these were no direct application site reaction). Consequently, 'eczema infected', 'swelling' and 'skin tightness' were added to SmPC section 4.8.

All 50 patients in the safety analysis set had PDT-1. 56% of the patients received a second PDT (=PDT-2). At least one TEAE was reported for all 50 (100%) patients' sides treated with Ameluz and 28 (56%) patients' sides treated with placebo. Application site pain was the most common individual TEAE in both groups, reported for 100% sides treated with Ameluz resp. for 40% sides treated with placebo; it was followed by application site erythema, reported for 90% resp. 14% patients' sides; application site pruritus (48% resp. 18%); application site oedema (32% resp. 0%); application site scab (30% resp. 4%); application site exfoliation (24% resp. 2%); and application site vesicles (18% resp. 6%) patients' sides. Analysis of severity revealed, that the most commonly reported severe TEAE was application site pain, reported by 40% patients for BF-200 ALA-treated sides and by 12% patients for placebo-treated sides. No patient discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs for both treatments were also the most commonly reported related TEAEs.

Six (12%) patients reported SAEs, all of which were assessed by the investigator as not related to the study medication (acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, humerus fracture, intervertebral disc protrusion, actinic keratosis, mechanical ileus, cervicobrachial syndrome). No deaths occurred.

No pregnancies were reported during the study. Laboratory parameters, vital signs variables, and results of physical examination showed no clinically relevant changes related to the study treatment.

On the sides treated with Ameluz, new lesions occurred only outside the treatment fields, whereas on the sides treated with placebo, one new AK lesion occurred within a treatment field.

The profile of TEAE findings is generally consistent with the elderly AK patient population represented in this study, the nature of the underlying disease, and the known safety profile of Ameluz. Local application site AEs associated with the treatment lasted for less than two weeks after PDT in most cases.

No new safety concern requiring an update of the RMP was identified.

## Study 009 - FU

All 52 patients initially randomized entered the 1-year follow-up and only one patient discontinued from the FU due to an SAE. The safety data presented within the current scope of the application for variation refer to the FU period only. In the SAF-FUP (safety analysis set of follow up) the mean age was 72.2 years (range 48 to 85 years). 96.2% of the patients were male. 92.3% of the patients had skin type Fitzpatrick I-III.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the follow-up no IMPs were applied. During FU one or more AEs were reported for 48.1% of patients regarding the Ameluz/daylight PDT-treated sides and for 44.2% patients regarding the Metvix)/daylight PDT-treated sides. Most of the AEs were of mild intensity. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was the system organ class (SOC) in which AEs in FU were most commonly reported in both treatment groups. Due to the reporting of new lesions, AK was the most common preferred term in both groups (reported for 44.2% of Metvix and 42.3% of Ameluz-treated sides). Most of these new lesions were ≥ 10 mm away from the nearest target lesion, which means that the respective area was not treated during the study. Basal cell carcinoma occurred in 2 patients inside the Ameluz treated area and Bowen's disease occurred in one patient inside the Metvix treated area. None of the AEs/ new lesions was considered related to one of the IMPs.

Overall, 8 SAEs (anal abscess, pelvic abscess, urinary tract infection, vestibular neuronitis [8 months after treatment with Ameluz/PDT], facial bone fracture, wrist fracture, dehydration, cerebrovascular accident) were reported for 3 (8.5%) patients in the FU. All SAEs were assessed by the investigators as unrelated to study medication. One patient (1.9%) discontinued the FU period due to SAEs (fracture of the cheekbone and the wrist as a consequence of a fall and hospitalization). It is agreed that this SAE is not related to Ameluz/PDT.

No deaths or other significant AEs were reported in the FU phase of the study. No pregnancies occurred. All SAEs and most of the other AEs resolved by the end of the FU.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile from study 010 was predominantly in line with the currently listed ADRs of Ameluz. Most of the treatment-related application site reactions reported for study 010 are listed in the SmPC, section 4.8. and most of them with the same frequency category.

The profile of relevant AE findings in the follow-up of study 009 was generally consistent with the AK population represented in the study, the nature of the underlying disease, and the known safety profile of Ameluz and Metvix. All documented AEs during FU were considered unrelated to the IMPs. As new lesion had to be documented as AE, the occurrence of actinic keratosis was the most reported AE during follow-up (reported for 44.2% of Metvix and 42.3% of Ameluz-treated sides). The safety during follow-up was comparable between Ameluz/daylight PDT-treated sides and for Metvix/daylight PDTtreated sides.

The SAEs were generally not related to the study drugs and no new (significant) safety concern was identified from the data presented within this application.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate severity on the trunk, neck and/or extremities.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

The appropriate treatment for AK is generally chosen based on the number and location of the lesions present. Treatment options belong to 2 broad categories: surgical destruction of the lesions (e.g. using cryotherapy or curettage with or without electrosurgery, laser) and medical therapy. Surgical destruction is restricted to limited areas and frequently associated with a flawed cosmetic result. Topical pharmaceutical therapy allows the treatment of extended areas with many AK lesions, and generally affords a treatment duration of several weeks. The following medications for the treatment of AK are approved:

- Topical 1% and 5% 5-fluorouracil cream (e.g. Efudix; twice daily for several weeks).
- Topical 5% imiquimod cream (e.g. Aldara; trice weekly for 4 to 8 weeks).
- Topical 3% diclofenac gel (eg Solaraze; twice daily for 60 to 90 days)
- Topical 70 μg/1 g gel ingenol mebutate (e.g. Picato; once daily for 3 consecutive days)
- Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA; Ameluz) or methylaminolevulinic acid (MAL; Metvix)

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

ALA-AK-CT010 is a randomized, double-blind, intra-individual, multi-center Phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) versus placebo in the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis on extremities, trunk/ neck with photodynamic therapy (PDT) when using the BFRhodoLED lamp.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The primary efficacy variable, the total lesion clearance rate in percent per patient's side 12 weeks after the last PDT, defined as the percentage of individual lesions with complete remission on the respective side of the patient, was significantly higher for Ameluz treated sides than for placebotreated sides (86.0% ± 23.2% versus 32.9% ± 37.1%), clearly demonstrating superiority of Ameluz over placebo (p&lt;0.0001; Wilcoxon signed rank test). The robustness of this result was confirmed by the PPS analysis (90.0% ± 19.5% versus 28.5% ± 36.7%; p&lt;0.0001; Wilcoxon signed rank test).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Exploratory subgroup analyses by sex, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type category, and baseline AK severity showed results consistent with the primary analysis. Most of the results showed a statistically significant difference between both treatments. The differences were not statistically significant, but numerically in favour of Ameluz in a few subgroups (e.g. baseline AK severity 'severe') with limited number of patients .

All confirmatory hypothesis testing of the secondary efficacy variables (e.g. analysis of the patient complete clearance, HCR [histopathologically confirmed lesion response] and cosmetic outcome) in the given hierarchical order showed statistically significant superiority of Ameluz over placebo and supported the results of the primary efficacy analysis.; in all instances, the PPS showed similar results.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The rate of lesions assessed as fully cleared by the investigator and simultaneously cleared according to histopathology of a small biopsy were lower in both groups: only 70.2% in the Ameluz and 19.1 % in the placebo group. Moreover, a high rate (44.7%) of lesions was not cleared according to the investigator's assessment but cleared according to histopathology in the placebo group.

Due to the following, extrapolation from narrow-spectrum red light to other types of PDT (PDT with broad spectrum red light lamp and PDT with daylight) without data is not possible:

- -uncertainty in difference in skin thickness between treatment regions and consequences on skin penetration with different PDTs. E.g. efficacy on AKs on the scalp is consistently lower than that on the face, with thinner skin.
- -the complete clearance rate (67.3% [secondary efficacy parameter]) in the study 010 in trunk/neck/extremities is lower than in face/scalp in the previous study 007, (90.9% [primary efficacy parameter]) (see p. 39 of AR). In both studies narrow-spectrum red light was used.
- -concerning daylight PDT: possibly insufficient exposure to daylight and suboptimal angle of light in treating trunk/neck/extremities.

Therefore, narrow-spectrum red light for the treatment of AK on the trunk/neck/extremities has been specified in SmPC section 4.2.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The safety profile from study 010 was predominantly in line with the currently listed ADRs of Ameluz. ADRs occurred in 100% of Ameluz-treated and 44% of placebo-treated sides. Most of the treatmentrelated application site reactions reported for study 010 are listed in the SmPC, section 4.8. and most of them with the same frequency category. The most frequent ADRs on the Ameluz compared to placebo treated sides were reactions at the application site: pain (100% vs. 40), erythema (90% vs. 14%), pruritus (48% vs. 18%), oedema (32%), scab (30%) and exfoliation (24%). There were only few ADRs, currently not listed in the SmPC, which were observed in study 010: In one patient (2.0%) 'eczema' was reported in the Ameluz/BF-RhdoLED PTD treatment site (application site reaction). For one patient each (2.0%) 'dry skin', 'swelling', resp. 'skin tightness' was observed on the Ameluz/BFRhdoLED PTD treated site (but these were not direct application site reaction).

The phase III study 010 included 50 patients with actinic keratosis. 12 weeks after last PDT the most common related TEAEs at the application site that had not resolved yet were erythema (16x), followed by application site pruritus (3x), application site scab (3x), exfoliation (2x), oedema (1x). Most of the application site TEAEs that had not recovered at week 12 were mild or moderate. Only single TEAEs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that had not recovered at week 12 after PDT were of severe intensity: erythema (1x), pruritus (1x) and induration (1x), at the application site each.

No deaths occurred and SAEs were considered unrelated by the investigator.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The results of the study demonstrated that the treatment of AK lesions on the extremities and trunk/neck with Ameluz is efficacious, with good cosmetic outcome and high patient satisfaction. The primary efficacy variable was significantly higher for Ameluz treated sides than for placebo-treated sides, clearly demonstrating superiority of Ameluz over placebo. Results in the Full Analysis Set are robust as only 2 patients did withdraw from the study and robustness of this result was confirmed by the PPS analysis. Exploratory subgroup analyses by demographic and baseline disease characteristics showed results consistent with the primary analysis. Most of the results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between both treatments. The number of patients in some subgroups, like the subgroup 'baseline AK severity severe', was too small to show statistically significant improvements, but results were numerically favorable for Ameluz. The confirmatory analyses of the secondary efficacy variables for the FAS supported the superiority of Ameluz over placebo shown in the primary analysis. The results demonstrated significant treatment effects of Ameluz compared with placebo in all secondary efficacy variables tested in the predefined hierarchical order.

The safety profile from study 010 was predominantly in line with the listed ADRs in the SmPC.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The previously authorised indication of Ameluz was restricted to AK on the face and scalp. The results of study 010 demonstrated that the treatment of AK lesions on extremities/trunk/neck with Ameluz is efficacious, with no new safety concerns. Considering the known safety profile of Ameluz, it can be concluded that the benefits of photodynamic therapy with Ameluz when using the BF-RhodoLED for the treatment of actinic keratosis on extremities/trunk/neck outweigh its risks.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Based on the results of the phase III study 010 and the previous clinical trial program of Ameluz, sufficient efficacy of Ameluz in the scope of broad spectrum red-light or daylight PDT in the region extremities/trunk/neck cannot be anticipated, although this has been established for the face/scalp region. Apart from the absence of data to support the use of daylight PDT and broad spectrum redlight PDT in the region trunk/neck/extremities, moreover, especially daylight PDT might not be appropriate for the treatment of extremities/trunk/neck. The angle of irradiation is of importance. With daylight PDT there are practical concerns as it will be difficult to achieve effective UV-light irradiation for trunk and extremities, taking into consideration the probable unfavourable angle of radiation. With red-light PTD a focussed irradiation is guaranteed. Please see also the publication 'Photodynamic and photobiological effects of light-emitting diode (LED) therapy in dermatological disease: an update; Sorbellini E et al.; September 2018, Volume 33, Issue 7, pp 1431-1439'. The authors explain, that the 'penetration into the skin is dependent on the wavelength'. They conclude that wavelength, irradiation, power density, and treatment time period can influence clinical outcomes.

Better efficacy of Ameluz/narrow-spectrum red-light PDT compared to Ameluz/broad-spectrum redlight PDT in actinic keratosis of the face/scalp is seen from the pooled efficacy results of the studies 002, 003 and 007. In the studies, different sources of red-light (narrow resp. broad spectrum lamps) were applied. Separate analysis of the different light sources revealed, that narrow spectrum lamps (e.g. BF-RhodoLED) were more efficacious compared to broad-spectrum lamps. It is clearly stated in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the SmPC of Ameluz that narrow spectrum lamps were more efficacious in the treatment of AK of the face/scalp.

Therefore, SmPC Section 4.2 has been updated to clarify that a treatment of actinic keratosis in the region 'extremities/trunk/neck' is indicated in the scope of PDT with the narrow spectrum BFRhodoLED lamp only, but does not refer to PDT with broad spectrum red-light or daylight.

In the scope of the current variation, the 1-year follow-up data of the phase III study 009 daylight PDT on face/scalp have been presented. One year after a single PDT, Ameluz treated lesions showed numerically lower recurrence rates than lesions treated with the marketed product Metvix (19.5% as compared to 31.2%). Nevertheless, during the study treatment-free follow-up period, the most frequently documented concomitant medications applied to treat new or remaining lesions were 'antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents' and 'dermatologicals'. 15 (28.8%) patients received topical antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, and 12 (23.1%) patients received dermatologicals (Ameluz, Luxerm, Actikerall, Picato, Zyklara, and Solaraze were applied). Concomitant medications were applied during or after follow-up in Ameluz treatment fields, Metvix treatment fields and outside the treatment fields. On the Ameluz treatment area 3 new lesions and on the Metvix treatment area 4 new lesions occurred during follow-up in close vicinity (&lt;15 mm) to a treated lesion. All were treated concurrently and with the same medication as non-responding or recurrent lesions. For the calculation of recurrence, lesions displaying total clearance 12 weeks after PDT (at Visit 4) and assigned at least to the FAS FU analysis set were considered. Once a lesion was assessed as recurrent at the FU1 or FU2 visit, the lesion kept the status 'recurrent' until the end of the study, irrespective of whether the lesion was treated and cured afterwards or not. New and non-responding lesions were not included for recurrence evaluation. During FU, only single lesions were treated; no field treatment was applied. On the Ameluz side, a total of 13 of the 47 patients in the FAS received concomitant medications due to treatment of non-responding or recurrent AKs. Because of the higher number of non-responding or recurrent lesions on the Metvix side, 17 of the 47 patients received treatments on that side. The MAH calculated the average recurrence rate per lesion with or without concomitant treatment during FU, and observed 6/37 (16.2%) recurrent lesions in Ameluz patients after treatment with, and 30/207 (14.5%) recurrent lesions on Ameluz patients without concomitant treatment prior to FU2, respectively. For Metvix, 8/45 (17.8%) lesions on average were recurrent on patients after treatment with and 43/189 (22.8%) lesions on patients without concomitant treatments, respectively.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Ameluz is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variations accepted   | Variations accepted                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I, II and IIIA     |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| C.I.6.a   | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one   | Type II   | I and IIIB   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|

Extension of indication to include the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis on extremities, trunk and neck for Ameluz; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. In addition, section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated based on follow-up data from study ALA-AK-CT009, a randomised, observer-blind, intra-individual phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ameluz (5-aminolevulinic acid) in combination with daylight PDT (photodynamic therapy) in comparison with methyl-5-aminolevulinate for the treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis. Additionally, the PI was adapted to the new QRD template version 10.1.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annex(es) I, II, IIIA and IIIB are recommended.
