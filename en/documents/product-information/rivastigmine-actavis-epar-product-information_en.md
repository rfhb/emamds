## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia.

Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

Rivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules should be swallowed whole.

## Initial dose

1.5 mg twice a day.

## Dose titration

The starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.

If adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. If adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated dose or the treatment may be discontinued.

## Maintenance dose

The effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a day.

Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. Therefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for patients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment the patient's rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be discontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present.

Individual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen in Parkinson's disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in Parkinson's disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1).

Treatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months.

## Re-initiation of therapy

If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. However, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied, however, Rivastigmine Actavis capsules may be used in this patient population provided close monitoring is exercised (see section 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of rivastigmine in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Previous history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine patch (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

The incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the possibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).

Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis.

Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3).

Patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form.

There have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis (disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3).

Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly.

Dose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer's dementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may respond to a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).

Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur particularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration resulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose reduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with serious outcomes.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, have been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient's weight should be monitored.

In case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as recommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments or high doses of rivastigmine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

products including rivastigmine. Rivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing, or a family history of, QTc prolongation or at higher risk of developing torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant use with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes. Clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).

Care must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).

Rivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.

Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.

Cholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended in treating patients predisposed to such diseases.

The use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer's disease or associated with Parkinson's disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related cognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not recommended.

Like other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. Worsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or severity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. discontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on rivastigmine vs. 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is recommended for these adverse reactions.

## Special populations

Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, rivastigmine may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary.

Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely to discontinue due to adverse reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed.

In view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine).

Additive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the combined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular betablockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in patients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is combined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, calcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of rivastigmine with QT prolongation- or torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as antipsychotics i.e. some phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required.

No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.

According to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, although rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

In pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs in humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

In animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.

## Fertility

No adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see section 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Alzheimer's disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when initiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on rivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38 %) and vomiting (23 %), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Most cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose.

Cholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate poisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary urination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion.

In more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures and respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome.

Additionally there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, confusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise.

## Management

As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary.

In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is not recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03

Rivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by functionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on cholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

Rivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that temporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40 % within the first 1.5 hours after administration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum inhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF by rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar to that of AChE.

## Clinical studies in Alzheimer's dementia

The efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain specific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. These include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale, a performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Change-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating caregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities relating to finances, etc.).

The patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10-24.

The results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three pivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's Dementia, are provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10 % improvement on the PDS.

In addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition of response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the CIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6-12 mg group, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this indication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid.

Clinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease

The efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has been demonstrated in a 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label extension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10-24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at regular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a measure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative StudyClinician's Global Impression of Change).

Although a treatment effect was demonstrated in the overall study population, the data suggested that a larger treatment effect relative to placebo was seen in the subgroup of patients with moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Similarly a larger treatment effect was observed in those patients with visual hallucinations (see Table 6).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with rivastigmine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia and in the treatment of dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Rivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine's interaction with its target enzyme, the increase in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. Absolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 %±13 %. Administration of rivastigmine with food delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30 %.

## Distribution

Protein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40 %. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg.

## Biotransformation

Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro , this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (&lt;10 %).

Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products metabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose.

## Elimination

Unchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of elimination. Following administration of 14 C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (&gt;90 %) within 24 hours. Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of rivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer's disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) following rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day.

## Elderly

While bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in Alzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age.

## Hepatic impairment

The Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60 % higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects.

## Renal impairment

Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.

Rivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 10 4 times the maximum clinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not show a genotoxic potential.

No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, although the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When normalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the maximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals.

In animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents.

A mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

## What is in this leaflet :

1. What Rivastigmine Actavis is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Rivastigmine Actavis
3. How to take Rivastigmine Actavis
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Rivastigmine Actavis
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Rivastigmine Actavis is and what it is used for

The active substance of Rivastigmine Actavis is rivastigmine.

Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with Alzheimer's dementia or dementia due to Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Rivastigmine Actavis allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease.

Rivastigmine Actavis is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and behaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult patients with Parkinson's disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Rivastigmine Actavis

## Do not take Rivastigmine Actavis

- if you are allergic to rivastigmine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch.

If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Rivastigmine Actavis.

## Warnings and precautions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Talk to your doctor before taking Rivastigmine Actavis:

- if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood level of potassium or magnesium.
- if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer.
- if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine.
- if you have, or have ever had, seizures.
- if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease.
- if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function.
- if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function.
- if you suffer from trembling.
- if you have a low body weight.
- if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are prolonged.

If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this medicine.

If you have not taken Rivastigmine Actavis for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have talked to your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

There is no relevant use of Rivastigmine Actavis in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

## Other medicines and Rivastigmine Actavis

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Rivastigmine Actavis should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Rivastigmine Actavis. Rivastigmine Actavis might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or spasms, to treat Parkinson's disease or to prevent travel sickness).

Rivastigmine Actavis should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff limbs and trembling hands.

If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Rivastigmine Actavis, tell your doctor before you are given any anaesthetics, because Rivastigmine Actavis may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during anaesthesia.

Caution when Rivastigmine Actavis is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness.

Caution when Rivastigmine Actavis is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or the electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation).

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Rivastigmine Actavis must be assessed against the possible effects on your unborn child. Rivastigmine Actavis should not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You should not breast-feed during treatment with Rivastigmine Actavis.

## Driving and using machines

Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. Rivastigmine Actavis may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing the dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your attention.

## 3. How to take Rivastigmine Actavis

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.

## How to start treatment

Your doctor will tell you what dose of Rivastigmine Actavis to take.

- Treatment usually starts with a low dose.
- Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to treatment.
- The highest dose that should be taken is 6.0 mg twice a day.

Your doctor will regularly check if the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will also monitor your weight whilst you are taking this medicine.

If you have not taken Rivastigmine Actavis for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have talked to your doctor.

## Taking this medicine

- Tell your caregiver that you are taking Rivastigmine Actavis.
- To benefit from your medicine, take it every day.
- Take Rivastigmine Actavis twice a day, in the morning and evening, with food.
- Swallow the capsules whole with a drink.
- Do not open or crush the capsules.

## If you take more Rivastigmine Actavis than you should

If you accidentally take more Rivastigmine Actavis than you should, inform your doctor. You may require medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Rivastigmine Actavis have experienced feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow heartbeat and fainting may also occur.

## If you forget to take Rivastigmine Actavis

If you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Rivastigmine Actavis, wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
