## 1. INTRODUCTION

Celvapan is a pandemic H1N1v vaccine. The strain change of the mock-up vaccine from H5N1 to H1N1v  was  approved  on  06/10/2009  (EMEA/H/C/982/PU/02).  As  committed  by  the  marketing authorisation  holder  (MAH),  preliminary  safety  data  from  the  ongoing  clinical  trial  in  adults  and elderly  evaluating  different  H1N1v  vaccine  formulations  was  submitted.  Additional  data  from  the ongoing trial in adults and elderly evaluating different H5N1 vaccine formulation was submitted. Postmarketing experience was reflected in the first sPSUR. Following assessment of this data, the MAH was requested to  update the  product information  to  reflect  the  current  safety  information  available. The variation was submitted on 2 December 2009.

2. CLINICAL Assessment Study 820902 adults (including the elderly) Design and demographics of clinical study 820902 Study 820902 is a phase I/II prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre study designed to assess immunogenicity and safety of an investigational H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy subjects aged 18 years of age and older. Primary Objective The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  measure  the  immune  response,  as  determined  by  HI (haemagglutination inhibition) assay. Secondary Objectives · To assess the immune response as determined by microneutralisation (MN) assay · To identify the optimal dose level of an investigational H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine · To investigate the safety characteristics Subjects were recruited in equal numbers to two age strata of 18 to 59 years of age (Stratum A) and 60 years of age and older (Stratum B). Within each stratum, subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of the whole virion, Vero cell-derived influenza vaccine at the same dose level of either 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of H1N1v (A/California/07/2009) HA antigen (Cohort 1) on Day 1 and Day 22. Cohort 1 consists of approximately 400 subjects (200 adults, 200 elderly). Enrolment  started  in  August  2009  and  411  adult  and  elderly  subjects  were  included  in  cohort  1. Subjects of cohort 1 were vaccinated twice with 7.5 µ g or 3.75 µ g HA of the pandemic vaccine 21 days apart. Currently safety data base (n= 408) of 21 days after each vaccination is available.

## Summary of Preliminary Day 22 Safety results

The safety data provided differentiate between the two administered dose groups 3.75 µ g and 7.5 µ g, and distinguish between the two age groups of adults and elderly subjects.

The preliminary analysis of the safety data base throughout a 21 days observation period after the first vaccination  demonstrates  a  favourable  safety  profile  in  regards  to  solicited  local  and  systemic reactions (Table 1).

Local  reactions  were  considered  by  subjects  always  mild  and  only  for  one  case  it  was  recorded  as unknown severity. Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First and Second Vaccination The  majority  of  subjects  experienced  no  systemic  reactions  within  7  days  after  either  vaccination. After the first vaccination, rates of subjects who reported systemic reactions were 18.8% and 12.5% in the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A and 16.8% and 11.8% in the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum B (Table 1). Rates  of  subjects  who  reported  systemic  reactions  within  7  days  after  the  second  vaccination  were generally slightly lower: 13.1% and 13.6% in the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A and 8.9% and 10.0% in the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum B (Table 2). Overall, the majority of systemic reactions were mild and none were severe (Table 14.3-10 and Table 14.3-11). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Certain  symptoms  of  systemic  reactions  (fatigue,  headache,  sweating,  muscle  pain,  joint  pain, shivering and fever1 with onset later than Day 6 after vaccination) were specifically queried in the subject  diary.  Fatigue and headache  were  the  most frequently  reported  symptoms  overall.  After the first vaccination, there was a slightly higher risk of experiencing fatigue, headache, joint pain, muscle pain or sweating, with the 7.5 µg dose observed relative to the 3.75 µg dose in Stratum A, and for all symptoms except shivering in Stratum B.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fever

No fever with onset within 7 days after either vaccination was reported in Stratum A; in Stratum B, one  incidence  of  mild  fever  occurred  within  7  days  after  the  first  vaccination  among  subjects  who received a 3.75 µg vaccine dose.

## SAEs

Two serious adverse events (SAEs) considered unrelated occurred within 21 days after vaccination:

- pulmonary embolism (10 days after vaccination) and

Subjects were enrolled into three cohorts as follows:

· one case of dialysis of the retina of the right eye; the patient was hospitalised for surgery. Some events, which might be summarised as allergic reactions were observed, such as burning eyes, warm sensation at vaccination site, exanthema and allergic rhinitis. The  stratification  into  the  age  groups  of  adults  and  elderly  subjects  revealed  no  difference  in  the frequency and severity of adverse events post dose 1 except for headache, which occurred more often in adults (~12%) than in elderly subjects (5%). Study 810705 (&gt; 18 years) Study Design: This is a Phase III open-label clinical study in male and female subjects (3560 planned), stratified to three  cohorts, two  age  strata  and  four  treatment  groups  to  assess  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of Baxter's Vero cell-derived whole virus H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population as well as in specified risk groups. For a subset of subjects in two cohorts, antibody kinetics and T-cell mediated immune response will also be evaluated. Objectives: The objectives of this study are: · To assess the safety and tolerability of a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population and in specified risk groups; · To assess the immune response to a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population and in specified risk groups; · To assess persistence of H5N1 influenza antibodies after vaccination with a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population and in specified risk groups; · To demonstrate consistency of immune response among three different lots of a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine. For the subset of subjects included in the evaluation of cellular immunity a further objective of the study is: · To evaluate the T-cell mediated immune response induced by an H5N1 influenza vaccine after the first and second vaccinations.

## Analyzed (Part A safety) :

The safety analysis dataset for each vaccination included the following subjects:

1st vaccination:

- 2790 Stratum A (7.5 µg N = 2730, 3.75 µg N = 60)
- 180 Stratum B (7.5 µg N = 120, 3.75 µg N = 60)

## 2nd vaccination:

· 2743 Stratum A (7.5 µg N = 2684, 3.75 µg N = 57) · 119 Stratum B (7.5 µg N = 119, 3.75 µg N = 59) Safety  is  assessed  in  all  subjects  in  terms  of  AEs  occurring  after  vaccination.  A  subject  diary  is distributed after each vaccination in which subjects are to record any injection site reactions, systemic AEs,  other  AEs,  daily  oral  body  temperature  (digital  thermometer  provided)  until  Day  6  after vaccination, medication taken after vaccination, and information on travel to countries or regions in which human H5N1 influenza infections have been reported in the past. The 3-person independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviews and evaluates all SAE reports. For subjects participating in  the  evaluation  of  cellular  immunity,  a  haematology  and  differential  blood  count  analysis  is performed on Day 0, Day 21, Day 42 and Day 201. ALT and Ca values are determined after the first and second vaccination for approximately 100 subjects in Cohort 2 participating at German study sites and approximately 100 subjects in Cohort 3. Calcium concentration is also determined in all subjects in Cohort 1, Treatment groups 1 and 2. Brief Summary of Adverse Events SAEs Nineteen (19) subjects experienced a treatment-emergent SAE during study Part A (nine after the first and  ten  after  the  second  vaccination).  Of  these,  five  (three  after  the  first  and  two  after  the  second vaccination) had an SAE considered related to the study vaccine: · severe asthenia, pyrexia, and headache; · severe vestibular neuronitis; · moderate influenza-like illness; · rheumatoid arthritis and · severe tension headache. There were no deaths. Overview of Adverse Reactions Occurring During Part A The overall adverse reaction rates after the first vaccination were 31.9% in the 7.5 µg dose group and 38.3% in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A, and 27.5% in the 7.5 µg dose group and 25.0% in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum B. After  the  second  vaccination,  rates  of  subjects  with  any  adverse  reactions  were  somewhat  lower: 20.2% in the 7.5 µg dose group and 19.3% in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A, and 17.6% in the 7.5 µg dose group and 16.9% in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum B. The primary endpoint was the frequency and severity of systemic reactions until 21 days after the first and second vaccination. Systemic reaction rates in the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose groups, respectively, after the first vaccination were 25.1% and 33.3% in Stratum A, and 21.7% and 21.7% in Stratum B; and  after  the  second  vaccination  were  12.9%  and  15.8%  in  Stratum  A,  and  13.4%  and  11.9%  in Stratum B. Systemic reactions occurring after both vaccinations were mostly mild and moderate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There was no fever with onset within 7 days after either the first or second vaccination among subjects who  received  3.75  µg  HA  antigen  and  fever  rates  were  low  with  the  7.5  µg  dose.  After  the  first vaccination with a 7.5 µg dose, 43/2711 (1.6%; 95% CI 1.2%; 2.1%) of subjects in Stratum A and 1/119 (0.8%; 95% CI 0.0%; 4.6%) in Stratum B reported fever. Following the second vaccination with 7.5 µg HA antigen, subjects who experienced fever after the second vaccination numbered 17/2669 (0.6%; 95% CI 0.4%; 1.0%) in Stratum A and 1/119 (0.8%; 95% CI 0.0%; 4.6%) in Stratum B (Table 14.3-10). Malaise with onset within 7 days after the first vaccination was reported by 196/2730 (7.2%; 95% CI 6.2% ; 8.2%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and by 7/60 (11.7%; 95% CI 4.8% ; 22.6%) in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A. Subjects in Stratum B who experienced malaise after the first vaccination numbered 5/120 (4.2%; 95% CI 1.4% ; 9.5%) in the 7.5 µg dose group and 1/60 (1.7%; 95% CI 0.0% ; 8.9%) in the 3.75 µg dose group. Following the second vaccination, 104/2684 (3.9%; 95% CI 3.2%; 4.7%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and 1/57 (1.8%; 95% CI 0.0%; 9.4%) in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A reported malaise. Subjects in Stratum B who experienced malaise after the second vaccination numbered 5/119 (4.2%; 95% CI 1.4%; 9.5%) in the 7.5 µg dose group and 2/59 (3.4%; 95% CI 0.4%; 11.7%) in the 3.75 µg dose group (Table 14.3-10). Shivering with  onset  within  7  days  after  the first  vaccination  was experienced by 152/2730 (5.6%; 95% CI 4.7% ; 6.5%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and by 8/60 (13.3%; 95% CI 5.9% ; 24.6%) in the  3.75  µg  dose  group  in  Stratum  A.  Subjects  in  Stratum  B  who  reported  shivering  after  the  first vaccination numbered 6/120 (5.0%; 95% CI 1.9% ; 10.6%) in the 7.5 µg dose group and 2/60 (3.3%; 95% CI 0.4% ; 11.5%) in the 3.75 µg dose group. Following the second vaccination, 68/2684 (2.5%; 95% CI 2.0%; 3.2%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and 1/57 (1.8%; 95% CI 0.0%; 9.4%) in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A reported shivering. Subjects in Stratum B who experienced shivering after the second vaccination numbered 5/119 (4.2%; 95% CI 1.4%; 9.5%) in the 7.5 µg dose group and 5/59 (8.5%; 95% CI 2.8%; 18.7%) in the 3.75 µg dose group (Table 14.3-10). All three symptoms (fever within 7 days after vaccination, malaise, shivering) were mainly mild to moderate in severity after each vaccination. Severe fever occurred in Stratum A subjects who received 7.5 µg HA antigen only (0.3% and 0.2% of subjects after the first and second vaccination). One of these subjects had a temperature of 40.3 for one day, which the investigator graded as severe based on the clinical assessment. According to the FDA toxicity grading scale fever &gt;40°C may be considered potentially life-threatening. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Severe malaise and shivering also occurred among Stratum A subjects who received the 7.5 µg dose level only (malaise at a rate of 0.3% and 0.1% of subjects after the first and second vaccination, and shivering at rates of 0.2% and 0.1% after the first and second vaccination).

Rates  of  injection  site  reactions  (mostly  mild  and  moderate)  after  the  first  vaccination  were  low: 12.9% and 16.7% in Stratum A, and 10.0% and 5.0% in Stratum B, in the 7.5µg and 3.75µg dose groups respectively. Local reaction rates were generally lower after the second vaccination.

Doses of Celvapan distributed to the EU member states from 14Oct2009 through 16Nov2009 were 3 399 200 (Austria 918 400 doses, France 12 000 doses, Germany 92 600, Ireland 230 800, UK 2145 400) and outside the EU 198 600.

After the first vaccination, injection site reactions were reported by 352/2730 (12.9%; 95% CI 11.7%; 14.2%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and by 10/60 (16.7%; 95% CI 8.3%; 28.5%) in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A. In Stratum B, subjects with injection site reactions numbered 12/120 (10.0%; 95% CI 5.3%; 16.8%) in the 7.5 µg and 3/60 (5.0%; 95% CI 1.0%; 13.9%) in the 3.75 µg dose group (Table 14.3-7). After the second vaccination, injection site reactions were reported by 295/2684 (11.0%; 95% CI 9.8% ; 12.2%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and by 7/57 (12.3%; 95% CI 5.1%; 23.7%) in the 3.75 µg dose group in Stratum A. In Stratum B, 8/119 (6.7%; 95% CI 2.9%; 12.8%) subjects in the 7.5 µg dose group and 4/59 (6.8%; 95% CI 1.9%; 16.5%) in the 3.75 µg dose group experienced injection site reactions (Table 14.3-7). Listing  of  Individual  Laboratory  Measurements  by  Subject  and  Each  Abnormal Laboratory Value During study Part A, a slightly elevated Calcium level was determined in one subject on Day 21 only, where after normal values were recorded. One subject had a slightly higher value on Day 0 before vaccination, which returned to normal by Day 21. One subject had elevated Ca levels on Day 0 and Day 21, but a normal value on Day 42. Slightly elevated levels  were recorded in  three subjects  at baseline and each subsequent visit during study Part A, and in four subjects on Day 42 only; follow-up information for these seven subjects is not yet available. sPSUR 1 This  first  simplified  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (S-PSUR)  is  a  summary  of  data  relevant  for assessing the safety of Celvapan for the period from 14Oct2009 through 16Nov2009. Vaccine distribution Medicinal product no longer authorised

Data  on  the  actual  exposure  of  Celvapan  are  currently  not  available  to  Baxter.  The  exposure  is dependent on the utilization of Celvapan within the national vaccination campaigns. It can currently be estimated that of the Celvapan volumes distributed, as shown above, significant amounts have not yet been  used.  When  more  detailed  information  on  actual  exposure  is  made  available  by  the  national authorities, it will be included in subsequent S-PSUR/s.

## Safety evaluation

During the period from 14Oct2009 up to and including 16Nov2009, a total of 146 reports of suspected adverse  reactions  to  H1N1  vaccine  have  been  received  by  Baxter  from  the  spontaneous  reporting system. These 146 reports include 566 suspected adverse reactions.

A breakdown of the number of adverse reaction reports received by vaccine brand is provided in the table below:

Reported suspected adverse reactions A  total  of  88  adverse  reaction  reports  for  Celvapan  were  received  for  this  reporting  period. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea (n=16), fatigue (n=16), headache (n=15), pyrexia (n=14), dizziness (n=13), vomiting (n=12) and hypersensitivity (n=11). Except for hypersensitivity, all other before-mentioned terms are listed adverse reactions for Celvapan. Fatal reactions No reports AESIs Neuritis 1 case of possible neuritis (reported terms numbness in the ring and pinky fingers of the left hand and paraesthesia extending to the adjacent metacarpus). Events were not resolved at time of reporting. The case  was  assessed  by  Baxter  as  serious  and  unlikely  associated  given  the  very  short  latency  of  2 minutes. Anaphylactic reaction / Angioedema A narrow SMQ query for anaphylactic reaction / angioedema revealed 12 reports for this SMQ. A review of all 12 narratives revealed 4 reports indicative for an anaphylactic reaction with level 1-3 of Brighton Collaboration cases definition diagnostic certainty (3 reports from Ireland, 1 from Austria) and 3 additional reports were evaluated regarding a possible angioedema. All 4 cases were assessed as probably/possibly associated due to the reasonable temporal association between the Celvapan vaccination and the onset of events. No lot association was identified for the above-mentioned cases of anaphylactic reaction. Based  on  the  very  limited  information  regarding  a  sudden  onset  of  symptoms  as  defined  for  an angioedema  as  well  as  the  clinical  course  of  these  events,  a  diagnosis  of  angioedema  was  not considered for any of the 3 cases.

## 3. OVERALL DISCUSSION AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT

CHMP  noted  that  preliminary  data  reported  for  the  ongoing  H1N1v  and  H5N1  studies  in  adults (including the elderly) suggest a comparable safety profile for both vaccine formulations. In parallel the first sSPUR was assessed within the variation, which caused an updated safety profile in the postmarketing surveillance in 4.8 of the SPC.

## Adults (including the elderly) H1N1v

The data demonstrate a comparable safety profile to that observed for seasonal flu vaccines and in previous clinical trials with the H5N1 mock-up vaccine. Safety  analysis  stratified  into  respective  age  strata  for  the  adults  and  the  elderly  revealed  that  in general  regardless  of  the  vaccine  formulation  administered  slightly  more  adverse  reactions  were reported for adults compared to elderly subjects. Only headache occurred more frequently in adults (~12%) than in the elderly (5.2%). Day 21 safety data reported post-dose 2 did not differ from the post-dose 1 data. Adults (including the elderly) H5N1 The majority of subjects who experienced symptoms reported symptoms of mild severity in all age groups regardless of the dose used. Very few symptoms of moderate severity were reported and local or systemic adverse reactions of severe severity were rarely reported. Following second vaccination the frequency of any adverse reactions were somewhat lower. The  safety  data  base  was  quite  high  in  numbers  of  subject  and  therefore  the  following  four  new adverse  reactions  were  included  in  the  SPC,  section  4.8:  paresthesia,  ear  pain,  dry  throat  and clumsiness of vaccinated arm, which were observed within the trial and were not mentioned before in the list of adverse reactions. Although  data  on  a  very  low  number  of  subjects,  especially  in  the  lower  age  groups,  is  available, overall  the  safety  database  involving  146  subjects  might  suggest  a  favourable  safety  profile  with regard to systemic reactions. This limited  and  preliminary  information  was included in the  product information. First sPSUR (children and adults) During  the  period  from  14  Oct  2009  up  to  and  including  16  Nov  2009,  a  total  of  146  reports  of suspected  adverse  reactions  to  H1N1  vaccine  have  been  received  by  Baxter  from  the  spontaneous reporting system. These 146 reports include 566 suspected adverse reactions. The evaluation of the impact  of  these  suspected  adverse  reactions  caused  changes  in  the  SPC.  Primarily  four  cases  of anaphylactic  reactions  were  reported,  which  were  assessed  as  probably/possibly  associated  to  the vaccine.  Regarding  angioedema,  there  were  2  serious  cases  that  were  evaluated  with  respect  to  a possible  angioedema.  However,  in  both  cases  the  information  was  too  limited  to  confirm  the diagnosis . Based on reports received during the period of review and the strong causal relationship to Celvapan  as  well  as  continued  adverse  reaction  reports  for  the  events  of  anaphylactic  reaction, hypersensitivity  and  paraesthesia,  it  is  recommended  to  include  these  terms  into  the  CCDS.  The benefit-risk balance for Celvapan is considered to remain positive. 4. CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH:

Update on section 4.2  of the  SPC  to  reflect  that  very  limited  safety  data  has  been  assessed  during Variation II-006 as is reflected under 4.8.

The PL was updated accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. CONCLUSION

Following the assessment of safety data of Study 820902 (part of SO 2 027.1), the Part A of Study 810705 (FUM C-038) and the sPSUR 1, it was requested that the new safety information should be included in the product information.

<!-- image -->

The MAH filed a variation as requested to include the information in section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and in section 2 and 4 of the PL. The  wording  is  endorsed  by  CHMP.  The  revised  product  information  including  also  an  update  on section 4.2 to reflect that very limited safety data has been assessed during Variation II-06 is provided as an Annex. On 17 December 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet.
