## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 12 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Individuals 12 years of age and older

A single intramuscular dose (0.5 mL) of BIMERVAX should be administered at least 6 months after previous mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (see section 5.1).

BIMERVAX may also be given at least 6 months after a previous booster with BIMERVAX.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with official recommendations, see section 4.4 and 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of BIMERVAX in children aged less than 12 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

BIMERVAX is for intramuscular administration only, preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.

Do not administer this vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.

For instructions regarding handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.

No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of BIMERVAX.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haemophilia), because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

There are limited data available on immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine when administered to immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see section 5.1). The efficacy of BIMERVAX may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with BIMERVAX may not protect all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Polysorbate 80

This vaccine contains 1.18 mg of polysorbate 80 in each dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Concomitant administration of BIMERVAX with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no experience with the use of BIMERVAX in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-natal development (see section 5.3).

Administration of BIMERVAX during pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether BIMERVAX is excreted in human milk.

No effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breastfeeding woman to BIMERVAX is negligible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

BIMERVAX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Individuals 18 years of age and older

The most common adverse reactions reported after a booster dose with BIMERVAX in adult individuals who received a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, were injection site pain (82.9%), headache (30.9%), fatigue (31.1%) and myalgia (20.7%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

The most common adverse reactions reported after an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX as a fourth dose were injection site pain (79.9%), headache (25.0%) and fatigue (25.0%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

The most common adverse reactions reported after a booster dose of BIMERVAX in adolescents were injection site pain (77.5%), headache (28.3%), fatigue (29.3%) and malaise (22.5%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 2 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile presented below is based on pooled safety data generated in two phase 2b and phase 3 clinical trials with a total of 3 156 individuals 18 years of age and older, that received one booster dose of BIMERVAX at least 3 months after a previous COVID-19 vaccine. The median duration of the safety follow-up was 12 months for a 99.4% of the individuals, and 6 months for a 0.6% of the individuals.

The safety of an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX as a fourth dose was assessed in 288 individuals, 18 years of age and older, who had completed either 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) or 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) and 1 dose of BIMERVAX, and received an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX between 6 and 12 months after the third previous dose.

The safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years is based on safety data from the phase 3 clinical trial and the ongoing phase 2b clinical trial. A total of 276 participants, with and without medical history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, received a booster dose of BIMERVAX at least 3 months after the last dose of the primary series.

Adverse reactions observed during clinical trials are listed below according to the following frequency categories: v ery common (≥ 1/10), c ommon (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), u ncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100), r are (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1000), v ery rare (&lt; 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Covid-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN04

## Mechanism of action

BIMERVAX is a recombinant protein vaccine whose active substance (antigen) is SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion dimer. Following administration, an immune response is generated, both at a humoral and cellular level, against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen. Neutralising antibodies against the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its cellular target ACE2, thus blocking membrane fusion and viral infection. Moreover, BIMERVAX induces antigen-specific T-cell immune response, which may contribute to protection to COVID-19.

## Efficacy

Efficacy of BIMERVAX has been inferred by immunobridging of immune responses to an authorised COVID-19 vaccine, for which vaccine efficacy has been established.

## Immunogenicity

## Individuals 16 years of age and older

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX was evaluated in one pivotal phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-2) and in one phase 3 multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-5).

## HIPRA-HH-2

Study HIPRA-HH-2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-centre, noninferiority clinical trial to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX compared to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran), in adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before enrolment. This phase 2b clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant, individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 weeks, as well as individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

A total of 765 subjects were vaccinated; 513 subjects received BIMERVAX, and 252 subjects received the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran). A total of 751 subjects were analysed (504 BIMERVAX subjects and 247 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine subjects) excluding those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. Randomisation was stratified by age group (1864 versus ≥ 65 years). The median age was 42 years (range: 19 to 76 years), with similar age ranges in both vaccine arms, including 7.4% and 7.1% of subjects 65 years of age and older in the BIMERVAX and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine groups, respectively.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose of BIMERVAX was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/BIMERVAX. Noninferiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.4. Superiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.0 (see Table 2, GMT ratio column).

The immunogenicity of an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX was assessed in a total of 288 individuals 18 years of age and older. Individuals had previously completed either a series of 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) and one dose of BIMERVAX (Cohort 1) or 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) (Cohort 2), and received an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX between 6 and 12 months after the previous dose. Of these, 190 subjects were analysed in the efficacy population (80 subjects in Cohort 1 and 110 subjects in Cohort 2). The median age was 49 years (range: 20 to 82 years), with similar age ranges in both Cohorts, including 11.5% of subjects 65 years of age and older.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immunogenicity of BIMERVAX as an additional booster dose was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 variants. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX administered after 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) or administered after 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA and one dose of BIMERVAX. Superiority of the additional booster dose with BIMERVAX was met if the upper limit of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio was &lt; 1 (see Table 3, GMT ratio column).

Table 3: Neutralising antibody levels (PBNA) and GMT ratio after an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX, administered either after a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose of BIMERVAX (cohort 1) or after a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (cohort 2), against Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 at days 14, 98 and 182 post-booster dose (per protocol population)

## HIPRA-HH-5

This study is an ongoing open label, single arm, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX for the prevention of COVID-19 in subjects vaccinated with several primary vaccine schedules, with or without previous non-severe COVID-19 infections. BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after the last dose or at least 30 days after the COVID-19 infection. This phase 3 clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant as well as individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 weeks. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

The interim report includes data from a total of 2 646 subjects who were vaccinated with BIMERVAX as a booster dose in healthy individuals (at least 16 years old) previously vaccinated with different COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: tozinameran and elasomeran, and adenovirusvector vaccines (COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) and COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]). Of these, 230 (8%) subjects were included in the immunogenicity population. In the immunogenicity analysis, the population of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) vaccine group were all subjects between 1617 years old.

Overall, the median age was 34.4 years (range: 16 to 85 years of age). Subjects were balanced between genders, 52.49% male and 47.47% female.

Immunogenicity was measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1. Data on GMT (geometric mean titre: ID50) at baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 (2 weeks after the administration of the booster dose) are provided in the following table.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX in individuals 12 through 17 years of age was evaluated in the ongoing phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-3).

## HIPRA-HH-3

This study is an ongoing open label, uncontrolled, single-arm, multicentre, non-inferiority, phase 2b clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age. BIMERVAX was administered at least 6 months after the last dose of the primary series. HIPRA-HH-3 study excluded adolescents who were pregnant as well as adolescents who were immunocompromised or who have received immunosuppressants within 90 days. Participants with known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the immunogenicity analysis.

At the time of the interim analysis a total of 240 adolescent participants were vaccinated with a booster dose of BIMERVAX. Of these, 88 individuals were eligible for the immunogenicity analysis. The primary immunogenicity analysis, measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA), compared geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies against Omicron BA.1 with those observed in young adult participants (aged 18 to 25 years) form the pivotal phase 2b study in adults (HIPRA-HH-2) at Baseline and at Day 14 (2 weeks after the administration of the booster dose). Both groups of participants included in the analysis had no previous documented medical history of SARSCoV-2 infection.

Data on neutralising antibody tires against Omicron BA.1 at Baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 after vaccination are provided in the following table.

## Elderly population

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX has been shown in the elderly population (≥ 65 years old) including 38 (7.4%) of individuals receiving BIMERVAX.

## Immunocompromised population

The immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX were evaluated in a phase 2b/3, open label, single arm, multi-centre clinical trial (HIPRA-HH-4) in adults with pre-existing immunosuppressive conditions, including people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with persistent CD4 Tcell counts &lt; 400/mm 3 within last 6 months, kidney transplant on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, haemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis, primary antibody deficiencies on IgG replacement therapy and auto-immune disease on treatment with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rituximab/ocrelizumab. The booster dose of BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after 3 previous doses of COVID-19 vaccine or after 2 doses plus a documented history of COVID-19. Participants with history of COVID-19 disease were allowed to be included if diagnosed at least 91 days before enrolment.

A total of 238 individuals were vaccinated with a booster dose of BIMERVAX and a total of 228 participants were analysed, excluding those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. The median age was 56 years old (range: 21 to 90 years of age).

Immunogenicity was measured by pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/5 up to 12 months postbooster dose in all immunosuppressive conditions studied, except in individuals living with confirmed HIV infection in which immunogenicity was measured by virus neutralisation assay (VNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Omicron BA.2. A booster dose of BIMERVAX enhanced humoral immune response in all immunosuppressive conditions, except in individuals with autoimmune disease on rituximab/ocrelizumab therapy. However, a comparison to immunocompetent individuals to inform about the magnitude of the potential difference as regards immune responses was not conducted. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the reported immune responses in immunocompromised individuals is unknown.

## Paediatric population

The European medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with BIMERVAX in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity.

## Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity

BIMERVAX has not been evaluated for its genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female and male rats prior to mating and during gestation. BIMERVAX was administered intramuscularly (equivalent to a full human dose) to female rats in four occasions, 21 and 14 days prior to mating and on gestation days 9 and 19. Males received three administrations, 35, 28 and 6 days prior to mating. No vaccine-related adverse effects on fertility, pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/foetus and offspring were observed.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.

No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of BIMERVAX.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haemophilia), because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

There are limited data available on immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine when administered to immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see section 5.1). The efficacy of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 may not protect all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Polysorbate 80

This vaccine contains 1.18 mg of polysorbate 80 in each dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Concomitant administration of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no experience with the use of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-natal development (see section 5.3).

Administration of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 during pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 is excreted in human milk.

No effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breastfeeding woman to BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 is negligible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## Summary of the safety profile

## BIMERVAX (original, heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains )

## Individuals 18 years of age and older

The most common adverse reactions reported after a booster dose with BIMERVAX in adult individuals who received a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, were injection site pain (82.9%), headache (30.9%), fatigue (31.1%) and myalgia (20.7%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

The most common adverse reactions reported after an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX as a fourth dose were injection site pain (79.9%), headache (25.0%) and fatigue (25.0%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

The most common adverse reactions reported after a booster dose of BIMERVAX in adolescents were injection site pain (77.5%), headache (28.3%), fatigue (29.3%) and malaise (22.5%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 2 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

## BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 (Omicron XBB.1.16-adapted BIMERVAX)

The safety of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 is inferred from the safety data of the BIMERVAX (original, heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains) vaccine and the safety data from the clinical trial of the adapted BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 vaccine.

The overall safety profile for the BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 booster dose was similar to that seen after the BIMERVAX (original, heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains) booster dose. The most common adverse reactions reported were injection site pain (68.11%), headache (23.42%), fatigue (19.60%) and myalgia (13.62%). Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. No new adverse reactions were identified for the BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 booster dose.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile presented below is based on pooled safety data generated in two phase 2b and phase 3 clinical trials with a total of 3 156 individuals 18 years of age and older, that received one booster dose of BIMERVAX at least 3 months after a previous COVID-19 vaccine. The median duration of the safety follow-up was 12 months for a 99.4% of the individuals, and 6 months for a 0.6% of the individuals.

The safety of an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX as a fourth dose was assessed in 288 individuals, 18 years of age and older, who had completed either 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine (tozinameran) or 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) and 1 dose of BIMERVAX, and received an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX between 6 and 12 months after the third previous dose.

The safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years is based on safety data from the phase 3 clinical trial and the ongoing phase 2b clinical trial. A total of 276 participants, with and without medical history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, received a booster dose of BIMERVAX at least 3 months after the last dose of the primary series.

The safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 was assessed in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial in individuals 18 years of age and older fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before receiving a booster dose with BIMERVAX XBB.1.16. From this study, safety data is available for 602 individuals who received a booster dose of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 with a median follow-up time of 6 month.

Adverse reactions observed during clinical trials are listed below according to the following frequency categories: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Covid-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN04

## Mechanism of action

BIMERVAX is a recombinant protein vaccine whose active substance (antigen) is SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion dimer. Following administration, an immune response is generated, both at a humoral and cellular level, against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen. Neutralising antibodies against the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its cellular  target  ACE2,  thus  blocking  membrane  fusion  and  viral  infection.  Moreover,  BIMERVAX induces antigen-specific T-cell immune response, which may contribute to protection to COVID-19.

## Efficacy

Efficacy of damlecovatein has been inferred by immunobridging of immune responses to an authorised XBB adapted COVID-19 vaccine, for which vaccine efficacy has been established.

## Immunogenicity

## BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 (Omicron XBB.1.16-adapted BIMERVAX)

The immunogenicity of damlecovatein was evaluated in the clinical trial HIPRA-HH-14, a Phase 2b/3, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with damlecovatein compared to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) adapted vaccine, in adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before enrolment.

This phase 2b/3 clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant, individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 90 days, received any previous Omicron XBB adapted vaccine as well as individuals with COVID-19 infection diagnosed in the previous 6 months. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

At the cut-off date of the Interim Analysis, a total of 800 individuals had been vaccinated. A total of 599 subjects were included in the immunogenicity analysis (406 subjects vaccinated with damlecovatein and 193 subjects vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran). Participants were stratified before randomisation by age group and by number of doses previously received (3 or ≥ 4 doses). The median age was 45 years (range: 18 to 88 years), with similar age ranges in both vaccine arms, including 13.6% and 11.7% of subjects 60 years of age and older in the damlecovatein and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) groups, respectively. Most subjects had received either 3 (66.9%) or 4 (33.0%) previous mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immunogenicity of a booster dose of damlecovatein was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA), against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.16 (primary endpoint of efficacy) and Omicron XBB.1.5, and binding antibodies at Baseline and at Day 14. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) / damlecovatein. Non-inferiority of damlecovatein to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.5. Superiority of damlecovatein to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.0 (see Table 2, GMT ratio column). Superiority of damlecovatein was met for all the variants tested.

## BIMERVAX (original,  heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains)

## Individuals 16 years of age and older

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX was evaluated in one pivotal phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-2) and in one phase 3 multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-5).

## HIPRA-HH-2

Study HIPRA-HH-2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-centre, noninferiority clinical trial to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX compared to COVID-19 mRNA (tozinameran) vaccine, in adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before enrolment. This phase 2b clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant, individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 weeks, as well as individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

A total of 765 subjects were vaccinated; 513 subjects received BIMERVAX, and 252 subjects received the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran). A total of 751 subjects were analysed (504 BIMERVAX subjects and 247 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine subjects) excluding those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. Randomisation was stratified by age group (1864 versus ≥ 65 years). The median age was 42 years (range: 19 to 76 years), with similar age ranges in

both vaccine arms, including 7.4% and 7.1% of subjects 65 years of age and older in the BIMERVAX and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine groups, respectively.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose of BIMERVAX was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/BIMERVAX. Noninferiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.4. Superiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.0 (see Table 3, GMT ratio column).

The immunogenicity of an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX was assessed in a total of 288 individuals 18 years of age and older. Individuals had previously completed either a series of 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA (tozinameran) vaccine and one dose of BIMERVAX (Cohort 1) or 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA (tozinameran) vaccine (Cohort 2), and received an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX between 6 and 12 months after the previous dose. Of these, 190 subjects were analysed in the efficacy population (80 subjects in Cohort 1 and 110 subjects in Cohort 2). The median age was 49 years (range: 20 to 82 years), with similar age ranges in both Cohorts, including 11.5% of subjects 65 years of age and older.

Immunogenicity of BIMERVAX as an additional booster dose was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 variants. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX administered after 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) or administered after 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA and one dose of BIMERVAX. Superiority of the additional booster dose with BIMERVAX was met if the upper limit of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio was &lt; 1 (see Table 4, GMT ratio column).

Table 4: Neutralising antibody levels (PBNA) and GMT ratio after an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX, administered either after a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose of BIMERVAX (cohort 1) or after a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (cohort 2), against Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 at days 14, 98 and 182 post-booster dose (per protocol population)

## HIPRA-HH-5

This study is an ongoing open label, single arm, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX for the prevention of COVID-19 in subjects vaccinated with several primary vaccine schedules, with or without previous non-severe COVID-19 infections. BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after the last dose or at least 30 days after the COVID-19 infection. This phase 3 clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant as well as individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 weeks. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

The interim report includes data from a total of 2 646 subjects who were vaccinated with BIMERVAX as a booster dose in healthy individuals (at least 16 years old) previously vaccinated with different COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: tozinameran and elasomeran, and adenovirusvector vaccines (COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) and COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]). Of these, 230 (8%) subjects were included in the immunogenicity population. In the immunogenicity analysis, the population of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) vaccine group were all subjects between 1617 years old.

Overall, the median age was 34.4 years (range: 16 to 85 years of age). Subjects were balanced between genders, 52.49% male and 47.47% female.

Immunogenicity was measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1. Data on GMT (geometric mean titre: ID50) at baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 (2 weeks after the administration of the booster dose) are provided in the following table.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX in individuals 12 through 17 years of age was evaluated in the ongoing phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-3).

## HIPRA-HH-3

This study is an ongoing open label, uncontrolled, single-arm, multicentre, non-inferiority, phase 2b clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age. BIMERVAX was administered at least 6 months after the last dose of the primary series. HIPRA-HH-3 study excluded adolescents who were pregnant as well as adolescents who were immunocompromised or who have received immunosuppressants within 90 days. Participants with known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the immunogenicity analysis.

At the time of the interim analysis a total of 240 adolescent participants were vaccinated with a booster dose of BIMERVAX. Of these, 88 individuals were eligible for the immunogenicity analysis. The primary immunogenicity analysis, measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA), compared geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies against Omicron BA.1 with those observed in young adult participants (aged 18 to 25 years) form the pivotal phase 2b study in adults (HIPRA-HH-2) at Baseline and at Day 14 (2 weeks after the administration of the booster dose). Both groups of participants included in the analysis had no previous documented medical history of SARSCoV-2 infection.

Data on neutralising antibody titres against Omicron BA.1 at Baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 after vaccination are provided in the following table.

## Elderly population

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 has been shown in the elderly population (≥ 65 years old).

## Immunocompromised population

The immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX were evaluated in a phase 2b/3, open label, single arm, multi-centre clinical trial (HIPRA-HH-4) in adults with pre-existing immunosuppressive conditions, including people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with persistent CD4 Tcell counts &lt; 400/mm 3 within last 6 months, kidney transplant on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, haemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis, primary antibody deficiencies on IgG replacement therapy and auto-immune disease on treatment with rituximab/ocrelizumab. The booster dose of BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after 3 previous doses of COVID-19 vaccine or after 2 doses plus a documented history of COVID-19. Participants with history of COVID-19 disease were allowed to be included if diagnosed at least 91 days before enrolment.

A total of 238 individuals were vaccinated with a booster dose of BIMERVAX and a total of 228 participants were analysed excluding those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. The median age was 56 years old (range: 21 to 90 years of age).

Immunogenicity was measured by pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/5 up to 12 months postbooster dose in all immunosuppressive conditions studied, except in individuals living with confirmed HIV infection in which immunogenicity was measured by virus neutralisations assay (VNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Omicron BA.2. A booster dose of BIMERVAX enhanced humoral immune response in all immunosuppressive conditions, except in individuals with autoimmune disease on rituximab/ocrelizumab therapy. However, a comparison to immunocompetent individuals to inform about the magnitude of the potential difference as regards immune responses was not conducted. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the reported immune responses in immunocompromised individuals is unknown.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with BIMERVAX in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity.

## Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity

BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 has not been evaluated for its genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female and male rats prior to mating and during gestation. BIMERVAX was administered intramuscularly (equivalent to a full human dose) to female rats in four occasions, 21 and 14 days prior to mating and on gestation days 9

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 19. Males received three administrations, 35, 28 and 6 days prior to mating. No vaccine-related adverse effects on fertility, pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/foetus and offspring were observed.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.

No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of BIMERVAX.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haemophilia), because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

There are limited data available on immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine when administered to immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see section 5.1). The efficacy of BIMERVAX LP.8.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with BIMERVAX LP.8.1 may not protect all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Polysorbate 80

This vaccine contains 1.18 mg of polysorbate 80 in each dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Individuals 18 years of age and older

The most common adverse reactions reported after a booster dose with BIMERVAX in adult individuals who received a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, were injection site pain (82.9%), headache (30.9%), fatigue (31.1%) and myalgia (20.7%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

The most common adverse reactions reported after an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX as a fourth dose were injection site pain (79.9%), headache (25.0%) and fatigue (25.0%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

The most common adverse reactions reported after a booster dose of BIMERVAX in adolescents were injection site pain (77.5%), headache (28.3%), fatigue (29.3%) and malaise (22.5%). The median duration of local and systemic adverse reactions was 1 to 3 days. Most adverse reactions occurred within 2 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity.

## BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 (Omicron XBB.1.16-adapted BIMERVAX)

The safety of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 is inferred from the safety data of the BIMERVAX (original, heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains) vaccine and the safety data from the clinical trial of the adapted BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 vaccine.

The overall safety profile for the BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 booster dose was similar to that seen after the BIMERVAX (original, heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains) booster dose. The most common adverse reactions reported were injection site pain (68.11%), headache (23.42%), fatigue (19.60%) and myalgia (13.62%). Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. No new adverse reactions were identified for the BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 booster dose.

## BIMERVAX LP.8.1 (Omicron LP.8.1-adapted BIMERVAX)

The safety of BIMERVAX LP.8.1 is inferred from safety data of BIMERVAX (original, heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains) vaccine and from the Omicron XBB.1.16-adapted BIMERVAX vaccine.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile presented below is based on pooled safety data generated in two phase 2b and phase 3 clinical trials with a total of 3 156 individuals 18 years of age and older, that received one booster dose of BIMERVAX at least 3 months after a previous COVID-19 vaccine. The median duration of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the safety follow-up was 12 months for a 99.4% of the individuals, and 6 months for a 0.6% of the individuals.

The safety of an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX as a fourth dose was assessed in 288 individuals, 18 years of age and older, who had completed either 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) or 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) and 1 dose of BIMERVAX, and received an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX between 6 and 12 months after the third previous dose.

The safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years is based on safety data from the phase 3 clinical trial and the ongoing phase 2b clinical trial. A total of 276 participants, with and without medical history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, received a booster dose of BIMERVAX at least 3 months after the last dose of the primary series.

The safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 was assessed in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial in individuals 18 years of age and older fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before receiving a booster dose with BIMERVAX XBB.1.16. From this study, safety data is available for 602 individuals who received a booster dose of BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 with a median follow-up time of 6 month.

Adverse reactions observed during clinical trials are listed below according to the following frequency categories: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Covid-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BN04

## Mechanism of action

BIMERVAX is a recombinant protein vaccine whose active substance (antigen) is SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion dimer. Following administration, an immune response is generated, both at a humoral and cellular level, against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen. Neutralising antibodies against the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its cellular  target  ACE2,  thus  blocking  membrane  fusion  and  viral  infection.  Moreover,  BIMERVAX induces antigen-specific T-cell immune response, which may contribute to protection to COVID-19.

## Efficacy

The efficacy of BIMERVAX and BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 has been inferred by immunobridging of immune response to an authorised COVID-19 vaccine, for which efficacy is established. The efficacy of BIMERVAX LP.8.1 is inferred from the immunogenicity data of prior BIMERVAX vaccines.

## Immunogenicity

## BIMERVAX XBB.1.16 (Omicron XBB.1.16-adapted BIMERVAX)

The immunogenicity of damlecovatein was evaluated in the clinical trial HIPRA-HH-14, a Phase 2b/3, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with damlecovatein compared to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) adapted vaccine, in adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before enrolment.

This phase 2b/3 clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant, individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 90 days, received any previous Omicron XBB adapted vaccine as well as individuals with COVID-19 infection diagnosed in the previous 6 months. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

At the cut-off date of the Interim Analysis, a total of 800 individuals had been vaccinated. A total of 599 subjects were included in the immunogenicity analysis (406 subjects vaccinated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

damlecovatein and 193 subjects vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran). Participants were stratified before randomisation by age group and by number of doses previously received (3 or ≥ 4 doses). The median age was 45 years (range: 18 to 88 years), with similar age ranges in both vaccine arms, including 13.6% and 11.7% of subjects 60 years of age and older in the damlecovatein and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) groups, respectively. Most subjects had received either 3 (66.9%) or 4 (33.0%) previous mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose of damlecovatein was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA), against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.16 (primary endpoint of efficacy) and Omicron XBB.1.5, and binding antibodies at Baseline and at Day 14. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) / damlecovatein. Non-inferiority of damlecovatein to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.5. Superiority of damlecovatein to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (raxtozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.0 (see Table 2, GMT ratio column). Superiority of damlecovatein was met for all the variants tested.

## BIMERVAX (original,  heterodimer B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains)

## Individuals 16 years of age and older

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX was evaluated in one pivotal phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-2) and in one phase 3 multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-5).

## HIPRA-HH-2

Study HIPRA-HH-2 is a phase 2b, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-centre, noninferiority clinical trial to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX compared to COVID-19 mRNA (tozinameran) vaccine, in adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a mRNA vaccine at least 6 months before enrolment. This phase 2b clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant, individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 weeks, as well as individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 765 subjects were vaccinated; 513 subjects received BIMERVAX, and 252 subjects received the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran). A total of 751 subjects were analysed (504 BIMERVAX subjects and 247 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine subjects) excluding those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. Randomisation was stratified by age group (1864 versus ≥ 65 years). The median age was 42 years (range: 19 to 76 years), with similar age ranges in both vaccine arms, including 7.4% and 7.1% of subjects 65 years of age and older in the BIMERVAX and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine groups, respectively.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose of BIMERVAX was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/BIMERVAX. Noninferiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.4. Superiority of BIMERVAX to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) is concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% Confidence Interval of the GMT ratio is &lt; 1.0 (see Table 3, GMT ratio column).

The immunogenicity of an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX was assessed in a total of 288 individuals 18 years of age and older. Individuals had previously completed either a series of 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA (tozinameran) vaccine and one dose of BIMERVAX (Cohort 1) or 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA (tozinameran) vaccine (Cohort 2), and received an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX between 6 and 12 months after the previous dose. Of these, 190 subjects were analysed in the efficacy population (80 subjects in Cohort 1 and 110 subjects in Cohort 2). The median age was 49 years (range: 20 to 82 years), with similar age ranges in both Cohorts, including 11.5% of subjects 65 years of age and older.

Immunogenicity of BIMERVAX as an additional booster dose was based on an assessment of geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies, measured by a pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 variants. GMT ratio is the result of the GMT values (ID50) of 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/an additional booster dose of BIMERVAX administered after 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) or administered after 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA and one dose of BIMERVAX. Superiority of the additional booster dose with BIMERVAX was met if the upper limit of the 2 sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the GMT ratio was &lt; 1 (see Table 4, GMT ratio column).

Table 4: Neutralising antibody levels (PBNA) and GMT ratio after an additional booster dose with BIMERVAX, administered either after a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose of BIMERVAX (cohort 1) or after a primary series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (cohort 2), against Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 at days 14, 98 and 182 post-booster dose (per protocol population)

## HIPRA-HH-5

This study is an ongoing open label, single arm, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX for the prevention of COVID-19 in subjects vaccinated with several primary vaccine schedules, with or without previous non-severe COVID-19 infections. BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after the last dose or at least 30 days after the COVID-19 infection. This phase 3 clinical trial excluded individuals who were pregnant as well as individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 12 weeks. Individuals were also required a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of any immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, plasma) prior to the study.

The interim report includes data from a total of 2 646 subjects who were vaccinated with BIMERVAX as a booster dose in healthy individuals (at least 16 years old) previously vaccinated with different COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: tozinameran and elasomeran, and adenovirusvector vaccines (COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) and COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]). Of these, 230 (8%) subjects were included in the immunogenicity population. In the immunogenicity analysis, the population of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran)/COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (tozinameran) vaccine group were all subjects between 1617 years old.

Overall, the median age was 34.4 years (range: 16 to 85 years of age). Subjects were balanced between genders, 52.49% male and 47.47% female.

Immunogenicity was measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1. Data on GMT (geometric mean titre: ID50) at baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 (2 weeks after the administration of the booster dose) are provided in the following table.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX in individuals 12 through 17 years of age was evaluated in the ongoing phase 2b multi-centre clinical trial (Study HIPRA-HH-3).

## HIPRA-HH-3

This study is an ongoing open label, uncontrolled, single-arm, multicentre, non-inferiority, phase 2b clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with BIMERVAX in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age. BIMERVAX was administered at least 6 months after the last dose of the primary series. HIPRA-HH-3 study excluded adolescents who were pregnant as well as adolescents who were immunocompromised or who have received immunosuppressants within 90 days. Participants with known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the immunogenicity analysis.

At the time of the interim analysis a total of 240 adolescent participants were vaccinated with a booster dose of BIMERVAX. Of these, 88 individuals were eligible for the immunogenicity analysis. The primary immunogenicity analysis, measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA), compared geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralising antibodies against Omicron BA.1 with those observed in young adult participants (aged 18 to 25 years) form the pivotal phase 2b study in adults (HIPRA-HH-2) at Baseline and at Day 14 (2 weeks after the administration of the booster dose). Both groups of participants included in the analysis had no previous documented medical history of SARSCoV-2 infection.

Data on neutralising antibody titres against Omicron BA.1 at Baseline (prior to the administration of the booster dose) and at Day 14 after vaccination are provided in the following table.

## Elderly population

The immunogenicity of BIMERVAX was shown in the elderly population (≥ 65 years old).

## Immunocompromised population

The immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of BIMERVAX were evaluated in a phase 2b/3, open label, single arm, multi-centre clinical trial (HIPRA-HH-4) in adults with pre-existing immunosuppressive conditions, including people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with persistent CD4 Tcell counts &lt; 400 /mm 3  within last 6 months, kidney transplant on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, haemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis, primary antibody deficiencies on IgG replacement therapy and auto-immune disease on treatment with rituximab/ocrelizumab. The booster dose of BIMERVAX was administered at least 91 days after 3 previous doses of COVID-19 vaccine or after 2 doses plus a documented history of COVID-19. Participants with history of COVID-19 disease were allowed to be included if diagnosed at least 91 days before enrolment.

A total of 238 individuals were vaccinated with a booster dose of BIMERVAX and a total of 228 participants were analysed excluding those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of the booster. The median age was 56 years old (range: 21 to 90 years of age).

Immunogenicity was measured by pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Beta, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/5 up to 12 months postbooster dose in all immunosuppressive conditions studied, except in individuals living with confirmed HIV infection in which immunogenicity was measured by virus neutralisations assay (VNA) against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) strain and against Omicron BA.2. A booster dose of BIMERVAX enhanced humoral immune response in all immunosuppressive conditions, except in individuals with autoimmune disease on rituximab/ocrelizumab therapy. However, a comparison to immunocompetent individuals to inform about the magnitude of the potential difference as regards immune responses was not conducted. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the reported immune responses in immunocompromised individuals is unknown.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with BIMERVAX in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity.

## Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity

BIMERVAX LP.8.1 has not been evaluated for its genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female and male rats prior to mating and during gestation. BIMERVAX was administered intramuscularly (equivalent to a full human dose) to female rats in four occasions, 21 and 14 days prior to mating and on gestation days 9 and 19. Males received three administrations, 35, 28 and 6 days prior to mating. No vaccine-related adverse effects on fertility, pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/foetus and offspring were observed.

## BIMERVAX emulsion for injection COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted)

selvacovatein

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effect you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you recieve this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

2. What you need to know before you receive BIMERVAX
3. How BIMERVAX is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store BIMERVAX
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What BIMERVAX is and what it is used for

BIMERVAX is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

BIMERVAX is given to individuals 12 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

The vaccine stimulates the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce specific antibodies that work against the virus, giving protection against COVID-19. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive BIMERVAX

## BIMERVAX should not be given

- -if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving BIMERVAX if:

- you have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine injection;
- you have ever fainted following any needle injection;
- you have a high temperature (over 38 °C) or severe infection. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold;
- you have bleeding problems, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots (anticoagulant medicine);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or cancer medicines).

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given BIMERVAX.

As with any vaccine, BIMERVAX may not fully protect all those who receive it, and it is not known how long you will be protected.

## Children

BIMERVAX is not recommended for children aged below 12 years. Currently, there is no information available on the use of BIMERVAX in children younger than 12 years of age.

## Other medicines and BIMERVAX

Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines or vaccines.

## Pregnancy and breastfeeding

If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the side effects of BIMERVAX listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily reduce your ability to drive and use machines. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## BIMERVAX contains sodium, potassium and polysorbate

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say, essentially 'potassium-free'.

This vaccine contains 1.18 mg of polysorbate 80 in each dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How BIMERVAX is given

## Individuals 12 years of age and older

BIMERVAX will be given to you as 0.5 mL injection into a muscle of your upper arm.

It is recommended that you receive BIMERVAX as a single dose at least 6 months after a previous vaccination series with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or after a previous BIMERVAX booster dose.

After the injection, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction.

If you have any further questions on the use of BIMERVAX, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## Immunocompromised individuals

If your immune system does not work properly additional doses may be administered in line with official recommendations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Most of the side effects occur within 3 days of getting the vaccine and go away within a few days of appearing. If symptoms persist, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
