A new needle must always be attached before each use. Needles must not be re-used. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases the risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for use accompanying the package leaflet. The above warnings do not apply to the cartridge |

|         | Grouping of two variations to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include updated information on the use of Tresiba in terms of transfer from other basal insulin regimens and the effects of Tresiba on hypoglycaemia. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are proposed to be updated accordingly. An updated RMP (version 7.0) was submitted with this procedure. The proposed changes reflect the findings from two studies submitted: NN1250-3995 (SWITCH 1) and NN1250-3998 (SWITCH 2), comparing the safety and efficacy of Tresiba and insulin glargine U-100, mainly to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0 and implement minor changes to the SmPC section 4.2 and the corresponding section of the Package Leaflet to clarify the correct use of Tresiba. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to   |            |     | and PL   | and NN1250-3998 (SWITCH 2). The trials were identically designed to compare the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec and insulin glargine U-100. The main objective of the trials was to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The prescribing information for Tresiba was updated with new information on the use of insulin degludec in terms of transfer from other basal insulin regimens and the hypoglycaemia benefit of Tresiba. The findings from the two trials were included in section 4.2 (Transfer from other insulin medicinal products) and section 5.1 (Clinical efficacy and safety) of the SmPC. Minor changes were also made to the SmPC section 4.2 and the corresponding section of the PL to clarify the correct use of insulin degludec.   |
