## SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF VIRACEPT PRESENTED BY THE EMEA

On the evening of 5 June 2007 the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) was made aware by Roche Registration  Limited  (the  Marketing  Authorisation Holder,  MAH) of the contamination of Viracept (nelfinavir)  with  a  genotoxic  substance.  As  a  consequence,  the  product  was  recalled  from  the European  Union  markets,  with  immediate  effect.  All  packs  of  Viracept  currently  available  on  the market  were  affected,  including  packs  that  patients  may  have  had  at  home.  A  Direct  Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) was released by the MAH on Thursday, 7 June 2007, to inform prescribers  about  the  incident  and  the  need  to  switch  patients  on  Viracept  to  other  alternative antiretroviral therapies. The choice of alternatives was left to the prescriber. The EMEA issued a Press Release and Q&amp;A document on the same day.

- A suitable limit of EMS in nelfinavir mesilate should be introduced in the specification. This limit should reflect the capability of the process to deliver the lowest achievable level, but be in  any  case  below  the  Threshold  of  Toxicological  Concern  (TTC),  which  translates  to  a maximum of not more than 0.6 ppm.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  MAH  had  identified  the  presence  of  the  contaminant  ethyl  mesilate  (also  known  as  methane sulfonic acid ethylester or ethylmethane sulfonate, EMS) in some batches of nelfinavir mesilate (the active substance). EMS is a known genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic substance in animals. The level of risk to patients resulting from this contamination is currently not known and therefore needs to be further evaluated. In order to characterise the toxicological risk associated with EMS, an ad-hoc expert group meeting of toxicologists was held at the EMEA on Wednesday, 13 June 2007. The group concluded that there was insufficient data to quantify the risk posed by exposure to the levels of EMS present as a contaminant in the affected batches of Viracept. On Monday, 18 June 2007 the EMEA  convened  a Pharmacovigilance  expert  meeting  which  discussed  the  follow-up  of  patients  exposed  to  the contaminant in Viracept and measures to be undertaken by the MAH in order to address the resulting public health concerns. Swissmedic, in collaboration with the EMEA, organised an inspection of the Basel active substance manufacturing site on 11 and 12 June 2007, in order to further investigate the root causes leading to the  contamination,  other  possible  GMP  failures,  and  to  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  MAH's  CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) plan. The results of the inspection were presented to the CHMP on 19 June 2007. Based  on  the  critical  GMP  deficiencies  found  which  led  to  contamination  of  the  active  substance, concerns were raised about the quality of Viracept and its safety under normal conditions of use. Therefore, on 19 June 2007, the European Commission referred the matter to the CHMP in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, for its Opinion on the measures necessary to ensure the quality as well as the safe use of Viracept. The CHMP, during its plenary  session,  drafted  a  list  of  questions,  which  were  addressed  by  the  MAH  during  an  oral explanation on Wednesday, 20 June 2007. The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH as well as the recommendations of both the toxicology  and  pharmacovigilance  ad-hoc  expert  group  meetings  and  the  report  from  the  GMP inspection and came to the following conclusions: · The MAH is required to put measures in place to ensure that the GMP deficiencies identified are corrected and prevented from future occurrence.

- The MAH should, in close co-operation with the CHMP perform non- clinical studies in order to better quantify the risk to patients who have been exposed to the contaminated batches.

- The MAH should, within the EU Risk Management Plan, undertake to set up a Registry for the  follow-up  and  monitoring  of  patients.  This  registry  should  be  in  line  with  the  CHMP's request to include
- o all  patients  having  been  exposed  to  Viracept  contaminated  with  EMS  at  a  level  of 1000 ppm or above
- o all pregnant women and children (including those exposed in utero ) who have ever been exposed to Viracept.

Medicinal product no longer authorised GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF VIRACEPT The CHMP is of the Opinion that the Marketing Authorisations for Viracept products can no longer be maintained under normal conditions of use for the following reasons: · The MAH, at this stage, cannot guarantee an acceptable quality of Viracept. · Based on this, the current safe use of Viracept cannot be ensured. Therefore, the CHMP has recommended the suspension of the Marketing Authorisations for Viracept. Until the above has been satisfactorily addressed, the Marketing Authorisation will remain suspended.
