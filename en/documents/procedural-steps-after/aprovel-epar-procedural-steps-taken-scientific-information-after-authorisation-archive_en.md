In patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be required when indicated. Hypoglycaemia has been added as an undesirable effect under frequency not known. Irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that irbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and 1.3 fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two |

Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live fetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabeled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit fetuses.   |

| II/0116   | The MAH applied for an update of the SPC sections 4.3 and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to implement the CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling relating to the use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists during pregnancy and lactation. Furthermore, minor typographical changes have been introduced to SPC section 4.4. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 19/02/2009   | 31/03/2009 | SmPC and PL | Available data regarding use of AIIRAs during lactation have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but no human data about their transfer into breast milk are available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low transport according to their high plasma protein binding and low oral availabilit y. A harmonised wording recommending an alternative treatment with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been included in the section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL. Consequently, the existing contraindication for lactation has been deleted. |

| II/0109 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet The MAH applied for an update of the SPC sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.6 as well as PL section 2 to implement the CHMP recommendation on a harmonised labelling relating to the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists during pregnancy. In addition, linguistic corrections to the German, French, Latvian, Dutch and Romanian Package Leaflets were proposed Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, | 24/04/2008 | 10/06/2008 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Cooper's study published in the NEJM in June 2006 identified a signal of increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiac defects after exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy. Since the role of confounding factors such as diabetes and hypertension cannot be accurately defined based on the available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors is not demonstrated, even though data suggest that such exposure cannot be considered as safe and should be avoided. There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it |
