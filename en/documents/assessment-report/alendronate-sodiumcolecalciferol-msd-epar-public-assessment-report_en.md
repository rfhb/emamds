## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore the MAH of the reference product, FOSAVANCE has provided consent to allow access to Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. A satisfactory letter of consent, dated 19 May 2009 is provided and accepted. FOSAVANCE had been submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The  dossier  submitted  for  ALENDRONATE  SODIUM  AND  COLECALCIFEROL,  MSD  consists only of Module 1 information.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of ALENDRONATE SODIUM AND COLECALCIFEROL,  MSD  are  identical  to  the  up  to  date  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of FOSAVANCE; the latest CHMP Opinion issued for FOSAVANCE at the time of the CHMP opinion for the current dossier was for the FOSAVANCE procedure nr EMEA/H/C/000619/II/012. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the FOSAVANCE CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

The approved indication is: Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D insufficiency.

ALENDRONATE SODIUM AND COLECALCIFEROL, MSD reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.

The initially proposed invented name (IN) was refused by the NRG (Name Review Group) before the end  of  this  procedure.  The  applicant  will  submit  a  type  I  B  variation  in  order  to  change  the  IN (invented name) when accepted by the NRG (Name Review Group).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

The  RMP  should  be  updated according to the final outcome of this procedure. In addition, stress fractures that have been included in  the  SPC  with  FOSAVANCE  variations  EMEA/H/C/619/II/010  and  EMEA/H/C/759/II/008 following  a  class  review  should  be  discussed  within  the  next  RMP  update.
