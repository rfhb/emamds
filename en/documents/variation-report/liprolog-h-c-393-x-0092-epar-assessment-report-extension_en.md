## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

According to the WHO, the prevalence of obesity in Europe is increasing and contributes towards (up to) 80% of new diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a correlation between obesity and insulin resistance. Insulin requirements in people with diabetes mellitus and who are obese are higher than the non-obese. Standard insulin injection devices only allow administration of a maximum of 80 units per injection and administration of large volumes (&gt;1 mL) may be associated with pain or discomfort.

One way to manage people with high daily insulin requirements is the development of insulin products with higher strengths than the current 100 U/ml.

Liprolog (insulin lispro, rDNA origin) is a human insulin analogue that is a rapid-acting, parenteral blood glucose-lowering agent. Chemically, it is Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analogue, created when the amino acids at positions 28 and 29 on the insulin B-chain are reversed. Liprolog is synthesised in a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of the gene for insulin lispro. The general safety and efficacy of insulin lispro 100 U/mL solution for injection has been established since its first marketing authorisation in the EU on 30 April 1996.

The clinical development program for Liprolog 200 U/ml solution for injection was based on the demonstration of bioequivalence to the 100 U/mL formulation.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

This line extension application is for a 200 Units/mL Insulin Lispro, which is double the strength of the currently available Liprolog products. The 200 U/ml will be presented only in the form of the prefilled KwikPen device. The proposed modified KwikPen will contain a total of 600 units of insulin lispro in a prefilled pen injector within a standard 3mL cartridge.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finished product is a solution, administered as a subcutaneous injection. The formulation differs from the formulation for the 100U strength. It is a solution for injection in a buffer also containing glycerol as a tonicity-modifying agent and metacresol as an anti-microbial preservative.

The KwikPen proposed for the new strength is based on the existing Lilly mechanical, prefilled pen injector device used for the current 100 U/mL Liprolog. The immediate container is a standard 3 ml glass cartridge of identical dimensions and composition as that used for the existing products. To accommodate the 200 U/mL strength with the same cartridge and device dimensions, the pen device mechanism has been modified to allow variable dosing in 0.005 ml/unit increments (compared to 0.010 ml/unit increments in the 100 U/ml KwikPen).

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The active substance in Liprolog is insulin lispro, a Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analogue, created when the amino acids at positions 28 and 29 on the insulin B-chain are reversed. Liprolog is synthesised in a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered by the addition of the gene for insulin lispro.

No changes have been introduced to the active substance in this line extension application. Lilly refers to the currently approved Liprolog dossier for all quality information related to the active substance, insulin lispro.

It is however noted that procedure EMEA/H/C/000088/WS0353/0113/G with the scope to register a Design Space for the introduction of a post approval change management protocol related to the active substance involving a major change to the manufacturing process for insulin lispro has recently been approved. In the response to the CHMP D120 LOQ Lilly has provided appropriate clarification on how the 200 U/ml strength will be incorporated into the change management protocol in question.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development

The finished product is a 200 U/ml solution for injection and presented as a 3ml cartridge in a sealed single use prefilled pen device which is a modification of the KwikPen currently used for the 100 U/mL range of Lilly insulin and insulin analogue products. It is manufactured and assembled at established insulin analogue manufacturing sites using similar manufacturing methods.

The container closure system is based on that used for the current U-100 product and evaluation of its suitability was carried out and has been found acceptable.

The chosen composition of metacresol as an antimicrobial preservative is the same as that employed for the U-100 Liprolog products. The applicant has conducted studies following standard methods to confirm that Insulin with the range of the metacresolcontent can comply with compendial microbial growth inhibition requirements.

The insulin lispro drug product is contained with a sealed cartridge assembled into a specified pen device. Once assembled, the resulting pen-injector is a sealed unit that cannot be disassembled without physically destroying the pen-injector. Hence it can be assumed that the cartridge may not be readily removed intact limiting the possibility of it being transferred to another device. The design of U-200

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

product has been found to be an appropriate approach from a safety point of view since the pen injector device is specifically designed only for use with the U-200 product.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

The manufacturing process is based on, and similar to, the one employed for the current U-100 product. Formulation studies were carried out which investigated the robustness of the formulation under processing. Optimisation of the formulation and the manufacturing process was implemented between the clinical and commercial lots. Three 120L lots of final commercial product were then evaluated. The established procedures for preparation of the solution and for sterilisation were found to be suitable for the U-200 product.

Satisfactory details have been provided of the manufacturing process which follows procedures already established for the approved U-100 product. Appropriate validation data has been provided for three commercial scale lots.

The in process control procedures are considered appropriate for the process and include mixing, dissolution and filling as well as validation of sterile filtration. Aseptic processing and sanitization procedures are satisfactory.

## Product specification

The specifications for Insulin lispro 200 U/mL are based on experience with the established Liprolog 100 U/mL product including stability testing data.

Satisfactory details of the release testing of the cartridges and the assembled pens have been provided. They are consistent with those applied to the established U-100 strength which is appropriate.

## Stability of the product

The submission contains stability data generated from three 120L lots of 200 U/mL finished product and packaged in the final commercial immediate container which contains a grey coloured plunger. An ongoing stability study is designed to monitor stability under long term storage conditions of for 36 months, under accelerated conditions of 30°C for 3 months and simulated in-use patient conditions.

The stability data provided in the initial submission was insufficient to fully support the requested shelf-life of the product. The Applicant was requested to propose an appropriate shelf life based on real time data. Any bracketing should be adequately justified. This should include, if relevant, data and justification of any extrapolation and commitments to support the stability.

With the responses to the List of questions, Lilly has provided updated real time data in the final container. Additional accelerated data has been provided. Some additional batches have been tested under normal storage conditions up to 36 months.  The data provided meets the predefined specification and does not indicate any trends which would raise concern. It was concluded that the proposed shelf life of 36 months can be accepted provided that a written commitment regarding ongoing studies is received. The requested commitment has been received.

## Adventitious agents

All excipients used comply with the relevant PhEur requirements. No excipients of animal origin are used.

## Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The company has provided satisfactory responses to the outstanding quality points and the application is considered approvable. The applicant has submitted a written commitment regarding ongoing stability studies as requested.

## 2.2.4. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommended an additional point for investigation.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH has developed a concentrated version (200 U/ml insulin lispro) of Liprolog (currently available as 100 U/ml insulin lispro).

The insulin lispro 200 U/ml clinical trial formulation was based on the commercial Liprolog 100 U/ml formulation (insulin lispro 100 U/ml). Changes to the formulation of the established product are:

-  increasing the lispro concentration from 100 U/ml to 200 U/ml
-  changing the buffering agent from dibasic sodium phosphate to trometamol (hydroxymethyl aminomethane) (TRIS)
-  increasing the zinc concentration.

One bioequivalence study (study IOPY) has been submitted in support of the current application. The study was done to establish bioequivalence between two formulations of insulin lispro: insulin lispro phosphate U-100 and insulin lispro TRIS U-200.

The impact of zinc ion concentration changes was previously examined in Study IMAB, submitted as part of the original MAA for Liprolog. Study IMAB evaluated the pharmcokinetics and 'glucodynamics' of an insulin lispro formulation with a zinc concentration compared to an insulin lispro formulation without zinc: study IMAB concluded that the impact of zinc was not clinically relevant. The proposed commercial formulation increase in zinc ion concentration in the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation is within the range examined in Study IMAB; therefore, it is also not considered clinically relevant.

The company has submitted the following clinical studies in support of this application.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

## 2.3.2. Clinical efficacy

## 2.3.2.1. Main clinical study

One bioequivalence study (study IOPY) has been submitted in support of the current application. The study was done to establish bioequivalence between two formulations of insulin lispro: insulin lispro phosphate U-100 and insulin lispro TRIS U-200.

Title of Study: Evaluation of the Bioequivalence of Two Formulations of Insulin Lispro in Healthy Subjects

Study code: F3Z-EW-IOPY

Study Design: Phase 1, single-centre, open-label, 2-sequence, 4-period, randomised, crossover, 8-hour euglycaemic clamp study.

## Methods

## · Study participants

Eligibility of subjects for study entry was based on the results of a screening medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests and an ECG.

## Inclusion criteria

-  Healthy subjects, aged 21 - 50yr with a body mass index between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m 2  inclusive.

Exclusion criteria

-  Affiliated to the MAH
-  Allergies to insulin or excipients
-  1 st degree relative with diabetes mellitus
-  a fasting venous blood glucose &gt;6 mmol/L at screening.

## · Treatments

The study is a phase 1, single-centre, open-label, 2-sequence, 4-period, randomised, crossover, 8-hour euglycemic clamp study to compare the pharmcokinetics and 'glucodynamics' of insulin lispro TRIS U-200 versus insulin lispro phosphate U-100 after s/c administration of 20 U. The treatments were replicated such that each formulation was administered twice on different occasions to healthy subjects over 4 study periods.

Subjects fasted for about 8 hours prior to each dose.

Blood samples were collected over the entire clamp procedure to determine free serum immunoreactive insulin lispro-specific concentrations for PK evaluations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was an interval of approximately 4 to 7 days between doses.

## · Objectives

## Primary objective

-  To demonstrate the bioequivalence of pharmacokinetic variables (AUC0-tlast and Cmax) for the insulin lispro TRIS U-200 formulation relative to that of insulin lispro phosphate U-100 after subcutaneous administration of 20 units to healthy subjects.

## Secondary objectives

-  To compare other pharmacokinetic variables for insulin lispro TRIS U-200 versus insulin lispro phosphate U-100 after s/c administration.
-  To compare the 'glucodynamic' responses for insulin lispro TRIS U-200 versus insulin lispro phosphate U-100 formulation after s/c administration.
-  To assess safety and tolerability of insulin lispro TRIS U-200 and insulin lispro phosphate U-100 in healthy subjects.

## · Sample size

Thirty completers in a replicated treatment design will provide at least 90% power to show the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of means for AUC0-tlast between the 2 formulations to be within the 0.80 to 1.25 limits.

## · Randomisation

A randomisation schedule and dosing details for patients was submitted.

## · Blinding (masking)

The study was open-label. An open-label study design was considered appropriate for a study with pharmacokinetics as the primary endpoint.

## · Statistical methods

To evaluate bioequivalence between insulin lispro TRIS U-200 relative to insulin lispro phosphate U-100, log-transformed area under concentration parameter estimates (AUC0-tlast, AUC0-8) were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model where formulation (TRIS or phosphate), period and sequence were included as fixed factors, and subject as a random factor.

If the 90% CI for treatment ratios (test/reference) for both AUC0-tlast and Cmax are contained within the range 0.80-1.25, the formulations were considered bioequivalent. A nonparametric approach was taken to evaluate tmax, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The difference in median tmax between formulations and the 95% CIs for the difference was presented.

To address the secondary objective of comparing glucodynamic variables (Gtot and Rmax) between the U-200 lispro TRIS formulation (test treatment) and the U-100 lispro phosphate formulation (reference treatment), log-transformed Gtot and Rmax estimates were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

where formulation (TRIS or phosphate), period, and sequence were included as fixed factors, and a random effect for subject.

## Results

## · Participant flow

45 healthy men and women were to be enrolled in order that a target of 30 subjects completed the study. Of the 41 subjects who entered the study, 38 were randomly assigned to treatment.

38 healthy subjects, 36 male and 2 female, between the ages of 23 and 45 (with a mean [SD] age of 32.4 [7.1] years) participated in this study and received at least 1 dose of study drug.

36 completed the study and 5 did not complete the study.

4 subjects discontinued due to subject decision: 3 subjects considered the cannulation difficult and / or painful and 1 subject could not commit to the study schedule.

1 subject discontinued due to a protocol violation: the subject's body mass index decreased below the inclusion criteria of 18.5kg/m2 during 2 dosing periods.

## · Recruitment

Date of first subject entered: 17 May 2010

Date of last subject completed: 23 August 2010

## · Conduct of the study

There were not any major amendments.

## · Baseline data

38 healthy subjects, 36 male and 2 female, between the ages of 23 and 45 (with a mean [SD] age of 32.4 [7.1] years) participated in this study. Subject demographics are presented in the following table:

## 2.3.2.2. Supportive studies

The company referred in this application to study IMAB, submitted as part of the original MAA for Liprolog. Study IMAB evaluated the pharmacokinetics and glucodynamics of an insulin lispro formulation with zinc compared to an insulin lispro formulation without zinc. The company has concluded that zinc content, as described in IMAB, did not affect the release kinetics of insulin lispro into the general circulation.

In addition, a validation study of a method for the determination of free Lispro Insulin in human serum by radio-immunoassay was submitted by the MAH.

## 2.3.3. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

Study IOPY was a phase 1, single-centre, open-label, 2-sequence, 4-period, randomised, crossover, 8-hour euglycemic clamp study carried out to establish bioequivalence between insulin lispro TRIS U-200 and insulin lispro phosphate U-100. 38 subjects received one or more doses of study drug and 36 subjects completed the study.

The CHMP was of the view that the design and conduct of study IOPY are acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Statistical analysis of Cmax and AUC for insulin lispro TRIS U-200 and insulin lispro phosphate U-100 returned results within the 80 - 125 confidence interval limits.

Based on the presented bioequivalence study IOPY, insulin lispro TRIS U-200 may be considered bioequivalent with insulin lispro phosphate U-100.

## 2.4. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

38 subjects received one or more doses of study drug in the submitted clinical trials.

## Adverse events

None of the 38 subjects who received one or more doses of study drug reported adverse events that were related to study drug as judged by the investigator. The most common adverse events were catheter site haematoma (11 subjects) and procedural-site reaction (5 subjects). Most adverse events were of mild severity, 2 events were considered moderate (1 catheter site haematoma in each treatment group) and none was considered severe. Records of fluctuations in vital signs were not considered to be clinically significant.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Deaths and serious adverse events did not occur.

## Laboratory findings

There were not any clinically-significant alterations in laboratory or urinalysis results.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Discontinuation because of an adverse event did not occur.

## 2.4.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH recognised that medication errors (between both doses) are the main potential risk. However, the MAH considered that these errors are limited to a misuse of the product. The MAH identified two possible scenarios that could lead to medication errors: (i) extraction of the 200 U/mL solution from a dedicated pen and administration by a different delivery system and (ii) carrying out an unnecessary dose conversion when changing from 100 U/mL to 200 U/mL or vice versa. These have been adequately addressed by labelling of the new strength and a communication plan (Dear Healthcare Professional Communication and Patient Communication) has been developed as described in the Risk Management Plan.

## 2.4.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

During the course of the study, there were not any adverse events that were considered to be related to study drug and there were not any clinically-significant alterations in vital signs or laboratory results. Within the study, both formulations of insulin lispro appeared to be well-tolerated and safe.

## 2.5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

*Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

In addition to the studies listed in this Pharmacovigilance plan, the Applicant has committed to submitting a protocol synopsis within one month after Commission Decision of the U200 strength, and to submit a full protocol within 6 months after Commission Decision, for a study examining the effectiveness of risk minimization. The study objectives are to assess the receipt, perception and comprehension of key messages relating to all potential medication errors, as well as impact on behaviour.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan, together with the study the Applicant has committed to regarding measuring the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures, are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

| intensified insulin therapy; diabetic nerve disease, or medications such as beta-blockers. A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-souuce insulin to human insulin have hypoglycaemia were less pronouuced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness,coma,or death Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk ofhypoglycaemia. A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if hypoglycaemia occuus, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human insulin. SPC 4.7 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g-. driving a car or operating machinery). Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving: this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the waming sigus of hypoglycaemia, or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances. SPC 4.8 Undesirable Effects Hypoglycaemia is the most fequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness and in extreme cases, death. No specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors, e.g.. a patient's level of diet and exercise.   |

|                  | SPC 4.9 0verdose Insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability, and other metabolic processes. Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure. Hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating, and vomiting. Mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products. Correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently. Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. If the patient is comatose, glucagon should be admimistered intramuscularly or subcutaneously However, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon. The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may   |      |

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s).

## 2.7. Product information

## 2.7.1. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 2.7.2. Additional expert consultation

During the evaluation procedure for Liprolog 200 U/ml concerns were raised with regards to the introduction of the new strength, and whether sufficient measures had been put in place to ensure the safe and correct use of the new high strength concentration. As such a Healthcare Professional and Patient Organisation consultation was launched to request feedback on how to minimise the risk of medication errors with this new strength for Liprolog. The comments received in this consultation prompted the PRAC and CHMP to request further changes to the labelling (mainly to clearly differentiate both strengths). The MAH adequately addressed these concerns by amending the labelling and by other measurements described in the risk minimisation plan.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Insulin lispro 100 U/mL is a well-understood, extensively-studied product with an established positive benefit-risk ratio that has been marketed in the EU since 1996. The company has developed a 200 U/mL formulation. The company intends the current product to be used by those people with diabetes mellitus who need &gt;20U insulin at mealtime.

The MAH has submitted study IOPY to claim bioequivalence between the 100 U/mL formulation of insulin lispro and the new 200 U/mL formulation. The company anticipates that because the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation is bioequivalent to the currently marketed insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation then the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio (incorporating the known beneficial effects) of the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation may also be claimed for the 200 U/mL product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A dedicated device has been developed to administer the new formulation. The company has carried out human factors engineering and usability testing on the 200 U/mL KwikPen device following scientific advice from the FDA and by following published guidance from the FDA.

Testing was carried out on subjects with diabetes mellitus, physicians and nurses (each group given its own set of scenarios).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Study IOPY was a study of bioequivalence carried out on healthy volunteers, none of whom was clinically obese. Insulin lispro 200 U/mL has not (apparently) been studied in people with diabetes mellitus, obese or not. The human factors engineering and usability testing on the 200 U/mL KwikPen device was carried out in an office environment and involved simulation of injections. There is not, at present, any clinical knowledge of beneficial effects in the population of people with diabetes mellitus either arising from exposure to insulin lispro 200 U/mL or from using the newly developed administration device.

The company claims of potential benefit are based on the company's own expertise, consultations with advisory boards, market research and published literature.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The company anticipates that because the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation is bioequivalent to the currently marketed insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation then the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio (incorporating the known unfavourable effects) of the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation may also be claimed for the 200 U/mL product.

The company recognises that medication errors are the main potential risk and considers that these are limited to a misuse of the product. The company has identified two possible scenarios: (i) extraction of the 200 U/mL solution from a dedicated pen and administration by a different delivery system and (ii) carrying out an unnecessary dose conversion when changing from 100 U/mL to 200 U/mL or vice versa. These have been addressed by labelling and other measurements described in the risk minimisation plan.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Study IOPY was a study of bioequivalence carried out on healthy volunteers, none of whom was clinically obese. Insulin lispro 200 U/mL has not (apparently) been studied in people with diabetes mellitus, obese or not. There is not, at present, any clinical knowledge of unfavourable effects in the population of people with diabetes mellitus either arising from exposure to insulin lispro 200 U/mL or from using the newly developed administration device.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

On the basis of bioequivalence between insulin lispro 100 U/mL and insulin lispro 200 U/mL, it is acknowledged that it is reasonable to assume that the importance of the favourable and unfavourable effects of exposure to the 200 U/mL formulation of insulin lispro will reflect those already established for the 100 U/mL formulation.

The dedicated 200 U/mL KwikPen device has been developed from the 100 U/mL KwikPen device (in clinical use for many years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the human factors engineering and usability testing on the 200 U/mL KwikPen device was carried out in an office environment (and not in situations reflecting real life), this may be accepted because of knowledge of experience of the 100 U/mL KwikPen device used with insulin lispro 100 U/mL.

The goal of human factors engineering in medical device design development is to ensure that the device will be safe and effective to use. The company identified the intended users of the 200 U/mL KwikPen device and the tasks they had to perform to use the device effectively. Hazards were identified and eliminated or controlled and informed the proposed risk management plan. As a consequence, a formal clinical study of use has not been submitted.

## Benefit-risk balance

On the basis of bioequivalence between the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation and the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation, the positive benefit-risk balance of the insulin lispro 100 U/ml formulation may also be claimed for the insulin lispro 200 U/ml formulation. Risks associated with the new formulation and KwikPen device have been identified and addressed by the human factor engineering study. The benefit risk balance of Liprolog 200 U/ml is therefore considered to be positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Liprolog 200 U/ml in the 'treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Liprolog 200 units/ml KwikPen is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes mellitus' is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

##  Periodic Safety Update Reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

-  Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreeed  subsequent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

-  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
-  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time.

##  Additional risk minimisation measures

The MAH shall provide a Dear Healthcare Professional Letter (DHPC) and patient communication prior to launch  targeting  all  physicians  and  nurses  who  are  expected  to  be  involved  in  the  treatment  and management of diabetic patients and, where required, all pharmacists who are expected to dispense Liprolog.

The target audience and the modalities for distribution all of these materials are to be agreed at Member State level. The MAH shall agree the final text of the Dear Healthcare Professional Communication letter and the content of the patient communication together with a communication plan, with the National Competent Authority in each Member State prior to launch of the product.

The DHPC and patient communication are aimed at increasing awareness about the fact that Liprolog is now available in two strengths and describing key differences in the design of the packages and the prefilled pen devices to minimise the risk of medication errors and mix up between the two different strengths of Liprolog.

The MAH shall ensure that healthcare professionals are informed that all patients who have been prescribed Liprolog should be trained on the correct use of the prefilled pen before prescribing or dispensing Liprolog.

The DHPC should address the following key elements:

-  Liprolog is now available in 2 strengths
-  Key features of the design of the package and prefilled pen device
-  When prescribing, to ensure that the correct strength is mentioned on the prescription
-  Liprolog should not be used outside of the prefilled pen device
-  Dose conversion on switching from Liprolog U-100 to U-200 should not be performed
-  Medication errors or any side effects should be reported
