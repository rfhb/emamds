## I. INTRODUCTION

On 2009-04-08, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for duloxetine, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for duloxetine and that no consequential regulatory action is required. II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION II.1 Information on the development program The MAH  stated that the Study HMFN  (An Open-Label Study of Tolerability, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Duloxetine in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder) is a stand alone study.  This is provided in line with the current 6 months reporting timeline. II.2 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Duloxetine is authorised as 30 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg, hard gastro-resistant capsules. Duloxetine is not indicated for use in children. So far, no suitable paediatric formulation is available. No clinical studies have been conducted for patients less than 18 years of age, although post marketing, off-label use has been reported. The study drug was provided in the form of 20 and 30 mg capsules of duloxetine enteric-coated pellets. Patients were given one to four capsules daily. II.3 Clinical aspects 1. Introduction The MAH submitted a final report for Study HMFN (An Open-Label Study of Tolerability, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Duloxetine in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder). 2. Clinical study Study F1J-MC-HMFN was a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the range of duloxetine tolerable doses and characterization of duloxetine pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents (aged 7 through 17 years) diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

##  Methods

- Objectives

## Primary Objective

To assess the safety and tolerability of duloxetine in children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD.

## Secondary Objectives

- To characterize the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine at steady-state in children and adolescents.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To compare the steady-state duloxetine pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents with historical adult duloxetine pharmacokinetics.
- To assess the efficacy of duloxetine at a proposed dose range of 20 to 120 mg once daily (QD).
- Study design

The study was up to 32 weeks in duration and consisted of 5 study periods:

-  Study Period I: Screening (2 weeks)
- 

 Study Period III: Safety and Tolerability (8 weeks) The duloxetine dose remained fixed throughout this Study Period.  Study Period IV: Extended Safety and Tolerability (3 months) The patient's dose was escalated or decreased at the investigator's discretion.  Study Period V: Taper Phase (2 weeks): Patients gradually reduced their duloxetine dose rather than abruptly discontinuing duloxetine. · Study population /Sample size Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- Study Period II: Dose Titration with Pharmacokinetic Sampling (10 weeks) Time to titrate each patient at 1- to 2-week intervals to the patient's highest tolerable dose up to a maximum dose of 120 mg QD based on safety, tolerability, and treatment response (CGI-Severity score).

## Inclusion Criteria

Outpatient  children  and  adolescents  aged  7  to  17  years,  who  meet  criteria  for  MDD  without psychotic features, single or recurrent, as defined by the DSM-IV and confirmed by the K-SADS-PL, with a MDD severity of moderate or greater (a CDRS-R total score of  ≥40 and a CGI-Severity rating of ≥4).

The K-SADS-PL was used as a supplementary diagnostic instrument. This clinician rated instrument assessed the extent of symptoms of MDD and other diagnoses and allowed for rating the worst part of an episode as well as symptoms over the past week.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exclusion Criteria

Patients  were  excluded  from  the  study  if  they  had  any  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder,  psychotic depression,  schizophrenia  or  other  psychotic  disorder,  anorexia,  bulimia,  obsessive  compulsive disorder, pervasive development disorder, borderline personality disorder, a current primary DSMIV Axis I disorder other than MDD, a current secondary DSM-IV Axis I disorder that required any pharmacologic treatment, or if they had a significant suicide attempt within 1 year of Visit 1 or were a suicidal risk as defined in the protocol.

Approximately 64 patients were to be enrolled (within 4 age groups: 7 through 9 years, 10 through 12 years,  13  through  14  years,  and  15  through  17  years  of  age)  and  to  have  approximately  4 study completers per age stratum with relatively equal male and female patients within this sample by the end of Study Period III.





Safety  was  assessed  by  summarizing  AEs  and  changes  in  laboratory  analytes,  vital  signs,  and ECGs. Patients were included in the extent of exposure analyses if they had non-missing exposure data for the reporting interval.

· Treatments All enrolled patients were assigned to duloxetine. Patients took duloxetine orally, in a dose range of 20 to 120 mg QD. The proposed starting dose of 20 or 30 mg QD was based on body weight (20 to 40 kg and &gt;40 kg, respectively). Concomitant medications with primarily central nervous system (CNS) activity were not allowed. Patients were allowed the episodic use of these medications to treat cold symptoms or insomnia. · Outcomes/endpoints The following efficacy measures were collected: ·  The  CDRS-R  (Children's  Depression  Rating  Scale-Revised)  is  a  clinician-rated  instrument designed to measure the presence and severity of depression in children. The scale consists of 17 items  scored  on  a  1-  to  5-point  scale  or  1-  to  7-point  scale.  A  rating  of  1  indicates  normal functioning. Total scores range from 17 to 113. ·  The  CGI-Severity Scale evaluates the severity of illness at the time of assessment. The score ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). ·  The  CGI-Improvement  records  the  degree  of  the  patient's  improvement  at  the  time  of assessment since starting the study drug. The score ranges from 1 ('very much improved\") to 7 ('very much worse'). Efficacy analyses were secondary for this study and included the following: ·  Mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  for  CDRS-R  Total  score  (LOCF)  during  Study  Period II/III; · Mean change from baseline to endpoint for CGI-Severity score (LOCF) during Study Period II/III; · observed cases visit wise summaries during Study Period II/III for the CDRS-R Total score and for the CGI-Severity score. The following safety measurements were collected:  Adverse Events  Adverse Event Monitoring with a Systemic Questionnaire: The C-SSRS and the Self-Harm Follow-up  Form  were  used  for  additional  monitoring  of  suicide-related  events  behavior and/or ideations.  Concomitant Therapies  Laboratory Data Vital Signs Electrocardiograms Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Duloxetine steady-state plasma concentration from 64 patients (5 to 8 plasma concentrations per patient) was obtained to characterize the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in paediatric patients. A population  pharmacokinetic  model  was  developed  using  a  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling program.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Statistical Methods

Efficacy and safety analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. Last-observationcarried-forward imputation was primarily used for missing data. Observed cases analyses use all data available with no imputation performed.

A  lock  of  all  pharmacokinetic  Study  Period  II  data  occurred  after  the  last  patient  visit  was completed for Study Period II for the purpose of assessing duloxetine doses for future Phase 3 studies. The number of patients that had completed through this time point was 58.  In addition, an interim lock of all Study Period II/III data occurred for the purpose of assessing safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Results for this interim analysis were submitted within a  Briefing  Document  to  the  FDA;  however,  these  results  were  not  communicated  to  the investigators.

<!-- image -->

Subsequent  to  database  lock,  an  error  in  the  reporting  database  was  discovered.  This  error remains in the reporting database that was used for all analyses in this clinical study report. It is believed that this error is minor and did not affect any conclusions in this clinical study report.  Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analyses o Two additional blood draws for clinical chemistry tests were performed during Study Period II for Weeks 2 and 6. o Ad  hoc  analyses  combining  data  from  Study  Periods  II,  III,  and  IV  were  completed  to better characterize the longer-term safety and tolerability of duloxetine. o The incidence of sustained elevations in blood pressure was also evaluated. o Some changes to the planned pharmacokinetic analysis occurred following the review of the data and model evaluation: smoking status was not tested as a covariate, Schwartz formula  was  used  to  calculate  the  creatinine  clearance  in  children  less  than  12  years  of age, changes of criteria for retention of a covariate in the final model.  Results · Recruitment/ Number analysed Figure HMFN.10.1.

· Baseline data Patients  entered  the  study  with  moderate  to  moderately  high  levels  of  depression  (mean  baseline CDRS-R total score of 61.7, scores ranged from 40.0 to 81.0). Similarly, patients entered the study with moderate to severe illness, with a mean baseline CGI-Severity score of 4.5 (scores ranged from 4.0 to 6.0). For the 72 enrolled patients, the mean age at first episode of MDD was 10.75 years of age, and the mean number of previous MDD episodes was &lt;1 episode with a minimum and maximum range of 0-6 episodes. The  percent  of  patients  who  met  the  definition  of  compliance  with  study  drug  administration  was greater than 85% at all visit intervals during Study Periods II, III, and IV.

For children ≤12 years, the mean change (SD) from baseline to endpoint in Study Period II/III was 34.3 (12.3) and, for patients who entered Study Period IV, the mean change from baseline to endpoint was  -41.8  (9.9).  For  adolescents  &gt;12  years,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  Study Period II/III was -30.5 (13.3) and, for patients who entered Study Period IV the mean change from baseline to endpoint was -36.3 (11.7). · Pharmacokinetic results The  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  dataset  consisted  of  319  duloxetine  concentrations  and associated dose, dosing time, sampling time, and patient demographic information from 29 children (7-12 years) and 33 adolescents (13-17 years). A total of 90 samples were below of quantitation limit. Majority of the patients are nonsmokers, extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (EMs) and Caucasians and received  either  30-,  60-  or  90-mg  duloxetine  dose.  The  percent  of  poor  metabolizers  (PMs)  is consistent  with  the  prevalence  of  5%  -  7%  PMs  in  Caucasians.  The  typical  duloxetine  plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase in dose. Table HMFN.11.10.

Abbreviations: N = number of patients; n = number of duloxetine concentrations.

a Summary statistics reported as Mean ± Standard Deviation (Minimum - Maximum)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  median  dose-normalized  duloxetine  concentration  is  similar  in  EMs  (0.55  ng/mL/mg)  and  Ultra rapid  metabolizers  (UMs)  (0.48  ng/mL/mg);  however,  the  median  dose-normalized  duloxetine concentrations  are  nearly  3-fold  higher  in  PMs  (1.69  ng/mL/mg).  However,  there  was  considerable overlap in the observed concentrations for the PMs and EMs patients.

As  in  adults,  the  duloxetine  plasma-concentration  time  data  in  paediatric  patients  are  adequately described  by  a  one-compartment  pharmacokinetic  model.  The  base  model  is  able  to  determine  the inter-patient variability in CL/F and V/F with covariance using the omega block. The residual error is described by a proportional/additive error model.

Gender is the only covariate that had a statistically significant influence on CL/F. CL/F of duloxetine in female  patients  is  approximately  30%  lower  as  compared  with  the  male  patients.  Given  the interpatient and intrapatient variability, there is considerable overlap in duloxetine concentration-time profile in females and males as shown in the model predictions.

Dose-normalized  duloxetine  concentrations  following  QD  dosing  regimen  demonstrate  that  the duloxetine  concentration  in  paediatric  patients  (children:  0.57  and  adolescents:  0.56  ng/mL/mg)  is slightly lower than those observed in adults (0.7 ng/mL/mg). However, there is considerable overlap in the  concentration  range  and  the  range  of  concentration  in  paediatric  patients  are  within  the  range observed in adults. Figure HMFN.11.5.

## · Safety results

All  72  patients  enrolled  in  this  study  were  exposed  to  duloxetine  during  Study  Period  II/III  with  an overall mean duration of exposure of 106.7 days. Twenty patients initiated duloxetine treatment at 20 mg QD and 52 patients initiated duloxetine treatment at 30 mg QD based on body weight. A majority of patients (52/72; 72%) had a modal duloxetine dose of 60, 90, or 120 mg QD, 17 patients had a modal dose of 30 mg QD, and 3 patients had a modal dose of 20 mg QD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of patients (55/72; 76%) required escalation of the duloxetine dose to 60, 90, or 120 mg QD during Study Period II in order to optimize efficacy. No patients with a modal dose of duloxetine 20 mg completed Study Period III. The 48 patients who entered Study Period IV had a mean duration of exposure during Study Period IV of 77.5 days. Nine patients (12.5%) required dose decreases due to tolerability, and of these 9 patients, patients required dose decreases to below duloxetine 60 mg QD.

Analysis  results  for  Study  Period  II/III  and  Study  Period  IV  are  presented  separately  in  this  study report.  During  Study  Period  II/III,  nausea  was  the  most  common  TEAE  (18  patients,  25%).  Other TEAEs  reported  by  at  least  5%  of  patients  during  this  study  period  were  headache,  vomiting, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, sedation, somnolence, abdominal pain upper, fatigue, decreased appetite, dry mouth, gasteroenteritis viral, and rhinorrhea. During Study Period IV, no TEAE was reported by more  than  2  patients.  Dry  mouth  (4.2%),  fatigue  (4.2%)  and  somnolence  (4.2%)  were  the  most common TEAEs reported during Study Period IV.

- A female patient experienced the SAE of self-injurious behaviour. The patient had no previous history of such behaviour and was not taking any concomitant medications.

Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Notable Adverse Events There were no deaths reported during the study. Overall, 5 patients reported a total of 6 SAEs. All 6 SAEs had an onset date during Study Period II/III. None of the SAEs reported were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug, and none of these patients were identified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. · A male experienced the SAE of worsening of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The patient had a history of ODD, but was not taking any concomitant medications. · An female experienced the SAE of self-injurious behaviour. The patient had a history of sexual abuse and MDD. She was receiving acetylsalicylic acid as concomitant medication for plantar warts. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- A female assigned to open-label duloxetine for the treatment of MDD experienced the SAE of worsening of depression and suicidal ideation. The patient had a history of separation anxiety (resolved  in  2005)  and  a  motor  vehicle  accident  (2006),  which  resulted  in  whiplash, intermittent headaches, dizziness, back, neck, and shoulder pain. The patient was taking the concomitant medications of omega-3 supplement and calcium with magnesium.
- A female assigned to open-label duloxetine for the treatment of MDD, experienced the SAE of viral  gastroenteritis.  The  patient  had  no  relevant  medical  history  and  was  not  taking  any concomitant medications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse Events Reported as Reason for Discontinuation

Three patients reported 1 AE each (nausea, rash, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) that led to discontinuation  during  Study  Period  II/III.  These  events  were  considered  to  be  related  to  study treatment. One patient reported an AE that led to discontinuation during Study Period IV (irritability), and the event was not considered to be related to study treatment.

## Suicide-Related Outcomes

-  Children's Depression Rating Scale Item 13

An emergence of any suicidal ideation was reported for Study Period II/III; that is, the percentage of patients with score less than or equal to 2 at all baseline visits and greater than 2 within the study period was 2.8%. There was no incidence of emergence of substantial suicidal ideation in either Study Period II/III or Study Period IV; that is, the percentage of patients with score less than or equal to 2 at all baseline visits and greater than 4 within the study period was 0%. The incidence of worsening of suicidal ideation (that is, the maximum score within the study period was greater than the maximum baseline  score)  was  8.3%  for  Study  Period  II/III  and  2.1%  for  Study  Period  IV.  However,  an improvement  of  suicidal  ideation  (that  is,  a  decrease  from  the  maximum  baseline  score)  was  also shown in both Study Period II/III and Study Period IV; &gt;35% of patients had a decrease from the maximum suicidal ideation baseline score during these study periods.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

CDRS - Item 13.-  Treatment Emergent Worsening Treatment Phase II/III and Phase IV  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale One  (1.4%)  nonfatal  suicide  event  was  reported.  This  event  was  the  only  event  reported  for  the suicidal behaviour (1-5) category in the C-SSRS during Study Period II/III. During Study Period II/III, 1 (1.4%) patients experienced worsening of suicidal ideation from baseline at any time during Study Periods II or III. No suicidal  behaviours  (1-5  category  in  the  C-SSRS)  were  reported  during  Study  Period  IV.  During Study Period IV, 1 (2.2%) patient experienced worsening of suicidal ideation from baseline at anytime during Study Period IV. Out of 19 patients who reported suicidal ideation at baseline, 17 (89.5%) reported an improvement in suicidal ideation at last observation during Study Periods II and III (Table HMFN.14.51). For patients who had suicidal ideation at baseline and continued in the study through Study Period IV (N=8), all 8 patients (100%) reported an improvement in suicidal ideation at last observation during Study Period IV. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Baseline  to  endpoint  changes  were  observed  for  some  laboratory  analytes;  however,  these  changes were small relative to baseline and relative to the standard deviation.

Greater than 5% of patients experienced low hematocrit (8, 13.3%), high creatine phosphokinase (6, 8.7%),  and  high  inorganic  phosphorus  (16,  25.8%)  during  Study  Period  II/III.  The  only  laboratory value with a potentially clinically significant change experienced by greater than 5% of patients was inorganic phosphorus (7.7%) during Study Period IV. Transient elevations in creatine phosphokinase and inorganic phosphorus have also been observed in duloxetine-treated adults.

One patient experienced a potentially clinically significant (PCS) elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). After approximately 14 weeks, the patient's ALT reached 5X upper limit of normal (ULN), but total  bilirubin,  AST,  GGT,  and  CPK  were  all  normal.  A  retest  revealed  that  the  ALT  elevation  had returned  to  normal  within  3  days  while  the  patient  continued  to  take  study  drug,  and  the  event appeared to be an isolated elevation.

## Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

During Study Periods II/III and Study Period IV, patients experienced mean increases in diastolic blood  pressure,  systolic  blood  pressure,  and  weight  as  well  as  a  mean  decrease  in  pulse.  Small increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have also been observed in duloxetine-treated adults.

Overall, approximately 20%  of patients experienced PCS high diastolic blood pressure and approximately  10%  of  patients  experienced  PCS  high  systolic  blood  pressure,  while  3%  of  patients experienced PCS high pulse at anytime. The percentage of enrolled patients with sustained elevation of blood  pressure,  either  diastolic  or  systolic,  was  5.6%  (4/72).  One  patient  experienced  sustained elevation of diastolic blood pressure, and 3 patients experienced sustained elevation of systolic blood pressure. 3. Discussion on clinical aspects Duloxetine has been approved in the European Union for the treatment of severe urinary incontinence (Ariclaim,  Yentreve)  and  for  the  treatment  of  major  depressive  disorders,  the  treatment  of  diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (Cymbalta, Xeristar). Treatment of children and adolescents with duloxetine is not recommended in the approved SPC. This study was conducted as part of a paediatric plan committed with the FDA. In the EU there is no agreed PIP  for  duloxetine  and  therefore  this  is  provided  as  a  standalone  study  in  line  with  the  current  6 months reporting timeline. This study was conducted to provide preliminary results on safety and pharmacokinetics in paediatric MDD population. A total of 72 patients aged 7 to 17 years were titrated from 20 (or 30) mg to 120 mg and 41 were treated up to 30 weeks. Two third of patients  were escalated up to 60, 90 or 120 mg dosage, what it is within the range of adult dosage recommendations. The safety profile of duloxetine at  those  dosages in paediatric population resulted in general similar to that observed in adults. The fragmented method of reporting of AEs by study period hampered having a global view of the product. Nevertheless, no new safety findings have been observed. Of concern, two suicidal ideations and two self-injurious  behaviour AEs were reported. The evaluation of specific suicide-related outcomes does not provide additional concerns on this issue, what could be considered expectable in the context of the condition. Duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase of the dose. Gender (and not age,  body  weight,  creatinine  clearance,  CYP2D6  status,  or  dose)  was  the  only  characteristic  that seemed to influence the pharmacokinetic of duloxetine. As it  was  observed  in  adults the  inter-  and intrapatient variability is very high, with an overlap in duloxetine concentration-time profile in females and males. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Children and adolescents involved in the trial suffered a moderate depression. About 7% of patients had previously been treated with psychotherapy and over 40% received antidepressant drugs. Of note, amphetamine-derived  drugs  and  atomoxetine  were  reported  by  27/72  patients  although  apparently only 3 patients reported  concomitant  attention  deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnose.  Efficacy parameters measured after 8 weeks and 18 weeks of treatment showed lower scores (response) with respect to baseline scores. The open label design and the small size of the trial make these results inconclusive.

According to the MAH statement, results from this study will be informative for the designs of larger, controlled,  Phase  III  studies.  At  present  the  current  benefit/risk  ratio  of  duloxetine  use  in  children, which is considered negative, should remain without changes in the SPC.

## Rapporteur's Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The  additional  data  provided  in  this  submission  do  not  change  the  current  benefit/risk  ratio  of duloxetine  use  in  children,  which  is  considered  negative,  as  stated  in  currently  approved  SPC. According to the MAH's conclusion, given that there were no new safety findings in paediatric MDD patients  relative  to  adult  patients  in  this  open  label  study,  the  additional  data  provided  in  this submission do no warrant an update of the product information.

##  Recommendation
