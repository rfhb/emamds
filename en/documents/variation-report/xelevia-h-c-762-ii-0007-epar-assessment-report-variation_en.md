## 1. Introduction

Sitagliptin  phosphate  is  an  orally  active,  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors act by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. These hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, are released from the  intestine  in  response  to  a  meal  and  are  part  of  an  endogenous  system  involved  in  glucose homeostasis.

Sitagliptin was approved for marketing in the EU in 2007 and currently has therapeutic indications as a second line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to be used in combination with metformin, a PPARγ agonist, or a sulphonylurea (alone or in combination with metformin).

This variation was filed to extend the indication for patients with T2DM in whom the use of a PPAR γ agonist  (i.e.  a  thiazolidinedione)  is  appropriate,  to  be  used  in  triple  combination  with  the  PPAR γ agonist  and  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  dual  therapy  with  these  agents  do  not  provide adequate glycaemic control.

In  support  of  this  extension  of  the  indication,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  has presented the  results  of  a  54-weeks  efficacy  and  safety  study  (P052).  This  was  a  Phase  III  clinical study designed to assess the glycaemic efficacy and tolerability of sitagliptin added to the combination of metformin and rosiglitazone compared with placebo in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on dual combination therapy. 18-week results of this study were already presented in April 2008 as a Follow-up Measure.

Changes to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) have been proposed to reflect the results of this study.

In  addition,  a  minor  revision  to  Section  5.1  of  the  SPC  was  proposed  to  include  two  sentences  to describe the effects of sitagliptin and metformin on GLP-1 concentrations.  These GLP-1 data have been reviewed by the CHMP in a previous submission. An update of section 4.9 (overdose) of the SPC was also proposed to include data from a Phase-I multiple dose study.

## 2. Non-Clinical aspects

## Environmental risk assessment (ERA)

The ERA submitted for the active ingredient sitagliptin is an updated version of the ERA submitted by the MAH in the dossier for Xelevia (EMEA/H/C/0762).

In Phase I the MAH calculated a PECsurface water of 0.5 µg/L for sitagliptin under the assumption of a Fpen of 1%, which is above the trigger of 0.01 µg/L. As the PECsurface water is larger than 10 ng/l, the MAH has provided an environmental risk assessment according to Phase II of the guideline on the environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006).

Sitagliptin is not susceptible to photodegradation. The substance is hydrolytically stable. The MAH stated  a  K ow  of  0.6,  and  the  respective  study  is  missing.  Provided  that  this  K ow  is  valid  there  is  no indication of a bioaccumulation potential. The Koc is less than 10,000 (logKoc = 2.88). Therefore, an evaluation of the risk to the terrestrial compartment is not required.

Sitagliptin is not readily biodegradable. The MAH submitted the results of a test on the aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems according to OECD 308. In both aerobic and anaerobic  conditions,  there  is  a  shifting  of  parent  to  sediment  of  &gt;10%  on  day  14.  Therefore,  a prolonged sediment toxicity with Chironomus riparius has been performed. The results show that the PECsed/PNEC was below 1, thus, no risk for sediment dwelling organism is expected.

The  MAH  has  submitted  data  on  the  ecotoxicity  of  sitagliptin.  The  comparison  of  the  predicted concentration  in  surface  water  with  the  predicted  no-effect  concentration  did  not  result  in  risk quotients above 1 (for algae, fish and water flea) or 0.1 (for micro-organisms). The PECground water to PNECdaphnia  risk  quotient  is  also  below  1.  The  MAH  did  not  provide  data  on  the  PECsediment  but stated that the results suggested that the drug substance is not toxic to sediment organisms.

The results for toxicity to algae were obtained from a test performed in 2004 in accordance with the OECD guideline for the Algae Growth Inhibition Test (OECD 201, 1984 Version).  The study was conducted in accordance and in full compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations for tests of substances as promulgated by the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals (OECD, 1998). A new algae test has been completed in June 2009, according to the most recent version of OECD 201.

## 3. Clinical aspects

## 3.1 Clinical efficacy

## A) Main study/Methods

Study  P052  was  a  multicenter,  multinational,  double-blind,  randomized,  parallel-group,  54-week Phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin 100 mg with placebo in patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on combination therapy with metformin (at a dose of ≥ 1500 mg/day) and rosiglitazone (at a dose of ≥ 4 mg/day). Patients with T2DM on dual combination therapy  with  metformin  and  a  PPAR γ agonist,  a  PPAR γ agonist  and  a  sulfonylurea  agent,  or metformin and a sulfonylurea agent were eligible.

Male and female patients who were between 18 and 78 years old with inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11%) when on dual combination therapy with metformin at a dose of ≥ 1500 mg/day  and  rosiglitazone  at  a  dose  of ≥ 4  mg/day  (either  at  study  entry  or  after  a  wash-off/dosetitration/dose-stable  period  -see  study  design  below-)  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  either sitagliptin 100 mg or matching placebo. Patients were on a stable dose of metformin and rosiglitazone for  at  least  12  weeks  prior  to  randomisation.  Dosing  regimen  for  open-label  metformin  and rosiglitazone was to remain stable for the duration of the study. Sites conducted a patient telephone contact midway between each clinic visit to reinforce diet/exercise and to review study therapy dosing instruction. Patients not meeting specific glycaemic goals were to receive rescue therapy with an openlabel sulfonylurea (SU), primarily glipizide.

AHA = antihyperglycemic agent; R=randomization; SU=sulfonylurea AHA = antihyperglycemic agent; R=randomization; SU=sulfonylurea

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c;  2-hour  post-meal  glucose (PMG)  after  a  standard  meal  challenge,  and  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG)  were  key  secondary endpoints. Other secondary endpoints/objectives included the proportion of patients meeting glycaemic goals and glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide levels obtained during a 3-point meal tolerance  test  (MTT).  This  study  has  been  completed  and  data  from  the  54  weeks  (double  blind) treatment period are reviewed.

The medical risk of inadequate glycaemic control was considered and efforts to limit this risk were implemented in this protocol. To ensure that patients were not exposed to poorer control for an undue period of time, strict glycaemic rescue and discontinuation criteria were included in the study design.

The population studied in P052 was the one using sitagliptin as add-on therapy to dual combination therapy with metformin and a PPAR γ agonist (rosiglitazone) in the clinical setting. The entry criteria, as  well  as  a  worldwide  enrolment  of  the  study,  supported  the  inclusion  of  a  broad  range  of  adult patients with T2DM, with a variety of racial backgrounds and across the usual age range of patients with this disease.

While  patients  with  unstable  medical  conditions,  such  as  active  liver  disease,  and  patients  with medical conditions that limited the use of metformin (e.g., moderate to severe renal insufficiency) or rosiglitazone (e.g., NYHA Class II-IV heart failure) were excluded from participation, patients with a wide range of concurrent medical conditions and concomitant medications were included. The study allowed  for  the  inclusion  of  older  patients  ( ≥ 65  years)  with  T2DM,  while  patients  &lt;18  years  were excluded.

Patients could be switched and titrated from their own therapy to metformin and PPAR γ agonist. For metformin, the washout/titration period of 12 weeks would be long enough to measure the therapeutic effect. However, the CHMP questioned whether the maximum therapeutic effect would be achieved in this titration period for the PPAR γ agonist and considered that more time might be needed to measure the maximum therapeutic effect of the PPAR γ agonist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients in the placebo group had been on combination therapy with a PPAR γ agonist and metformin (60.9%), relative to the sitagliptin group (48.8%), while in the sitagliptin group a higher proportion of patients had been on combination therapy with a sulfonylurea and metformin (48.2%), relative to the placebo group (37%). If the therapeutic effect of the PPAR γ agonist lasts longer than the 12 week period, then this will favour the results in the Sitagliptin group. The CHMP requested during its January 2009 plenary meeting that the MAH should demonstrate that the maximum time period of the achieved therapeutic effect of a PPAR γ agonist is 12 weeks.

In response to the CHMP concerns, the MAH showed data of the placebo group in which patients who were on a PPAR γ agonist at screening had a slightly greater HbA1c response at Week 18. The change in  baseline  after  Week  54  was  also  comparable  between  the  patients  who  were  on  PPAR γ agonist treatment and the patients who were not on PPAR γ agonist therapy at screening. Furthermore, there was  a  non-significant  (p=0.251)  covariate  effect  of  diabetes  pharmacotherapy  at  screening  on  the HbA1c change from baseline. This data suggests that the HbA1c decrease in the sitagliptin group in the P052 Study is not caused by the higher proportion of patients in the sitagliptin group who were not on a PPAR γ agonist at screening. The small change in HbA1c from baseline is more likely to be a direct effect of sitagliptin.

## GCP

The  clinical  trial  was  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  has provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial, which included sites outside the community, was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## B) Results

## B.1. Patient disposition, baseline data and demographics

A total of 742 patients were screened, from which 464 were screen failures. The most common reason for  not  being  randomised  was  failure  to  meet  HbA1c  inclusion  criteria  (46.8%  of  patients  not randomized).  The  next  most  common  reason  for  patients  not  being  randomized  was  because  of laboratory  values  (other  than  HbA1c)  meeting  protocol  exclusion  criteria  (17.7%  of  patients  not randomized).  These  included  the  following  parameters:  creatinine ≥ 1.4  mg/dL  (123.8 µ mol/L) for males or ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (114.9 µ mol/L) for females, an elevated ALT or AST &gt;2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN), TSH &lt;0.3 mIU/L or &gt;5 mIU/L, or triglycerides &gt;600 mg/dL (6.78 mmol/L).

Two hundred seventy eight (278) patients with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control on a PPAR γ agonist  (rosiglitazone)  in  combination  with  metformin  were  randomized  in  the  study  at  41  sites worldwide. One study site was identified as non-compliant with some of the requirements of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). For this reason, the patient data from the 16 patients randomized at that site were deemed unreliable and were removed from all analyses (efficacy and safety). This concerns 11 patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  and  5  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  Therefore,  the  analyses  were performed on a total of 262 randomised patients.

A high number of patients were screened. However, many patients were excluded, mainly because they  were  ineligible.  Therefore,  the  resulted  population  is  a  highly  selected  patient  group  on  dual therapy.

Data Source: [16.4.2.4: 16.4.2.11]

A total of 219 (83.6%) patients completed the study. A higher percentage of patients completed the study  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  Reasons  for  discontinuation  were generally  similar  between  treatment  groups  with  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  placebo treatment group discontinuing due to lack of efficacy. During the conduct of this study, a report was published suggesting an association of rosiglitazone with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; subsequently, seven patients (3 patients in the sitagliptin treatment group (1.7%) and 4 patients in the placebo treatment group (4.3%) discontinued due to concerns over the use of rosiglitazone).

Demographic and anthropometric traits were generally similar across treatment groups. In addition, baseline disease characteristics, including duration of disease, and baseline HbA1c and FPG were also similar across treatment groups.

The mean age of the randomized population was 54.5 years, 57.6% were males, mean duration of diabetes was 9.3 years, and the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.8%. There were more Asian (34.1%) in the sitaglipitin  group then in the placebo group (26.1%) and more Hispanic in the placebo (10.9%) than in the sitaglipitin group (7.6%).

At study entry, all patients were on dual combination therapy with: a PPAR γ agonist and metformin, a sulfonylurea and metformin, or a PPAR γ agonist and a sulphonylurea, as required by the protocol.

Of the randomized patients 23.4% had baseline HbA1c values &lt;8.0% and 43.3% had baseline HbA1c values ≥ 9.0%.

Two hundred and fifty-nine (98.9%) of the 262 randomized patients had at least 1 secondary diagnosis other  than  T2DM.  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders,  vascular  disorders,  musculoskeletal  and connective tissue disorders and nervous system disorders were the most common categories by SOC of secondary diagnoses.

The  most  common  specific  secondary  diagnoses  were  hypertension  (sitagliptin  63.5%  vs  59.8%  in placebo group), hypercholesterolaemia (sitagliptin 24.1% vs 19.6% in placebo group), hyperlipidaemia (sitagliptin 22.9% vs 27.2% in placebo group), dyslipidaemia (sitagliptin 24.1% vs 19.6% in placebo group and obesity (sitagliptin 19.4% vs 18.5% in placebo group). There were no clinically  important  differences  among  treatment  groups  in  the  frequency  or  type  of  secondary diagnoses.

All of the 262 randomized patients had prior therapies (i.e., took at least 1 medication from 30 days prior to the screening visit [Visit 1] up until the day before randomization). The most common prior drug  therapeutic  categories  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  treatment  groups  were  drugs  used  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

diabetes, agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, serum lipid-reducing agents and analgesics. There were no clinically important differences between treatment groups.

Two hundred and fifteen (82.1%) patients took concomitant therapies (i.e., took at least 1 medication post-randomization).  The  most  common  concomitant  drug  therapeutic  categories  were  for  antibacterials for systemic use, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products. There were no  meaningful  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the  use  of  concomitant  medications  postrandomization.

## B.2. HbA1c reduction (primary endpoint)

## · Primary Endpoint HbA1c at Week 18

Table 2 displays Week 18 HbA1c results for the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. The reduction observed with sitagliptin was statistically significantly greater than that observed with placebo. The analysis of HbA1c conducted in the completers population at Week 18 supported the conclusion for the primary analysis.

The analysis of HbA1c conducted in the completers population at Week 54 showed a greater reduction from baseline  as  compared  with  the  analysis  of  the  FAS  population  within  both  the  sitagliptin  and placebo groups. The between group difference in the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline was smaller in the completers population than in the FAS population and was no longer statistically significant.  It  is  noted,  however,  that  the  completers  population  was  defined  by  post-randomization events: many  more  placebo  patients  than  sitagliptin patients  underwent  glycaemic  rescue  or discontinued, and as a result, the baseline HbA1c level of the placebo group was lower than the one of the sitagliptin group.

The profile of LS mean changes from baseline in HbA1c over time (Figure 2) shows a progressive reduction that reached a plateau at Week 24 in the sitagliptin group and remained stable through Week 54. In the placebo group, there was a reduction at Week 6 in LS mean change from baseline, which remained stable through Week 54.

The CHMP concurred that there is a significant HbA1c reduction in the sitagliptin group compared to placebo at week 18 and week 54 in the FAS analysis set and in the completers analysis.

## · HbA1c Goal &lt; 7%

The results of analysis of proportions of patients with Week 18 HbA1c values below 7.0% are shown in  Table  4  in  the  FAS  population.  The  odds  of  achieving  a  Week  18  HbA1c  level  &lt;7.0%  were statistically significantly higher in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (nominal p=0.003). The results of the analyses of HbA1c goal attainment of &lt;7.0% at Week 54 (Table 5) or at both Week 18 and Week 54 (Table 6) are consistent with the results observed at Week 18. The same conclusions can be drawn for the results of analyses for the completers population.

The baseline HbA1c value was a significant covariate (p&lt;0.001) because patients with higher baseline values tended to have greater reduction in HbA1c from baseline. However, there were no apparent differences in the between treatment effects across the different baseline HbA1c levels.

The results of analysis of proportions of patients with HbA1c values below 7.0% at week 18, at week 54 and week 18 and 54 show a lot of variation. Only 14.9% of the patients in the sitagliptin group showed a HbA1c &lt; 7% at both visits. The CHMP, during its January 2009 meeting requested that the MAH should explain these results. The CHMP also requested that the MAH should demonstrate the complete statistical values like it was done for the 18 weeks at week 54 and week 18 and week 54.

In its responses to the CHMP request, the MAH argued that the percentages of patients at the HbA1c goal of &lt;7.0% was statistically significant higher in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group  at  Week  18  and  at  Week  54.  Similarly,  the  difference  between  groups  in  the  percentage  of patients meeting this goal at both Week 18 and Week 54 was also statistically significant in favour of sitagliptin. Although some patients on sitagliptin who met the HbA1c &lt;7.0% goal at Week 18 did not meet this goal at Week 54 (n=12; 7.1%), a larger number of patients (n=19; 11.3%) who did not meet the goal at Week 18 did meet the goal at Week 54.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH further justified that there is a relation (correlation coefficient = 0.70, p&lt;0.001) between results at Week 18 and Week 54. This is consistent with the maximum effect occurring at or near the Week 18 time point.

On the view of the results the CHMP was of the opinion that the effect of sitagliptin on HbA1c level goal &lt;7.0% is modest; although differences are statistically significant, confidence intervals are very wide. Nevertheless, the CHMP agreed that there might be patients who can benefit from addition of sitagliptin to metformin and pioglitazone.

A relatively high proportion of patients had high baseline HbA1c values in this population. The results of the summary statistics for HbA1c change by HbA1c at baseline at week 18 are shown in Table 7. Table 7:

The Week 54 data were additionally submitted by the MAH. The HbA1c level decrease was greater with higher baseline HbA1c levels. These results were in line with the Week 18 data.

## B.3. Secondary Endpoints

## · Two-Hour Post-Meal Glucose (2-hour PMG) at week 18

Table 8 displays 2-hour PMG results for the FAS population at Week 18. Decreases in 2-hour PMG relative to baseline were observed in both groups, with a statistically significantly greater decrease in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group.

The  analysis  of  2-hour  PMG  conducted  in  the  completers  population  at  week  18  supported  the conclusion for the primary analysis.

## · Two-Hour PMG at Week 54

A significantly greater reduction in 2-hour PMG was observed with sitagliptin at Week 54 than that observed with placebo (see Table 9).

The  analysis  of  2-hour  PMG  conducted  in  the  completers  population  at  Week  54  showed  greater within group decreases from baseline in both treatment groups and smaller between group difference in LS mean reduction from baseline compared to the analysis of the FAS population due to the same reason as the endpoint of HbA1c.

## · Fast Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 18

Table 10 displays Week 18 FPG results for the FAS population. A statistically significantly greater decrease in mean change from baseline in FPG was observed in the sitagliptin group relative to the placebo group.

The analysis  of  FPG  conducted  in  the  completers  population  at  Week  18  supported  the  conclusion from the FAS analysis.

## · FPG at Week 54

Similarly, a significantly greater reduction in FPG was observed with sitagliptin at Week 54 relative to that  observed  with  placebo  for  the  FAS  population  (nominal  p&lt;0.001,  Table  11).  The  repeated measures analysis used as a secondary approach to handling missing data supported the conclusion for the primary analysis.

The analysis of FPG conducted in the completers population at Week 54 shows greater decreases from baseline within both the sitagliptin and placebo groups and smaller between group difference on the reduction from baseline as compared to the analysis of the FAS population due to the same reason as the endpoint of HbA1c.

## · Durability of FPG Effect

The profiles of mean change from baseline in FPG over time (Figure 3) showed reduction in mean FPG in the sitagliptin group at Week 6, with a reduction through Week 54. There was a reduction in the placebo group and the FPG level was stabilized from Week 18 through Week 54.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The coefficient of durability (COD), defined here as the slope of the time profile of mean change from baseline in the outcome variable (FPG), was derived using the LS Means produced by the ANCOVA models. The estimation of COD provides a quantitative assessment for the rate of deterioration of a treatment after reaching its peak efficacy. A treatment with larger COD tends to be less to Week 54 and its 95% CI were provided. Standard errors for the COD were computed by bootstrapping subjects within treatment groups. There was no statistically significant between-group difference in the COD (nominal p=0.612).

There  is  a  statistically  significantly  greater  decrease  in  2-hour  PMG  relative  to  baseline  in  the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group at 18 weeks and at 54 weeks in the FAS analysis and in the completers analysis. The reduction in FPG is smaller but also significant.

## B.4. Tertiary endpoints

Other parameters such as Measures of Beta-Cell Function and Insulin Secretion (like Proinsulin/Insulin Ratio, HOMA B, 2-hour post-meal C-peptide, 2-hour proinsulin to insulin ratio, 2hour  post-meal  insulin,  2-hour  post-meal  proinsulin,  insulinogenic  index  and  AUC  endpoints)  are supportive to the primary endpoints results

## B.5. Time to Rescue

The medical risk of inadequate glycaemic control was considered and efforts to limit this risk were implemented in the study protocol. To ensure that patients were not exposed to poorer control for an undue period of time, strict glycaemic rescue and discontinuation criteria were included in the study design. Because of the length of the placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period, progressively stricter  glycaemic  rescue/discontinuation  criteria  were  implemented,  so  that  patients  with  poorer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

glycaemic control were rescued early in the double-blind treatment period. Indeed, rescue could have been  initiated  immediately  after  the  patient  entered  the  double-blind  period  if  the  patient's  FPG reflected deterioration of control. In addition, all patients received initial and continued counselling for diet and exercise, which may lead to improvements in glycaemic control.

The study design included rescue  therapy  with  a  sulfonylurea  (generally  glipizide)  in  patients  with poor  glycaemic  control.  Rescue  therapy  was  provided  to  allow  patients  to  benefit  from  continued participation in the study and to support the collection of a larger database of safety and tolerability information while avoiding prolonged exposure to poor glycaemic control. Patients who were rescued were  included  in  the  glycaemic/lipid  analysis  and  primary  safety  analysis  up  until  the  initiation  of rescue  therapy.  A  secondary  analysis  of  safety  included  data  regardless  of  the  initiation  of  rescue therapy.

Figure  4  presents  results  for  the  analysis  of  time  to  receiving  glycaemic  rescue  medication.  A significantly smaller proportion of patients in the sitagliptin treatment group initiated rescue therapy by Week 54 compared to patients in the placebo treatment group. The numbers of patients at risk (i.e., patients who were not rescued) at each specified calendar week are also provided in Figure 4.

The progressive increase in the proportion of patients rescued in both treatment groups after Week 30 was  due  to  the  implementation  of  progressively  stricter  rescue  criteria.  Specifically,  the  rescue criterion  from  baseline  through  Week  9  was  an  FPG  value  &gt;280  mg/dL;  the  rescue  criterion  after Week 9 through Week 24 was an FPG value &gt;240 mg/dL; the rescue criterion after Week 24 was an HbA1c value &gt;8.5%.

## 3.2 Clinical safety

## A) Clinical adverse experiences

Over  the  54-week  treatment  period,  slightly  higher  incidences  of  overall  adverse  experiences  were observed  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (75.3%  and  70.7%  respectively). These were not indicative  of  isolated  increases  but  rather  reflective  of  a  number  of  slightly  higher incidences of specific AEs across a number of body systems. In addition, slightly higher incidences of serious  adverse  experiences  were  observed  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group (8.2% and 3.3% respectively), but no serious adverse experience was reported in more than 2 patients in a treatment group and none was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.

Slightly  higher  incidences  of  drug-related  adverse  experiences  were  also  observed  in  the  sitagliptin group (15.3% and 10.9% respectively) compared to the placebo group. For all summary measures, the 95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  around  the  between-group  difference  included  '0'.  The  number  of patients discontinued due to adverse experiences was low and similar in both treatment groups, and no patients  were  discontinued  in  either  treatment  group  due  to  a  drug-related  adverse  experience. No deaths were reported in this study.

The results of the clinical adverse experience profile and summary analyses for the secondary safety analysis (all data included) are not meaningfully different from those in the primary safety analysis (excluding data after initiation of glycaemic rescue therapy).

Adverse experiences by System Organ Class (SOC) were reported most frequently for Infections and Infestations,  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  and  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders. The incidences of adverse experiences grouped by SOC were generally comparable between the two treatment groups. Over 54 weeks, a higher incidence of adverse experiences was reported for patients in the sitagliptin group (9 (5.3%) patients) compared with the placebo group (1 (1.1%) patient) in the Cardiac Disorders SOC. Other SOCs for which a numerically higher incidence of adverse experiences was observed in the sitagliptin treatment group and with a between-group difference &gt;2% include: Eye Disorders; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions; Infections and Infestations; Injury, Poisoning,  and  Procedural  Complications;  Metabolism  and  Nutrition  Disorders;  and  Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders SOCs. For all SOCs, the observed between-group differences in the incidence of adverse experiences were generally similar to those observed at Week 18 and the 95% CI included '0'. Specific adverse experiences are discussed in the following section.

The above-mentioned increase in incidence of cardiac disorders observed during the use of sitagliptin was noted by the CHMP, who requested that these types of events be closely monitored. The MAH was requested to submit this complete data set in the upcoming PSURs.

## A.1. Hypoglycemia

Over the 54 weeks, hypoglycemia was observed in 7 patients (4.1%) in the sitagliptin group who had 10 episodes in total. In the placebo group only one patient (1.1%) with one episode of hypoglycemia was reported. All episodes of hypoglycemia were considered mild in intensity, none required either non-medical or medical assistance, and no patients were discontinued due to the adverse experience of hypoglycemia. Events of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group were considered by the investigator to be  related  to  the  study  medication  in  4  of  the  patients  and  not  related  in  the  other  3  patients.  The episode of hypoglycaemia in 1 patient in the placebo group was considered not related to the study drug by the investigator.

## A.2. Body Weight

An increase from baseline in body weight at Week 18 was noted in both groups (sitagliptin 0.4 kg; placebo 0.1 kg); not statistically significant (p=0.362). At 54 weeks, the increase in body weight from baseline  was  1.8  kg  for  the  sitagliptin  group,  versus  1.2  kg  for  the  placebo  group.  No  statistically significant (p=0.372) between-group difference was observed for body weight increase at Week 54.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## A.3. Gastro-intestinal Side Effects

Over 54 weeks, the incidences of the  pre-specified  gastrointestinal  adverse  experiences  (abdominal pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea)  were  numerically  higher  in  the  placebo  treatment  group compared with the incidences observed in the sitagliptin group.

## A.4. Other

Adverse experiences of headache, independent of relationship with the study drug, were reported for 10 (5.9%) patients in the sitagliptin treatment group compared with 4 (4.3%) patients in the placebo treatment  group.  Of  those,  adverse  experiences  of  headache  in  4  (2.4%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin group and none in the placebo group were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug. Two of these events resolved while the patient was on study medication. The other two (reported  as  adverse  experiences)  were  ongoing  at  study  completion.  Adverse  experiences  in  these four patients were mild in intensity and did not result in interruption or discontinuation of the study drug.

For most laboratory parameters, mean changes over time and frequency of values meeting Pre-defined Laboratory Criteria (PDLC) were similar in the sitagliptin treatment group compared to the placebo group.  Over  the  54-week  treatment  period,  similar  incidences  of  laboratory  adverse  experiences overall and laboratory drug-related adverse experiences were observed in both treatment groups. No laboratory  serious  adverse  experiences  were  reported.  One  patient  in  the  sitagliptin  group  was discontinued due to a laboratory drug-related adverse experience of decreased white blood cells. There were no discontinuations due to laboratory adverse experiences in the placebo group.

## C) Risk Management plan

There was no change in the pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation activities as defined in the RMP as it existed at the time of submission.  An update to the RMP was submitted in June 2009.

## Section 4.1 (Therapeutic indications)

'For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, Xelevia is indicated:

- in combination with the PPAR γ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPAR γ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- in  combination  with  the  PPAR γ agonist  and  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control'

## Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use)

' In  clinical  trials  of  Xelevia  as  monotherapy  and  as  part  of  combination  therapy  with  agents  not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i.e. metformin and/or pioglitazonea PPAR γ agonist), …'

## Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects)

' In 9 10 large clinical trials of up to 2 years in duration, over 29700 patients have received treatment with  Xelevia  100 mg  per  day  alone  or  in  combination  with  metformin,  a  sulphonylurea  (with  or without metformin) or a PPAR γ agent (with or without metformin). In a pooled analysis of 9 of these trials, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse experiences considered drug-related was 0.8 % with 100 mg per day and 1.5 % with other treatments. No adverse reactions considered as drug-related were  reported  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin  occurring  in  excess  (&gt; 0.2 %  and  difference  &gt; 1 patient)  of  that  in  patients  treated  with  control.  In  an  additional  combination  study  with  a  PPAR γ agent  (rosiglitazone)  and  metformin,  no  patients  were  discontinued  due  to  adverse  experiences considered as drug-related. '

- '5 In  this  study  of  sitagliptin  100 mg  once  daily  in  combination  with  rosiglitazone  and  metformin, which continued through 54 weeks, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the sitagliptin combination  compared  to treatment with the placebo combination was 15.3 % and 10.9 %, respectively. Other drug-related adverse reactions reported in the  54-week  analysis  (frequency  common)  in  patients  treated  with  the  sitagliptin  combination occurring in excess (&gt; 0.2 % and difference &gt; 1 patient) of that in patients treated with the placebo combination  were:  headache,  cough,  vomiting,  hypoglycaemia,  fungal  skin  infection,  and  upper respiratory tract infection.'

## Section 4.9 (Overdose)

'In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days .'

## Section 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties)

'In  a  two-day  study  in  healthy  subjects,  sitagliptin  alone  increased  active  GLP-1  concentrations, whereas  metformin  alone  increased  active  and  total  GLP-1  concentrations  to  similar  extents.  Coadministration  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  had  an  additive  effect  on  active  GLP-1  concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.'

'Overall,  sitagliptin  improved  glycaemic  control  when  given  as  monotherapy,  when  used  in combination with metformin (initial or add-on therapy), in combination with a sulphonylurea (with or without  metformin),  and  in  combination  with  a  thiazolidinedione,  and  in  combination  with  a thiazolidinedione and metformin….'

'A 54-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg  once  daily)  added  to  the  combination  of  rosiglitazone  and  metformin.  The  addition  of sitagliptin to rosiglitazone and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters at  the  primary  timepoint  of  Week  18,  with  improvements  sustained  through  the  end  of  the  study. Change  from  baseline  in  body  weight  was  similar  for  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin  relative  to placebo (1.9 vs. 1.3 kg).'

'Some patients have experienced the following side effects while taking Xelevia in combination with rosiglitazone and metformin:

Common:  headache,  cough,  diarrhoea,  vomiting,  low  blood  sugar,  fungal  skin  infection,  upper respiratory infection, swelling of the hands or legs.'

## 4. Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment

Study P052 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase III study to compare the efficacy of sitagliptin 100 mg with placebo in patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on combination therapy with metformin (at a dose of ≥ 1500 mg/day) and rosiglitazone (at a dose of ≥ 4 mg/day). The study was designed to include patients on different types of dual medication. Patients  with  T2DM on  dual  combination  therapy  with  metformin  and  a  PPAR γ agonist,  a  PPAR γ agonist  and  a  sulfonylurea  agent,  or  metformin  and  a  sulfonylurea  agent  were  eligible.  Prior  to randomisation patients switched from their own therapy to metformin and rosiglitazone and the dose was  titrated.  The  wash-out/titration  period  for  metformin  and  PPAR γ agonist  was  long  enough. The  mean  duration  of  diabetes  was  relatively  long  with  9.3  years  and  mean  HbA1c  levels  were relatively high (8.8%) in this study population.

Furthermore, to ensure that patients were not exposed to poorer control for an undue period of time, strict glycaemic rescue and discontinuation criteria were included in the study design. Between 18 and 30 weeks the rescue criteria were based on FPG levels &gt;13.32 mmol/L. The sitagliptin and placebo group were more or less the same regarding glycaemic rescue therapy. Starting from Week 24, the rescue criteria changed to a longer-term measurement method: HbA1c &gt;8.5%. After week 30 a strong difference between the two groups occurred.

In  study  P052,  sitagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  inadequate  control  on  metformin  and rosiglitazone provided improvement in glycaemic control compared with placebo. Least square means for change from baseline at week 54 with 95% CI Full-Analysis-Set Population for HbA1c (%): -0.77 (-1.04, -0.50) for FPG (mg/dL): -17.4 (-26.4, -8.4) and for 2-hourPMG (mg/dL) -34.1 (-48.4, -19.9) for sitagliptin compared vs placebo. There was a trend that patients with higher baseline HbA1c values had a greater mean decrease from baseline in HbA1c in both sitagliptin group and placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Add-on therapy  with  sitagliptin  resulted  in  greater  proportions  of  patients  achieving  the  glycaemic goal of HbA1c &lt;7% compared to placebo. The percentage of patients achieving HbA1c&lt; 7% at week 54 (26.2%) was higher than at week 18 (22%), however the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c&lt; 7% at week 18 and week 54 was only 14.9%. Results were variable and confidence intervals were wide. Nevertheless, there might be patients who can benefit from addition of sitagliptin to metformin and PPAR γ agonist treatment.

The overall exposure and safety population examined was sufficient. A higher percentage of patients completed the study in the sitagliptin group compared  to the placebo group. Reasons for discontinuation were generally similar between treatment groups with a higher percentage of patients in the placebo treatment group discontinuing due to lack of efficacy.

Over the 54-week treatment period slightly higher incidences of serious adverse experiences, slightly higher incidences of overall adverse experiences and slightly higher incidences of drug-related adverse experiences were observed in the sitagliptin group compared to the placebo group (8.2% vs 3.3% and 75.3% vs 70.7% and 15.3% vs 10.9%  respectively). No unexpected adverse events and no deaths were reported.

The overall number of patients reported to have clinical adverse experiences of hypoglycaemia during the study was low and the between-group difference in the incidence of adverse experiences was not statistically  significant.  The  few  hypoglycaemia  events  reported  in  this  study  with  sitagliptin  were mild, none required assistance for treatment, and none caused interruption or discontinuation of study drug.

Over 54 weeks, the incidences of the  pre-specified  gastrointestinal  adverse  experiences  (abdominal pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea)  were  numerically  higher  in  the  placebo  treatment  group compared with the incidences observed in the sitagliptin group.

After 54 weeks body weight increased 1.8 kg in the sitagliptin group and 1.2 kg in the placebo group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant.

In  conclusion, sitagliptin  100mg  caused  a  very  small,  but  statistically  significant  reduction  in  mean HbA1c in respect  to  baseline  HbA1c.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  postprandial glucose  levels  in  the  sitagliptin  group.  In  the  sitagliptin  group,  a  greater  proportion  of  patients achieved  the  glycaemic  goal  of  HbA1c  &lt;7%,  however  this  effect  seems  to  be  variable  over  time. The numbers of hypoglycaemic events during the use of sitagliptin was low.

## Benefits

Mean HbA1c reduction was small in respect to baseline HbA1c, but significant. A significant decrease of  postprandial  glucose  was  measured.  More  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  reached  HbA1c  &lt;7%, although the percentage was modest and less patients in the sitagliptin group needed rescue therapy from week 24 onwards. There were few hypoglycaemic events.

## Risks

No unexpected adverse events were observed.

## Balance

The benefit/risk for Xelevia to include the indication for the triple combination therapy with a PPAR γ agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a PPAR γ agonist is considered positive.
