## I. INTRODUCTION

As requested by the Guidance To Marketing Authorisation Holders For the Provision Of Additional Paediatric Data Not Yet Submitted To the EMEA  (Doc.  Ref. EMEA/157537/2005 Rev; dated 10 May 2005) , the MAH submitted, on 15 July 2005, to  EMEA,  the  Rapporteur  and  the  Co-Rapporteur  data  concerning  the  use  of desloratadine products in children up to the age of 18 years. Later, on 6 February 2008,  the  MAH  submitted  the  Clinical  Study  Report  for  the  clinical  study  P04141, which was not yet finalised in July 2005.

Now the MAH is submitting the only recently finalised Clinical Study Report for the last remaining study P04299:

Observational Study Evaluating the Safety and  Efficacy of Desloratadine for Perennial Allergic Rhinitis in Indonesian Paediatric Patients. This submission, same as the previous two, is not done on the grounds of pedriatric requirements (i.e. art 45 or 46) but in accordance with the above quoted EMEA Guidance.

## II. SUBMITTED DATA

Clinical Study Report Study P04299: Observational Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Desloratadine for Perennial Allergic Rhinitis in Indonesian Paediatric Patients.

## Synopsis

Studied Period: 20 May 2005 - 31 March 2008

## Objective:

The aims of this observational study are to evaluate the safety and general clinical response of desloratadine syrup in the relief of symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis in Indonesian pediatric patients.

## Methodology:

Open-label, observational study.

The  patient's  diagnosis,  initiation  of  treatment  and  the  necessary  monitoring  and follow-up  visits  will  depend  on  the  underlying  medical  condition  and  the  treatment prescribed, according to the doctor's daily practice.

Demographic data will be collected; each of symptoms as parameters will be graded and scored, concomitant therapy (desloratadine syrup) will be noted at first visit by the doctor.

The patient  will  return  for  a  second  study  related  visit  in  minimum  of  7  days  after initiation of therapy. Therapy response will be evaluated and the occurrence of any adverse event will be monitored. All drugs will be used according to the corresponding prescribing information from physician.

## Number of subjects:

Approximately  880  patients  will  be  enrolled.  This  study  will  be  conducted  at approximately  8  sites.  Each  site  will  enrol  approximately  110  patients  in  order  to provide 800 patients that complete this study.

## Duration of Treatment:

- -The duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 7 days.
- -Number of visit: minimum two visits

## Criteria for Evaluation:

## Study variables

Each of symptoms as parameters will be graded and scored, concomitant therapy will be noted at first by the doctor.

The patient will return for a second visit in minimum of 7 days after initiation of therapy.

Therapy response will be evaluated and the occurrence of any adverse event will be monitored.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All drugs will be used according to the corresponding prescribing information from physician.

## Statistical Methods:

Descriptive data will be recorded. Descriptive analysis will be performed.

## Power and Sample size determination

Using a 95% confidence interval methodology and a sample size of approximately 800 subjects will permit the proportion of subject having a Fair, Good, or Excellent response in global response to be estimated within +/-5%.

## Results:

## -Efficacy:

Nasal  discharge,  nasal  congestion,  nasal  itching,  sneezing,  itching/burning  eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes, itching of ears or palate revealed significant difference between and after the treatment (p=0.0001).

Based on physician's judgment: 85.4% of subjects were evaluated to have good to excellent  condition  after  treatment  with  desloratadine.  Most  of  the  physicians  rated the  result  of  treatment  as  good:  58.7%  (350  subjects),  excellent:  26.7%  (159 subjects), fair: 8.4% (50 subjects) and poor 1.8% (11 subjects).

## -Safety:

Incidence of adverse event was found in 4 subjects. 3 of the subjects experienced nausea and 1 subject experienced dizziness. All of the adverse events were considered mild.

## III. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

This clinical study does not add very much  to the existing knowledge on desloratadine.  It  is  an  observational  study.  There  is  no  control  group  and  it  is  not blinded. The study duration is very short (7 days). Many biases can occur in a study like this. For example, the patients might have gotten better regardless of treatment and observer bias.

The  results  are  very  positive.  Nasal  discharge,  nasal  congestion,  nasal  itching, sneezing,  itching/burning  eyes,  tearing/watering  eyes,  redness  of  eyes,  itching  of ears  or  palate  revealed  significant  difference  between  and  after  the  treatment (p=0.0001).  In  only  4  subjects  out  of  591  an  adverse  event  was  identified.  The reported adverse events (nausea and dizziness) are already listed in section 4.8 of the SPC. This clinical study does not change the existing prescribing information of desloratadine.
