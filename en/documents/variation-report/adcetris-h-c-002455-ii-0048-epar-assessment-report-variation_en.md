## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Disease or condition

Primary cutaneous lymphoma's (PCL) are defined as non-Hodgkin lymphoma that present in the skin with no evidence of extra-cutaneous disease at diagnosis.

## 2.1.2. Epidemiology

In Western countries the estimated annual incidence of PCL is around 1/100.000 and CTCL represent approximately 75 to 80 percent of all PCLs. CTCL is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms of skinhoming T cells that show considerable variation in clinical presentation, histologic appearance and prognosis.

## 2.1.3. Biologic features

The most common type of CTCL (50-60%) is mycosis fungoides (MF) and its histological variants. Classic MF is an epidermotropic CTCL clinically characterised by the progression from patch stage to plaques stage and lastly to tumour stage. In the literature, the percentage of CD30 positive cells in MF greatly varies (0-80%), but is usually low. The peak age is between 55 and 60 years and the incidence is between 1/350.000 and 1/110.000 (Orphanet).

## Other CTCL subtypes

Sezary syndrome (SS, 3% of CTCL) is a leukaemia closely related to MF and should be treated with systemic treatment, such as IFN, retinoids, TSEBT and ECP. Some of the other rarely occurring subtypes also have an aggressive course with poor prognosis and require extensive systemic therapy or multi-agent chemotherapy (e.g. primary CTCL NOS, pc ɣ δ T-cell lymphoma (though rare case with indolent course have been reported), extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma nasal type). While other subtypes (subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma, pc CD4+ small/medium sized pleomorphic T cell lymphoma proliferative disorder and pc acral CD8+ T cell lymphoma) have excellent prognoses. CD30 expression has been observed for o.a. SS with a median 10% of cells positive. CD30 expression has also been described in PTCL NOS and extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma in various levels, though literature, as these subtypes, is scarce.

## Background CD30

CD30 is a type I transmembrane glycosylated protein and a member of the tumour-necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It was originally identified on Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin Lymphoma, but is also expressed on cell subsets of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CTCL as well as on embryonal carcinomas. The CTCL subtype 'primary cutaneous CD30+lymphoproliferative disorders' (LPD) have (per definition) a strong and homogenous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CD30expression. Other CTCL subtypes may also express CD30 expression, however, at much lower and variable levels. Other subtypes in which CD30 expression is observed are MF, PTCL NOS and extranodal NK/Tcell lymphoma.

In non-malignant cells, CD30 is expressed on activated (T, B and NK cells), in lower levels of expression on activated macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils and in negligible expression on naïve or resting lymphocytes. The CD30 signalling pathway mainly activates MAP kinases and NF-κB, which can promote cell proliferation and survival as well as induction of anti-proliferative responses and cell death, depending on the cell type and the co-stimulatory signals involved.

## 2.1.4. Clinical presentation and prognosis

Primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) (&gt;75% expression of CD30) are the second most common group of CTCL, accounting for around 30 percent. This group mainly constitutes of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) (13%) and lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) (19%). PcALCL presents with (ulcerating) skin tumours up to several centimetres. The mean age at presentation is 60 years. The exact incidence of pcALCL is unknown. PcALCL has considerable overlap with LyP, which is a recurrent, chronic, but (mostly) self-limiting disease.

## Prognosis

MF is a disease with a persistent and relapsing course and prognosis is stage dependent. MF stage IA or IB has excellent prognosis, however progression to advanced stages occurs in around 25% of the patients. MF Stage IIB and III has a median survival of 4-6 years and stage IV has a poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 4 years. The prognosis for LPD is excellent with a ten year survival of 90% for pcALCL and 100% for Lyp. Up to 40% of the pcALCL localised lesions show some spontaneous regression. Most patients with pcALCL will attain a CR following initial therapy, however, recurrences occur often (&gt;40%) and patients can experience serial relapses. Extra-cutaneous spread occurs in up to 13% at time of relapse.

## Management

Due to the heterogeneity and rarity of PCL controlled trials are rare, there is no standard initial therapy. The early stages of MF can be managed with skin direct therapies (e.g. topical steroids, psoralens +UVA [PUVA], UVB, topical cytostatic agents, local electron beam therapy [EBT]). Ledaga (chlormethine as gel) was recently approved by the EMA for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL) in adult patients. In advanced stages (IIBIV) recommended options include, in combination or alone: total skin EBT (CR44-74%), PUVA (CR 3070%), interferon (RR30-60%) and retinoids (RR45-55%) including (second line option) bexarotene (RR30-50%). Many clinicians administer oral methotrexate in refractory (RR ±35%) or in advanced stage disease (RR30-50%), however methotrexate is currently not recommended for MF by the ESMO. In advanced refractory disease gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin (RR 40-80%) could be considered. Multi-agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients with extensive disease (stage IV).

Although a broad spectrum of therapy regimens has been reported, these have been limited to small cohort series or case reports. PcALCL patients with isolated lesions should receive surgical excision or radiation, which can be again used in case of recurrence. With multiple recurrences and/or multiple lesions systemic therapy is recommended due to the morbidity of repeated surgery/radiation. First choice is oral methotrexate (RR 87%). Patients often have recurrence after discontinuation. In case of progression bexarotene (RR ±50% in CTCL patients) and interferon (RR 60% in CTCL patients) are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

options. In case of wide spread nodal or visceral involvement or refractory disease gemcitabine and etoposide are options. Multi-agent chemotherapy is only indicated in patients presenting with extracutaneous disease or rapidly progressive skin disease (rare).

## About the product

Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the monoclonal antibody (cAC10) covalently linked, via an enzyme-cleavable linker, to the antimitotic small molecule monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Binding of the ADC to CD30 on the cell surface initiates internalisation of the ADC-CD30 complex, which then traffics to the lysosomal compartment. Within the cell MMAE is released via proteolytic cleavage and degradation of the drug linker. Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, induces cell cycle arrest and results in apoptotic death of the CD30-expressing tumour cell.

A conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for Adcetris was granted in October 2012 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) CD30+ HL following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option. It is also indicated for the treatment of r/r systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). Specific obligations related to the CMA include OS follow up data for the sALCL population, post-authorisation safety data in HL and sALCL and performing single arm studies in similar sALCL patients and r/r HL patients not eligible for ASCT.

In May 2016 Adcetris was approved for patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT.

The current Type II variation was submitted for the following extension of the indication:

'Adcetris is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who require systemic therapy'

Extension of indication to include the new indication 'ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who require systemic therapy', based on data from study C25001 (the 'ALCANZA' study): 'A Phase 3 Trial of brentuximab vedotin(SGN-35) Versus Physician's Choice (Methotrexate or Bexarotene) in Patients With CD30-Positive Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma'

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Brentuximab vedotin is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the \"Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use\" (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), brentuximab vedotin is exempt from the submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the environment. Concerning the antimitotic small molecule MMAE, the PECsurfacewater calculation was adapted to include the newly added indication. The PECsurfacewater value is 0.0029 ug/L, which is below the trigger value for a phase II assessment. Overall, it is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered that no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated with brentuximab vedotin.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data has been submitted for this application which is considered acceptable. Brentuximab vedotin is not considered to pose a significant risk to the environment. Brentuximab vedotin should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The CHMP considers that the non-clinical data already submitted in the previous variations and the updated ERA are sufficient to address the non-clinical aspects of this application.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

This section therefore only summarizes additional findings from the Phase 3 study C25001 (ALCANZA) in (CTCL subtype) MF and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (pcALCL) patients.

Relevant PK and pharmacodynamic secondary and exploratory objectives in Study C25001 were:

-  To further describe the PK of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE in blood.
-  To further determine the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin.
-  To investigate possible correlations between expression of serum protein markers and response.

## PK parameters of MMAE from Study C25001

PK results for Cmax and Ctrough of MMAE data are presented in Table 4 by individual and combined disease subgroups (pcALCL and MF). A concentration time curve showing median plasma concentration of MMAE is displayed in Figure 3. Due to the sparse PK sampling scheme used in this study, PK samples were not obtained 24 hours post infusion after Cycle 3, which explains the apparent lower Cmax for MMAE in these cycles.

## 2.3.3. PK/PD modelling

## Population pharmacokinetic modelling

Data obtained from Study C25001 were used in the population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models for brentuximab vedotin ADCand MMAE. These models were built based on PK data collected in adult patients with CD30+ malignancies who received brentuximab vedotin. There were 380 patients in the dataset, which included data from patients with CTCL, i.e., MF, pcALCL, in Study C25001 combined with data from patients enrolled in 5 other studies with various tumour types (Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and other hematologic malignancies) (SG035-0001, SG035-0002, SG035-0003, SG035-0004, C25007).

The objectives of the PopPK modelling were:

1. To understand the impact of various patient factors (covariates) on the PK of the brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE.
2. To use the PopPK models to summarize the systemic exposures of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE in patients with CTCL in Study C25001.
3. To provide a quantitative framework for derivation of individual patient-level exposure metrics for subsequent use in exposure-response analyses of efficacy and safety in Study C25001.

## Methodology

Baseline demographic and characteristics data of the patients included in the PopPK model are summarised in Table 5 and Table 6. Age distribution for Study C25001 is depicted in Table 7.

The population PK model was developed using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling approach. NONMEM 7.3 software with the first-order conditional estimation method (FOCE) was used.

The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as gender, body weight, race, age, ethnicity, disease, baseline albumin levels, baseline tumour size, indicators of renal and hepatic function, immunogenicity, and manufacturing process on the PK of ADC and MMAE were explored in the PopPK model.

The concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE after treatment with brentuximab vedotin have been modelled previously with data available at the time of the original MAA. These previously developed models were used as the structural base models for the current analysis, which includes additional data from Study C25001 (ALCANZA) and Study C25007.

These previous PopPK models for ADC and MMAE were based on a base model which included structural components of the model, which was used to conduct a graphical evaluation of the covariates. Covariates that showed a graphical trend or required further evaluation based on physiological relevance or observation during previous clinical trials of BV were tested as single covariate models (p&lt;0.01). A full model including all of the statistically relevant pre-specified covariate effects of interest was then developed. A final model was chosen by retaining only the statistically significant covariate effects (p&lt;0.001). The magnitude of the impact of the covariates was also considered, if the magnitude of the impact was small (less than a 20% change over the range of covariate values in the database) or the covariate effect was poorly estimated [e.g., standard error (SE) &gt; 45%] then the covariate was allowed to be reparameterised or discarded.

The final basic structural model was selected on the basis of goodness-of-fit as judged by change in objective function (OBJ), and various diagnostic plots [predicted(PRED)/individual predicted (IPRED) versus observed concentrations, WRES/individual weighted residuals (IWRES) versus time, WRES/IWRES versus PRED/IPRED]. CWRES was used in lieu of or in addition to WRES.

Data from the 6 studies used in the analysis included 22,660 records with 3,450 dosing records and 19,210 concentration records. Of the concentration records 9,541 were for ADC and 9,669 were for MMAE. Overall there were 1,287 concentration records that were BLQ, 649 MMAE (6.7%) and 638 ADC (6.7%) and about half (359 for ADC and 356 for MMAE) of these records were pre-dose concentrations. Therefore approximately 3% (279 for ADC and 393 for MMAE) of the post dose records for each analyte were BLQ. Due to the low proportion of BLQ records in the dataset, these were ignored.

The patients in C25001 were generally the oldest patients in the dataset. The median age for the patients in the entire dataset was 37 years old (mean 42 years) and the median age for patients in C25001 was 61 years old (mean 59 years).

## ADC model

A schematic of the ADC PK model is shown in Figure 4 below and was based on the previous analysis. The model for brentuximab vedotin ADC PK was a linear 3-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order elimination.

The final model included the effect of pcALCL tumour type on CL, anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) on CL, albumin (ALB) on CL, and body surface area (BSA) on CL and central volume of distribution (Vc). There were 3 possible ATA status values in the database (positive, negative, or missing) with the base value (no additional parameters) for patients who had negative ATA status. Separate parameters were estimated for patients with missing values, patients from the older studies (SG035-0001, SG0350002, SG035-0003, and SG035-0004) with positive values, and patients from the newer studies (C25001 and C25007) with positive values.

The results showed that ATA-positivity status, regardless of the assay used, consistently resulted in fractionally higher CLs. Further, patients with pcALCL (N=16) showed higher concentrations than patients with other tumour types. A pcALCL tumour-type effect was added to CL and resulted in a lower CL than the non-pcALCL patients. The other covariate effects in the model showed that brentuximab vedotin ADC CL and Vc increase with increasing body size, and brentuximab vedotin ADC CL decreases with increasing ALB concentration. The final brentuximab vedotin ADC model parameter estimates are shown in Table 8.

The final PopPK model was evaluated by the Visual Predictive Check (VPC) method. For the VPC evaluation, the 2.5th and 97.5th prediction intervals (PIs) were constructed by simulating replicates of the dataset from which the model was developed. The observed data were then overlaid and compared

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with the PIs. For the model to be acceptable, approximately 2.5% of the observed data should lie above the 97.5th PI, and 2.5% should lie below the 2.5th PI. The combined data from all the studies as shown in Figure 5 were well predicted by the model. The observed and predicted 95% PI are similar and generally within the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the PI. Overall, the simulated concentrations appeared to be reasonably consistent with the observed concentrations, with no systematic bias.

The dashed red lines are the lower 2.5th and upper 97.5th percentiles of the observed data. The solid black line is the median of the simulated data. The dashed black lines are the lower 2.5th and upper 97.5th percentiles of the simulated data. The shaded red area is the 95% CI of the simulated median, and the shaded blue areas are the 95% CI of the simulated 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.

The final PK model for ADC was used to simulate the concentrations produced after a 1.8 mg/kg dose of BV every 21 days for 3 cycles. The dose was capped at 180 mg for patients weighing more than 100 kg. The results showed/confirmed that there is minor accumulation of ADC with this dosing regimen.

Simulation of the AUCs in the various tumour types indicated a 35% estimated higher geometric mean AUC in pcALCL vs non-pcALCL tumour types in the overall population, and 16% higher AUC in patients with MF in C25001 compared with patients with HL in Study C25007) (Figure 6).

## MMAE model

The  model  for  MMAE  included  a  link  to  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  elimination  using  the  individual parameter  estimates  from  the  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  model  to  predict  the  brentuximab  vedotin ADC concentrations in the MMAE model. The PK of MMAE was described by a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination and formation of MMAE both directly from brentuximab vedotin ADC and through  binding  of  brentuximab  vedotin  ADC  to  a  hypothetical  target.  The  model  had  a  lag compartment to describe the delay in formation of MMAE, both directly from brentuximab vedotin ADC and through binding of brentuximab vedotin ADC to the target. The fraction of MMAE formed directly from brentuximab vedotin ADC decreased following brentuximab vedotin ADC administration, relative to time after dose.

The  final  MMAE  model  included  creatinine  concentration,  BSA,  bilirubin  concentration,  and  albumin (ALB)  concentration  on  CL;  and  BSA  on  Vc.  Specifically  MMAE  CL  increases  with  increasing  ALB concentration,  and  MMAE  CL  decreases  with  increasing  creatinine  and  bilirubin  concentration.  This indicates  that  renal  function  shows  a  positive  relationship  with  MMAE  CL  where  higher  values  of creatinine  CL  resulted  in  higher  MMAE  CL.  Hepatic  function  as  assessed  by  bilirubin  concentration showed that higher bilirubin concentrations, an indicator of lower hepatic function, showed a trend for lower  MMAE  CL.  In  addition,  the  model  results  showed  that  the  Vc  is  consistently  larger  for  larger patients based on BSA. The pcALCL tumour type was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of MMAE CL. Overall the MMAE model had acceptable precision of parameter estimates. The final MMAE model parameter estimates are shown in Table 9.

A VPC plot for all the data in the dataset combined (Figure 10) shows that the data are well predicted by the model. The observed and predicted 95% PI are similar and generally within the 95% CI around the PI. Overall, the simulated concentrations appeared to be reasonably consistent with the observed concentrations, with no systematic bias.

Similar  to  the  ADC  model,  the  final  PK  model  for  MMAE  was  used  to  simulate  the  concentrations produced after a 1.8 mg/kg dose of BV every 21 days for 3 cycles with a capped dose of 180 mg for patients weighing more than 100 kg. The results showed that there is minor accumulation of MMAE with this dosing regimen.

These increases in brentuximab vedotin ADC exposure in pcALCL vs non-pcALCL tumour types (Figure 6) did not translate to higher MMAE exposure (Figure 11).

## Immunogenicity assessments

Immunogenicity assessments (anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) and neutralising ATA) in Study C25001 were based on serum from blood samples collected before brentuximab vedotin dosing in the cycle of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 and at EOT, and neutralising ATA was assessed for ATA-positive samples only. Sixty of 66 patients (91%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm were evaluable for immunogenicity assessments (14/16 patients [88%] with pcALCL and 46/50 patients [92%] with MF).

All 14 patients with pcALCL were ATA negative at Baseline, and 6 of the 14 patients developed ATA after the brentuximab vedotin administration. Forty-two of 50 patients (84%) with MF were ATA negative at Baseline, and 19 of the 42 patients developed ATA after brentuximab vedotin administration. Most of the patients who were ATA negative at Baseline continued to be ATA negative at all assessment time points during the study (8 of 14 evaluable patients with pcALCL and 23 of 46 evaluable patients with MF). Three of the 4 patients with MF who were ATA positive at Baseline remained transiently positive during the study; 1 patient with MF who was ATA positive at Baseline was ATA negative at all post-baseline time points. The total ATA-positive rate in Study C25001 was 42% (28/66 patients) among the safety population; however, 16 of the 28 patients who were ATA positive were transiently ATA positive, and 23 of the 28 ATA-positive patients had low titres. Also, 20 of the 28 ATA-positive patients were neutralising ATA positive.

## Population PK results by ATA status

The impact of ATA status on the PK of the brentuximab vedotin ADC was evaluated in the PopPK analysis. A VPC plot comparing the observed and predicted brentuximab vedotin ADC concentration versus time since last dose for the studies that formed the basis of the original approval (SG035-0001, SG035-0002, SG035-0003, and SG035-0004) and the newer studies (C25001 and C25007) by ATA status is shown below. Notably the older studies had a large proportion of missing values, and the new studies had only 2 missing values. VPC plots show that the model generally predicts the 4 possible ATA status categories to a reasonable extent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A VPC analysis was also performed using dose-normalised concentrations versus time since first dose, and these results are shown in Figure 12. The observed and predicted intervals generally overlap.

The brentuximab vedotin ADC CL values by antidrug antibody status are summarised in Figure 14 and

Patients who were neutralising antidrug antibody positive (NADA+) had higher geometric mean CL (0.040 L/h) than patients who were antidrug antibody negative (ADA-, 0.036 L/h) or ADA+ and NADA- (0.031 L/h).

Although ATA positivity resulted in higher brentuximab vedotin ADC clearance (CL) per the covariate analysis in the PopPK model, the overall impact on steady-state area under the curve (AUC) in the analysis population was small (9%-12% lower steady-state AUC in ATA-positive vs ATA-negative patients) according to simulations from the final PopPK model.

## Effect of NAbs on efficacy

The  relationship  between  neutralising  antibody  (NAb)  status  and  outcomes  for  primary  efficacy endpoints  (ORR4,  ORR,  and  PFS)  was  explored  in  58  patients  who  were  immunogenicity  evaluable (i.e., patients with a sample at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline visit) and received treatment with brentuximab vedotin in Study C25001. A summary of the data is shown in Table 11.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Brentuximab vedotin and MMAE PK in the (CTCL subgroups) MF and pcALCL patients in the pivotal Study C25001 do not appear to be markedly different from the PK that has been previously described.

Further analysis of the brentuximab vedotin and MMAE PK data was conducted using PopPK modelling. Overall the PopPK models for brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE appear to characterize the data sufficiently. The results indicated that body size, baseline ALB concentrations, tumour type, and ATA positivity affect brentuximab vedotin PK, but to an extent that is limited in relation to the overall variability in PK.

The final brentuximab vedotin PopPK model was used to simulate and derive summary statistics of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE exposure by tumour type and ATA status. In the PopPK model, the patients with pcALCL from Study C25001 (N=16) showed a 35% higher brentuximab vedotin ADC concentrations than patients with other tumour types. This may be explained by the lower CD30related disease burden in the pcALCL population compared with the HL and ALCL populations. Considering the previously demonstrated relationship between circulating sCD30 concentration and overall tumour burden, lower levels of tumour burden in CTCL may therefore result in relatively higher brentuximab vedotin ADC levels circulating in blood compared with other tumour types like HL and ALCL. However, when viewed in relation to the overall variability in brentuximab vedotin ADC PK (%CV in steady-state AUC of 39%-45% in ATA-negative patients), the magnitude of the differences in steady-state brentuximab vedotin ADC exposure across tumour types appear relatively modest (e.g., 35% estimated higher geometric mean AUC in pcALCL vs non-pcALCL tumour types in the overall population, and 16% higher AUC in patients with MF in C25001 compared with patients with HL in Study C25007). Further, these changes in brentuximab vedotin ADC in pcALCL patients did not translate to higher MMAE exposure.

Although ATA status was a statistically significant covariate on brentuximab vedotin ADC CL, the effect of this covariate on steady-state AUC was smaller than the overall extent of interpatient variability in brentuximab vedotin ADC PK (9-12% lower geometric mean steady-state AUC in ATA-positive vs ATAnegative patients with pcALCL). The other covariate effects in the model showed that brentuximab vedotin ADC CL and Vc increase with increasing body size, and brentuximab vedotin ADC CL decreases with increasing ALB concentration. The impact of these changes appears modest.

Based upon population PK analyses (see section 5.2 of the SmPC) and the safety profile in elderly patients, which are consistent with that of adult patients, the dosing recommendations for patients aged 65 and older are the same as for adults (section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Patients being positive for neutralising ATAs showed an increased clearance of brentuximab vedotin. However, the increased clearance of brentuximab vedotin in patients positive for neutralising ATAs is not associated with decreased efficacy compared to the general study population.

The final MMAE model included the effect of creatinine concentration, BSA, bilirubin concentration, and ALB concentration on CL; and BSA on Vc. However, pcALCL tumour type was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of MMAE CL. Overall, MMAE AUC and Cmax in patients with CTCL in Study C25001 were similar to those in patients with relapsed/refractory HL in Study C25007.

The data from the pop-PK model show that brentuximab vedotin clearance appears to decrease with age to a limited extent (Cycle 1 Cl at 20 years approximately 0.07 l/h vs 0.05 l/h at 70 years). In line with these CL data, the simulated AUC for brentuximab vedotin increased by approximately 20% going from 20 to 70 years. Simulated MMAE AUC was almost unchanged in this age range (data not shown). Both for brentuximab vedotin and MMAE, Cmax was unchanged within this age range. These changes

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

are considered to be of no clinical relevance. Therefore, the dosing recommendations for patients aged 65 and older in the SmPC, have been updated and are the same as for adults.

Taken together, these analyses support the conclusion that there are no clinically meaningful differences in the systemic exposures of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE in patients with CTCL compared with patients with other tumour types.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The PK data provided confirm the known clinical pharmacology of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE. No marked difference in exposure was apparent between the CTCL patients as compared with HL and sALCL patients. There is little accumulation of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE exposure, and steadystate AUC and Cmax predicted in patients with CTCL in Study C25001 were very similar to those from patients with HL in Study C25007. This is supported by the PopPK modelling and simulation exercise. Further PK data from Study C25001 into the PopPK dataset increased the number of elderly patients in this dataset. The analysis showed that age was not a covariate in the PopPK models. Hence, the posology in section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated for patients aged 65 and older, which is considered the same as for adults.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

No new dose response study was submitted. The recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in the approved indications of HL and sALCL was used in the current study (1.8 mg/kg as IV infusion over 30 minutes Q3W).

## Methods

## Study participants

Patients with a diagnosis of MF or pcALCL and histologically confirmed CD30+ disease (≥10%) were eligible for study enrolment. Patients were to be stratified by MF or pcALCL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The key main inclusion criteria were:

-  Adults ≥18 years and ECOG≤2
-  MF (received at least 1 prior systemic therapy) or pcALCL (received prior radiation therapy or at least 1 prior systemic therapy).
-  Histological confirmation by central review of CD30 disease (CD30 positivity is defined as ≥10% target  lymphoid  cells  demonstrating  membrane,  cytoplasmic  and/  or  Golgi  staining  pattern  for CD30 at any intensity above background staining in at least 1 sample). Skin biopsy was required of at least 2 lesions for MF and 1 lesion for pcALCL
-  Radiographically/clinically measurable disease
-  Adequate liver and renal function
-  3 week washout period from previous treatment and 12 weeks washout for antibody-directed or immunoglobulin-based immune therapy (unless not in best interest of patient)

The key exclusion criteria were:

-  Concurrent diagnosis of SS, B2 disease (high blood tumour burden) sALCL, or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma, excluding Lyp
-  Progression on prior therapy with both bexarotene and methotrexate
-  History of another primary malignancy not in remission for at least 3 years
-  Known active cerebral/meningeal disease
-  History of pancreatitis or significant risk factors for developing pancreatitis or elevated lipase value ≥3×ULN with an amylase level &gt;ULN
-  Known HIV infection, hepatitis B surface antigen positive or known/suspected hepatitis C infection
-  Any severe active systemic viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 1 week before first study drug dose requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy (Oral antibiotics for prophylaxis were allowed)

## Treatments

Patients were randomised 1:1 to either receive brentuximab vedotin, or to receive the physician's choice of either bexarotene or methotrexate.

Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg by IV infusion (outpatient) over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. In patients above 100 kg the dose was based on 100 kg. Patients could receive a maximum of 16 cycles (approximately 48 weeks) of brentuximab vedotin.

Methotrexate once weekly as a single dose of 5 to 50 mg orally. Dosages adjustments (to max.50mg /week) to achieve optimal clinical response/lowest effective dose were allowed according to protocol. Patients could receive methotrexate for a maximum of 48 weeks.

Bexarotene once daily 300 mg/m2 orally, dose reduction was allowed to 200 mg/m2/day or 100 mg/m2/day. Bexarotene could be temporarily suspended for toxicity. Pre-treatment with fenofibrate 145 to 200 mg for 7 days (or reduced dose in case of creatinine≥1.5 mg/dL or nephrotic syndrome) was required. Concurrently a low dose of synthetic thyroxine (T4) was to be taken (adjusted along with dose of bexarotene). Continual monitoring of lipid and T4 concentrations was required during bexarotene treatment. Patients could receive bexarotene for a maximum of 48 weeks.

Primary objective: to determine objective response lasting at least 4 months (ORR4), with brentuximab vedotin in patients with CD30+ MF or pcALCL compared to that achieved with therapy in the control arm.

Key secondary objectives: to determine CR rate, PFS and burden of symptoms with brentuximab vedotin compared to that achieved with therapy in the control arm.

Other secondary objectives: to determine duration of response (DOR) and duration of skin response in brentuximab vedotin. To determine event-free survival (EFS) with brentuximab vedotin compared to that achieved with therapy in the control arm. To describe PK of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE in blood. To determine the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin. To assess patient-reported QOL outcomes. To assess the safety of brentuximab vedotin.

Additional (exploratory) objectives: to investigate the relationship between baseline levels of CD30 expression and clinical response. To assess changes in CD30 expression before and after treatment. To investigate possible correlations between expression of serum protein markers and response. To examine correlation between biomarkers related to the disease pathway, drug mechanism, and drug clearance proteins, such as CD30, tubulin, Fcneo, and Fcγ receptors and clinical response. To assess healthcare utilisation. To collect patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data for utility-based economic evaluations.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: ORR4 is the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (CR or PR) that lasted at least 4 months, as determined by an independent review facility (IRF).

Objective responses will be based on a Global Response Score (GRS), which consists of skin evaluation (mSWAT assessment) by investigator, nodal and visceral radiographic assessment by IRF, and detection of circulating Sézary cells (MF only) by IRF.

-  Skin evaluation (mSWAT) performed at screening, before dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, -3 and at the end of every cycle beginning at Cycle 3, EOT, and at post treatment follow-up visits
-  CT scans for patients without nodal or visceral involvement were performed at screening and during the cycle following the first skin response and 6 cycles (or ≥ 4 months) after that or in case of suspected new/progressive disease in the LN/viscera
-  CT scans for patients with baseline nodal/visceral disease, were performed at screening and at the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, and per the follow-up schedule until PD or suspected new/progressive disease in the LN/viscera and at EOT
-  Blood sample for Sézary cell enumeration in patients with MF performed at screening; at the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, at EOT, and per the follow-up schedule until PD or study closure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Key secondary endpoints:

-  CR - proportion of patients who achieved a CR as their best response on study as determined by an IRF by GRS criteria
-  PFS- time from randomisation until PD per IRF or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first
-  Changes in symptom domain (7 items) according to Skindex-29 questionnaire (administered on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and subsequent even number cycles)

Other secondary endpoints:

Exploratory endpoints

-  Qualitative and quantitative measures of CD30 expression in biopsied tumour assessed before and after brentuximab vedotin treatment. The Quest clinical trial assay was initially used for screening to determine CD30 expression in tissue samples from skin biopsies. This assay was later replaced by the Ventana anti-CD30 (Ber-H2) assay (Amendment 3).
-  Serum concentration of PD markers such as sCD30
-  Presence or absence of gene or protein variation associated with CTCL or brentuximab vedotin mechanism of action
-  Utilisation of health resources

Patient-reported QOL assessment per EQ-5D-3L for economic considerations

## Sample size

Approximately 124 patients, approximately 62 patients per treatment arm, were to be randomised to 1 of the treatment arms in the study. The sample size was calculated to provide 90% power to detect a 30% improvement in ORR4 in the brentuximab vedotin treatment group, assuming ORR4 for the methotrexate or bexarotene treatment group was 40%. This calculation was based on a 2-sided chisquared test with a significance level of alpha=0.05, and a 10% dropout rate using nQuery Advisor 7.0. A minimum of 30 patients with pcALCL, 15 patients per treatment arm were to be randomised in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

Patients will be randomised in an overall ratio of 1:1 to Arm 1 (brentuximab vedotin) or Arm 2 (physician's choice of MTX or bexarotene) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by baseline disease diagnosis (MF or pcALCL).

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open label study.

## Statistical methods

No interim analyses were planned for efficacy. In general, missing data was treated as missing, and no data imputation were applied unless otherwise specified.

The primary endpoint , ORR4 per IRF, will be analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by baseline disease diagnosis (pcALCL or MF) based on the ITT population. Difference in proportions were based on normal approximation. The objective response was considered maintained for patients with a previous CR who experienced recurrent disease (relapse) unless the criteria for disease progression were met. Patients who do not have any post baseline response assessment or no response before dropout, will be counted as non-responders. Patients whose first response occurs after the start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, but otherwise meet the primary endpoint criteria will be excluded.

Pre-specified subgroups analyses were performed for the following subgroups: baseline disease diagnosis, ECOG PS, sex, age (&lt;65, ≥65), region, race and physician's choice. Baseline disease involvement and baseline skin tumour involvement were not pre-specified.

The key secondary endpoints CR per IRF, PFS per IRF, symptom Skindex-29 were analysed using a fixed sequential testing procedure (weighted Holm procedure). The analyses for CR per IRF, PFS per IRF, and the changes in symptom domain of the Skindex-29 were assigned weights (0.7, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively). Comparison of the CR rates between the 2 treatment groups will be conducted using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and normal approximation for difference in proportions. Patients who do not have any post baseline response assessment as specified in the protocol will be counted as non-responders.

Stratified log-rank test statistics will be used to compare PFS between the 2 treatment arms. The HRs and 95% CIs will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of the time-to event endpoints for each treatment. An alpha level of 0.01 (2-sided) was specified per the weighted Holm procedure.

Handling of missing data and censoring PFSs: The date of PD/response should be assigned based on the time of the first documentation regardless of violations or discontinuation of study drug. Patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, or those who discontinue treatment due to undocumented PD were censored at the last disease assessment. If death or PD occurs after a missed visit, then the patient is treated as progressed at the date of death or PD. Patients without baseline and/or no sufficient post baseline data for disease assessment and with no death recorded will be censored at the date of randomisation. If PD is documented between scheduled visits, then the date of the documented PD is the date of progression. If the patient starts new antineoplastic therapy before PD, then the patient is treated as progressed at the date of assessment at which PD was documented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For skin symptoms (Skindex-29; symptom domain), the mean of symptom reduction between both arms is compared. 'Symptom reduction' is defined for each patient as the maximum reduction from baseline (sum of the 7 items related to skin symptoms normalised to a 1-100 scale) over the nonmissing visits. The ANCOVA model controlling for baseline covariates (treatment group, baseline score, disease diagnosis, ECOG) will be employed for the analysis. No validated MID methods were available at time of data analyses. The Applicant calculated the MID using three methods based on the current dataset: half of standard deviation of the maximum score change; Cohen's moderate effect size (0.5x st.dev baseline score) and 'standard error of measurement' (std dev(baseline score)√(1-Cronbachs α).

Regarding the other secondary endpoints , EFS will be analysed similarly as the endpoint PFS. DOR and duration of skin response will be summarised descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method. PRO endpoints include subscales of Skindex-29 and global and subscale scores of the EQ-5D and FACT-G questionnaires. All PRO scores (Skindex 29 total score, EQ-5D and FACT-G score) will first be scaled into numeric scores following published or pre-specified scoring guidelines for each PRO instrument employed in this trial. Scores will be summarised in descriptive statistics for the 2 treatment groups over time.

Handling of missing data and censoring secondary endpoints: The ITT principle will be used to determine the event time or censoring time for the EFS analysis. For EFS, patients who are lost to follow-up will be censored at last disease assessment. Patients who withdraw consent or start new antineoplastic therapy will be treated as if experiencing an EFS event. Patients without baseline and/or sufficient post baseline data for disease assessment and no treatment discontinuation or death recorded will be censored at the date of randomisation.

DOR will be analysed for patients with confirmed response (CR or PR) in the ITT population. Patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, or discontinue treatment due to undocumented PD after the last adequate disease assessment will be censored at the last disease assessment. If the patient starts new antineoplastic therapy before PD, the patient is treated as progressed at the date of assessment at which PD was documented. Duration of skin response will be analysed for patients with skin response (CR or PR in skin) in the ITT population). Data was handled similar to DOR. Patients without sufficient skin assessment data after the initial skin response and with no death recorded were censored at the date of the initial skin response.

## Sensitivity analyses

-  For ORR4 per IRF per response criteria which are published by Whittaker (2010) in the ITT and MF patients only
-  ORR4 per IRF based on a subset of GRS time points, using the available CT scans and blood assessments for GRS at the time points they were taken. For patients with baseline nodal/visceral/blood disease, the sensitivity analysis used GRS assessed at time points with concurrent nodal/viscera/blood component assessments. For patients with skin-only disease, this analysis used the same GRS assessment frequency as the primary analysis.
-  ORR4 per investigator GRS
-  ORR per IRF and per investigator
-  For the skin symptoms using the linear mixed model with repeated measures at each time point specified in the protocol SOE. The total score for skin symptoms (Skindex-29) will be imputed with the mean of the other items if there is no more than 1 missing item; otherwise, it will be considered invalid and excluded from the analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  For CR sensitivity analysis will be performed for CR per the investigator's GRS assessment
-  For PFS multiple sensitivity analyses with different handling of missing data/censoring rules (including according to FDA censoring guidelines and investigator-assessment)

## Exploratory analysis

-  ORR4 based on GRS consisting of skin evaluation (mSWAT assessment) by independent review of photos, nodal and visceral radiographic assessment, and detection of circulating Sézary cells (MF only) by IRF
-  ORR4 in the All-Enrolled population, Response-Evaluable population, as well as the PP population.
-  Time to next significant antineoplastic treatment
-  Biomarker analyses
-  Health utilisation
-  QoL questionnaires

## Recruitment

The first patient was enrolled in the study on 13 August 2012. The last patient was enrolled in the study on 31 July 2015, and the last patient visit before the data cut-off was on 26 May 2016. Patients in this study were enrolled at 34 study centres. A total of 33 patients (25%) were enrolled in the United States, 68 patients (52%) in the European Union, 20 patients (15%) in Australia, 6 patients (5%) in Switzerland, and 4 patients (3%) in Brazil.

## Conduct of the study

Study conduct was revised by 5 amendments to the original Protocol C25001. The major amendments are summarised below. Major protocol deviations were reported for 9 patients in the study. One protocol deviation related to the informed consent form, which was signed after randomisation and 2 days after rescreening visit. Other major protocol deviations are shown in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Table 12.

## Amendment 1 (no patients enrolled)

Primary endpoint changed from ORR to ORR4. The study population was modified to include only patients with a primary diagnosis of MF or pcALCL(minimum 30 patients). Only patients who received at least 1 prior systemic therapy were allowed in to the trial. The confirmation of tumour CD30 positivity decreased from 75% to 10% based on phase II data.

## Amendment 2 (46 patients enrolled)

Due to the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity use of bleomycin with brentuximab vedotin was contraindicated. For patients who completed either 48 weeks of study treatment discontinuation of therapy was to be attempted. After 48 weeks either subsequent standard of care (control arm) or reinitiation of brentuximab vedotin (interventional arm) was permitted.

## Amendment 3 (no patients enrolled)

Patients with SD were allowed to continue to receive study treatment up to 16 cycles of brentuximab vedotin or 48 weeks with the control therapy. Patients with pcALCL were allowed to have received prior radiation therapy or at least 1 prior systemic therapy instead of the latter. The CD30 (screening) assay was changed from the Quest CTA to the Ventana anti-CD30 (Ber-H2) assay. Tumour samples from patients enrolled using the Quest assay were re-evaluated using the Ventana assay.

## Protocol Amendment 5 (6 patients enrolled)

Amendment 5 included updated safety information and revised the existing eligibility criteria regarding patients at risk for pancreatitis, due to experiences in clinical studies and post marketing.

Percentages are based on nommissing values in the ITT population in each columm. First dose date of study dug for patients randomized to bexarotene anm was first dose of fenofibrate.

Max-maximum, min-minimm, std dev=standard deviation.

(a) Time since initial diagnosis = (first dose date of study dug -- date of initial diagnosis)/30.4375.

(b) TNMB staging components are presented for all patients in the ITT population (MF and pcALCL).

The majority of patients with pcALCL had skin only lesions with 9 (56%) patients treated with brentuximab vedotin and 11 (73%) with physician's choice of therapy, while 7 (44%) and 4 patients (27%) had extracutaneous disease, respectively.

## Prior cancer-related therapies

## In

Table 14 the prior cancer related therapies are summarised. One patient with pcALCL who was randomised to the brentuximab vedotin arm did not receive prior radiation therapy or at least 1 prior systemic therapy and is included in major protocol deviations. In MF patients a median of 2 prior systemic therapies was observed in both arms and in pcALCL subjects a median of 1 in the brentuximab vedotin and 2 in the control arm were observed. All but 1 pcALCL patient (see above) received prior systemic therapy in this study. The median time since progression from last line of prior therapy (radiotherapy excluded) was 2.4 months (range 0-112) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1.4 months (range 0-55) in the control arm.

In the physician's choice arm, 3 patients (8%) had previously received bexarotene for their CTCL and were assigned by their physician to bexarotene in this study. Similarly, 2 patients (8%) in the physician's choice arm had previously received methotrexate and received methotrexate as study drug. The listing of individual patient data indicate that for the 2 methotrexate retreated patients the best response on previous methotrexate was SD and PR. Both patients had also previously received bexarotene. For the bexarotene retreated patients the previous responses to bexarotene were documented as unknown. Only one of the bexarotene retreated patients was previously treated with methotrexate.

Four patients (3 (5%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 (2%) in the physician's choice arm) had prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant.

## Concomitant medication and procedures

Nearly all patients received concomitant medication during the study, however concomitant medications which might have influenced outcomes were prohibited per protocol. The most common concomitant medication received by patients who received methotrexate (n=25) was folic acid in 13 patients (52%). In patients who received bexarotene (n=37), 27 patients (73%) received concomitant treatment with fenofibrate, and 33 patients (89%) received treatment with levothyroxine. In the brentuximab vedotin arm, 13 patients (20%) received levothyroxine, 12 patients (18%) received hydroxyzine, and 9 patients (14%) received fenofibrate other than the required premedication course. Statins were administered to 21 patients (32%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm.

## Numbers analysed

The following populations were analysed, see Table 15 for their numbers.

-  The All-Enrolled population included all patients randomised to treatment, analysed according to randomisation treatment.
-  The ITT population included all patients who were identified as CD30+ by the Ventana antiCD30 (Ber-H2) assay and were randomised to treatment; analysed according to randomisation treatment. The ITT population was used for the primary efficacy analysis and for all other efficacy analyses unless specified otherwise.
-  The Per-Protocol (PP) population included a subset of ITT patients who received study drug and did not have major protocol violations as determined by the project clinician; analysed according to received treatment.
-  The Response-Evaluable population is defined as a subset of the ITT population with measurable disease at Baseline and with at least 1 post baseline skin response assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The Safety population included patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. All patients were analysed according to the actual treatment received.
-  The PK/PD population included patients with sufficient dose and PK/PD data to reliably estimate PK/PD parameters. At least 1 of the biomarkers, CTACK, TARC, sCD30, or interleukin 6 was required to reliably measure PD parameters.

## Key secondary endpoints

## CR

Per IRF assessment, study treatment led to CR in 10 patients (15.6%) (95%CI 6.7-24.5) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 patient (1.6%) (95%CI 0-4.6) in the physician's choice arm (pvalue=0.0046; adjusted p-value=0.0046; percentage difference of 14.1 (95% CI (-4.0, 31.5)).

## PFS

The PFS analyses were performed with an median PFS follow-up of 17.5 months. At the time of data cut-off, 86 (67%) patients had experienced a PFS event: progressive disease per IRF in 74 patients (30 patients (47%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 44 patients (69%) in the physician's choice arm and death in 12 patients (6 patients (9%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 6 patients (9%) in the physician's choice arm.

## Changes in symptom domain of Skindex-29 Score

The changes in symptoms are measured by the mean maximum change from baseline in disease symptoms, as measured by the Skindex-29 symptom domain score. The mean maximum change from baseline was -28 points (std dev- 26.9) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and -8.62 points (std dev 17.0) in the physician's choice arm (p-value&lt;0.001; adjusted p-value&lt;0.001). The median of the maximum reduction from baseline was -32.1 points (range, -78.6 to 42.9 points) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and -10.42 points (range, -50.0 to 28.6 points) in the physician's choice arm. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

calculated MID in the reduction in Skindex-29 symptom domain score was 12.3 using half of a standard deviation of change in score, 11.2 using Cohen's effect size, and 9.1 using standard error of measurement.

In Figure 20 the mean change from baseline Skindex-29 symptom score is shown troughout the time in the ITT Population.

## Other secondary endpoints

## Duration of response

In patients who received brentuximab vedotin and experienced CR or PR (43 patients), the median DOR was 15.1 months (CI 9.7, 25.5). In patients who received either methotrexate or bexarotene and experienced CR or PR (13 patients), the median DOR was 18.3 months (CI 3.5, 18.4). Responses were ongoing at last assesment in 20 of the 43 responders (47%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 7 of the 13 patients (54%) in the physician's choice arm.

## Duration of skin response

In patients who received brentuximab vedotin and experienced skin response (47 patients), the median duration of skin response was 20.6 months (14.1, 25.7). In patients who received either methotrexate or bexarotene and experienced skin response (19 patients), the median duration of skin response was 18.3 months (3.5, 18.9). Responses were ongoing at last assessment in 25 of the 47 responders (53%) in the in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 9 of the 19 patients (47%) in the physician's choice arm.

## Ancillary analyses

## Sensitivity analyses

## ORR4

-  ORR4 per IRF using the OPDREC response criteria (guidelines in Whittaker 2010): a total of 35 patients (54.7% (CI 42.5-66.9)) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4, compared with 5 patients (7.8%(CI 2.6 -17.3)) in the physician's choice arm (p-value &lt;0.001). Similar outcomes were observed in the MF only population.
-  ORR4 per IRF based on a subset of GRS time points: a total of 32 patients (50% (CI 37.862.2)) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4, compared with 8 patients (12.5% (CI 4.4-20.6)) in the physician's choice arm (p-value &lt;0.001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CR

-  CR per the investigator's assessment: 12 patients (18.8%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm versus 0 patients in the physician's choice arm achieved CR, with a risk difference of 18.8 (95% CI (0.7, 35.9)) in favour of brentuximab vedotin (p-value&lt;0.001).

## PFS

The PFS sensitivity analyses using different rules for handling of censoring/missing data are shown in Table 21 and a summary of PFS per investigator is shown in Table 22.

Discontinuation for undocumented progressive disease was determined by investigator assessment; Scenario 2

Scenario 1: If disease progression was documented between scheduled visits, the date of the next scheduled visit was used as the date of progression.

Scenario3:If thepatientstartednewantineoplastictherapywithorwithoutsubsequentprogression/deathevent,the patient was censored at the date of the last disease assessment before the start of antineoplastic therapy.

the patient was treated as progressed at the date of last disease assessment before the start of antineoplastic therapy.

Scenario 4: If the patient started new antineoplastic therapy (with or without subsequent progression/death event),

Scenario 5: If death or progressive disease occurred after more than 1 missed visit, the patient was censored at the last disease assessment before the missed visits.

Scenario 6: If death or progressive disease occurred after more than 1 missed visit, the patient was censored at the last disease assessment before the missed visits. If the patient started new antineoplastic therapy with or without subsequent progression/death event, then the patient was censored at the date of the last disease assessment before the start of antineoplastic therapy.

-  ORR4 per investigator GRS in the ITT: a total of 38 patients (59.4%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4, compared with 5 patients (7.8%) in the physician's choice arm (p-value &lt;0.001).
-  ORR4 in which the patient's response after the start of next alternate therapy was censored at the start of next alternate therapy: a total of 35 patients (54.7%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4, compared with 7 patients (10.9%) in the physician's choice arm (p-value &lt;0.001).
-  ORR4  in  CR  patients  with  recurrent  disease  considered  as  not  maintained  (i.e.,  relapse  is treated as PD): a total of 36 patients (56.3%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4, compared with 8 patients (12.9%) in the physician's choice arm (p-value &lt;0.001).

B=bexarotene, BV=brentuximab vedotin, M=methotrexate, Num=number.

## Skin symptoms

-  The linear mixed model with repeated measures and imputed scores were in line with the original analyses; though scores in the control arm were lower than in the original analysis.

## Exploratory analyses

## ORR4

-  ORR4 per IRF based on GRS consisting of skin evaluation mSWAT assessment by independent review of photographs for skin response: a total of 22 patients (34% (CI 22.7-46.0)) in the brentuximab vedotin arm achieved ORR4 compared with 6 patients (9.4% (CI 2.2-16.5)) in the physician's choice arm (p-value &lt;0.001).

## Time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy

-  The time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy was assessed in the ITT population with 38 patients (59%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 47 patients (73%) in the physician's choice arm who received at least 1 subsequent antineoplastic therapy. The median time to subsequent antineoplastic therapy was 14.3 (12.5, 20.4) months in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 5.5 (3.6, 7.2) months in the physician's choice arm with HR=0.236 (95% CI 0.145, 0.383) (p&lt;0.001).

Patients who did not have any postbaseline response assessment as specified in the protocol were counted as nomresponders. GRS response per IRF consisted of a skin evaluation (mSWAT assessment) by investigator, nodal and visceral radiographic assessment by IRF, and detection of circulating Sezary cells (MF only) by IRF. (a) Overall best response that occurred after the start of subsequent therapy was excluded.

## Biomarker analyses

CD30 expression from skin biopsy

CD30 expression level (percentage of total cells) from skin biopsy was assessed at Baseline, Cycle 3 Day 21, and EOT.

Soluble CD30 expression, TARC, CTACK

Soluble CD30 (sCD30), Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC), Cutaneous T-cellAttracting Chemokine (CTACK) were measured in serum in both treatment arms at Baseline, before administration of study drug on Day 1 of Cycle 2 through Cycle 16, and at EOT. Levels of sCD30, TARC and CTACK were highly variable between patients. Mean baseline values of these three biomarkers

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were similar at baseline. Mean sCD30 levels slightly increased throughout time in the interventional arm and did not change in the control arm. Mean levels of TARC declined over the course of treatment, moreso in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared to the control arm. CTACK mean levels declined in the brentuximab vedotin arm over time and increased in the physician's choice arm over time.

## Immunogenicity/ATA Status

Sixty patients (91%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm were evaluable for immunogenicity assessments. From the total analysed population 56 (85%) were ATA negative at baseline. The total ATA positive rate in the study was 42% among the Safety population, of which 24% were ATA transiently positive and 18% persistently positive. There were no apparent differences in ORR4 per IRF by ATA response or titre status. In total 30% of the patients neutralising ATA was measured. No correlation between neutralising ATA status and efficacy were provided.

## Health Economics Using Medical Resource Utilisation

The number of patients with at least one hospitalisation was 19 (30%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 28 (44%) in the control arm. The number of patients with at least one outpatient visits were 38 (59%) and 30 (47%) respectively. The median number of hospitalised days was 15 vs 20 days, respectively and the number of median number of outpatient visits was 5 days in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 13 in the control arm.

In both arms the number of patients with hospitalisation due to AEs was equal (45%). The median number of missed days from work was 9 days in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 5 days in the control arm.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No analysis performed across trials for efficacy was submitted.

## Clinical studies in special populations

Patients up to 83 years were included in the pivotal study. Subgroup analyses were performed for ORR4 and PFS between patients ≥65 years (28 (44%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 24 (38%) control arm) and patients &lt;65 years. In patients ≥65 years decreased efficacy was observed compared to patients &lt;65 years. The ORR4 subgroup analyses indicated a 32.1% difference in patients ≥65 compared to control arm vs 51% difference in younger patients. For PFS, HR: 0.54, in which the CI crosses 1 in older patients and HR: 0.11 in younger patients.

## Supportive study(ies)

Published literature studies in CTCL subtypes were included in this submission. This included two phase 2 trials in which brentuximab vedotin was given at 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 1 retrospective study and several case studies.

The phase II trial by Kim et al (2015) included 30 patients of which 3 with Sézary Syndome (SS) and 27 with MF. Patients were allowed to receive up to 16 cycles. In the 3 SS patients different outcomes (1CR, 1PR, 1PD) were observed. The phase II trial by Duvic et al (2016) in MF and LPD (n=48) included 17 patients with Lyp (n=9) or mixed Lyp histology; these patients had a RR of 100% including 13CRs. Median duration of response was 26 weeks (range 6 to 44).

In a retrospective single centre study (Wieser 2016) in patients with Lyp and Lyp mixed histology, brentuximab vedotin was given in 21 patients (posology is not known). Patients' LyP lesions regressed with 1 to 2 infusions. A total of 10 patients (47.6%) achieved a CR and 7 (33%) patients had relapse after therapy was stopped.

Several case reports which apply different posology are included. For SS patients (2 PD, 1SD and 1 response) and for patients with pc ɣ δ T-cell lymphoma (1CR, 2PR, 2SD) responses were observed.

In addition to the data collected in Study C25001, 2 investigator-sponsored trials (ISTs) were provided (Study 35-IST-001 and Study 35-IST-002). The main efficacy data is summarised below.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The MAH submitted one pivotal trial (CA25001/ ALCANZA) which was an open label, randomised (1:1) phase III study to support the extension of the indication. The study included patients with CD30+ (≥10%) MF or pcALCL. During scientific advice (SA; Febr.2011), the MAH was recommended to include a  sufficient  number  of  CTCL  types,  as  it  was  not  regarded  justified  to  pool  efficacy  results  in  a heterogeneous disorder. In principle, it could be possible to extrapolate to subtypes which might have similar prognosis as the studied subtypes as some of the subtypes are very rare and clinical trials are not feasible.

Patients were enrolled in the study after they had received at least 1 systemic therapy for MF and 1 prior systemic therapy or prior radiation for pcALCL. The choice of the control arm (bexarotene and methotrexate) is acceptable. Bexarotene is an approved second line therapy for  CTCL  and methotrexate is a frequently used therapy for MF and a recommended therapy for pcALCL. However, these  two  treatments  have  different  efficacy  (ORR4:  15.8%  and  7.7%,  median  PFS,  4.5  and  2.3 months, respectively). Given that the majority of control patients were treated with bexarotene, which has better efficacy than methotrexate, the pooling of patients treated with bexarotene or methotrexate is not expected to change the outcome of the results.

A large part (45%) of the screened patients were not enrolled in the study. From the 106 patients (45%) who failed screening,  65  patients  (61%) did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  CD30+  eligibility.  The study included small patient numbers, especially for those with pcALCL. This is regarded acceptable, since both are very rare diseases. Demographic data and baseline clinical data are balanced between the two arms with the exception of more severe pcALCL and more time since initial diagnosis in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared to the treatment arm. However, most likely these differences will not have a large influence on the outcomes, or at most predispose for slight less favourable outcomes in the interventional arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most  MF  patients  did  not  have  advanced  staged  disease  (≥stage  2)  and  most  pcALCL  patients  had stage 3 disease (generalised skin involvement) at study entry. In both arms MF  patients received a median  of  two  systemic  therapies  and  all  pcALCL  patients  (except  1  protocol  violation)  received  at least one systemic therapy.

The  primary  endpoint  was  ORR4  per  IRF,  measured  by  the  global  response  score  (GRS)  as recommended by EORTC/ISCL, is regarded as acceptable. ORR4 along with the secondary endpoint PFS, provides a more robust readout than only ORR in this disease. PFS is considered an acceptable endpoint, especially since this disease is characterised by frequent recurrences and an indolent course in  early  stages.  The  MAH  followed  the  SA  (Febr.  2011),  where  the  mSWAT  was  performed  by  the investigator and sensitivity analyses were performed for ORR4 with mSWAT on photographs per IRF. This strategy is considered acceptable as a clinical assessment of the skin is preferred.

In  terms  of  measuring  response,  patients  who  started  new  therapy  for  ORR4  and  had  an  ongoing response  at  the  time  of  the  start  of  next  alternate  therapy  were  counted  as  responders.  For  ORR4 patients with a previous CR who experienced recurrent disease responses were considered maintained unless  the  criteria  for  disease  progression  were  met.  Results  from  sensitivity  analyses  in  which  the patient's response after the start of next alternate therapy was censored at the start of next alternate therapy were similar to the primary analyses. Key secondary endpoints (CR, PFS, skin symptoms) are analysed  only  after  statistical  significance  of  the  primary  endpoint  ORR4  (fixed  sequential  testing procedure) and controlled for type I error (weighted Holm procedure). The analyses are considered acceptable.  Most  subgroups  were  pre-specified  in  the  SAP  and  no  interim  analysis  for  efficacy  was planned,  which  is  regarded  as  appropriate.  The  protocol  was  amended  5  times.  None  of  the amendments are considered  critical  for  conduct  of  the  study  or  the  interpretation  of  data.  Protocol deviations were equally balanced between treatment arms.

Patients with CTCL should receive up to 16 cycles (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  difference  in  primary  endpoint  ORR4  favouring brentuximab vedotin over physicians' choice therapy was observed where ORR4 was 56.3% for the brentuximab  vedotin  arm  compared  with  12.5%  for  the  control  arm.  This  statistical  significant difference was consistent over MF/pcALCL patients and over physician's choice treatment. ORR4 was generally consistent over the subgroups, though not significant in 2 subgroups (ECOG ≥1 and baseline skin tumour =0), which might relate to the small patient numbers. Sensitivity analyses show similar outcomes. In an exploratory  analysis  for  ORR4  (per  IRF  including  mSWAT  by  skin  photographs  per IRF)  the  difference  still  favoured  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  over  the  control  arm,  however,  a marked  lower  number  of  responses  are  assigned  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm,  though  still favouring brentuximab vedotin. This is considered acceptable as the difficulties in assessment of skin response per mSWAT by photographs are acknowledged, as are the associated difficulties to objectify the outcomes per IRF.

The CR rate was regarded as supportive of the primary endpoint with a higher CR in the brentuximab vedotin arm over the control arm. The PFS analyses showed a statistically significant PFS difference of 13 months for brentuximab vedotin over the physician's choice arm, which is regarded as compelling and clinically relevant. These data can be regarded as mature and were conducted after 67% of the patients experienced a PFS event, which resulted in a median follow up of 17.5 months. Sensitivity analyses with different handling of missing data and censoring rules were consistent with the original analyses.  The  PFS  advantage  of  brentuximab  vedotin  over  the  control  arms  is  generally  consistent across the other subgroups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MF and pcALCL have different prognoses, however subgroup analyses indicate statistically significant outcomes in both ORR4 and PFS and thus it can be concluded that efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in both  types  of  CTCL  compared  to  the  physician's  choice  treatment  can  be  demonstrated.  In  two subgroups, the PFS effect is not statistically significant (ECOG ≥1 and age ≥65), most likely related to the small sample sizes of the subgroups.

The disease symptoms, measured as the mean of the (per subject) maximum reduction from baseline in  the  Skindex-29  symptom  domain  was  higher  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  compared  to  the control arm. However, no conclusion can be drawn on disease symptoms as the trial was open label and  from  cycle  6  onwards  only  a  part  of  the  total  population  was  analysed.  Regarding  QoL,  no meaningful differences were observed between both treatment arms in the Skindex domains emotions and functioning and skin symptoms. The FACT-G and EQ-5D-3L outcomes were similar between the two treatment arms. Due to the open label design and the small sample size, no firm conclusions can be drawn (SmPC section 5.1). Other secondary endpoints were supportive of the primary endpoints but since they were not adjusted for multiplicity, the results should be interpreted with caution.

OS  curves  were  provided  to  exclude  any  detrimental  effects  from  the  treatment.  In  the  pcALCL patients,  there  appears  to  be  a  trend  towards  a  better  survival  for  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm compared to the control arm and in MF patients, the curves mostly favour brentuximab vedotin but appear to cross around 17 months. A further updated data cut for OS did not allow to attribute the observation of better OS in the control arm to switching of control patients to brentuximab vedotin. As such,  no  definitive  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the  longer-term  survival  of  MF  patients.  Since  the study  was  not  powered  to  detect  OS  differences,  the  uncertainties  relating  to  the  OS  data  of  MF patients are not considered to affect the totality of the favourable efficacy data in MF.

The  proposed  indication  for  ' adults  with  CD30+  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  (CTCL)  who  require systemic therapy ' is broader than the studied population. CD30 is expressed in high (per definition) and homogeneous levels by CD30 +  LPDs (pcALCL and Lyp) and CD30 may also be expressed by other CTCL  types  (Sézary  Syndome  (SS)  and  the  more  rare  CTCL  NOS  and  primary  cutaneous ɣ δ  T  cell lymphoma). The MAH provided more detailed data (full CSR) from the two investigator sponsored trails (ISTs) in which different CTCL subtypes (SS, Lyp and mixed histologies together with MF and pcALCL± 85%  of  CTCL,)  were  included.  Disease  activity  was  shown  across  all  these  subtypes.  In  the  Lyp subtype had comparable efficacy to the MF and pcALCL patients. The ISTs SS and mixed CTCL efficacy outcomes  were  somewhat  lower  compared  to  the  MF/pcALCL  patients.  Prognoses  in  CTCL  mixed histology is not known, however the subtype SS is generally associated with worse prognoses, which could explain these numbers. The available data appears in support for the extrapolation of efficacy from MF and pcALCL to other subtypes (SmPC section 5.1).

Patients enrolled were only allowed in the study after they had received at least 1 systemic therapy for MF  and  1  prior  systemic  therapy  or  prior  radiation  for  pcALCL.  There  were  no  data  submitted comparing brentuximab vedotin with current systemic treatments used in the first line setting (e.g. mono or combination  therapy  of  ECP,  total  skin  EBT,  PUVA,  interferon,  retinoids).  In  addition,  it  is unknown whether there are possible differences  between  the  first  and  second  line+  populations,  in relation to disease stage, CD30 expression, disease transformation, that could affect treatment efficacy in  first  line.  Given  these  uncertainties,  extrapolation  of  benefit/risk  from  the  second  to the  first  line setting was not considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Study C25001 was a randomised trial with CD30+ MF and pcALCL patients, who had received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. A statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in ORR4, favouring the brentuximab vedotin arm over the physician's choice arm was observed. PFS and subgroup analyses also supported the efficacy data observed with brentuximab vedotin arm over the control arm. Furthermore, anti-tumour activity was also shown in several other CTCL subtypes in two phase 2 studies, providing enough evidence to extrapolate the indication to patients with CD30+ CTCL. Conversely, there was insufficient evidence to be able to extrapolate from second line to a first line indication.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The existing safety profile of brentuximab vedotin monotherapy was mainly based on two single arm phase II studies in 160 patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL, and one placebo controlled Phase III trial (AETHERA) in 165 HL patients at increased risk for relapse after ASCT. The median number of cycles with similar brentuximab vedotin dose was 9 in patients with relapsed or refractory  HL,  15  in  HL  patients  at  increased  risk  of  relapse,  and  7  in  patients  with  relapsed  or refractory sALCL. Treatment-related adverse events were common, leading to treatment discontinuation  in  19-32%  of  patients  and  dose  modifications  in  46-54%  of  patients.  The  most common brentuximab vedotin treatment-related AEs in the pivotal studies were peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, nausea, infections and infusion reactions. The majority of AEs were managed by dose delays or reduction.

The safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in patients with CTCL was analysed in one pivotal randomised Phase 3 trial, the ALCANZA trial. The safety analysis set comprised 128 patients with the CTCL subtypes pcALCL or MF, who received ≥1 dose of any study drug. A total of 66 patients received brentuximab  vedotin,  and  in  the  control  arm  62  patients  received  physician's  choice  of  either methotrexate or bexarotene.

With methotrexate treatment, there is a potential for serious toxic reactions, such as bone marrow, liver, lung, and kidney toxicities. Bexarotene is a retinoid that has been associated with birth defects in humans  and  can  cause  major  lipid,  liver  function,  and  thyroid  test  abnormalities,  leukopenia,  and anaemia.

## Patient exposure

Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg was administered via IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle.

Methotrexate was administered once weekly as a single oral dose of 5 to 50 mg once weekly. The initial recommended starting dose of bexarotene was 150 mg/m2 for 14 days, with close monitoring of thyroxine and lipid levels. The dose would then be titrated to a final total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 if TEAEs were manageable at the lower dose.

Because brentuximab vedotin was administered in 21-day cycles while bexarotene was dosed daily and methotrexate was dosed weekly, for purposes of comparison, 21 days of bexarotene or methotrexate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dosing was counted as 1 treatment cycle in the safety analyses. Patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of brentuximab vedotin intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles or physician's choice  for  up  to  48  weeks.  The  median  number  of  cycles  was  approximately  12  cycles  in  the brentuximab vedotin arm. In the physician's choice arm, the median duration of treatment (number of cycles) for patients receiving bexarotene was approximately 16 weeks (5.5 cycles) and 11 weeks (3 cycles) for patients receiving methotrexate.

The maximum number of cycles (16) was received by 36% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 8% in the physician's choice arm.

The difference in the median number of treated cycles and doses taken in the brentuximab vedotin arm is because of the method of recording dose interruptions. Patients with dose interruptions would appear to have received 2 doses in 1 treatment cycle

(a) Patients randomized to bexarotene first received fenofibrate pre-therapy from Cycle 1 Day 1 to Day 7, followed by treatment with bexarotene starting on Cycle 1 Day 8. One patient assigned to bexarotene received only fenofibrate and is not included in this table.

(b) Duration of treatment was defined as (last dose date+21-first dose date) of brentuximab vedotin or (last dose date+7-first dose date) of methotrexate or (last dose date+1-first dose date) of bexarotene.

(c) A treated cycle was defined as a 21-day period during which the patient received any amount of brentuximab vedotin (scheduled for single dose every 21 days), methotrexate (single weekly dose), or bexarotene (single oral daily dose).

(d) Total amount of dose taken for the brentuximab vedotin arm was calculated as the sum of (prepared dose amount in mg*volume/prepared volume) over each dosing electronic case report fom record.

(e) Dose intensity was calculated as total amount of dose taken (mg)/(3*number of treated cycles). For bexarotene, divided by 3*number of treated cycles-1.

(f) Relative dose intensity was defined as 100x(total amount of dose taken [mg])/total dose expected [mg]). See source table for details. Note that relative dose intensity was not calculated for methotrexate because dose modifications were permitted per protocol.

A patient with multiple actions was counted only once.

(a) Dose increased: For methotrexate or bexarotene, it was possible for the dose to be first reduced and then increased. The action of dose increased does not necessarily mean that the increased dose was higher than the baseline dose.

(b) Dose held: As a result of an intentional physician intervention, the planned or scheduled dose was not given. No drug was administered.

(c) Dose missed: For reason(s) other than physician intervention, the dose was not administered.

(d) Not applicable for bexarotene or methotrexate, which are taken orally.

(e) Dose delayed: The scheduled dose was administered, but not within the protocol-specified timeframe for a particular scheduled dosing day/cycle. This was not applicable for bexarotene daily dosing.

## Adverse events

Adverse events (AEs) were classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using MedDRA. AEs were reported up through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

In  the  safety  analysis  set,  at  least  1  AE  of  any  Grade  was  reported  in  95%  of  patients  in  the brentuximab vedotin arm and 90% in the physician's choice arm. SAEs of  any causality  and  drugrelated treatment emergent adverse events (related TEAEs) ≥Grade 3 were each reported for 29% of patients in both treatment arms.

A higher percentage of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm experienced a TEAE that resulted in study drug discontinuation compared with the physician's choice arm (24% vs 8%, respectively).

Sechions 12.2.1 and 12.3.1.1 and Table 14.3.1.7.9.

TEAE was defined as newly occuning (not present at Baseline) or worsening after first dose of study dhug and up through 30 days after the last shudy drug dose. A patient was coumted only once for each type of event. Relatedness (eausality) to study drug was assessed by the investigator.

NR=not reported, Ph=phase.

(a) Includes only the l67 patients who received at least 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin.

(b) Shudy dug was discontinued because of an AE in 1 additional patient in the brentuximab vedotin aum (C25001

Table 14.1.1.1), but the event was erroneously reported on the patient's EOT form. The AE (lymphoma progression) subsequently became fatal and is included in Section 3.5.1.

An additional safety analysis evaluated the incidence of TEAEs adjusted for study drug exposure, since patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  remained  longer  on  study  drug  than  patients  in  the physician's choice arm. When adjusted for total person-year exposure, the incidence density of TEAEs in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  was  numerically  lower  compared  with  the  physician's  choice  arm (13.15 vs 14.90 TEAEs per person-year, Table 32).

## Treatment related TEAEs

Overall, 79% of patients experienced ≥1 treatment-related TEAE, including 86% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 71% in the physician's choice arm. The most common treatment-related TEAEs in the brentuximab  vedotin  arm  included  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (44%  vs.0%  with  physician's choice), nausea (32% vs.8%), and fatigue (27 vs. 23%).

The  most  common  treatment-related  TEAEs  in  the  physician's  choice  arm  included  fatigue  (23%), hypertriglyceridemia (18%), and headache (10%).

## Adverse Drug Reactions

Frequencies of adverse reactions described Table 34 have been determined based on data generated from clinical studies. In the pooled dataset of Adcetris as monotherapy across HL, sALCL and CTCL studies (SG035-0003, SG035-0004, SGN35-005, SGN35-006, C25001 and C25007) the most frequent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adverse reactions (≥10%) were infections, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, neutropenia, rash, cough, vomiting, arthralgia, peripheral motor neuropathy, infusion-related reactions, pruritus, constipation, dyspnoea, weight decreased, myalgia and abdominal pain. The information in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with the pooled dataset.

(a) Includes only the 167 patients who received at least 1l dose of brentuximab vedotin.

## Grade 3-4 TEAEs

Grade  3  TEAEs  were  reported  with  similar  frequency  in  both  arms  (32%).  Grade  4  TEAEs  were reported in 5% of brentuximab vedotin treated patients and 15% of patients in the physician's choice

Regardless of causality, 29% of patients in both treatment arms experienced ≥1 SAE (Table 37). SAEs reported for more than 1 patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm were cellulitis and pyrexia (2 patients each). SAEs reported for more than 1 patient in the physician's choice arm were pyrexia (4 patients) and sepsis (3 patients).

A patient was counted only once for the highest severity of each PT. Percentages were calculated using the number of treated patients as the denominator.

In the pooled dataset of Adcetris as monotherapy across HL, sALCL and CTCL studies (SG035-0003, SG035-0004,  SGN35-005,  SGN35-006,  C25001  and  C25007,  see  section  5.1)  the  most  frequent adverse reactions (≥10%) were infections, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, pyrexia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  neutropenia,  rash,  cough,  vomiting,  arthralgia,  peripheral motor  neuropathy,  infusion-related  reactions,  pruritus,  constipation,  dyspnoea,  weight  decreased, myalgia and abdominal pain.

Serious adverse drug reactions occurred in 12% of patients. The frequency of unique serious adverse drug reactions was ≤1%.

## Treatment related SAEs

Nine patients (14%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 3 patients (5%) in the physician's choice arm experienced a combined total of 20 SAEs that were assessed as related to study drug (Table 38). None of the events occurred in &gt;1 patient in either treatment arm.

At  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  for  the  study,  16  events  had  resolved,  and  two  remained  ongoing (Grade  3  PN  [brentuximab  vedotin  arm;  resulted  in  treatment  discontinuation]  and  Grade  1  skin

erosion [methotrexate]. One event of Grade 4 pancreatitis resolved with sequelae in a patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm who subsequently died of multiorgan failure.

Among  the  9  patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  who  had  treatment-related  SAEs,  three experienced Grade 3 SAEs in the infection and infestations SOC: cellulitis, diverticulitis, and impetigo (1  patient  each).  All  events  resolved  or  resolved  with  sequelae.  The  impetigo  SAE  resulted  in permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  One  other  drug-related  SAE  resulted  in  permanent discontinuation of brentuximab vedotin: Grade 4 drug eruption, reported in 1 patient.

In the physician's choice arm (methotrexate), 1 patient experienced a treatment-related SAE (Grade 4 sepsis)  in  the  infections  and  infestations  SOC;  the  event  resolved  and  did  not  result  in  study discontinuation.  One  drug-related  SAE  resulted  in  permanent  discontinuation  of  physician's  choice (bexarotene): Grade 3 haematuria, reported in 1 patient.

TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs after study drug administration of the first dose of study drug and up through

30 days after the last dose of study medication.

AEs were coded using the MedDRA dictionary Version 19.0.

(a) A patient counted once for each PT. Percentages use the number of treated patients as the denominator.

## Deaths

As of the cut-off date for the ALCANZA data analyses, which included the PFS follow-up period, the total number of deaths was 16 (24%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 14 (23%) in the physician's choice arm (Table 39).

Most  of  the  deaths  were  attributed  to  the  patients'  underlying  disease  (75%  of  the  deaths  in  the brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  71%  of  the  deaths  in  the  physician's  choice  arm)  and  were  not considered related to study treatment.

Four deaths occurred within 30 days after the last study drug dose and all in the brentuximab vedotin arm.  Events  in  3  of  the  4  patients  were  attributed  by  the  investigator  to  the  patients'  underlying disease (sepsis,  lymphoma and pulmonary embolism). In the fourth patient, a fatal event of multiorgan failure at cycle 1 day 29 was considered by the investigator as being related both to underlying disease  and  to  a  therapeutic  effect  of  brentuximab  vedotin  on  sites  of  visceral  disease  (including intestinal  perforation  and  pancreatitis).  This  patient  had  not  met  study  eligibility  criteria  at  baseline (elevated  liver  function  test  results),  and  enrolment  of  this  patient  constituted  a  major  protocol violation.

Seven deaths occurred 31 to 120 days after the last dose of the study drug, and all occurred in the physician's choice arm.

(a) Disease-related death as assessed by the investigator. Percentages use the total number of deaths in the treatment arm as the denominator.

(b) Includes 1 patient in the Safety population in the brentuximab vedotin arm who was excluded from the ITT population, and thus, is not listed in Table 14.4.2.4, which presents only the ITT population.

## Adverse events of special interest

Adverse events of interest were selected based on the known safety profile of brentuximab vedotin.

## Peripheral neuropathy

At  least  1  peripheral  neuropathy  (PN)  TEAE  was  reported  for  67%  of  patients  (n=44)  in  the brentuximab vedotin arm and 6% (n=4) in the physician's choice arm (Table 40). PN SMQ TEAEs were considered treatment related for 41 of the 44 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm of ALCANZA who  reported  PN  events  and  for  none  of  the  patients  in  the  physician's  choice  arm.  The  most commonly reported PN SMQ term for the brentuximab vedotin arm was peripheral sensory neuropathy in 30 patients (45%); in the physician's choice arm, 1 patient (2%) each reported muscular weakness, neuralgia, paraesthesia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the patients with a PN TEAE in the brentuximab vedotin arm, most were Grade 1 or 2 (n=17 and 21 respectively), and for 6 patients (9%), a Grade 3 PN TEAE was reported. In the physician's choice arm all PN events were Grade 1 or 2. No Grade 4 events were reported for either arm.

The median time to first onset of any PN event was 12 weeks (range, 0-48 weeks) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 2.5 weeks (range, 0-10 weeks) in the physician's choice arm.

Dose delays were reported for 16 of the 44 patients (36%) who experienced an event of PN in the brentuximab vedotin arm and none in the physician's choice arm.

With a median overall study follow-up of 22.9 months, PN SMQ events that had been ongoing had either improved or completely resolved in 36 of the 44 affected patients (82%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and in 1 of the 4 affected patients (25%) in the physician's choice arm.

Complete  resolution  was  reported  for  22  of  the  44  brentuximab  vedotin  patients  (50%)  and improvement was reported for 14 patients (32%). The maximum severity of those PN SMQ events that were ongoing at the last follow-up was reported as Grade 1 in 17 patients and Grade 2 in 5 patients; there were no ongoing Grade 3 events. The patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm who discontinued because of PN (n=9 patients) were able to complete a median of 11 treatment  cycles (range, 4-15 cycles) of the possible 16 treatment cycles before discontinuation.

Four  patients  (6%)  treated  with  brentuximab  vedotin  experienced  treatment-emergent  peripheral motor neuropathy; 2 patients had events with a maximum severity of Grade 2, and 2 patients had events with a maximum severity of Grade 3. Onset of peripheral motor neuropathy ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. One Grade 3 event was resolved by the EOT visit, and 2 events (1 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 2) were  resolved  at  the  last  follow-up  visit.  One  patient  had  an  event  of  Grade  2  peripheral  motor neuropathy that was reported as not resolved or improved at the time of the last follow-up, 10 weeks after EOT.

## Haematologic toxicities

Preferred terms in the MedDRA blood and lymphatic system disorders system organ class (SOC) were reported in 15% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 19% the physician's choice arm.

In the brentuximab vedotin arm, 3% of patients experienced a Grade 3 TEAE and 5% experienced a Grade  4  TEAE.  The  most  common  Grade  3  or  4  events  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  were neutropenia  (Grade  3  in  2  patients  [3%],  Grade  4  in  1  patient  [2%]).  Grade  3  thrombocytopenia, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and Grade 4 haemolytic uremic syndrome were each reported in 1 patient (2%) in this arm.

A total of 10% of patients in the physician's choice arm experienced Grade 3 TEAEs in this SOC, with no patient experiencing a ≥Grade 4 TEAE. Grade 3 TEAEs in the physician's choice arm were anaemia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  3  patients  (5%)  and  neutropenia  in  3  patients  (5%).  Nearly  all  of  the  events  in  the  physician's choice arm (10 of 12 patients) were reported in patients with bexarotene.

## Neutropenia

Neutropenia or decreased neutrophil count TEAEs were reported for 9% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 6% of patients in the physician's choice arm.

Grade  3  neutropenia  events  were  reported  in  3  patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  in  2 patients in the physician's  choice  (bexarotene)  arm.  One  patient  (brentuximab  vedotin  arm) experienced ≥1 Grade 4 event. Among the patients with Grade 3-4 neutropenia TEAEs, 1 patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 patient in the physician's choice (bexarotene) arm also experienced ≥1 TEAE in the infections and infestations SOC. The brentuximab vedotin-treated patient experienced cellulitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and upper respiratory tract infection, and the bexarotenetreated patient experienced incision site infection, otitis externa, skin infection, and tinea cruris.

Neutropenia TEAEs required ≥1 dose delay for 4 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm but did not require dose reductions, holds, or permanent discontinuations.

No events of febrile neutropenia were reported in either arm.

A patient was counted once for each category.

(a) Includes events with the PTs neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased; does not include treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities.

(b) Dose held: As a result of an intentional physician intervention, the planned or scheduled dose was not given. No study drug was administered.

## IRR

IRRs  were  reported  only  for  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm,  since  bexarotene  and  methotrexate  are orally administered. IRRs occurred in 9 patients (14%) treated with brentuximab vedotin (Table 42).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two  patients  experienced  ≥1  Grade  3  IRR  (urticaria  and  drug  hypersensitivity).  The  urticaria  IRR resulted in study drug discontinuation. All IRR preferred terms were reported in 1 patient each, except for Grade 1 pruritus, which was reported in 3 patients.

None of the IRRs were considered SAEs, and no Grade 4 IRRs or anaphylaxis TEAEs were reported.

IRRs occurred during Cycle 2 in 8 patients and in Cycle 3 in 2 patients.

Section 2.1.4.5; SGN35-005 Section 12.3.1.6 and Listings 16.2.5.1.2 through 16.2.5.1.4.

IRRs are defined as AEs related to the administration of brentuximab vedotin. A patient counts once for each type of event.

(a) Dose modification includes any dose interruption, delay, or reduction.

Patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  were  tested  for  the  presence  of  antitherapeutic  antibodies (ATAs; Table 43). Of the 9 patients who experienced an IRR in ALCANZA:

- -1 patient was ATA positive at Baseline and was transiently ATA positive during the study, with consistently low titres of ATAs.
- -5 patients were ATA negative at Baseline and became ATA positive during the study (3 were persistently ATA positive and 2 were transiently ATA positive).
- -3  patients  were  ATA  negative  at  study  Baseline  and  remained  ATA  negative  throughout  the study.

No correlation could be made between ATA and neutralising antibody (Nab) status and occurrence of TEAEs.

Table includes only those patients who received brentuximab vedotin who had an immunogenicity sample at Baseline and ≥1 postbaseline visit. IRRs were defined as TEAEs related to the infusion of brentuximab vedotin.

ATA Baseline positive was defined as patients with confirmed ATA-positive response at Baseline.

ATA Baseline negative was defined as ATA response negative (ie, not confirmed positive) at the Baseline visit.

Transiently positive was defined as 1 or 2 postbaseline-confirmed ATA-positive responses.

Persistently positive was defined as &gt;2 postbaseline-confirmed ATA-positive responses.

Negative was defined as ATA response negative (ie, not confirmed positive) at all postbaseline time points.

(a) Number of patients with ATA negative status was used as denominator.

(b) Number ofpatients with transiently positive ATA status was used as denominator.

(c) Number of patients with persistently positive ATA status was used as denominator.

(d) Number of patients with transiently or persistently positive ATA status was used as denominator.

## Laboratory findings

Serum  chemistry  abnormalities  reported  as  Grade  3  TEAEs  included  Grade  3  hyperglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, ALT increased, and AST increased. Other serum chemistry abnormalities reported as TEAEs included Grade 2 hypocalcaemia and hypernatraemia; Grade 1 and Grade 2 GGT increased, AST increased, ALT increased, and hyperglycaemia; and Grade 1 transaminases increased, blood creatinine increased,  hyponatraemia,  hyposmagnesaemia,  and  hypokalaemia.  A  post  baseline  shift  to  Grade  3 increased  ALT  was  reported  for  1  patient  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  1  patient  in  the physician's choice arm.

Abnormal haematology laboratory values reported as TEAEs included Grade 1 and Grade 2 WBC count decreased  (2  patients),  Grade  2  neutrophil  count  decreased  and  Grade  1  WBC  count  increased  (1 patient, each) in the brentuximab vedotin arm, and lymphocyte count decreased in 1 patient in the physician's  choice  arm.  One  patient  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  had  a  Grade  3  event  of thrombocytopenia that resulted in dose delay and resolved.

Hematologic values were further discussed in the previous section hematologic toxicity.

## ECG

Grade 1 tachycardia was reported in 2 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 patient in the physician's  choice  arm.  One  patient  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  had  an  event  of  Grade  1 bradycardia. No clinically significant abnormal findings were reported for the Safety population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ECOG performance status

The shift in ECOG score from baseline to worst post baseline score was no more than 1 point for the majority of patients in both treatment arms (88% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 92% in the physician's choice arm. A shift of more than 1 point in worst post baseline score was reported for 8 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 5 patients in the physician's choice arm. One patient in the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  who  had  an  ECOG  score  of  2  at  Baseline  improved  to  a  worst  post baseline score of 1 (this patient had an ECOG score of 0 at Cycle 4 through Cycle 16, and at EOT), and 1 patient in the physician's choice arm who had an ECOG score of 1 at Baseline improved to a worst post baseline score of 0.

## Safety in special populations

## Safety in additional CTCL subtypes (from published sources)

To provide additional support for the safety of brentuximab vedotin in CD30-expressing CTCL subtypes that were not included in the ALCANZA study (LyP and more aggressive forms of CTCL, such as SS, and primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma), the applicant discussed results from two Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trials and published case studies/series.

## Investigator sponsored trials

- -Kim (2015)

In this Phase 2 study, patients were included with MF or SS stages IB through IVB, who had experienced  ≥1  systemic  therapy  failure. All  patients  could  receive  up  to  8  cycles  of brentuximab  vedotin  (1.8  mg/kg)  administered  every  3  weeks.  Those  showing  continued clinical improvement were allowed a maximum of 8 additional cycles (total of 16 cycles); those with a CR were allowed to have 2 more cycles.

Thirty-two patients were enrolled and included in the safety analysis with median age of 62 years (range, 20-87 years). Most patients had advanced disease (88% with stage ≥IIB). The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3; most had prior cytotoxic agents, one with prior  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplantation.  Only  4  of  the  32  patients  had  ≥50%  CD30 expression levels.

Three  SS  patients  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis,  but  safety  data  were  not  reported separated  per  CTCL  subtype.  PN  was  a  commonly  observed  toxicity  (66%  of  32  patients). Other  toxicities  included  fatigue  (47%),  nausea  (28%),  alopecia  (22%),  and  neutropenia (19%).  Three  treatment-related  SAEs  were  reported,  including  1  event  each  of  confusion, acute renal failure, and neuropathy. Ten patients had a dose delay and/or reduction (to 1.2 mg/kg), and 6 patients (19%) discontinued study treatment because of toxicities. PN was the most common cause of dose modification or toxicity-related early termination. Most PN was a combined  sensory-motor  neuropathy.  Twelve  of  21  patients  with  PN  had  Grade  2  PN.  By Kaplan-Meier calculation, the median time to improvement of PN was 49.0 weeks, with 59% showing improvement or resolution by 12 months and 86% by 24 months.

- -Duvic (2015)

In this Phase 2 study, 48 patients (median age 60) with CD30+ LyP, CD30+ pcALCL or MF were  included.  Of  these  patients,  9  had  only  CD30+  LyP.  Brentuximab  vedotin  was administered  at  1.8  mg/kg  every  21  days  for  up  to  8  doses.  Patients  with  a  PR  or  stable disease could receive up to 8 additional doses. Patients with a CR could receive 2 additional doses.  Patients  with  breakthrough  lesions  could  receive  1.2  mg/kg  every  2  weeks  at  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discretion  of  the  investigator. The  median  number  of  prior  systemic  therapies  was  2  for patients  with  MF  and  1  for  patients  with  LyP/pcALCL.  The  median  number  of  cycles  of brentuximab vedotin was 7 for MF and 7.5 for LyP/pcALCL.

Again, safety data were reported in aggregate so safety within a particular CTCL subtype (e.g., LyP) cannot be well described. The most common dose-limiting toxicities were sensory PN in 67%  of  patients  and  fatigue  in  35%.  Grade  1  neuropathy  occurred  in  30  patients,  with progression to Grade 2 neuropathy in 21 patients. Neuropathy resolved in 14 of 31 patients, with  a  median  time  to  resolution  of  41.5  weeks.  Brentuximab  vedotin  was  occasionally associated  with  a  tumour  flare,  brisk  inflammation  in  lesions  and  surrounding  skin  that resolved as treatment continued. Patients with high CD30 expression could experience itching and  burning  of  their  skin  lesions.  A  pruritic  hypersensitivity  drug  rash  with  epidermal spongiosis  and  eosinophilia  occurred  in  24%  of  patients  during  Cycles  2  and  3  that  was managed with topical corticosteroids.

## Case studies/series

- -SS

Three case reports were discussed reporting results of 3 SS patients treated with Brentuximab vedotin. The dose was not mentioned in one report, the other two reported an initial dose of 1.2 followed by 1.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 5 cycles; and 1.8 mg/kg for 2 cycles. No (new) adverse events were reported.

Furthermore, one publication by Lamarque et al (2016) was discussed, reporting the findings of  56  peripheral  T-cell  Lymphoma  treated  with  brentuximab  vedotin  (dose  not  presented), including  2  patients  with  SS.  Safety  was  reported  in  aggregate.  No  new  safety  signal  was reported, although two known AEs were reported with a substantially higher frequency than previously  observed:  neutropenia  (37%  vs.  9%  in  ALCANZA  study)  and  thrombocytopenia (42% vs. &lt;10% 'common' in current SmPC).

## -Primary Cutaneous Gamma-delta T-cell Lymphoma

One case series (Talpur et al, 2016) was presented that included safety results. Four patients with primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma  were presented that received brentuximab  vedotin  after  various  previous  therapies  had  failed.  The  following  AEs  were reported:

- o Patient 1 received 6 cycles with fatigue being the only reported side effect.
- o Patient 2 received 7 cycles, and discontinued due to Grade 1 PN.
- o Patient 3 received 6 cycles and discontinued for unknown reason. Reported AEs were Grade 1 PN and ulcerations on hands.
- o Patient 4 completed 2 cycles and was continuing at the time of the report. Reported AEs were fatigue, pruritus and mild neuropathy.
- -LyP

Wieser  at  al  (2016)  conducted  a  retrospective  study  of  180  patients  with  LyP  of  whom  21 patients received brentuximab vedotin. The most commonly reported side effect was PN (in 9 patients); information on other side effects was not provided in the publication.

## Safety in patients with visceral CTCL involvement

In  ALCANZA,  12  patients  overall  had  visceral  involvement  at  study  entry,  and  11  (92%)  of  these patients were randomised to the brentuximab vedotin arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of  the  12  patients  with  visceral  involvement  at  study  entry,  7  patients  had  MF  and  5  patients  had pcALCL.

- -Four of the 5 patients with pcALCL were randomised to receive brentuximab vedotin, and one was randomised to the physician's choice arm and received bexarotene. Among the 4 patients with  pcALCL  who  received  with  brentuximab  vedotin,  one  died  after  receiving  1  dose.  The cause  of  death  was  reported  as  intestinal  perforation,  multi-organ  failure,  and  pancreatitis, which were attributed by the investigator to the therapeutic effect of brentuximab vedotin; the patient showed a clinical response after only 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin. Enrolment of this patient  into  the  study  constituted  a  violation  of  protocol  eligibility  criteria  because  of  liver function test results at Screening. The remaining 3 patients with pcALCL who were assigned to receive brentuximab vedotin received &gt;6 treatment cycles.
- -Among the 7 patients with MF, all were randomised to the brentuximab vedotin arm. One of the 7 patients with MF who received brentuximab vedotin discontinued study drug after Cycle 1 because of a non-serious TEAE of Grade 2 maculopapular rash. The remaining 6 patients with MF went on to receive &gt;6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin.

## Hepatic and renal impairment

Only patients with adequate hepatic and renal function were included. No separate clinical study in patients with hepatic or renal impairment has been submitted.

## Paediatric patients

No data is available in children and adolescents younger than 18 years.

## Elderly

A  total  of  51  patients  in  the  ALCANZA  study  were  aged  65  years  or  older:  28  patients  in  the brentuximab vedotin arm and 23 patients in the physician choice arm. No meaningful differences in frequency and nature of AEs were observed for patients aged ≥60 years, aged ≥65 years, aged ≥70 years, or aged ≥75 years versus the patient population as a whole (Table 44).

Treatment-emergent is defined as newly occurring (not present at Baseline) or worsening after first dose of study drug and up through 30 days after the last study drug dose. A patient was counted only once for each type of event. Relatedness (causality) to study drug was assessed by the investigator.

(a)StudydrugwasdiscontinuedbecauseofanAEin1additionalpatientinthebrentuximabvedotinarm(C25001Table12.p),buttheeventwaserroneously reported on the patient's EOT form. The AE (lymphoma) subsequently became fatal and is included in Section 3.5.1.

## Pregnancy and lactation

No events of pregnancy in either a patient or a male patient's partner were reported during the study. No change to the existing warning in section 4.6 of the SmPC is proposed.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation

TEAEs resulted in discontinuation of study drug for 24% of patients (n=16) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 8% (n=5) in the physician's choice arm. In the brentuximab vedotin arm, more than half of the patients (9 out of 16) discontinued study drug because of ≥1 TEAE included in the PN standardised MedDRA  query  (SMQ)  search  terms,  including  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (8%),  PN  (3%),  and peripheral  motor  neuropathy  and  hypoesthesia  (2%  each).  All  other  TEAEs  that  led  to  study  drug discontinuation were experienced by not more than 1 patient in either treatment group.

A patient counts only once for each PT. Percentages use the number of treated patients as the denominator. (a) Study drug was discontinued because of an AE in 1 additional patient in the brentuximab vedotin arm (C25001 Table 14.1.1.1); the recorded action for this AE was \"discontinued from the study\" instead of \"study drug discontinued\". The AE (lymphoma) subsequently became fatal; a summary of the event is provided in Section 3.5.4.

## Post marketing experience

Cumulatively as of August 2016, post marketing exposure to brentuximab vedotin was estimated at 25,458 patients worldwide since launch.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Patient population and exposure

The safety analysis set included 128 randomised patients with the CTCL subtypes pcALCL or MF, who received ≥1 dose of any study drug. The safety analysis set of the pivotal trial is considered sufficient,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

although information concerning uncommon adverse events may be limited at this time. Safety data from  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  of  ALCANZA  are  largely  consistent  with  those  of  the  earlier monotherapy studies.

## Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths

No new safety signals were detected in the ALCANZA trial. Almost every patient experienced at least one  TEAE  (95%  with  brentuximab  vedotin  vs.  90%  physician's  choice).  Although  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs, (41% vs. 47%), related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (29% in both arms) and SAEs (29% both arms) occurred with almost similar frequencies in both arms, treatment related TEAEs (86% vs. 71%) and treatment related  SAEs  (14%  vs.  5%)  were  more  frequently  reported  with  brentuximab  vedotin  compared  to physician's choice. Within the physician's choice arm, more (treatment related) TEAEs and (related) ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs were observed with bexarotene, while serious TEAEs and treatment related SAEs were observed  more  frequently  with  methotrexate.  However,  the  safety  profile  of  brentuximab  vedotin appears  generally  similar  when  compared  to  one  of  the  separate  treatments  or  the  combined physician's choice arm.

The most common treatment related TEAEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (44% vs.0%), nausea (32% vs.8%), and fatigue (27 vs. 23%). None of the related SAEs occurred in &gt;1 patient in either treatment arm, but three patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (4.5%) experienced Grade 3 SAEs in the infection and infestations SOC: cellulitis, diverticulitis, and impetigo.

An additional safety analysis evaluated the incidence of TEAEs adjusted for study drug exposure, since patients  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  remained  longer  on  study  drug  than  patients  in  the physician's choice arm. When adjusted for total person-year exposure, the incidence density of TEAEs in the brentuximab vedotin arm was lower compared with the physician's choice arm (13.15 vs 14.90 TEAEs per person-year). This difference resolved after correction for study drug exposure.

The  total  number  of  deaths  was  16  (24%)  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  14  (23%)  in  the physician's choice arm. A higher number of deaths occurred within 30 days after the last study drug dose in the brentuximab vedotin arm (n=4) vs. the physician's choice arm (n=0). Only one of these 4 deaths  was  considered  treatment  related  (multi-organ  failure  including  intestinal  perforation  and pancreatitis). Another 3 deaths in the brentuximab vedotin arm were not considered disease-related, as  well  as  4  deaths  in  the  physician's  choice  arm.  The  cause  of  these  deaths  (other  than  disease related)  was  assessed  and  no  new  safety  signals  regarding  deaths  related  to  brentuximab  vedotin treatment have been revealed.

TEAEs resulted in discontinuation of study drug for 24% of patients (n=16) in the brentuximab vedotin arm  and  8%  (n=5)  in  the  physician's  choice  arm,  which  is  in  line  with  previous  observed discontinuation rates for brentuximab vedotin. Almost half of the patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm  discontinued  due  to  peripheral  neuropathy.  All  other  AEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  were  not reported for more than one patient. Dose modifications occurred in large proportions of both treatment arms  (~73%),  with peripheral neuropathy being the most  common  TEAE  resulting in dose modifications. In the brentuximab vedotin, this mostly consisted of a dose delay (61% vs. 18%), in the physician's  choice  arm  a  dose  modification  mostly  consisted  of  dose  reduction  (26%  brentuximab vedotin  vs.  34%  physician's  choice),  -  increase  (0%  vs.  33%)  or  dose  held  (2%  vs.  26%).  TEAEs resulting in dose modifications have been discussed by the applicant during the second and third round of  assessment. No notable trend in PFS or response rates could be observed between patients that discontinued due to AEs vs. patients who remained on treatment, but no definitive comparisons could be performed due to the limited number of patients discontinuing study medication due to AEs.

## Adverse events of special interest

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among  the  AEs  of  special  interest,  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  observed.  The  safety  data  in patients retreated with ADCETRIS (SGN35-006, see section 5.1) were consistent with those observed in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies, with the exception of peripheral motor neuropathy, which had a higher incidence (28% vs. 9% in the pivotal phase 2 studies) and was primarily Grade 2. Patients also  had  a  higher  incidence  of  arthralgia,  Grade  3  anaemia,  and  back  pain  compared  to  patients observed  in  the  combined  pivotal  phase  2  studies.  The  observed  frequencies  of  the  AEs  peripheral neuropathy  (67%  brentuximab  vedotin  vs.  6%  physician's  choice),  neutropenia  (9%  vs.  6%)  and infusion related reactions (14% vs. 0%) were higher compared with the comparator arm, but in line with or with lower frequencies (neutropenia) than observed in the Phase 3 AETHERA trial in HL. Lesscommon  TEAEs  that  have  been  previously  observed  with  brentuximab  vedotin  treatment  (e.g., Stevens-Johnson  syndrome/toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  tumour  lysis  syndrome,  and  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) were not reported in the ALCANZA study. AEs of special interest that were defined in previous studies with brentuximab vedotin, including thrombocytopenia and anaemia, pulmonary  toxicity,  hepatotoxicity,  hyperglycaemia,  secondary  malignancies,  and  infections,  were consistent with the known safety profile of brentuximab vedotin and within the range of that reported in  the  SmPC.  In  clinical  trials,  the  majority  of  patients  had  improvement  or  resolution  of  their symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). The proposed changes regarding peripheral neuropathy in the SmPC section 4.4 (deletion of incidence) were acceptable as incidences of peripheral neuropathy in the different studies were moved to or already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The general warning regarding peripheral neuropathy has remained largely unchanged, and is therefore still acceptable.

Of the 28 patients (47%) that were anti-drug antibody (ATA) positive at any post-baseline visit, 12 (20%  of  total  number  of  patients  in  the  brentuximab  arm)  were  persistently  ATA  positive.  These frequencies  seem  higher  compared  to  the  AETHERA  trial  (&gt;32%  ATA  positive,  8%  persistently positive).  It  is  however  reassuring  that  the  frequency  of  IRRs  was  in  line  with  previous  observed frequencies, and no relation between ADA status and occurrence of TEAEs has been observed.

## Safety in other CTCL subtypes

The  case  series/reports  presented  seem  to  reveal  no  new  safety  signal  in  SS,  primary  cutaneous Gamma-delta T-cell Lymphoma or Lyp. Safety data has been presented separately for MF and pcALC and despite differences in some of the safety parameters (overall TEAE frequency 100% with MF vs. 81%  with  pcALCL,  and  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  30%  vs.  13%,  primarily  due  to  peripheral neuropathy),  the  overall  safety  profile  seems  largely  similar.  Related  TEAEs,  Grade  ≥3  events  and SAEs were reported with almost similar frequencies in MF patients compared to pcALCL patients. The safety database is small (n=50 MF vs n=16 pcALCL), however, no strong safety signal has been found that might indicate a different safety profile in MF or pcALCL and was similar to that observed in other indications (HL, sALCL). Extrapolation of safety data to other more rare CTCL subtypes can therefore be  considered.  However,  since  the  safety  database  is  limited  in  CTCL  subtypes  other  than  MF  and pcALCL, the safety of these patients should be monitored through post-marketing pharmacovigilance via PSURs.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, no new safety concerns have been identified with brentuximab vedotin treatment in MF and pcALCL patients. Moreover, the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin in patients with MF and pcALCL was similar to that observed in other indications (HL, sALCL). Safety data for other rare CD30+ CTCL subtypes included in the indication is very limited but nevertheless no findings in the data provided

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

could indicate a different safety profile between the different CD30+ CTCL subtypes. The frequency of ADRs has been updated in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

The assessor, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation  measures  remains  sufficient  to  minimise  the  risks  of  the  product  in  the  proposed indication(s).

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections  4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2  SmPC  have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: a user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was conducted in the context of the initial marketing authorisation application for Adcetris in 2012. This variation does not change the treatment regimen or the safety profile of Adcetris and only introduces minimal changes to the package.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The MAH initially applied for the following indication:

-  Adcetris  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  CD30+  cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who require systemic therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

CTCL  is  a  very  rare  disease  group  of  skin-homing  T  cell  neoplasms  with  considerable  variation  in clinical  presentation,  histologic  appearance  and  prognosis.  CD30  is  strongly  and  homogeneously expressed (per definition) by pcALCL and Lyp, and may also be expressed by other CTCL subtypes, however at much lower and variable levels. In MF, the most frequent CTCL type (50-60% of CTCL) varying CD30 levels have been described (0-80%), though most literature indicates lower expression rates  (median  10-12%  of  cells  express  CD30).  The  studied  population  included  patients  with  MF (incidence 0.3-0.9/100.000) and pcALCL (incidence unknown). There is no standard initial therapy for MF patients, however, systemic options bexarotene and methotrexate are frequently used in second line (both RR30-50%). Systemic therapies for pcALCL include methotrexate (RR 87%) and bexarotene (RR ±50%). Both diseases are characterised by frequent recurrences. pcALCL and the early stages of MF have an excellent prognosis, while the advanced stages of MF have a poor prognosis.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

This application is based on one pivotal randomised, open-label, phase III trial (C25001; ALCANZA) conducted in 128 patients with CD30-positive (≥10%) MF or pcALCL (stratified per diagnosis), who received at least 1 prior systemic therapy (or prior radiation therapy in pcALCL). In this study, the effect  of  brentuximab  vedotin  versus  physician's  choice  of  methotrexate  or  bexarotene  on  the proportion of patients with objective response lasting at least 4 months (ORR4) was evaluated.

Supportive material is derived from two phase II investigator sponsored trials in CTCL patients after prior systemic therapy.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The  primary  endpoint  ORR4  (objective  response  that  lasted  4  months)  per  IRF  based  on  a  Global Response  Score  (GRS)  was  56.3%  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  12.5%  in  the  control  arm (p&lt;0.001).  The  results  are  considered  clinically  relevant.  ORR4  was  generally  consistent  across subgroups and in different sensitivity analyses.

Key secondary endpoints (CR, PFS and skin symptoms) were analysed according to a fixed sequential testing procedure. The CR rate per IRF was 10 patients (15.6%) in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 1 patient (1.6%) in the physician's choice arm (adjusted p-value=0.0046). A median PFS differences of 13 months was observed favouring the brentuximab vedotin arm over the physician's choice arm with a  median  PFS  16.7  vs  3.5  months,  respectively  (HR  0.27;  95%CI  0.17-0.43).  PFS  analyses  were performed with a median PFS follow-up of 17.5 months and 67% of the events reached. The treatment effect  was  mostly  consistent  across  subgroups.  All  sensitivity  analyses  favoured  the  brentuximab vedotin arm over the control arm.

EFS analyses supports the primary endpoint. Durable response were observed both overall and in the skin in both treatment arms. Duration of response (15.1 [95%CI 9.7-25.5] vs 18.3 [95%CI 3.5-18.4]) and  duration  of  skin  response  (20.6  [95%CI14.1-25.7]  vs  18.3  [95%CI  3.5-18.9])  are  comparable between  the  brentuximab  vedotin  and  control  arm.  OS  data  in  pcALCL  patients  do  not  indicate detrimental effects.

No  differences  in  patient  reported  outcomes  per  FACT-G,  EQ-5D  and  Skindex-29  total  score  were observed between the two treatment arms. Skin symptoms as measured by the Skindex-29 symptom domain appear to decrease with time in the brentuximab vedotin arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two supportive phase II trials showed anti-tumour activity in the majority of other CTCL subtypes (SS, Lyp  and  mixed  CTCL  histology's  ±  85%  of  CTCL,  together  with  MF  and  pcALCL)  with  CD30 expression≤10%.  Case  series  additionally  indicate  anti-tumour  activity  of  brentuximab  vedotin  in patients with CTCL types primary cutaneous ɣ δ T-cell lymphoma and folliculotropic MF (together 6% of the CTCL).

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

CTCL subtypes other than MF and pcALCL were not included in the pivotal study. Subtypes SS, Lyp and mixed  CTCL  histology  were  studied  in  two  non-comparative  phase  II  trials.  The  case  series  in cutaneous ɣ δ T-cell lymphoma and Lyp were submitted but the evidence is limited. From the remaining CTCL subtypes, most of which are very rare, (together&lt;10% CTCL) no data is available.

Therefore, the size of the treatment effect in CD30 + CTCL subtypes other than  MF and  pcALCL is not clear due to lack of high level evidence. In two single arm phase II studies of brentuximab vedotin, disease  activity  has  been  shown  in  the  subtypes  SS,    LyP  and  mixed  CTCL  histology.  These  data suggest that efficacy  and  safety  can  be  extrapolated  to other  CTCL  CD30+  subtypes.  Nevertheless, Adcetris should be used with caution in other CD30+ CTCL patients after careful consideration of the potential benefit-risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In study C25001, at least 1 TEAE of any Grade was reported in almost all patients (95% brentuximab vedotin vs. 90% physician's choice). The most frequently reported TEAEs included peripheral sensory neuropathy (45% vs. 2%), nausea (36% vs. 13%), diarrhoea (29% vs. 6%), fatigue (29% vs. 27%), pruritus (17% vs. 13%), pyrexia (17% vs. 18%), and vomiting (17% vs. 5%).

When  adjusted  for  total  person-year  exposure,  the  incidence  density  of  TEAEs  in  the  brentuximab vedotin arm was lower compared with the physician's choice arm (13.15 vs 14.90 TEAEs per personyear).

Treatment  related  TEAEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  (86%  vs. 71%). The most common treatment related TEAEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (44% vs.0%), nausea (32% vs.8%), and fatigue (27 vs. 23%).

SAEs were reported in 29% of patients in both treatment arms. Treatment related SAEs occurred more frequently with brentuximab vedotin (14% vs. 5%). None of the related events occurred in &gt;1 patient in either treatment arm, but three patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm (4.5%) experienced Grade 3 SAEs in the infection and infestations SOC: cellulitis, diverticulitis, and impetigo.

The  total  number  of  deaths  was  16  (24%)  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  and  14  (23%)  in  the physician's choice arm. A higher number of deaths occurred within 30 days after the last study drug dose  in  the  brentuximab  vedotin  arm  (n=4)  vs.  the  physician's  choice  arm  (n=0).  One  of  these  4 deaths  was  considered  treatment  related  (multi-organ  failure  including  intestinal  perforation  and pancreatitis).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A higher frequency of patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm discontinued study treatment due to AEs  (24%  vs.  8%  with  physician's  choice).  The  most  common  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  was peripheral  neuropathy.  Dose  modifications  occurred  in  large  proportions  of  both  treatment  arms (~73%). In the brentuximab vedotin, this mostly consisted of a dose delay (61% vs. 18%), in the physician's  choice  arm  a  dose  modification  mostly  consisted  of  dose  reduction  (26%  brentuximab vedotin vs. 34% physician's choice), - increase (0% vs. 33%) or dose held (2% vs. 26%).

As expected, higher frequencies of the AEs of special interest peripheral neuropathy (67% brentuximab vedotin vs. 6% physician's choice), neutropenia (9% vs. 6%) and infusion related reactions (14% vs. 0%) were observed compared with the comparator arm.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Literature  based  safety  data  for  patients  with  other,  more  rare  CD30+  CTCL  subtypes  than  MF  or pcALCL  included  in  the  proposed  indication  is  considered  very  limited.  The  case  series/reports presented seem to reveal no new safety signal in SS, primary cutaneous ɣ δ T-cell lymphoma or Lyp. However,  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  analysed  and incomplete  safety  data  for  these  patients.  Therefore,  safety  information  in  other  more  rare  CD30+ CTCL subtypes will be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance activities.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

A higher number of responses lasting at least 4 months were observed in the brentuximab vedotin arm compared to the control arm. This primary efficacy endpoint (ORR4) is supported with a compelling and  clinically  relevant  PFS  difference  and  ORR,  CR  and  EFS  favouring  brentuximab  vedotin  over bexarotene/methotrexate. Therefore, the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin is considered demonstrated in the studied population of MF and pcALCL patients who received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. The OS data does not show a detrimental effect thus far but the data are still immature for the pcALCL and  the  MF  population.  Considering  the  totality  of  the  data  and  the  effect  of  many  subsequent therapies on OS, this uncertainty is regarded acceptable.

Although Grade ≥3 TEAEs (41% vs. 47%), related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (29% in both arms) and SAEs (29%  both  arms)  occurred  with  almost  similar  frequencies  in  both  arms,  treatment  related  TEAEs (86%  vs.  71%)  and  treatment  related  SAEs  (14%  vs.  5%)  were  more  frequently  reported  with brentuximab  vedotin  compared  to  physician's  choice.  Likewise,  treatment  discontinuation  occurred more frequently in the brentuximab vedotin arm (24% vs. 8%). Although the toxicity of brentuximab vedotin  in  the  ALCANZA  trial  is  considered  substantial,  safety  data  are  largely  consistent  with  the earlier monotherapy studies, and no new safety signals were reported.

No new safety signal has been found that might indicate a different safety profile in MF or pcALCL, despite the difference in CD30+ expression and tumour load between these different CTCL subtypes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Because of the rarity of the disease, it is likely that there may be difficulties in acquiring additional comprehensive data in the CTCL subtypes other than MF and pcALCL. Currently, there is limited data on the safety in the rarest CTCL subtypes (&lt;10% CTCL). The totality of the data provided indicate that the  safety  profile  in  CD30+  CTCL  subtypes  will  likely  be  similar  to  the  known  safety  profile  of brentuximab vedotin. It is considered that the safety in the CTCL subtypes other than MF and pcALCL should be monitored post-marketing.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The  randomised  phase  III  C25001  trial  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  of  brentuximab vedotin  compared  to  physician's  choice  chemotherapy  in  MF  and  pcALCL  patients.  Based  on  the efficacy data, the clinical benefit can be extrapolated to the other rarer subtypes of CD30+CTCL. No new safety  signals  have  been  reported  for  these  patients  and  the  presented  frequencies  and  ADRs seem  consistent  with  previous  observed  safety  data  for  brentuximab  vedotin  monotherapy  in  HL. Therefore,  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  the  proposed  indication  'ADCETRIS  is  indicated  for  the treatment  of  adult  patients  with  CD30+  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  (CTCL)  after  at  least  1  prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1)' is positive.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

The proposed indication in the studied population consisted of patients who had received a median of 2 systemic  therapies.  Extrapolation  of  benefit/risk  from  second  line  to  first  line  setting  was  highly uncertain  due  to  the  lack  of  efficacy  comparing  brentuximab  vedotin  with  possibly  less  toxic  and effective treatment options in first line setting (e.g. mono or combination therapy of ECP, total skin EBT, PUVA, interferon and retinoids). There was concern that there could also be possible differences in the risk factors in patient populations being treated in first and second line plus setting (related to disease  stage,  CD30  expression,  disease  transformation  etc.).  Therefore,  the  extrapolation  to  the broader indication was not acceptable and a restriction to patients that had been previously treated with at least 1 prior systemic therapy, which reflects the patient population that had been included in the main pivotal study.

The CHMP considered that the benefit risk balance was positive for CD30+ CTCL. It is regarded that the benefit-risk in MF/pcALCL patients can be extrapolated to other CD30+ patients. The uncertainties regarding  the  effect  size  in  other  CTCL  types  than  MF/pcALCL  should  be  considered  in  the  light  of difficulties of performing trials in this very rare disease (SmPC section 4.4).

## 4. Recommendations
