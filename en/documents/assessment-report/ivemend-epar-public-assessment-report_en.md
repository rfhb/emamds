## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Problem statement

Nausea  and  vomiting  are  common  adverse  effects  during  or  after  cancer  chemotherapy.  Patients consistently report that chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is an aspect of treatment they  find  most  unpleasant  and  distressing.  This  syndrome  has  a  significant  impact  on  patients'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

functional  status  and  quality  of  life  and  patients  may  delay  scheduled  chemotherapy  or  even  on occasion  refuse  potentially  curative  therapy  because  of  CINV.  The  emetic  response  may  be  acute (within 24 hours after treatment) or delayed (&gt; 24 hours after treatment). The underlying mechanism(s) of acute and delayed emesis are suggested to be different. Present therapies consist of serotonin  5-HT3  receptor  antagonists  such  as  ondansetron,  tropisetron  and  granisetron  and  the dopamine receptor antagonist metoclopramide. These compounds have an adequate effect in acute, but not in delayed CINV.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of oral aprepitant, there is still a medical need for treatment options (such  as  intravenous  administration)  to  prevent  CINV  in  patients  who  cannot  easily  tolerate  orally administered  medication  prior  to  initiating  chemotherapy.  Parenteral  administration  is  also  an important treatment option for oncologists for whom it is frequently more convenient and easier to administer  compounds  intravenously  prior  to  the  administration  of  chemotherapy  (which  is  also commonly given intravenously).

## About the product

The active substance of IVEMEND  is  fosaprepitant dimeglumine (hereafter referred to as fosaprepitant) is a water-soluble phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant, which is rapidly converted to aprepitant in  vivo following  intravenous  administration.  Aprepitant  is  an  antagonist  of  human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.

Substance P belongs to the neuropeptide-family, tachykinins and is abundant and widely distributed in the  mammalian CNS and other tissues. Its biological action is  mediated through G-protein coupled receptors designated NK1, NK2, and NK3. The preferred ligand for the NK1 receptor is substance P itself.  NK1  receptors are for instance located in brain regions (brain stem nuclei of the dorsal vagal complex) that are critical for the regulation of the vomiting reflex and consequently substance P is able to evoke emesis. The anti-emetic profile of NK1 antagonists has been demonstrated in several species including  ferrets,  dogs  and  pigs.  In  the  most  characterised,  non-clinical  model  of  emesis,  the cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets, aprepitant showed a good effect on both acute and delayed emesis in contrast to 5-HT3 antagonists where the effect was seen only in the acute phase. Since fosaprepitant is  a  prodrug  of  aprepitant  and  is  rapidly  converted  in  aprepitant,  the  pharmacological  activity  of fosaprepitant mirrors those of aprepitant.

The indication applied for IVEMEND by the Applicant is 'prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeated courses of highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy,  including  high-dose  cisplatin,  in  combination  with  other  anti-emetic  agents'.  The proposed regimen of fosaprepitant is 115 mg as a 15-minute infusion administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy to substitute 125 mg of oral aprepitant on Day 1.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Merck  Sharp  &amp;  Dohme  Ltd  has  applied  for  a  marketing  authorisation  through  the  centralised procedure for IVEMEND 115 mg powder for solution for infusion.

The  active  substance  fosaprepitant  dimeglumine  is  the  water  soluble  pro-drug  of  already  approved water-insoluble  aprepitant  (already  marketed  as  a  centralised  product  for  the  80,  125  and  40 mg capsules, respectively EMEA/H/C/527 and EMEA/H/C/527/X/015). This new product is intended to be an alternative to the Day 1 oral administration of aprepitant 125 mg. Fosaprepitant converts rapidly to aprepitant in vivo following intravenous administration.

The finished product is packaged in a glass vial containing fosaprepitant dimeglumine equivalent to 115 mg fosaprepitant.

The structure of pro-drug fosaprepitant dimeglumine (INN) is detailed below. It is a white to off-white amorphous  powder  and  is  very  hygroscopic.  Properties  such  as  solubility,  partition  coefficient  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pKa have been described. Fosaprepitant has 3 chiral centres and the counter-ion meglumine 4 chiral centres.

<!-- image -->

## · Manufacture

The synthesis of fosaprepitant can be summarised in 3 main steps starting from aprepitant.

The synthesis has been sufficiently detailed (materials, quantities, temperatures, pressures and typical yields given) including an adequate manufacturing process development.

Satisfactory  specifications  are  provided  for  all  raw  materials  and  starting  materials  used  in  the synthesis as well as control of the critical steps and intermediates.

No process validation data has been submitted. However, a formal validation of the manufacturing process,  at  the  proposed  manufacturing  site  will  take  place  prior  to  release  of  the  product  to  the market. This was accepted.

Impurities  have  been  extensively  discussed,  and  the  level  of  the  impurities  (including  residual solvents, catalysts and reagents) do not present any toxicological concern.

The structure of fosaprepitant dimeglumine has been elucidated by analytical methods such as UV, IR, NMR ( 1 H and 13 C) and MS.

Stereochemistry remains unchanged compared to the starting material aprepitant. The chiral centres of fosaprepitant are controlled in aprepitant as well as the chiral purity of the meglumine counter ion, and no epimerization is expected during the process. Also batch results have been consistent throughout the development and during storage.

## · Specification

Adequate specification has been presented for fosaprepitant meglumine and includes parameters such as identification, appearance, assay, related substances, residual solvents, water content, heavy metals, counter ion meglumine.

Analytical  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  ICH guidelines.

The specification has been justified and in particular the impurity limits. The acceptance criteria for impurities including residual solvents are in line with ICH requirements and batch results and do not raise any safety concern.

Microbiological quality was not included in the specification. It has been appropriately justified taking into account the properties of fosaprepitant, the storage conditions and the manufacturing conditions of the finished product. Optical purity has not been included in the specification since it has been studied and remained stable during storage.

Fosaprepitant  dimeglumine  is  stored  in  double  polyethylene  liners  in  stainless  steel  containers. Specification  for  the  packaging  material  polyethylene  has  been  provided  and  the  material  complies with EU Directive 2002/72/EC for use with pharmaceuticals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability

Stability data were provided for pilot (36 months) and commercial (18 months available) batches of fosaprepitant stored in the commercial package at long-term (-20°C) and accelerated (5°C) conditions, in line with ICH conditions.

The following parameters were investigated: appearance, degradation products, assay of fosaprepitant dimeglumine, water content. Analytical methods were described and validated.

Data support a 3 years re-test period when the active substance is kept at -20°C.

## Medicinal Product

The product is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and further dilution prior to intravenous infusion. Each 10-ml vial contains fosaprepitant dimeglumine (equivalent with 115 mg  of fosaprepitant free acid) in a lyophilised matrix.

The product is kept in 10 ml Ph. Eur. Type I glass vial with Ph. Eur. rubber stopper and aluminium seal with plastic cap.

## · Pharmaceutical development

The finished product is a powder for solution for infusion. The focus of the development has been to provide a parenteral product as an alternative to the oral hard capsule presentation of aprepitant.

Fosaprepitant  dimeglumine is  a  phosphorylated  prodrug  of  aprepitant.  Following i.v. administration the  prodrug  rapidly  converts  to  aprepitant.  Aprepitant  is  insoluble  in  water  whereas  fosaprepitant dimeglumine  is  soluble.  Fosaprepitant  dimeglumine  is  an  amorphous  hygroscopic  compound  that easily degrades to 'exclusively' aprepitant unless stored at low temperature. Degradation is enhanced by  the  presence  of  water.  Therefore  conditions  of  storage  at  low  temperature  and  reducing  the exposure to water have been carefully controlled to avoid conversion to aprepitant before use.

The excipients were selected to provide a physically and chemically stable formulation.

The following compendial excipients (Ph. Eur.) are commonly used for parenteral products and have been used to stabilise  the  formulation.  Edetate  disodium  prevents  precipitation  of  insoluble  salts  of fosaprepitant. Polysorbate 80 is added to solubilise the possible degradate and is below a level raising safety concerns. Lactose is added to the formulation to prevent cake collapse. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid are used for pH adjustment. Water is used as solvent.

Analytical methods are compendial and therefore no validation was needed.

Certificates of analysis in compliance with Ph. Eur. have been presented for each excipient

The manufacturing process development has been extensively discussed. Key steps in the manufacture are  compounding,  lyophilisation  and  stopper  drying.  The  process  has  been  optimised  to  prevent degradation of fosaprepitant during manufacture especially with regard to temperature, pH, and water content.

Since the labile nature of the active substance, terminal sterilisation by moist heat was not feasible. Gamma radiation did also cause degradation of fosaprepitant. Therefore aseptic processing has been the method of choice.

Compatibility  between  the  finished  product  and  the  process  equipment  as  well  as  the  packaging materials  has  been  demonstrated.  Furthermore,  the  reconstituted  drug  product  has  been  tested  in medical devices used for reconstitution and administration such as polyolefine syringes, hypodermic needles, IV sets, and cannulae.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compatibility between the finished products and diluents such as 0.9% Sodium chloride injection', '5% Dextrose injection' and 'Water for injection' has been confirmed. The product is stated to be incompatible with 'Ringer's' and 'Lactated Ringer's solutions.

## · Adventitious agents

Among the excipients only lactose is from animal origin. A supplier's certificate states that milk is sourced from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk used for human consumption. Therefore it  complies  with  the  Note  for  guidance  EMEA/410/01  rev2  and  does  not  present  any  risk  of  TSE contamination.

## · Manufacture of the product

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  described  in  detail  (equipment,  quantities,  temperatures, durations and in-process controls given). The manufacture consists of 11 steps: dissolution of inactive ingredients  in  water  for  injections  (WFI),  cooling,  possible  pH  adjustment,  addition  of  active substance, adjustment of batch weight with WFI, possible pH adjustment, final adjustment of batch weight with WFI, filtration through 0.22 micron filter, filtration into pre-sterilised vials, lyophilisation and capping.

Adequate  control  of  critical  steps  and  intermediates  have  been  applied  during  the  manufacturing process including temperature control, pH check, fill weight check, pre-sterilisation bioburden, filter integrity, control of lyophilisation parameters, and control of the stoppers.

A  5%  percent  overfill  has  been  included  to  assure  the  withdrawal  of  115  mg  fosaprepitant dimeglumine for reconstitution.

The  manufacturing  process  is  not  considered  as  a  standard  process,  given  the  labile  nature  of  the substance, the water-insoluble nature of the possible degradation product, the lyophilisation step and the aseptic processing. Validation data have been provided for the aseptic part of the process ensuring the  sterility  of  the  finished  product  and  validation  results  submitted  for  3  consecutive  production batches. Results comply  with  the release specification and  demonstrate the consistency and reproducibility of the manufacture.

The finished product is supplied in type I borosilicate glass vials closed by type I closures (bromo or chlorobutyl rubber stoppers) capped with aluminium seal and a flip-off plastic cap. Glass vials and stoppers have been adequately characterised and comply with Ph. Eur. requirements.

## · Product specification

The release and shelf life specification for IVEMEND 115 mg powder for solution for infusion have been provided and include parameters such as: appearance, identification (HPLC, NIR), pH, assay of fosaprepitant (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), water content (NIR, Karl Fischer), particulate matter, sterility, bacterial endotoxins.

Non-compendial analytical procedures have been adequately described and validated.

Analysis of pilot scale batches kept in the commercial packaging have showed that all batches remain within the proposed specification.

## · Stability of the product

Eighteen  batches  of  90  mg/vial,  115  mg/vial,  and  150  mg/vial  have  been  kept  under  long-term conditions (up to 18 months, at 5°C) and accelerated conditions (6 months, at 25°C/60%RH).

The following stability indicating parameters were investigated: assay, degradation product, appearance of solution, particulate matter, pH, reconstitution time, water content.

No significant degradation could be observed under long-term conditions.

Analytical methods were sufficiently detailed and validated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In general, stability data support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

Reconstitution stability data for the drug product support storage for up to 24 hours.

Photostability studies were performed in line with the ICH NfG Q1B showed that the product is not light-sensitive.

The applicant has committed to place the first three production batches under long-term stability until 36 months according to the agreed stability schedule.

## Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects

Generally, satisfactory documentation has been provided. The active substance fosaprepitant (prodrug of aprepitant) is well characterised and the retained specification including the impurities levels have been justified by toxicological studies. Stability data support the proposed re-test period providing that it is kept at -20C.

Regarding the finished product, the manufacturing process is adequately described and controlled. It should ensure a consistent quality for the product. Appropriate specification has been selected for this parenteral product. Stability studies under ICH conditions have demonstrated the good stability of the finished product. Stability data support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC as well as stability after reconstitution.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were some outstanding quality issues with no impact on the benefit/risk. The applicant undertook to provide with the necessary information as follow-up measures within  an  agreed  timeframe  and  to  submit  variations  if  required  following  the  evaluation  of  this additional information.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

In addition to the pharmacokinetics and in vivo metabolism investigations of aprepitant in mice, the pharmacokinetics of fosaprepitant and/or aprepitant were studied in rats and dogs. For the purpose of interspecies  comparisons  between  non-clinical  animal  models  and  humans,  the  plasma  protein binding, blood-to-plasma partition ratio and in vitro metabolism of [ 14 C]fosaprepitant and/or aprepitant were also investigated. In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of aprepitant to serve as  an  inhibitor  of  human  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  and  P-glycoprotein-mediated  transport  and  to identify the human liver microsomal P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of aprepitant.

To support the clinical studies, formulations of fosaprepitant in PS80 (up to 2 mg/ml fosaprepitant and 0.5% PS80) and in saline (up to 50 mg/ml fosaprepitant) were evaluated in non-clinical tolerability and/or toxicity studies. The intravenous fosaprepitant non-clinical studies included in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies, local tolerance studies, acute and repeated dose (up to  1  month in duration) intravenous toxicity studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, and ocular and dermal irritation studies.

Since  fosaprepitant  is  rapidly  dephosphorylated in  vivo to  the  active  moiety  aprepitant  following intravenous administration of fosaprepitant, the oral aprepitant studies are included in this Marketing Application  including  genotoxicity  studies,  acute  and  repeated  dose  (up  to  1 year  in  duration)  oral toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  and  developmental  and  reproductive  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and rabbits. Based on regulatory guidances (CPMP/ICH/140/95), carcinogenicity studies are not required for indications such as chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) due to the limited, short, and episodic duration of patient treatment. However, carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice as well as  the  chronic  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were  conducted  with  aprepitant  to  support  other  potential chronic therapeutic indications and are presented for full disclosure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pivotal toxicity and safety  pharmacology  studies (i.e., telemetry in dog  and  functional observational  battery  assay  in  rat)  were  performed  in  compliance  with  Good  Laboratory  Practices (GLP), as claimed by the Applicant.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro receptor affinity

The in vitro affinity  of  fosaprepitant  (inhibition  of  the  binding  of  radioactive  natural  ligand substance P) is shown in Table 1. The affinity was in all cases lower than for aprepitant.

Table 1. Inhibition of [ 125 I]-Substance P binding to human, dog, ferret, Guinea pig, rat and gerbil NK 1 receptors by aprepitant and fosaprepitant

| NK 1 Receptor   | Fosaprepitant (IC 50 nM)   | Aprepitant   | Ratio (fosaprepitant/aprepitant)   |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|

In addition, the effect of 1% human serum albumin on receptor affinity for the human NK1 receptor was assayed: the affinity (IC50) decreased 9-fold for fosaprepitant (from 3.3 to 30 nM) and 3-fold for aprepitant  (from  0.1  to  0.3 nM).  The  IC50  of  aprepitant  increased  3-fold  with  human  serum albumin (1%).

## In vitro functional pharmacology

In  functional  pharmacological  assays in  vitro aprepitant  was  devoid  of  agonist  activity  and  had  the characteristics of a potent, competitive human NK1 receptor antagonist. Aprepitant at concentrations up  to  10 µ M did not  stimulate  inositol-1-phosphate  formation  by  CHO  cells  expressing  the  human NK1  receptor.  Aprepitant  consistently  attenuated  the  functional  effects  of  substance  P  (inositol-1phosphate formation) at human NK1 receptors in CHO cells and CHO cells expressing the rat NK1 receptor (CHO-rNK1R).

## In vivo central NK1 receptor antagonist activity

Central  NK1 receptor  antagonist  activity in  vivo was  determined  by  examining  the  ability  of fosaprepitant  and  aprepitant  (intravenously  administered)  to  block  repetitive  foot-tapping  behaviour evoked in gerbils by intracerebral ventricular (ICV) infusion of an NK1  receptor agonist (GR73632, d-Ala [L-Pro 9 , Me-Leu 10 ] substance P) (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1. Dose related inhibition of NK1 agonist GR73632 induced foot-tapping in gerbils by aprepitant

<!-- image -->

Both  fosaprepitant  and  aprepitant  had  a  profile  typical  of  potent  brain  penetrant  NK1 receptor antagonists  with  a  long  central  duration  of  action.  When  dosed  immediately  before  NK1 receptor agonist  challenge,  aprepitant  and  fosaprepitant  produced  a  dose-dependent  and  essentially  complete inhibition of centrally mediated foot tapping (ID50 = 0.32 and 0.95 mg/kg, respectively). Time course studies with aprepitant showed that the central antagonism remained pronounced even when aprepitant was  administered 4 or 24 hours before NK1  agonist challenge (ID50 = 0.04 and 0.33 mg/kg, respectively).

## In vivo receptor occupancy

Receptor  occupancy  in  brain  striatum  was  studied  with  PET  in  anesthetised  rhesus  monkeys  given fosaprepitant  intravenous  bolus  alone  (3  or  5 mg/kg,  plasma  kinetic  at  0,  10,  20,  30  and  every 30 minutes up to 240 minutes post-dose) or bolus (0.13-2.3 mg/kg) followed by a constant infusion (0.031-0.54 mg/kg/h;  plasma  kinetic:  timepoint  0,  15,  30  and  every  30 minutes  up  to  330 minutes during infusion). The latter protocol gave steady state plasma concentration of aprepitant in the range of 0.035-1.3 µg/ml whereas fosaprepitant concentration was found to be negligible. A 50% receptor occupancy occurred at steady state aprepitant of 0.051 µg/ml and &gt; 80% occupancy at &gt; 0.12 µg/ml. An occupancy of ~90% was measured after bolus dosing of 3 or 5 mg/kg.

## In vivo efficacy in emesis model

The anti-emetic activity of the NK1 receptor antagonist fosaprepitant and aprepitant were examined in a  series  of  studies  using  two  experimental  protocols  in  ferrets.  In  the  first  protocol,  the  ability  of fosaprepitant and aprepitant to inhibit the acute emetic effects of cisplatin was assessed over a 4-hour observation period. In the second protocol, the ability of orally dosed aprepitant to inhibit acute and delayed  emesis  induced  by  cisplatin  in  ferrets  was  determined  over  a  72-hour  observation  period following cisplatin administration.

The first studies showed that aprepitant had efficacy against acute cisplatin-induced emesis (ID90 for inhibition  of  retching  or  vomiting  1 mg/kg  IV  fosaprepitant  and  3 mg/kg  P.O.  aprepitant)  and  that anti-emetic effects were enhanced when used in combination with established anti-emetic agents such as dexamethasone or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron.

The anti-emetic action of aprepitant was shown to most likely be due to its activity at central sites since  it  blocked  (3 mg/kg  P.O.)  emesis  produced  by  the  centrally  acting  emetogens  morphine  and apomorphine, which is refractory to treatment by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.

In  a  delayed  emesis  model,  no  emetic  episodes were  observed over the entire 72 hours observation period daily after dosing with aprepitant (2 or 4 mg/kg, started 2 hours before cisplatin treatment). At the  low  dose  of  1 mg/kg/day,  aprepitant  abolished  the  retching  and  vomiting  response  to  cisplatin. Inhibition of delayed cisplatin-induced emesis by aprepitant was not a consequence of inhibiting the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acute phase response, as aprepitant was highly effective even when dosing was initiated after the acute emetic response had occurred.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The following tests have been carried with fosaprepitant:

## In vitro, receptor affinity

Fosaprepitant was tested in a panel of human G-protein coupled receptors (27 different receptors at 1 and 10 µM). Fosaprepitant was &gt; 3000-fold selective for the human NK1 receptor versus the human NK3 receptor, 818-fold selective versus the endothelin A receptor, and &gt; 3000-fold selective versus the other  receptor  tested  (including  the  NK2  receptor).  Fosaprepitant  was  also  shown  to  be  a  weak displacer  of  [3H]-diltiazem  at  the  L-type  calcium  channel  in  rabbit  skeletal  muscle;  fosaprepitant IC50 = 6 µM, aprepitant IC50 = 8 µM.

## In vitro, functional pharmacology

Fosaprepitant  (1  µM)  had  no  effect  on  contractile  response  to  a  selective  NK2-receptor  agonist (N1e 10 NKA) in  vitro in  guinea-pig  trachea.  Fosaprepitant  (1 µM  ± vanadate)  had  no  effect  on depolarisation  of  isolated  guinea-pig  superior  cervical  ganglia  by  a  selective  NK3-receptor  agonist (senktide). Fosaprepitant (1 µM) had no significant effect on calcium entry into depolarised strips of guinea-pig ileum LM/MP. Fosaprepitant (up to 30 µM) were devoid of 5-HT1D-receptor stimulating properties in ring segments of rabbit saphenous vein.

## In vivo

Fosaprepitant (5 mg/kg IV) had no effect on changes in CV parameters in anesthetised dog mediated by  cholinergic  (methacoline,  McNeil-343-A,  peripheral  vagal  stimulation),  adrenergic  (epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenethylsmine), muscarinic (McNeil-343-A), or nicotinic (DMPP) stimuli.

In summary, fosaprepitant showed a high in vitro selectivity for the human target receptor versus the other  tested  receptors.  Fosaprepitant  was  tested  negative  in  the  functional in  vitro and in  vivo tests suggesting no undesirable effects from interference with the non-target receptors investigated.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Fosaprepitant and aprepitant were studied in a range of tests at doses of 1.0 mg/kg intravenously or 5.0 mg/kg orally to assess its potential for effects on cardiovascular/autonomic or respiratory function in  anesthetised  dogs  and  renal  or  gastric  acid  secretion  functional  assays  in  conscious  dogs.  The cardiovascular  effects  of  fosaprepitant  on  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  PR-interval,  QRS-interval, QT-interval or corrected QT interval (QTcf) were also examined using telemetry in conscious dogs using a Latin square design [each dog received drug vehicle (saline) or fosaprepitant 2, 4 or 6 mg/kg IV with 1-week wash out between each dosing]. Fosaprepitant and aprepitant were also examined in conscious mice at 5.0 mg/kg PO to examine any potential for effects on gastrointestinal motility and at 100 mg/kg  PO  to  evaluate  behavioural  and  other  central  nervous  system  effects.  In  these  studies aprepitant did not induce significant effects on cardiovascular, behavioural, central nervous system, respiratory, renal and gastric systems. Importantly, NK1 antagonism with aprepitant did not induce any relevant  effects  on  gastro-intestinal  motility.  The  minor  cardiovascular  effects  (slight  reduction  in mean arterial pressure, of heart rate and negligible or no effects on PR, QRS and QTc intervals), that were observed in the safety pharmacology studies were similar to those described with the vehicle. In three  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  ECG  measurements  did  not  demonstrate  any  effects  on  the cardiovascular  system  in  particular  on  the  QT  interval  at  exposures  up  to  80-fold  over  clinical exposure.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

The  acute  anti-emetic  effects  of  aprepitant  were  studied  in  combination  with  ondansetron  or dexamethasone  and  showed  that  its  anti-emetic  effect  was  increased  in  combination  with  these anti-emetics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiovascular effects of diltiazem with fosaprepitant

The potential for cardiovascular changes due to the interaction of fosaprepitant and the L-type calcium channel antagonist diltiazem was investigated in artificially ventilated barbiturate anesthetised dogs. The cardiovascular effects of diltiazem (0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg IV) were similar in saline pre-treated dogs to those pre-treated with 3 mg/kg IV fosaprepitant. At a higher dose of diltiazem (1 mg/kg IV) more sustained  cardiovascular  effects  were  seen  in  fosaprepitant  pre-treated  animals  consistent  with  30% higher  plasma  diltiazem  levels.  ECG  measurements  showed  changes  consistent  with  AV  block following diltiazem 1 mg/kg IV in all dogs regardless of pre-treatment.

## Effects of aprepitant on tumour growth and interaction with chemotherapy

Tumour growth was unaffected by aprepitant alone. Moreover, cisplatin-induced inhibition of tumour growth was not attenuated in the presence of active (including aprepitant) or inactive NK1 antagonists. None of these agents, alone or in combination with cisplatin were overtly toxic. The studies suggest that the use of aprepitant as an anti-emetic will not interfere with the efficacy or enhance the toxicity of cisplatin, nor will it have anti-tumour effects alone.

## Pharmacokinetics

The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of fosaprepitant and aprepitant were studied in vivo in  rat  and dog. Metabolism studies were also performed in mouse. Brain penetration studies  were  performed  in  rats  and  ferrets.  Toxicokinetic  studies  were  performed  as  part  of  the non-clinical  toxicity  studies  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  monkey.  For  interspecies  comparisons between  non-clinical  animal  models  and  humans,  protein  binding,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of fosaprepitant  and  aprepitant  in  humans  are  presented.  Most  metabolism,  excretion,  and  tissue distribution studies were carried out with [ 14 C]fosaprepitant and [ 3 H]aprepitant or [ 14 C] aprepitant.

## · Methods of analysis

Biological samples from studies with radiolabelled compounds were analysed for total radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Plasma concentration of fosaprepitant and aprepitant were determined by validated LC-MS/MS methods.

## · General

The pharmacokinetic studies following IV administration of fosaprepitant to rats, dogs and humans indicated  that  the  prodrug  converted  rapidly  to  the  pharmacologically  active  entity,  aprepitant (tmax: 0.033 h, plasma concentration undetectable after 15 minutes). Conversion of fosaprepitant into aprepitant in non-clinical species and humans was studied in vitro as well as in vivo .

In vitro studies indicate that, in addition to the liver, the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple human tissues.

In vivo, following IV administration in rats and dogs, fosaprepitant maximum aprepitant concentrations were found at 2-5 minutes after administration. In rats, a near proportional increase in the  AUC  of  aprepitant  with  dose  of  fosaprepitant  was  observed  after  intravenous  doses  of  1  to 8 mg/kg. The systemic exposure to aprepitant in female rats was 2 to 3-fold greater as compared to male rats. Fosaprepitant was detected only during the first hour post-dose. In dogs elimination started to deviate from linearity at doses above 0.5 mg/kg.

## · Distribution

## In vitro plasma protein binding

No  plasma  protein  binding  studies  were  performed  for  fosaprepitant.  Binding  of  [ 3 H]aprepitant  to plasma  proteins  was  determined in  vitro by  an  ultra-filtration  method.  [ 3 H]Aprepitant  was  tightly bound to proteins from rat, dog, and human plasma at concentrations from 0.01 to 10.0 µg/ml. The mean fraction bound was 99.0, 99.3, and 99.7%, respectively. The bound fraction did not vary as a function of aprepitant concentration in any species.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blood-to-plasma ratio

The  blood-to-plasma  ratios  were  determined  for  aprepitant  and  were  0.74,  0.55,  and  0.62  for  rats, dogs, and humans, respectively, following incubations of [ 3 H]aprepitant (0.01 to 10 µg/ml) with fresh, heparinised  whole  blood  from  these  species.  These  results  indicate  that  total  blood  clearance  of aprepitant would be somewhat higher than plasma clearance for all three species.

## Tissue distribution of fosaprepitant and aprepitant

Following  intravenous  administration  of  2 mg/kg  of  [ 14 C]fosaprepitant  in  saline  to  rats,  maximum mean tissue concentrations of radioactivity were observed at 5 minutes through 4 hours post-dose in all studied tissues. The radioactivity concentrations in adrenal gland, liver, kidneys, and thyroid/parathyroid reached a maximum at 5 minutes post-dose. Radioactivity was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier over time. The testes and brain reached maximum radioactivity concentrations at 4 hours post-dose.

Distribution  of  [ 14 C]aprepitant  after  intravenous  administration  (2 mg/kg)  has  been  studied  in  rats. Following drug administration, maximum concentrations of radioactivity were observed at 5 minutes through  4 hours  post-dose  in  all  tissues,  with  concentrations  steadily  declining  after  reaching Cmax values. At 5-minute post-dose, concentrations of radioactivity were highest in the adrenal gland, liver, lung, and heart and lowest in testes and brain. By 4-hour post-dose, radioactivity levels in testes and brain reached a maximum when those in heart and liver declined.

After oral aprepitant administration, aprepitant was present as major component in rat and ferret brain, indicating  that  aprepitant  penetrated  the  blood  brain  barrier  well.  In  rats  a  higher  portion  of radioactivity  was  due  to  metabolites  than  in  ferrets.  After  48-hour  post-dose  aprepitant  was  still present as the major radioactive component in the ferret brain.

Furthermore, one hour after intravenous fosaprepitant administration on gestation Day 20 to pregnant rats  and  rabbits  the  foetal  plasma  concentration  was  about  10-15%  of  the  maternal  plasma concentration.  One  hour  after  intravenous  fosaprepitant  administration  in  lactating  rats,  aprepitant concentrations in plasma and milk were similar.

Overall, tissue distribution studies after intravenous administration of radiolabelled fosaprepitant and aprepitant showed that radiolabelled material originating from both compounds distributed rapidly and extensively to tissues, including the brain. Distribution patterns of fosaprepitant and aprepitant were slightly different at the first few time points, but thereafter it was similar. The differences at the first 1-2 time points could be due to the difference in plasma concentration profile in the first minutes after administration (time needed for conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant). Aprepitant penetrates the blood brain barrier,  crossed  the  placenta  from  the  maternal  compartment  and  was  excreted  into  the milk of lactating rats.

## · Metabolism and excretion

No in vivo metabolism data after administration of fosaprepitant to laboratory animals other than those on the conversion to aprepitant were submitted.

After oral administration of aprepitant, metabolism of aprepitant was qualitatively similar in rats, dogs, mice and humans and elimination of aprepitant was mainly by excretion of metabolites. Data on the human  metabolite  pattern after intravenous administration of fosaprepitant  showed  no  major qualitative  differences  with  the  metabolism  as  found  after  oral  administration  of  aprepitant  to laboratory species.

Aprepitant undergoes N-dealkylation and O-dealkylation resulting in the removal of the triazolone and bis-trifluoromethylphenyl  ether  sidechains,  respectively.  Major  metabolites  present  in  systemic circulation are mainly nonpolar and polar oxidative products derived from both pathways accompanied  by  degradation  of  the  morpholine  ring.  Very  polar,  low  molecular  weight  acids containing the p-fluorophenyl moiety and glucuronides of oxidative metabolites are major metabolites found in excreta (urine, bile, faeces). Although non-polar metabolites of aprepitant are present in rat brain,  intact  [ 14 C]aprepitant  is  the  predominant  radioactive  component  in  ferret  brain  48  hours

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

following oral dosing. The in vitro metabolism of aprepitant is catalysed primarily by CYP3A4, with some involvement of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.

Excretion of radiolabelled material after administration of radiolabelled fosaprepitant in humans and radiolabelled aprepitant in rat and dog occurred via both the urinary and biliary route. There was no evidence of differences between the species.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Aprepitant is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and also an inducer of CYP3A and CYP2C9.

Based  on  the  fact  that  aprepitant  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  only  a  weak  inhibitor  of  human P-glycoprotein in in vitro systems, the potential for aprepitant to cause adverse drug-drug interactions with chemotherapeutic agents through inhibition of P-glycoprotein mediated transport is anticipated to be low.

Polysorbate 80 was shown to be a weak inhibitor of human MDR1 P-glycoprotein-mediated verapamil and  quinidine  transport.  However,  as  the  IC50  values  for  polysorbate  80  for  the  inhibition  of P-glycoprotein  mediated  transport  are  considerably  higher  than  the  anticipated  peak  concentrations after IV dosing of fosaprepitant, it is unlikely that the amounts of polysorbate 80 in the fosaprepitant product will result in significant inhibition of P-glycoprotein in vivo .

## Toxicology

Toxicity studies provided consist of studies with different formulations of fosaprepitant in PS80 and in saline and studies with oral aprepitant.

## · Single dose toxicity

Single dose studies with intravenously administered fosaprepitant showed that the approximate LD50 for  fosaprepitant  injected  intravenously  as  a  1%  solution  in  saline  was  &gt; 200 mg/kg  in  rats and &gt; 500 mg/kg  in  mice.  Surviving  animals  of  both  species  at  both  dose  levels  developed  local necrotic reactions at the injection site (tail vein). Single oral dose up to 500 mg/kg of fosaprepitant or 2000 mg/kg of aprepitant revealed little to no toxicity.

## · Repeat dose toxicity

Intravenous  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  with  fosaprepitant  were  carried  out  in  rats  (16  days  and 5 weeks,  dosed  up  to  10  mg/kg/day),  dogs  (17  days  and  5  weeks,  dosed  up  to  8  mg/kg/day)  and monkeys (5 weeks, dosed up to 10 mg/kg/day). In rats, maximum exposure was only a fraction of the proposed clinical dose in humans. In dogs, maximum exposure exceeded the clinical dose in humans with a factor 2-5, in monkeys the maximum exposure was in the range of 1-2 times human exposure.

In  the  16-day  rat  study  (formulation:  lyophilised  fosaprepitant  containing  EDTA  and  sodium hydroxide, reconstituted in saline at 25 mg/ml), severe injection site damage was observed at doses of 2.5-7.5  mg/kg/day.  At  the  high  dose  both  sexes  showed  numerous  haematological  and  serum biochemical changes (decreased erythrocytes, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, serum albumin,  albumin/globulin  ratio,  increased  reticulocytes,  neutrophils,  monocytes  and  platelets). Enlarged lymph nodes at all dose levels in both sexes were considered secondary to treatment-related changes at injection sites.

No drug related effect was found in a 5-week rat study with doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (fosaprepitant dissolved in saline to concentrations up to 0.4 mg/ml).

In  another  5-week  rat  study  with  doses  up  to  10 mg/kg/day,  with  fosaprepitant  dissolved  at concentrations up to 2 mg/ml in Tween-Sodium Citrate Diluent [= TSCD: containing polysorbate 80 (0.5%), lactose, mannitol, sodium citrate hydrate, citric acid, sodium chloride; ratio of polysorbate 80 to  drug:  2.5:1]  and  diluted  further  in  saline,  no  injection  site  damage  was  found.  In  this  study  at 10 mg/kg/day  dose  slightly  increased  liver  weight  and  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  was  found,  at  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

systemic aprepitant exposure of about 0.1-0.3 times the human exposure. This toxicity was similar to that found in oral aprepitant studies.

In the 17-day dog study using lyophilised fosaprepitant (dissolved in saline at 25 mg/ml), injection site damage, body weight loss and decreased food intake was observed at doses of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day. At 2 mg/kg dose, the number of dogs with changes at the injection sites was increased as compared to the vehicle treated control, but the degree of damage was in the range of the normal effect of venipuncture also seen in controls.

In a 5-week dog study testing doses of 0.5, 2, 8 and 21 mg/kg/day of fosaprepitant (dissolved in saline: 0.156, 0.625, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/ml), the two highest dose groups had to be terminated before the end of the study because of local toxicity. At a dose of 2.0 mg/kg no adverse effect was found. The systemic aprepitant exposure at this dose was in the range 0.6-1.1 times the human exposure. An additional 5-week dog study was done with one dose level of 8 mg/kg/day of fosaprepitant (dissolved in saline: 0.625 mg/ml) but this also resulted in local toxicity.

In the monkey study, fosaprepitant dissolved in TSCD did not cause clear adverse effects up to a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. The systemic aprepitant exposure at this dose level was in the range 1.2-2.0 times the human exposure.

In addition, a series of oral repeated dose toxicity studies with aprepitant was submitted. The studies were carried out in rats (16 days and 5, 14 and 27 weeks, dosed up to 2000 mg/kg/day), mice (5 and 14 weeks,  dosed  up  to  2000  mg/kg)  and  dogs  (5,  14  and  39  weeks,  dosed  up  to  1500 mg/kg/day). Maximal exposure multiples achieved were 0.38 and 1.3 in male and female rats respectively, 1.4 and 2.5 in male and female mice, and 40 and 48 in male and female dogs respectively. In monkeys only an intravenous toxicity study was performed with aprepitant (17 days, dosed up to 0.240 mg/kg/day). In rats,  there  was hypertrophy in the liver and hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the thyroid, presumably caused by microsomal enzyme induction. Serum cholesterol was slightly increased in both sexes and serum triglycerides were slightly decreased in males. Effects on the morphology of erythrocytes were seen at the end of the chronic toxicity study. The salient toxicity findings in the mouse studies were hepatocellular hypertrophy, increase of cholesterol and triglycerides, kidney hydropic tubular degeneration,  and  decrease  of  potassium.  In  dogs,  all  observed  effects  occurred  at  exposures  high above human exposure. Effects seen at dosages ≥ 50 mg/kg/day were a decreased food consumption and  body  weight  loss,  atrophy  in  the  prostate  and  signs  of  degeneration  in  the  testis  and  increased cholesterol levels. In one study at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day, ovary weight was decreased, without an effect on histopathology.  The  safety  margin  for  these  effects  was  8.7  in  males  and  9.3  in  females.  Thymus atrophy  was  found  in  one  study,  at  dosages ≥ 250 mg/kg/day.  No  effects  were  seen  in  monkeys. However, there was only one intravenous monkey study, in which the maximum dose was very low. Intravenous rat and monkey studies showed no drug related local toxicity, however, only intravenous doses up to 0.240 mg/kg were tested.

## · Genotoxicity

Fosaprepitant and aprepitant was found neither genotoxic nor mutagenic based on a series of standard in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity assays (gene mutation in bacteria, in mammalian cells, DNA strand breakage, in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberrations).

## · Carcinogenicity

No studies were conducted with fosaprepitant. Based on regulatory guidances (CPMP/ICH/140/95), carcinogenicity  studies  are  not  required  for  indications  such  as  chemotherapy  induced  nausea  and vomiting (CINV) due to the limited, short, and episodic duration of patient treatment.

## · Reproduction toxicity

Effects of intravenous doses of fosaprepitant on male and female fertility, embryofoetal development, and periand post-natal development  were  investigated in rats and effects  on  embryofoetal development in rabbits at doses up to 4 mg/kg/day of fosaprepitant (except for male fertility in rats: up to 10 mg/kg/day). No adverse effects were found at the tested doses (which were lower than clinical dose).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  similar  series  of  reproduction  toxicity  studies  was  done  with  orally  administered  aprepitant.  No evidence of teratogenicity was seen in rats and rabbits at doses resulting in exposures of 1.1 (rat) and 0.9 (rabbit) times the expected human exposure. In rabbits, post-implantation loss and the number of resorptions  per  litter  were  slightly  increased  at  an  exposure  slightly  above  the  expected  human exposure. Signs of maternal toxicity included a small increase in liver weight in rats and increased liver enzymes, decreased triglycerides, decreased food consumption and decreased body weight in rabbits. In rabbits, maternal toxicity was observed at exposures slightly above human exposure (NOEL 5 mg/kg/day). Post-natal mortality of rat pups in a peri- and post-natal development study was slightly  increased  at  an  exposure  marginally  above  the  expected  human  exposure.  This  was predominantly due to mortality on post-natal Days 1-3.

## · Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetics  were  assayed  in  all  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies.  The  exposure  levels  (mean  plasma fosaprepitant  and  aprepitant)  in  the  highest  dosed  animals  are  shown  in  the  Table  2  (the  following figures  for  human  exposure  were  used:  fosaprepitant  Cmax = 5.64  µg/ml,  AUC = 1.48  µg  x  hr/ml; aprepitant Cmax = 2.6 µg/ml, AUC = 30 µg x hr/ml).

## · Local tolerance

A series of local tolerance studies in rats confirmed the above-mentioned high local toxicity of locally IV infused fosaprepitant, dependent on concentration and composition of the infused solution. None of the tested formulations was the same as the commercial formulation proposed for clinical use.

Significant local reactions were observed from Day 4 at the low dose in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day) and dogs (2 mg/kg/day)  receiving  fosaprepitant  (at  25 mg/ml)  as  a  bolus.  The  first  clinical  signs  of  local reactions  were  swelling,  cutaneous  discoloration,  induration  and  desquamation.  Various  steps  were taken in order to investigate the possibility to administer the drug more safely (addition of EDTA or Tween 80 in the infusion  solution,  using  different  injection  sites,  solution  dilution,  slower  infusion rates and/or post-dose catheter flush).

The  dogs  tolerated  a  dose  of  2 mg/kg  when  the  drug  was  diluted  40 folds  (25 → 0.625  mg/ml)  and given  over  ~30-60  seconds,  but  with  extensive  local  reactions  occurred  after  some  days  at  higher dosing.  In  rat,  no  local  reactions  were  reported  at  any  dose  level  tested:  up  to  4 mg/kg  (without Tween 80) diluted 62.5 folds (25 → 0.4 mg/ml) given over ~15-30 seconds; or up to 10 mg/kg (with Tween 80 0.5%) diluted 12.5 folds (25 → 2 mg/ml) given over ~15-30 seconds. In monkey, no local reactions  were  reported  up  to  10 mg/kg  (2 mg/ml  given  over  ~1-1.5 minutes,  with  Tween 80). Post-dose catheter flush was performed in all studies. Fosaprepitant formulated with Tween 80 was shown  to  be  well  tolerated  at  the  infusion  site  up  to  4.3-fold  clinical  dose,  given  as  a  2-fold concentrated  infusion  solution  and  ~10-15 times  (monkey)  or  ~30-60 times  (rat)  faster  than  that proposed clinically for IVEMEND.

## · Other toxicity studies

No specific non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted to assess antigenicity (no specific reason for such investigation) and immunotoxicity (no evidence in multiple dose studies in rats).

No  non-clinical dependence studies were conducted to support a CINV  indication because fosaprepitant will be administered as a single dose and will not be used for chronic treatment.

No  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  metabolites  because  new  metabolites  were identified  in  the  non-clinical  development  (including in  vitro assays  with  subcellular  fractions  from animal liver [HPLC  analysis] and pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic analysis of in vivo samples [LC-MS/MS analysis]) and relevant clinical studies.

No special studies  on  impurities  have  been  performed  because  each  of  the  specified  impurities  has been  qualified  by  virtue  of  having  been  presented  in  batches  evaluated  in  the  non-clinical  toxicity studies and/or by levels allowable under ICH Guidelines for Impurities in New Drug Substances.

A series of non-GLP haemolysis assays was done in rat, dog, monkey and human washed red blood cells  and  whole  blood.  Haemolysis  in  washed  red  blood  cells  was  found  with  some  of  the  tested formulations  in  all  tested  species,  at  lower  concentrations  and  more  often  in  rats  than  in  the  other species.  In  whole  blood  no  haemolysis  was  observed  in  monkey  and  human  blood,  but  only concentrations up to 1 mg/ml were tested. With Tween  80, haemolysis occurred at higher concentrations or not at all. This haemolytic effect and the local toxicity of fosaprepitant are assumed to be due to the amphiphilic character of the compound. Polysorbate 80 in the formulation is assumed to protect against this effect.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In the environmental risk evaluation, the PEC value calculated for the EU is below 0.01 µg/l.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

In  terms  of  pharmacodynamics,  no  study  was  designed  to  investigate  the  potential  contribution  of fosaprepitant to the overall NK1 receptor inhibitory potency. Since almost a complete in vivo blockade of  the  target  receptor  (brain  striatum)  is  expected  to  have  been  achieved  in  the  animals  studies  by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aprepitant/fosaprepitant,  a  study  to  investigate  the  role  of  fosaprepitant  potential  contribution  is considered not necessary but a mention has been provided in the SPC.

The performed studies on safety pharmacology revealed no concern, the highest IV doses tested were about  2-4  fold  of  the  clinical  dose.  The  systemic  exposure  to  fospaprepitant  and  aprepitant  was however  relatively  low  in  the  dogs  of  the  telemetry-study  (single  IV  dose  up  to  6  mg/kg).  The potential in vitro effect of fosaprepitant or aprepitant on hERG  was  not  studied  (in vitro electrophysiology).  No  such  data  are  requested  for  the  present  time  being  while  waiting  for  the assessment of the requested final report of the clinical QTc study that has recently been undertaken. Only preliminary study data was submitted in the application. A request for additional non-clinical data may later on be triggered according to ICH S7B if the clinical data are considered not sufficient.

The local reactions appeared clinically after some days or at the same day in highly dosed animals (14-fold  the  clinical  dose).  Several  animals  had  to  be  unscheduled  sacrificed  due  to  unacceptable injection  site  reactions.  Different  ways  to  overcome  the  low  local  tolerability  of  fosaprepitant  were tested:  adding  compounds  to  the  solution  composition  and/or  change  the  infusion  dosage  regimen. Tween 80 was found to improve the local tolerability of fosaprepitant in local tolerance and to reduce the haemolytic property of fosaprepitant in  vitro .  Injection  site  reactions (induration and pain) were common adverse  events  in  the  clinical  trials  with  IVEMEND  and  the  potential  risk  for  significant injection  site  reactions  from  accidentally  miss-injected  drug  (e.g.  paravenous,  intramuscular  and subcutaneous) has not been investigated in animals. A non clinical study investigating local tolerance at injection sites is requested as follow-up measure. In meantime, a warning is proposed to be included in the SPC section 4.4 as a precautionary measure. This may be revised dependent on the outcome of the animal study.

For  this  application,  even  if  the  maximum  achievable  exposure  was  not  fully  explored  in  the low-exposed  rats  and  monkeys,  no  further  toxicity  study  is  required  taken  into  account  that substitution  with  IVEMEND  may  be  considered  valuable  for  some  of  the  patients  suffering  from severe disease and treated with a highly toxic compound as cisplatin. The limited value of the repeated dose toxicity studies regarding fosaprepitant exposure (AUC), as well as the too high concentration of Tween 80 used in the infusion solution, should be given in the SPC.

No  effect on fertility was  detected with fosaprepitant. The  reproduction toxicity profile of fosaprepitant and aprepitant was evaluated in animals at low exposure, and short duration. No attempts to increase the degree of exposure and the duration of exposure were explored. This circumstance is reflected in the proposed SPC section 4.6. No teratogenicity was evident in the limited studies with fosaprepitant. The approved EMEND should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, the same recommendation has been proposed for IVEMEND.

## GCP

The  clinical  overview  stated  that  all  studies  were  conducted  following  appropriate  Good  Clinical Practice  guidelines  and  considerations  for  the  ethical  treatment  of  human  subjects.  A  statement  on Clinical Requirements has been provided stating that clinical studies conducted outside EU meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Following administration of a single dose of fosaprepitant 115 mg as a 15-minute infusion to healthy volunteers fosaprepitant is rapidly converted into aprepitant. Fosaprepitant AUC was 1.5 ± 0.3 µg.h/ml and Cmax (obtained at the end of infusion of fosaprepitant) was 5.6 ± 1.5 µg/ml and aprepitant AUC was  32  ±  14  µg.h/ml  and  Cmax  (also  obtained  at  the  end  of  infusion  of  fosaprepitant)  was 3.3 ± 1.2 µg/ml. Fosaprepitant levels were below detection limit 30 minutes after the end of infusion (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Study P012L1: Mean plasma concentration of fosaprepitant and aprepitant following a 15-minute infusion of 115-mg fosaprepitant

<!-- image -->

The mean aprepitant plasma concentration from 4 hours after dosing (including the concentration at 24 hours post-dose) were similar between the 125 mg oral aprepitant dose and the 115 mg intravenous aprepitant dose (Figure 4 on page 27).

## · Distribution

Fosaprepitant volume of distribution was estimated to be 5 l. However, the very rapid disappearance of  fosaprepitant  from  plasma  possibly  reflects  the  distribution  to  tissues,  where  fosaprepitant  is hydrolysed to aprepitant. Hence, the estimated volume of distribution is most likely underestimated.

Aprepitant has a high protein binding, i.e., 97-98%. The volume of distribution of aprepitant is ~66 l.

## · Elimination

Fosaprepitant clearance and half-life were estimated to 1.3 l/min and 2.3 min, respectively.

Following intravenous administration of 100 mg 14 C-labelled fosaprepitant, approximately 57% of the total radioactivity is excreted in the urine and 45% in faeces. No unchanged fosaprepitant or aprepitant is excreted in urine.

Fosaprepitant is eliminated by hydrolysis to aprepitant. Fosaprepitant may be converted to aprepitant efficiently in multiple human tissues. The data provided suggest rapid conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant  in  human  liver  preparations,  but  very  slow  conversion  in  human  blood.  Data  from  S9 preparations from other human tissues suggested similar rate and extent of conversion in liver, kidney and ileum (almost complete conversion within 60 minutes) with slightly slower/lower conversion in lung.  The  exact  identity  of  the  enzyme(s)  involved  is  unknown  but  is  likely  related  to  the phosphoramidase  and/or  the  phosphatase  activities  observed  in  a  variety  of  human  tissues.  Since conversion of the prodrug to aprepitant involves the hydrolysis of the phosphoramide moiety and can occur in the absence of NADPH, conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant is not thought to involve the CYP family of enzymes and is unlikely to differ significantly in patient subpopulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Aprepitant  is  eliminated  by  metabolism  (oxidation)  to  a  large  number  of  metabolites.  Twelve metabolites  of  aprepitant  have  been  identified  following  IV  administration  of 14 C-fosaprepitant. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism. Glucoronidation and CYP2C19 may also be  involved  to  some  extent.  Aprepitant  constitutes  about  20%  of  the  radioactivity  in  plasma  over 72 hours and is the largest component in plasma during the first 48 hours.

The data do not indicate any other metabolites formed after administration of fosaprepitant than those formed  after  administration  of  aprepitant.  All  of  the  metabolites  have  lower  or  no  NK1  receptor affinity compared with aprepitant and none of the metabolites are likely to contribute significantly to the activity.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Data suggest linear pharmacokinetics of fosaprepitant. Aprepitant pharmacokinetics is non-linear after administration of fosaprepitant with a decreased clearance with increased dose consistent with nonlinear PK observed for oral administration of aprepitant.

Time dependency has not been investigated for the final fosaprepitant formulation. No accumulation is to be expected since it is only a single dose treatment and due to the rapid conversion to aprepitant.

## · Special populations

Since fosaprepitant is metabolised in various extrahepatic tissues hepatic insufficiency is not expected to  alter  the  conversion  of  fosaprepitant  to  aprepitant.  Patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  have similar  aprepitant  pharmacokinetics  as  healthy  volunteers.  Conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant could not be drawn from the data available. Severe hepatic impairment has not been studied.

No new data were provided for this application for fosaprepitant, but based on oral aprepitant data, age, gender, weight, race and renal function have no clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics  of  aprepitant.  Aprepitant  is  not  extracted  during  haemodialysis.  There  are  no pharmacokinetic data in children.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Because of the rapid conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant, data with regard to interactions for oral aprepitant are also deemed applicable for fosaprepitant. Aprepitant has a complex interaction profile: it is  a  substrate  and  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and  an  inducer  of  CYP3A4,  CYP2C9 and potentially other enzymes.

Two studies were conducted investigating drug-drug interactions with fosaprepitant:

- o  Fosaprepitant administered as a single, IV dose of 100 mg has no clinically meaningful effect on the  pharmacokinetics of midazolam co-administered as a single oral dose of 2-mg (increase in midazolam AUC approximately 1.6-fold). This compares to the 2.3 fold increase in midazolam AUC by 125-mg oral aprepitant.
- o  In a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, 3-period fixed sequence study, the interaction  between  fosaprepitant  and  diltiazem  was  investigated  in  10 hypertensive  patients. Both aprepitant and diltiazem exposures (AUC) after concomitant administration of fosaprepitant with diltiazem were increased by 40-45%. This increase is consistent with moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 both by aprepitant and diltiazem. The effect on diltiazem may be clinically significant.

Specific recommendation for dose reduction of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone is given based on the interaction with oral aprepitant 125 mg. Fosaprepitant has a lower effect on CYP3A4. With the recommended  dose reduction of 50%  of dexamethasone in combination with fosaprepitant, dexamethasone  AUC is  expected  to  be  about  20%  lower  than  when  dexamethasone  is  given  at  its usual dose without fosaprepitant/aprepitant. However, no effect on efficacy is expected due to a flat dose response curve for IV dexamethasone at this dose level.

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No clinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted using human biomaterials.

- Bioequivalence of fosaprepitant and aprepitant

Bioequivalence of fosaprepitant and aprepitant was investigated in the Part V of a multiple-step study ( Study P012L1 ) where previous steps led to dose and formulation selection. This Part V was an openlabel,  randomised,  3-period,  crossover  study  in  75  healthy  volunteers  using  the  final  market formulation,  i.e., containing  0.05%  PS80  (administered  as  a  15-minute  constant  rate  infusion  with fosaprepitant at 1 mg/ml). The randomised treatment sequences were:

- 1) 100-mg intravenous fosaprepitant
- 2) 115-mg intravenous fosaprepitant
- 3) 125-mg oral aprepitant

There  was  a  14-day  washout  interval  between  treatment  periods.  Blood  samples  (n = 18)  were collected for 72 hours following study drug administration for determination of plasma concentrations of aprepitant. Additional blood samples (n = 6) were collected for 45 minutes after administration of fosaprepitant for determination of plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant.

In  the  primary  analysis,  aprepitant  AUC  values  following  intravenous  fosaprepitant  doses  were adjusted  based  on  the  actual  dose  of  fosaprepitant  intravenously  administered  (exact  volume  of infusate  administered  multiplied  by  concentration  of  infusate).  This  dose-adjusted  analysis  was considered  the  primary  analysis  in  this  study  to  minimise  the  impact  of  the  dosage  administration variability  on  the  assessment  of  bioequivalence.  A  supplemental  analysis  was  completed  using nominal doses (unadjusted). Secondary pharmacokinetic variables were Cmax, C24h, tmax, and t1/2.

Pharmacokinetic parameters for the 100- and 115-mg dose comparison from this part of the study are displayed in Table 4. Mean aprepitant concentrations are plotted over time in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Study P012L1: Mean plasma concentration profiles of aprepitant following administration of 125-mg aprepitant, 100- and 115-mg fosaprepitant

<!-- image -->

The 115-mg rather than the 100-mg dose of fosaprepitant was determined to be more comparable to 125-mg aprepitant based on:

- o  C24hr  concentration  after  the  115-mg  fosaprepitant  dose  was  more  similar  to  the  oral  125-mg aprepitant dose than the 100-mg fosaprepitant dose
- o  the  dose-adjusted  analysis  showed  that  both  100-  and  115-mg  fosaprepitant  were  AUC bioequivalent to 125-mg aprepitant but 90% CI of Geometric Mean Ratio (IV/Oral) of unadjusted AUC  values  of  100-mg  fosaprepitant  fell  out  of  the  bioequivalence  bounds  of  [0.80,  1.25]. Furthermore, the bioequivalence of 115-mg fosaprepitant to 125-mg aprepitant is confirmed in using the 95% CI of Geometric Mean Ratio (IV/Oral) of unadjusted AUC values
- o  the  safety  of  the  100-  and  115-mg  fosaprepitant  was  comparable.  A  total  of  six  infusion  site reactions were recorded for the 66 subjects who received the 115-mg dose of fosaprepitant versus eight infusion site reactions in the 67 subjects who received the 100-mg dose of fosaprepitant.

Plasma  concentrations  were  somewhat  higher  for  4  hours  post-dose  for  the  115-mg  intravenous fosaprepitant dose compared to the 125-mg oral aprepitant dose but similar thereafter.

In conclusion, the data support the 115-mg intravenous fosaprepitant as the strength resulting in the most comparable exposure to aprepitant, as compared to 125-mg oral aprepitant.

## Pharmacodynamics

In non-clinical studies, it has been shown that aprepitant inhibits emesis elicited by centrally acting emetogens. In addition, substance P release in the periphery can elicit an inflammatory response, a response that could be attenuated by an NK1 receptor-blocking agent. This might be of relevance as mucosal inflammation is assumed to be of importance for delayed emesis. The effect of aprepitant also appears to be more pronounced with respect to vomiting than nausea. Inhibition of NK1 receptors in vagal motor neurons might therefore also be of relevance as this may prevent fundic relaxation, an early event related to vomiting.

The  relationship  between  plasma  concentration  and  NK1  receptor  occupancy  in  the  CNS  has  been evaluated  in  PET  studies.  Aprepitant  plasma  concentrations  of  ~10 ng/ml  and  ~100 ng/ml  produce NK1 receptor occupancies of ~50% and ~90%, respectively. The aprepitant CINV regimen (125 mg on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Day 1; 80 mg on Days 2 and 3) produces mean trough plasma aprepitant concentrations &gt; 500 ng/ml, which would be expected to result in &gt; 95% brain NK1 receptor occupancy (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Striatal NK1 receptor occupancy and ranges of mean trough plasma concentrations of aprepitant

<!-- image -->

The shaded bars represent the range of the mean trough plasma concentrations of aprepitant achieved on each of Days 1 through 5 with aprepitant 375/250 mg, 125/80 mg, and 40/25 mg regimens in healthy volunteers.

In  addition  to  equivalent  in  terms  of  aprepitant  AUC,  115-mg  fosaprepitant  (fosaprepitant  PS80 0.05%) produced a C24hr of 504 ng/ml. Based on Figure 3, this trough concentration would result in similar  95%  brain  NK1  receptor  occupancy.  Provided  that  there  is  no  lag  phase,  e.g.,  due  to  the blood/brain  barrier,  these  data  suggest  very  high  receptor  occupancy  during  the  entire  treatment period.

## Clinical efficacy

Since  no  confirmatory  clinical  efficacy  studies  were  conducted  with  fosaprepitant,  this  section  will summarise  previously submitted efficacy data obtained with aprepitant  for  HEC  and  MEC, highlighting efficacy  data  using  an  IV  formulation  different  from  that  intended  to  be  marketed  and similar doses of fosaprepitant and aprepitant at doses higher than the proposed marketed regimen.

## · Main study(ies)

The clinical programme for aprepitant included two pivotal Phase III studies with similar design. The primary objective was to demonstrate that the add-on of aprepitant to standard therapy (i.e., combination  of  ondansetron  and  dexamethasone)  is  superior  to  standard  therapy  alone  for prevention of CINV associated with high-dose cisplatin. Both studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials which enrolled a total of 1094 patients receiving chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≥ 70 mg/m 2 .  The study treatment was aprepitant 125 mg orally on  Day 1  plus  ondansetron  32 mg  intravenously  administered  on  Day 1  plus  dexamethasone  12 mg orally on Day 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4 in the experimental arm and placebo plus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1 and 8 mg orally once daily on Days 2 to 4), in the control arm.

Patients were allowed to take rescue therapy for relief of established nausea and/or vomiting. Patients who had taken rescue medication were classified as treatment failures in the primary analysis. Rescue medications  were  recorded  during  Cycle  1  only.  Assessments  of  efficacy  regarding  nausea,  emetic episodes and use of rescue medication were recorded by the patient in a diary, from the initiation of cisplatin  infusion  until  the  morning  of  Day  6.  Both  studies  had  two  components,  the  initial chemotherapy cycle and an optional multiple-cycle extension, focusing on the initial  chemotherapy cycle.

The primary efficacy evaluation was based on evaluation of a composite measure: complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy) over a 120-hour time period following the initiation of cisplatin. Quality of life was measured by patient-reported impact of CINV on daily life using the FLIE (Functional Living Index-Emesis) questionnaire completed on Day 6, i.e. 5 days after receiving chemotherapy. In secondary analyses, the overall phase (0-120 hours) was divided into an acute phase (0-24 hours) and a delayed phase (25-120 hours).

The results were evaluated for each individual study and for the two studies combined. A summary of the key study results from the combined analysis is shown in Table 5.

*  The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and concomitant chemotherapy, which were included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models.

The  proportion  of  patients  with  an  overall  complete  response  (no  emesis  and  no  use  of  rescue medication due to nausea) during the initial chemotherapy cycle (primary endpoint) was statistically significantly higher in the aprepitant group compared to the placebo group in both studies (p &lt; 0.001). Statistically significant differences in efficacy were also observed in each individual study.

The estimated time to first emesis in the combined analysis is depicted by the Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 6.

In both studies, the Kaplan-Meier curves start to diverge at about 16 hours showing clear effects as add-on to standard therapy as regards delayed emesis.

As  regards  emesis,  the  efficacy  of  aprepitant  as  add-on  to  standard  therapy  has  been  convincingly demonstrated. In the pooled analysis, a statistically significant effect has also been shown as regards delayed nausea. In the individual studies, the effect on 'no significant nausea' defined as &lt; 25 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), however, was borderline (Table 6).

In these 2 studies ( Studies P052 and P054) , 851 patients continued into the multiple-cycle extension for up to 5 additional cycles of chemotherapy. The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was maintained during all cycles.

In one randomised, double-blind study ( Study P071 ) in a total of 866 patients (864 females, 2 males) receiving  chemotherapy  that  included  cyclophosphamide  750-1500 mg/m 2 or  cyclophosphamide 500-1500 mg/m 2 and doxorubicin (&lt; 60 mg/m 2 ) or epirubicin (&lt; 100 mg/m 2 ), 125 mg aprepitant orally on  Day 1  plus  ondansetron  32 mg  intravenously  administered  on  Day 1  plus  dexamethasone  12 mg orally  on  Day 1  and  8 mg  orally  twice  daily  on  Days 2  to  4  was  compared  with  standard  therapy (placebo  plus  ondansetron  8 mg  orally  (twice  on  Day 1  and  every  12  hours  on  Days  2  and  3)  plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1).

Efficacy was based on evaluation of the composite measure: complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy) primarily during Cycle 1.

## · Supportive study(ies)

Study P004L1 was a clinical Phase IIa study comparing a single 60-or 100-mg dose of fosaprepitant (mannitol  containing  formulation,  not  for  marketing  authorisation)  with  a  single  32-mg  dose  of ondansetron administered prior to cisplatin 50-100 mg/m 2 . In this proof-of-concept study, fosaprepitant was effective in the prevention of both acute and/or delayed CINV (Table 8).

## Table 8. Study P004L1: Complete responders during mono-therapy as compared to single dose ondansetron

| Acute (Day 1)         | 36.7%                                 | 52.2%                       |
| Delayed (Days 2 to 7) | 72.4%                                 | 30.4%                       |

* Based on an interim assessment of the first 9 patients at the 60-mg dose of fosaprepitant, then this dose was increased to 100 mg

Despite  a  lower  response  for  acute  CINV  compared  with  a  5-HT3  antagonist,  a  single  dose  of fosaprepitant  given  on  Day  1  showed  efficacy  in  the  delayed  phase  measured  out  to  Day 7 post-chemotherapy.

Study P007L1 was performed to assess:

- -the safety and tolerability of fosaprepitant (mannitol containing, not for marketing authorisation) and aprepitant for the prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced emesis
- -the efficacy of fosaprepitant plus dexamethasone in the acute phase (first 24 hours) of cisplatininduced emesis
- -whether a single  dose  of  fosaprepitant  plus  dexamethasone  followed  by  4 days  of  aprepitant  or placebo will prevent delayed emesis (Days 2 to 5 post-cisplatin infusion) and
- -whether a single  dose  of  fosaprepitant  plus  dexamethasone  followed  by  4 days  of  aprepitant  or placebo will reduce nausea following cisplatin (Days 1 to 5 post-cisplatin infusion).

This randomised, double-blind, active-controlled (ondansetron plus dexamethasone) study in 177 cisplatin-naïve  patients  with  various  cancer  type  evaluated  the  prevention  of  both  acute  (0  to 24 hours) and delayed (Days 2 to 5) emesis after cisplatin IV ( ≥ 70 mg/m 2 ).

All patients received dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously before cisplatin. In addition, patients were randomised to 1 of 3 groups to receive:

| Group A   | n = 62   | fosaprepitant 100 mg intravenously prior to cisplatin and aprepitant 300 mg once daily on Days 2 to 5   |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Group B   | n = 57   | fosaprepitant 100 mg intravenously prior to cisplatin and placebo once daily on Days 2 to 5             |
| Group C   | n = 58   | ondansetron 32 mg intravenously prior to cisplatin and placebo once daily on Days 2 to 5                |

Rescue therapy was permitted on an as-needed basis at any time for all patients but was not to be given  prophylactically.  Randomisation  was  stratified  both  for  gender  and  for  moderate  to  highly emetogenic chemotherapy given in addition to cisplatin.

Episodes of vomiting or retching (date, time and number of episodes) were recorded by the patients on diary cards. An emetic episode was defined as a single vomit or retch or any number of continuous vomits  or  retches;  distinct  episodes  were  separated  by  at  least  1  minute.  Emetic  episodes  were recorded daily in a patient diary. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients with no  emesis  (i.e.,  no  emetic  episodes)  in  the  acute  phase  (0  to  24  hours  post-initiation  of  cisplatin infusion). Emetic episodes in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours post-initiation of cisplatin infusion) and the use of rescue medication in both periods were also evaluated. In addition, the proportion of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  (complete  responders)  with  no  emesis  and  no  rescue  therapy  during  the  acute  and  delayed phases was a post-hoc exploratory efficacy parameter.

Patient self assessment of nausea was assessed every 24 hours in the patient diary using a 100-mm horizontal  VAS.  Global  satisfaction  with  the  anti-emetic  treatment  was  assessed  by  the  patient  the morning of Day 2 and the morning of Day 6 post-cisplatin using a 100-mm VAS.

During the acute phase, the treatment providing the best control of emesis was the standard therapy (ondansetron plus dexamethasone - Group C). Table 9 provides the results of the primary analysis.

* Significantly different from group C

The  difference  between  the  combined  group  (Groups  A  and  B)  and  Group  C  was  -36.6%,  with  a 90% CI  about  this  difference  of  -49.6  to  -24.2%.  Furthermore,  an  additional  exploratory  analysis showed  that  the  proportion  of  patients  without  emesis  and  no  use  of  rescue  therapy  in  Group  C (82.8%) was higher than either Group A (45.0%), Group B (35.1%), or the combined group (Groups A and B) (40.2%; p &lt; 0.001 for Group C vs. the combined groups).

During the delayed phase, the best control of emesis was achieved in those patients who received an NK1-receptor antagonist, administered either at Days 1-5 or only at Day 1 (Table 10).

| 3 or more emetic episodes  | 15.3%             | 21.4%             | 41.4%             |

* p-value &lt; 0.001

The between-treatment difference was (24.7%) with 95% CI of 5.9 to 43.6% for Groups A and C and 19.3% with 95% CI of 0.4 to 38.8% for Groups B and C. An exploratory analysis showed a similar advantage in the proportion of patients without emesis and no use of rescue therapy in the delayed phase  (59.3,  44.6,  and  37.9%  in  Groups  A,  B,  and  C,  respectively;  Groups  A versus C  were significantly different, p &lt; 0.05).

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  pharmacokinetics  of  fosaprepitant  has  been  adequately  evaluated.  Upon  I.V.  infusion  over 15 minutes, fosaprepitant is rapidly converted in aprepitant. Bioequivalence with respect to aprepitant AUC between 115-mg fosaprepitant and 125-mg aprepitant has been demonstrated.

No formal pharmacodynamic studies on fosaprepitant were submitted however the pharmacodynamic properties  of  the  active  metabolite  aprepitant  were  appropriately  evaluated.  The  aprepitant  studies showed  that  there  is  a  relation  between  plasma  concentration  of  aprepitant  and  the  NK1-receptor occupancies in the brain and a beneficial treatment effect on delayed emesis.

No confirmatory study was conducted with fosaprepitant and is considered adequate in view of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for fosaprepitant and aprepitant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical safety

Clinical safety profile of fosaprepitant is supported by data collected during clinical studies performed with  fosaprepitant  and  with  high  dose  of  oral  aprepitant  since  fosaprepitant  is  rapidly  converted  in aprepitant and produces plasma concentration similar to high dose of oral aprepitant.

## Safety of fosaprepitant

## · Patient exposure

All together 696 individuals have been exposed to fosaprepitant IV of whom 123 received the market formulation and 76 individuals to a dose of 115 mg or higher.

The  exposure  to  fosaprepitant  by  formulation  is  outlined  in  Table 11  and  while  Table 12  provides exposure by dose.

Subjects/patients are counted once for each dose received

All subjects/patients counted in the 'Market formulation' row are also counted in 'All formulations\" row

## · Adverse events

This section will focus on tolerability data of the market formulation in the population in which it was tested (healthy subjects) and tolerability data in the patient population (CINV) where it is intended for use (using a previous formulation). It must be emphasised that the exposure to fosaprepitant itself is brief  (undetectable  by  30  minutes),  although  fosaprepitant  plasma  levels  average  5800 ng/ml  at  the end of a 15-minute infusion with a 115-mg dose of the market formulation.

## Intravenous fosaprepitant including local tolerability

Fosaprepitant  has  been  generally  well  tolerated  with  a  low  incidence  of  adverse  events,  including adverse events that occur at the infusion site. The incidence of adverse events among healthy subjects receiving  the  market  formulation  of  fosaprepitant  is  in  Table 13;  of  note,  subjects  who  received aprepitant 125 mg did not receive an intravenous placebo administration.

The possibility of reactions at the site of infusion of the market formulation was carefully assessed because  previous  fosaprepitant  formulations  have  been  associated  with  local  reactions,  which  were dose,  infusion  rate,  and  formulation  dependent.  Although  the  market  formulation  contains  the solubilising agent PS80 which has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions. The concentration of  PS80  in  the  market  formulation  is  significantly  lower  (0.05%)  than  in  an  earlier  fosaprepitant formulation (0.25%) and also lower than in other marketed products such as the taxane chemotherapy agents. The lower PS80 concentration in the fosaprepitant formulation for market should have a low likelihood  of  hypersensitivity  reactions.  In  an  earlier  study,  using  the  fosaprepitant  PS80  0.25% formulation, 1 of 35 subjects had a hypersensitivity reaction. Of note, no hypersensitivity reactions were  noted  in  123  subjects  who  were  administered  the  market  formulation  of  fosaprepitant.  The likelihood of hypersensitivity reactions is further diminished by the co-administration with dexamethasone as part of the CINV regimen.

## Safety experience in CINV patients (intravenous fosaprepitant mannitol)

In  two  clinical  CINV  studies,  a  total  of  140  patients  received  fosaprepitant  mannitol  100 mg;  an additional  9  patients  received  60 mg  (administered  1  hour  prior  to  initiation  of  cisplatin-based).  In these studies, fosaprepitant was generally well tolerated compared with ondansetron with or without the use of other anti-emetic agents. Additionally, infusion site intolerability was reported infrequently.

## Safety of high dose oral aprepitant

Aprepitant plasma exposure at or in excess of that provided by the market formulation of fosaprepitant has  occurred  in  patients  in  the  Phase  III  depression  programme  (i.e.  the  programme  evaluating aprepitant  as  an  anti-depressant),  patients  at  risk  for  CINV  in  the  Phase  II  programme  and  healthy young subjects in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study As illustrated in Figure 8, a single oral dose of  the  aprepitant  375-mg  capsule  provides  a  plasma  level  at  Cmax  greater  than  the  aprepitant  C max which occurs with single IV dose fosaprepitant. Figure 6 also shows how the aprepitant trough plasma

levels associated with repeat dosing of oral aprepitant 375 mg and 250 mg exceed the level associated with a single IV dose of fosaprepitant.

Oral aprepitant 250 or 375 mg was administered daily for 8 weeks to 180 patients in a placebo-controlled  depression  study  ( Study  039 ).  Both  aprepitant  doses  provide  a  greater  plasma exposure than the peak plasma aprepitant exposure resulting from a single IV dose fosaprepitant. Both aprepitant  doses  were  well  tolerated  relative  to  the  control;  in  this  depression  study,  there  were  no serious adverse events associated with aprepitant. There was no pattern among the types of clinical adverse  event  that  caused  discontinuation  in  patients  receiving  either  dose  of  aprepitant  in  this prolonged  exposure  to  high  doses.  A  higher  percentage  of  patients  receiving  aprepitant  250 mg (16.5%), aprepitant 375 mg (13.5%) and paroxetine (15.1%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event compared with placebo (1.1%). Table 14 displays adverse events with an incidence ≥ 5%.

Aprepitant regimens

375 mg aprepitant 375 mg P.O. on Day 1 and 250 mg P.O. once daily on Days 2 to 5

125 mg aprepitant 125 mg P.O. on Day 1 and 80 mg P.O. once daily on Days 2 to 5

40 mg aprepitant 40 mg P.O. on Day 1 and 25 mg P.O. once daily on Days 2 to 5

Standard Therapy: ondansetron 32 mg IV and dexamethasone 20 mg P.O. on Day 1 and dexamethasone 8 mg P.O. once daily on Days 2 to 5

Additionally, a 4-week, multiple-dose safety study with aprepitant 375 mg was performed in healthy volunteers. No clinically important adverse experiences were reported.

## Safety oral aprepitant

Since fosaprepitant is rapidly converted in aprepitant with similar off-peak plasma concentration and since there is no specific adverse event occurring following the infusion of fosaprepitant, the overall

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

safety profile of the treatment fosaprepitant/aprepitant could also be based on the safety information of aprepitant.

Frequently reported adverse reactions that were more common in the aprepitant treatment group were asthenia/fatigue  and  hiccups.  These  were  also  among  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related adverse experiences.

Other frequently reported adverse reactions that were slightly more common with aprepitant treatment included  dizziness,  diarrhoea,  and  cough.  Constipation,  headache,  and  anorexia  were  frequently reported as drug-related adverse experiences and were also more common in the aprepitant treatment group.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Serious adverse experiences of dehydration and respiratory insufficiency were frequent with aprepitant treatment  during  Cycle  1,  but  not  during  the  Multiple-Cycle  extension.  The  pre-specified  adverse reactions, selected to reflect potential chemotherapy-induced haematologic toxicity, potential corticosteroid induced-toxicity and also toxicity potentially related to chemotherapy and/or corticosteroids, were generally similar in frequency between the treatment groups.

## · Laboratory findings

Laboratory adverse reactions were generally similar in frequency between the treatment groups except for  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  and  increases  aspartate  aminotransferase  that  were  both  slightly more common in the aprepitant treatment group.

## · Safety in special populations

Since  fosaprepitant  115  mg  on  Day  1  followed  by  oral  aprepitant  on  Days  2  and  3  provide  a comparable  efficacy  and  safety  profile  than  the  3-day  oral  regimen  in  patients  at  risk  for  CINV receiving either HEC or MEC, the following information is based on the oral aprepitant.

No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, age, or race. Neither fosaprepitant nor aprepitant have been evaluated in patients below 18 years of age.

Additionally, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal insufficiency or for patients with end  state  renal  disease  undergoing  haemodialysis  or  for  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic insufficiency. There are no clinical data in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug-drug  interactions  were  derived  from  studies  conducted  with  fosaprepitant  and  midazolam  or diltiazem and drug-interaction studies with oral aprepitant. As a general recommendation:

- Fosaprepitant  must  not  be  used  concurrently  with  pimozide,  terfenadine,  astemizole,  or cisapride. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, potentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions
- Caution is advised when warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide, phenytoin or other medicinal products  that  are  known  to  be  metabolised  by  CYP2C9  are  administered  during  this  time period
- Fosaprepitant or aprepitant does not seem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Very few patients discontinued fosaprepitant or aprepitant due to adverse events during the clinical studies.

## · Post-marketing experience

From  market  introduction  of  aprepitant  in  March  2003  through  September  2005,  a  total  of 332 spontaneous reports from both healthcare professionals including regulatory agencies (312) and consumers (20) were identified. Eighty of the 312 reports identified were serious. Six of these reports described patients less than 18 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Aprepitant is generally well tolerated, in particular, considering the potential drug interactions already highlighted.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  post-marketing  surveillance  of  aprepitant  has  not  resulted  in reports clearly suggestive of clinically significant drug interactions.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The  oral  aprepitant  programme,  with  plasma  aprepitant  exposures  at  or  above  the  peak  aprepitant levels  anticipated  after  fosaprepitant,  as  well  as  the  available  database  of  fosaprepitant  exposure, provide evidence that fosaprepitant is well tolerated.

Because  hypersensitivity  reactions  with  polysorbate  80  have  been  documented,  the  formulation proposed in this Application for marketing authorisation utilises a low concentration of polysorbate 80 that is less than that used in other marketed products. Using this polysorbate concentration (0.05%) in 123 healthy volunteers did not reveal a clear hypersensitivity reaction.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this medicinal product is considered satisfactory when used with the conditions defined in the SPC.

The  documentation  provided  for  the  active  substance  fosaprepitant  (prodrug  of  aprepitant)  is comprehensive and well detailed.

The  pharmaceutical  development  is  adequate  for this intravenous formulation and  took into consideration properties such as hygroscopicity and thermal lability of the active substance.

The excipients are those typically used for parenteral formulation. Similarly, the packaging material is well documented and no incompatibility has been noticed.

The validation of the manufacturing process ensures consistency and reproducibility of the finished product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  finished  product  has  been  satisfactorily  controlled  and  stability  studies  conducted  under  ICH conditions showed that the product is stable throughout the proposed shelf life.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Non-clinical data are satisfactory and do not raise any concern. However, the remained issue is the need for a non clinical study investigating the potential risk  for  significant  local  intolerance  due  to accidentally miss-administered drug as outlined in EU-guideline CPMP/SWP/2145/00 for which the Applicant has agreed as Follow-Up Measure.

## Efficacy

No  confirmatory  clinical  efficacy  studies  have  been  conducted  with  fosaprepitant.  Activity  in monotherapy  and  in  combination  with  dexamethasone  on  acute  and  delayed  emesis  has  been demonstrated in exploratory studies. Overall from an efficacy perspective, the absence of confirmatory studies is found fully appropriate given the submitted data on pharmacokinetics, available data on the pharmacodynamics of aprepitant and the efficacy results of Phase III programme of oral aprepitant.

## Safety

The safety profile as documented and reported raises no concerns. Mild injection site reactions have been  documented  as  a  common  event.  There  is  no  report  submitted  with  respect  to  extravasation. There is a potential  for  hypersensitivity  reactions  related  to  PS80,  but  no  such  reactions  have  been reported yet for the formulation proposed for marketing.

No clustering of adverse events in relation to expected peak concentrations was observed.

An adequately designed thorough QTc study with moxifloxacin as positive control was conducted. A single dose of aprepitant of 200 mg is not associated with a clinically meaningful prolongation of QT.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk/management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## User consultation

The Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for IVEMEND (fosaprepitant) has not been tested in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC since the PIL IVEMEND is similar to the aprepitant PIL except for the dosage section. This was considered acceptable justification.

## Risk-benefit assessment

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were some outstanding quality issues with no impact on the benefit/risk.  The  applicant  undertook  to  provide  the  necessary  information  as  Follow-Up  Measures within  an  agreed  timeframe  and  to  submit  variations  if  required  following  the  evaluation  of  this additional information.

The local tolerance at injection sites will be investigated according to the Guideline CPMP/SWP/2145/00 in a non clinical study as Follow-Up Measure.

Fosaprepitant I.V. infused over 15 minutes is rapidly converted into aprepitant. Bioequivalence with respect to aprepitant  AUC  between  115  mg  fosaprepitant  and  125  mg  aprepitant  has  been demonstrated.  Due  to  this  equivalent  exposure,  efficacy  of  the  regimen  containing  intravenous fosaprepitant on Day 1 is expected to be comparable to that provided when aprepitant is administered

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

orally on Day 1. Although higher aprepitant peak levels are observed following fosaprepitant infusion as  compared  to  the  currently  registered  oral  aprepitant  formulation,  additional  efficacy  is  unlikely, since brainstem NK1 receptors are already fully occupied with the 125 mg oral regimen. Additional higher oral doses administered in the Phase II programme, which generated peak aprepitant plasma levels  similar  to  or  exceeding  those  following  fosaprepitant  administration,  were  associated  with similar  efficacy  as  125  mg  orally.  The  efficacy  profile  of  the  early  formulations  of  fosaprepitant  is consistent with the findings from the oral aprepitant studies.

There are sufficient safety data to support the conclusion that there is acceptable tolerability with the higher  aprepitant  peak  plasma  levels  that  will  occur  with  fosaprepitant  relative  to  oral  aprepitant administration, including similar or higher peak concentration in the Phase II CINV (multiple-day but less  than  1  week,  exposure)  and  Phase III  depression (multiple-week exposure) programmes. These exposures to aprepitant were well tolerated with no important differences from the tolerability profile already described in the aprepitant current SPC. Furthermore, fosaprepitant (various formulations) was well tolerated  following  intravenous  administration  in  ~700 individuals,  78 of  whom  received ≥ 115 mg with the proposed market formulation; there were no major local tolerability concerns with the marketed formulations.

From a clinical perspective, benefit-risk is considered favourable.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus/majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of IVEMEND in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy and  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer  chemotherapy  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
