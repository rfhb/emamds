## 1. Introduction

On 10 August 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synagis (palivizumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that P13-203 (a Post-Marketing Surveilliance study of Synagis in Korean Pediatric Patients under the New Drug Re-Examination) is a standalone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The originally approved medicinal product in the EU was the lyophilized formulation of palivizumab (50 mg and 100 mg). The liquid solution for injection formulation of palivizumab has since been approved in  the  EU  in  August  of  2014.  The  lyophilized  formulation  of  palivizumab  is  currently  the  only formulation approved in the Republic of Korea.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- P13-203 (a Post-Marketing Surveilliance study of Synagis in Korean Pediatric Patients under the New Drug Re-Examination)

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

In  accordance  with  the  EMA  regulation,  the  MAH  (Abbvie)  has  submitted  the  postmarketing surveillance  study  P13-203,  in  which  adverse  events  related  to  the  use  of  palivizumab  (Syangis)  in routine medical practice in the Republic of Korea from March 2011 through March 2015 was evaluated.

In  Korea,  the  approved  indication  for  palivizumab  is  for  the  prevention  of  serious  lower  respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization caused by respiratory syncytial virus in children at high risk for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease:

-Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV season.

-Children  less  than  2  years  of  age  and  requiring  treatment  for  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia (BPD) within the last 6 months.

-Children  less  than  2  years  of  age  and  with  hemodynamically  significant  congenital  heart disease (CHD).

## Methods

Observational prospective, multi-center study from 29 clinical sites in Korea.

The primary objective was to evaluate SAEs and AEs in relation to the use of palivizumab in the setting of routine medical practice in the Republic of Korea.

The study was done from March 30, 2011 through March 29, 2015.

## Results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subject and Treatment Description

618  subjects  were  enrolled  from  March  2011  to  March  2015.  One  participant  was  a  duplicate enrollment and the duplicate data was excluded from the analysis.  Mean (SD) age at enrollment was 3.38 (3.39) months. Mean (SD) gestational age was 31.46 (4.91) weeks, and mean (SD) birth weight was 1.68 (0.89) kg.

Of the 617 infants, 73% were premature births (&lt;35 weeks gestation) and 55% were male.

The most common indication for palivizumab administration was preterm newborn infants or infants born  at  35  weeks  of  gestation  or  less,  and  less  than  6  months  of  age  at  the  onset  of  RSV  season (347/617,  56%).  The  other  indications  for  palivizumab  administration  were  infants  or  children  with BPD (21%), and with CHD (32%).

380 subjects received 4 (8%) or 5 (53%) doses of palivizumab and 237 (38%) subjects received less than 4 doses of Synagis.

## Safety

In a total of126 subjects, 213 adverse events and 3 AEs related to palivizumab (ADRs) were reported.

## AE

Infections and infestations were reported as 114 AEs in 82 [13%] of the subjects.

The  main  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  infection  (32/617,  5%),  pyrexia  (16/617,  3%),  bronchiolitis (13/617, 2%), respiratory syncytial virus infection (11/617, 2%), and diarrhea (8/617, 1%).

## SAE

In 46 subjects (46/617, 7%) SAEs were observed.

The most common SAEs were infections and infestations (38 SAEs in 31 subjects [5%]). In 11 cases these were RSV infections.

In  total,  99  cases of  unexpected AEs (i.e., AEs not described in the Korean label) from 67 subjects were reported. According to the study investigators, none of these AEs were related to palivizumab. Death occurred in five subjects, none of the deaths was considered related to the drug.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

In the submitted study P13-203, the safety profile of pavalizumab was in agreement with the known AE profile.

Overall,  the  incidence  and  types  of  AEs  reflected  the  serious  underlying  conditions  of  the  pediatric subjects receiving palivizumab. In this study, no new safety signals were observed.

The results from study P13-203 submitted in accordance with article 46 of the Pediatric Regulation are in agreement with the currently approved SmPC and no further regulatory action is deemed necessary.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
