## 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Type of application and aspects on development

This application concerns a follow-up measures P046 for Januvia/ Xelevia/Tesavel/Ristaben (CHMP adoption 21 February 2008) wherein the MAH committed to submit a proposal for a study design and timetable for paediatric studies.

A clinical study report (CSR) was submitted pertaining to study 081 - A Single-Dose Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Sitagliptin in Adolescents (Januvia and related products, EMEA-000470-PIP01-08).

This submission is in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which obliges the MAH to submit to the EMA any MAH-sponsored studies involving the use in the paediatric population of a centrally authorised medicinal product.

## 2.1.1. Introduction

Sitagliptin, an orally active, well-tolerated, potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), provides glycemic improvement by increasing the concentration of incretin hormones, including the key glucoregulatory hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which act to lower glucose through enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and release and suppression of glucagon secretion. Studies in the adult sitagliptin development program have shown that sitagliptin monotherapy improves HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and post-meal glucose (PMG) in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner. When coadministered with metformin, sulfonylurea, a PPAR-γ agonist, insulin, metformin plus a sulfonylurea, metformin plus a PPAR-γ agonist, and metformin plus insulin, sitagliptin results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful incremental glycemic improvements in HbA1c and FPG. Sitagliptin is presently indicated/approved for the treatment of adults with T2DM as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, PPAR-γ agonist, as well as part of triple combination therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea or metformin plus PPAR-γ agonists. It has also been approved for use with insulin. Based upon its mechanisms of action and the similar pathophysiology underlying T2DM in youths and adults, the favorable safety and efficacy profiles of sitagliptin are predicted to be similar for youths relative to adults.

The study report included in this submission (MK-0431, PN081) presents data from the first clinical study in which sitagliptin was administered to subjects under the age of 18 years. This single-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 10 - 17 year old patients with T2DM, and evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sitagliptin in this pediatric patient population. Single oral doses of 50-, 100-, and 200-mg sitagliptin or matching placebo were administered to 35 adolescent patients (ages 10 - 17 years) with T2DM.

## 2.1.2. Methods

## · Study Design

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple panel, single-dose study involving 10- to 17-year-old patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Up to 3 panels (Panels A, B, and C) of up to 12 patients each were randomized to receive single oral doses of sitagliptin or placebo (in a 3:1 ratio, respectively). Panel A patients were administered single doses of 50 mg sitagliptin or placebo and Panel B subjects were administered single doses of 100 mg sitagliptin or placebo. There was a minimum of 48 hours between Panels A (after completion of 8 subjects) and B to allow for assessment of safety and tolerability. Initiation of Panel C was dependent on the review of safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Panels A and B after completion of 16 subjects, which occurred at the completion of 8 subjects from Panel B. The dose of sitagliptin selected for administration in Panel C was 200 mg and was based upon the review of partial safety and PK data from Panels A and B.

The age of the subjects was 10 -17 years and the weight ranged from 50 to 180 kg.

Demographic information for the 35 patients is given in the Table 10-1

In the placebo group there are 8 females versus one male. It could be of interest for interpretation of the study data whether the one male in the placebo-group weighed 180 kg, as might be concluded from Table 10-1.

None of the concomitant therapies could affect the study objectives.

Patients fasted for at least 8 hours prior to study drug administration. All doses were taken orally with approximately 240 mL of water, with water restricted 1 hour prior to and after study drug administration.

Blood samples (4 mL) for plasma sitagliptin and DPP-4 activity will be collected predose and at the following time points postdose: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 (pre-meal), 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 32, 48, and 72 hours.

The plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, and apparent t1/2) of sitagliptin after oral administration of single doses were determined.

Urine for determination of sitagliptin concentrations was collected predose and at intervals up to 24hours postdose in all panels.

## Assessors Comments

The study design is considered acceptable. That the study was conducted as a multi centre (7 centres in the USA), parallel group design with only 8 patients in each group and the time span of the study was 28 months, this study is considered of low power and the results should be interpreted with care.

## Analytical methods

Plasma samples were directly injected onto a High Turbulent Liquid Chromatography (HTLC) system. Analyte and internal standard were detected by MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with turbo-ionspray interface in the positive ion mode. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the plasma assay was 0.50 ng/mL and the linear calibration range was 0.50 to 1000 ng/mL.

Urine samples were analyzed by MRL (Merck Research Laboratories) (West Point, PA, U.S.A.). Urine samples were diluted and injected directly onto a HPLC system. Analyte and its isotopic internal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

standard were detected by MS/MS using SRM with turboionspray interface in the positive ion mode. The LLOQ for urine assay was 0.1 µg/mL and the linear calibration range was 0.10 to 50.0 µg/mL.

The long term stability was tested over a period of 527 days.

## Assessor's comment

The analytical method used for determination of sitagliptin in plasma and urine is considered acceptable.

## · Pharmacokinetic data analysis

Actual sampling times were used to estimate each patient's plasma sitagliptin pharmacokinetic parameters. AUC0-∞, Cmax, C24hr, Tmax, and the apparent terminal t1/2 were calculated for sitagliptin. Plasma sitagliptin concentrations were converted into molar units (nM) prior to analysis using the molecular weight of 407.32 g/mol. Values below the LLOQ (LLOQ = 0.50 ng/mL = 1.23 nM) were replaced with 0. The pharmacokinetic variables were calculated model independently.

Sitagliptin urine concentrations, urine volumes from individual collection intervals, and actual time of the total collection interval were used to calculate urinary pharmacokinetic parameters. The fraction of the sitagliptin dose that was excreted unchanged in urine over the dosing intervals was determined by the quotient of the sum of sitagliptin collected over all dosing intervals and the dose administered (corrected for assayed potency of the formulation).

Assessor's comment

The methods for estimation of the pharmacokinetic variables are acceptable.

## 2.1.3. Between Population Comparison

## Between-Population Comparison

The appropriate dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ from MK-0431 PN005 (N=7 adult patients with T2DM, 25 mg and 200 mg doses) was used for comparison with adolescent patients with T2DM. Pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in healthy adults obtained from MK-0431 PN033, a study to evaluate dose proportionality of MK-0431 final market image tablets in healthy volunteers, indicate that the range of doses to be studied here is dose proportional with respect to AUC0-∞. The dose-adjusted (to 100 mg) AUC0-∞ from MK- 0431 PN005 (N=7 diabetic patients, 25 mg and 200 mg doses) was used for comparison with adolescent patients with T2DM.

The dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ (to 100 mg) for sitagliptin was analyzed using linear mixed effect model with treatment (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) and population as fixed effects and patient as a random effect. The ninety percent confidence interval (90% CI) was generated for the least square mean ratio (GMR, adolescents/adults) for sitagliptin AUC0-∞, based upon the t-distribution. If this 90% CI of the GMR for AUC0-∞ fell within the pre-specified bounds [0.50, 2.00], similarity between the adults and the adolescents would be concluded.

In addition, since MK-0431 PN005 is a crossover study, the AUC0-∞ from 25 mg and 200 mg for each patient was dose-adjusted to 100 mg and the mean of these 2 readings for each patient was used as historic data in analysis. An ANOVA model with population (adolescent patients with T2DM vs. adult patients with T2DM) as a factor for the dose adjusted (to 100 mg) AUC0-∞ was performed as supplemental analysis.

Due to non-dose proportionality, sitagliptin Cmax and C24hr at 200 mg for both adolescents and adults were analyzed using an ANOVA model with population (diabetic adolescents vs. diabetic adults) as a factor.

By including the historic adult patients in the model, it was assumed that time and any differences between the protocols (site, country, etc.) have negligible effects on the sitagliptin pharmacokinetic comparisons.

## Assessor's comment

The methods described for comparison the data in adolescent patients and historical data from adult patients are considered adequate. The assumptions made on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of sitagliptin as dose linearity, the influence of weight and the pre-specified range of 0.5 - 2.0 for clinical relevant differences are acceptable in comparison of the pharmacokinetic data.

However, as the number of possible covariables, e.g. the issues mentioned above and the differences between protocols like site, country analytical method etc., in this comparison is rather large the value of this comparison is of low significance.

The conclusions of the applicant on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in adolescent subjects were:

- Single oral doses of sitagliptin up to 200 mg are generally safe and well-tolerated in 10 to 17 year old adolescent patients with T2DM.
- Adolescent patients with T2DM treated with single doses of sitagliptin have an approximately 18% lower AUC0-∞ as compared to adult patients with T2DM but this difference is not thought to be clinically meaningful.
- Adolescent patients with T2DM treated with a 200 mg single dose of sitagliptin have an approximately 4% higher Cmax and 26% lower C24hr compared to adult patients with T2DM treated with a 200 mg single dose of sitagliptin.

Assessors Comments Considering the results from this study the conclusions of the applicant can be endorsed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In adolescent subjects, despite the fact of the drawbacks of this study (parallel design, low number of subjects in each group, multi centre, long period of the study) the results showed acceptable variability and an acceptable comparison with the historical adult characteristics could be made.

In adolescent patients the pharmacokinetics showed also linear relationship with the dose with respect to the extent of absorption and a small deviation with respect to the rate of absorption. This is also in accordance with the data in adult patients.

## In Conclusion

The exposure to sitagliptin in addolescent patients older than 10 years of age is considered not clinically significantly different from the exposure in adult patients.

## 2.2. Pharmacodynamics

Blood samples for determination of plasma DPP-4 activity were collected predose and at selected time points through 72 hours postdose in all Panels .

DPP-4 enzyme activity was assessed in plasma by measuring the release of paranitroanaline (pNA) from the added substrate glylcyl-prolyl-paranitroaniline (Gly-PropNA).

The change in absorbance at 390 nm was determined at 30 second intervals over 20 minutes. The enzyme activity was defined as the slope (in mOD/min) from 4 to 14 minutes. The LLOQ for the DPP-4 assay was 0.6 mOD/min.

## Percent Inhibition of Plasma DDP-4 Activity after sitagliptin

The geometric mean (± standard error) for % inhibition of DPP-4 activity after administration of sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or placebo is depicted in Figure 11-8.

## Exploratory PK/PD Analysis

Time-matched DPP-4 inhibition and plasma concentration data were evaluated in an exploratory PK/PD analysis. Plotting the data (Figure 11-31) demonstrates that DPP-4 inhibition vs. plasma concentration follows a sigmoidal curve. An exploratory Emax model was fit to the adolescent data, shown with a dashed line. The estimated IC50 from this analysis was 25.4 +/- 1.5 nM. A similar analysis was performed with data generated in healthy adult subjects from protocol 001 and 002, receiving single oral doses of sitagliptin ranging from 1.5 to 600 mg. The estimated IC50 for adults in this previous study was 25.7 +/- 0.7 nM [16.1.12.46]. The Emax model fit for adults from P001/P002 is shown in Figure 11-31 with a solid gray line.

The PK/PD relationship between sitagliptin plasma concentration and DPP-4 inhibition was similar between adolescents and adults. The(modest) reduction in plasma sitagliptin exposure in adolescents translated to differences in plasma DPP-4 inhibition which were most marked at 24-hours post-dose. A single dose of 100 mg sitagliptin in healthy adult subjects achieves ~ 75% trough inhibition and ~ 83% change from placebo in weighted average inhibition (historical data from study MK-0431PN001/002). The steady state trough DPP-4 inhibition in adults for 100 mg sitagliptin increases to ~80% following multiple dosing.

That a single dose of 100 mg sitagliptin in adolescent patients achieves a numerically lower placeboadjusted DPP-4 inhibition, both on Day 1 \"trough\" inhibition (59.2%) and on weighted average inhibition (73.8%), reflects the small but observable differences in PK between adolescents and adults. However, it should be realised that this is a cross study comparison. In adults, sitagliptin dose-related reductions in trough DPP-4 inhibition have translated into only small differences in glycemic efficacy (historical data from MK-0431, PN001,PN002, PN014,  PN07).

## Assessor's comments:

Considering the results of this pharmacodynamic study on the inhibition of DPP-4 activity the conclusions of applicant are endorsed.

The pharmacodynamic effects of sitagliptin were evaluated further in an exploratory fashion. Plasma glucose, glucagon, insulin, C-peptide and GLP-1 (active and total) concentrations were measured in the context of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) administered 2 hours postdose, and/or in the context of a standardized meal administered 4 hours postdose.

## Glucose

The LS mean with corresponding 95% CI for plasma glucose concentrations (mg/dL) after single dose administration of sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and placebo are given in Figure 11-11.

For the 2 hour period following the OGTT, the weighted mean insulin was greater than placebo for all three doses of sitagliptin.

## GLP-1

After administration of sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and placebo, the summary statistics and comparisons with placebo for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted mean active GLP-1 concentration are provided in Table 11-23.

The GMRs (sitagliptin / placebo) and 95% CI for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted average active GLP-1 concentration were 3.24 (1.81, 5.80), 2.38 (1.33, 4.25) and 1.89 (1.04, 3.43), respectively, for sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg.

## 2.2.1. Assessor's overall conclusion on pharmacodynamics

This is a single-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind in adolescents with T2DM. The term 'adolescents' is used to refer to the 10-17 year old pediatric patient. The pharmacodynamic data in adolescents are consistent with those previously demonstrated in adults.

Based on the observed PK profile following single doses of 200 mg, increasing the daily sitagliptin dose in adolescents to above 100 mg in order to closely match adult trough DPP-4 inhibition would be accompanied by a sitagliptin Cmax in adolescents exceeding that associated with the usual 100 mg daily dose in adults. This daily dose exceeding 100 mg could induce risks in this vulnerable pediatric population.

Therefore, as based on the data presented, the balance of evidence indicates that 100 mg sitagliptin per day should be the dose for adolescent patients to be enrolled in Phase III studies.

## 3. Clinical safety

## 3.1. Assessor's overall conclusions on clinical safety

## Discussion on clinical safety

All 35 patients were included in the assessment of safety and tolerability. Eight (8) patients reported a total of 18 clinical AEs (13 while on sitagliptin, 5 while on placebo), none of which was serious. Six (6) of the 18 clinical AEs were considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator.

Seventeen (17) of the 18 reported clinical AEs were rated by the Investigator to be mild in intensity, and one was reported to be moderate in intensity (AN 0025, infusion site pain). All patients recovered from their adverse experiences.

There were no laboratory adverse experiences, serious adverse experiences (AEs) or deaths reported in this study. No patients were discontinued from the study due to an adverse experience. There were no consistent treatment-related changes in laboratory, vital sign, or ECG safety parameters.

## Conclusions on clinical safety

In this single-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind in adolescents with T2DM sitagliptin was safe and well tolerated. However, it should be noted that this is an exploratory PK/PD study of short duration.

## 4. Overall conclusion

As a corollary to the follow-up measures FUM 006 for Januvia/Xelevia and FUM 004 for Tesavel the clinical study report: 'A single-dose study to assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerablity of Sitagliptin in Adolescents' has been sumitted. This is a single dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in adolescents with T2DM.

The exposure to sitagliptin in adolescents is clinically not significantly different from the exposure in adult patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the data presented, the balance of evidence indicates that 100 mg per day should be the dose for adolescent patients with T2DM to be enrolled in Phase III studies.

In this exploratory PK/PD study of short duration sitaglitin was safe and well tolerated.

MAH confirms that in the context of this submission, no amendments to SmPC, labelling and/or PL are warranted.

P46.030 for Januvia and corresponding submissions for the clones Xelevia, Tesavel and Ristaben can be considered fulfilled.
