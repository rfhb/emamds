## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Polymyalgia rheumatica

Kevzara is indicated for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who experience a relapse during corticosteroid taper.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the condition for which this medicinal product is intended (see section 4.1). Patients must be given the patient card.

## Posology

## Rheumatoid arthritis

The recommended dose of sarilumab is 200 mg once every 2 weeks administered as a subcutaneous injection.

## Polymyalgia rheumatica

The recommended dose of sarilumab is 200 mg once every 2 weeks administered as a subcutaneous injection, in combination with a tapering course of systemic corticosteroids, after which sarilumab can be continued as monotherapy.

Data are available in patients that were treated for up to 1 year. Therefore treatment beyond 52 weeks should be guided by disease activity, physician discretion, and patient choice.

## Dose modification

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Reduction of dose from 200 mg once every 2 weeks to 150 mg once every 2 weeks is recommended for management of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme elevations.

Treatment with sarilumab must be withheld in patients who develop a serious infection until the infection is controlled.

Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2 x 10 9 /L.

Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below 150 x 10 3 /µL.

## Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)

Laboratory Abnormalities: Discontinue sarilumab in patients with PMR who develop the following laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4 and 5.1) :

- o neutropenia (ANC below 1 x 10 9 /L at the end of the dosing interval)
- o thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100 x 10 3 µL)
- o AST or ALT elevations (3 times above the ULN)

Dosage modifications have not been studied in patients with PMR with these conditions. For treatment initiation criteria, refer to the posology for PMR.

## Missed dose

If a dose of sarilumab is missed and it has been 3 days or less since the missed dose, the next dose should be administered as soon as possible. The subsequent dose should be administered at the regularly scheduled time. If it has been 4 days or more since the missed dose, the subsequent dose should be administered at the next regularly scheduled time, the dose should not be doubled.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Sarilumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients with positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology (see section 4.4).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

## Subcutaneous use.

Injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper arm) should be rotated with each injection. Sarilumab should not be injected into skin that is tender, damaged, or has bruises or scars.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen

The total content (1.14 ml) of the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen should be administered as a subcutaneous injection.

For the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen, a patient may self-inject sarilumab or the patient's caregiver may administer sarilumab if their healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to patients and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of sarilumab prior to use.

The pre-filled syringe or pen has not been studied in paediatric patients.

Comprehensive instructions for administration of this medicinal product are given in the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Serious infections

Patients must be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with sarilumab (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly.

Sarilumab must not be administered in patients with an active infection, including localised infections. The risks and benefits should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients who have:

- chronic or recurrent infection;
- a history of serious or opportunistic infections;
- HIV infection;
- underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection;
- been exposed to tuberculosis; or
- lived in or travelled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses.

Treatment with sarilumab must be withheld if a patient develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection. Once the infection is controlled, treatment with sarilumab may be re-initiated at the discretion of the healthcare professional.

A patient who develops an infection during treatment should also undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored.

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. The most frequently observed serious infections with sarilumab in RA patients included pneumonia and cellulitis (see section 4.8). Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystis were reported with sarilumab in RA. In some patients with RA with concomitant tuberculosis, disseminated rather than localised infections were observed, most of whom were taking

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concomitant immunosuppressants such as MTX or corticosteroids, which may increase the risk of infection.

## Tuberculosis

Patients must be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating treatment with sarilumab. Patients with latent or active tuberculosis must be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating treatment. Anti-tuberculosis therapy must be considered prior to initiation of treatment in patients with a past medical history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Healthcare professionals are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. When considering antituberculosis therapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in tuberculosis may be appropriate.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.

## Viral reactivation

Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies. Cases of herpes zoster were observed in clinical studies with sarilumab (see section 4.8). No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation were reported in the clinical studies; however patients who were at risk for reactivation were excluded.

## Laboratory parameters

## Neutrophil count

Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in ANC (see section 4.8). Decrease in ANC was not associated with higher incidence of infections, including serious infections.

- Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e., ANC less than 2 x 10 9 /L. In patients who develop an ANC less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L, it is recommended to discontinue treatment with sarilumab (see section 4.2).
- Neutrophil count must be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to clinical judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC results, see section 4.2.
- Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC, results obtained at the end of the dosing interval should be used when considering dose modification (see section 5.1).

## Platelet count

Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies. Reduction in platelets was not associated with bleeding events (see section 4.8).

- Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below 150 x10 3 /µL. In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50 x 10 3 / µL, treatment with sarilumab must be discontinued.
- Platelet count must be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to clinical judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on platelet counts, see section 4.2.

## Liver enzymes

Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with sarilumab.

Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with elevated transaminases, ALT or AST greater than 1.5 x ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT greater than 5 x ULN, treatment with sarilumab must be discontinued (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ALT and AST levels must be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. When clinically indicated, consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin. For recommended dose modifications based on transaminase elevations, see section 4.2.

## Lipid abnormalities

Lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Treatment with sarilumab was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or triglycerides (see section 4.8). Lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment with sarilumab, then at approximately 6 month intervals. Patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia.

## Gastrointestinal perforation and diverticulitis

Cases of gastrointestinal perforation and diverticulitis have been reported in association with sarilumab. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients with and without diverticulitis. Patients presenting with symptoms potentially indicative of diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early identification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation. Sarilumab should be used with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis (see section 4.8).

## Malignancies

Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. The impact of treatment with sarilumab on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with sarilumab (see section 4.8) . Injection site rash, rash, and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients must be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Sarilumab must be stopped immediately (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Vaccinations

Concurrent use of live vaccines as well as live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment with sarilumab as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving sarilumab. Prior to initiating treatment, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.

## Cardiovascular risk

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) should be managed as part of usual standard of care.

## Polysorbate 20 (E 432)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product contains 2.28 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1.14 ml of solution for injection which is equivalent to 2 mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Sarilumab exposure was not affected when coadministered with MTX based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses and across study comparisons. MTX exposure is not expected to be changed by sarilumab coadministration; however, no clinical data was collected. Sarilumab has not been investigated in combination with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA or PMR and hence increase drug levels compared to subjects without RA or PMR. Blockade of IL-6 signalling by IL6Rα antagonists such as sarilumab might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered medicinal products concentrations.

The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by sarilumab may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of sarilumab in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or concentration of the medicinal product (e.g., theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.

Caution should be exercised in patients who start sarilumab treatment while on therapy with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., oral contraceptives or statins), as sarilumab may reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP3A4 activity, leading to decreased exposure and activity of CYP3A4 substrate (see section 5.2). Interaction of sarilumab with substrates of other CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP2D6) has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment (see section 4.5).

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sarilumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Sarilumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with sarilumab.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether sarilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion.

The excretion of sarilumab in milk has not been studied in animals (see section 5.3). Because IgG1 are excreted in human milk , a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue sarilumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No data are available on the effect of sarilumab on human fertility. Animal studies showed no impairment of male or female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Kevzara has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequent adverse reactions in RA (n=661) and PMR (n=59) patients are neutropenia (14.3%), upper respiratory infections (6.8%), increased ALT (6.3%), urinary tract infections (5.3%), and injection site erythema (5.0%). The most common serious adverse reactions are infections (3.1%) (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions listed in the table have been reported in controlled clinical studies. The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention:

very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rheumatoid arthritis

## Infections

In the placebo-controlled population, the rates of infections were 84.5, 81.0, and 75.1 events per 100 patient-years, in the 200 mg and 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs and placebo + DMARDs groups respectively. The most commonly reported infections (5% to 7% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and nasopharyngitis . The rates of serious infections were 4.3, 3.0, and 3.1 events per 100 patient-years, in the 200 mg, 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs, and placebo + DMARDs groups, respectively.

In the sarilumab +DMARDs long-term safety population, the rates of infections and serious infection were 57.3 and 3.4 events per 100-patient years, respectively.

The most frequently observed serious infections included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of opportunistic infection have been reported (see section 4.4).

The overall rates of infections and serious infections in the sarilumab monotherapy population were consistent with rates in the sarilumab + DMARDs population.

## Gastrointestinal perforation

Gastrointestinal perforation was reported in patients with and without diverticulitis. Most patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or MTX. The contribution of these concomitant medicinal products relative to sarilumab in the development of gastrointestinal perforations is not known (see section 4.4).

## Hypersensitivity reactions

In the placebo-controlled population, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions was higher among those treated with sarilumab (0.9% in 200 mg group, 0.5% in 150 mg group) than placebo (0.2%). The rates of discontinuations due to hypersensitivity in the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population were consistent with the placebo-controlled population. In the placebo-controlled population, 0.2% of the patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg every two weeks (q2w) + DMARD reported serious adverse reactions of hypersensitivity reactions, and none from sarilumab 150 mg q2w + DMARD group.

## Injection site reactions

In the placebo-controlled population, injection site reactions were reported in 9.5%, 8%, and 1.4% of patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg, 150 mg, and placebo respectively. These injection site reactions (including erythema and pruritus) were mild to moderate in severity for the majority of patients (99.5%, 100%, and 100%, for sarilumab 200 mg, 150 mg, and placebo respectively). Two patients on sarilumab (0.2%) discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions.

## Laboratory abnormalities

To allow for a direct comparison of frequency of laboratory abnormalities between placebo and active treatment, data from weeks 0-12 were used as this was prior to patients being permitted to switch from placebo to sarilumab.

## Neutrophil count

Decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 6.4% and 3.6% of patients in the 200 mg and 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs group, respectively, compared to no patients in the placebo + DMARDs group. Decreases in neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10 9 /L occurred in 0.8% and 0.6% of patients in the 200 mg and 150 mg sarilumab+ DMARDs groups, respectively. In patients experiencing a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), modification of treatment regimen such as interruption of sarilumab or reduction in dose resulted in an increase or normalisation of ANC (see section 4.2) . Decrease in ANC was not associated with higher incidence of infections, including serious infections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, the observations on neutrophil counts were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled population (see section 4.4).

## Platelet count

Decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 /µL occurred in 1.2% and 0.6% of patients on 200 mg and 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs, respectively, compared to no patients on placebo + DMARDs .

In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, the observations on platelet counts were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled population.

There were no bleeding events associated with decreases in platelet count.

## Liver enzymes

Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarised in Table 3. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as interruption of treatment or reduction in dose, resulted in decrease or normalisation of liver enzymes (see section 4.2). These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.4).

## Lipids

Lipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of sarilumab+ DMARDs in the placebo-controlled population. At week 4 the mean LDL increased by 14 mg/dL; mean triglycerides increased by 23 mg/dL; and mean HDL increased by 3 mg/dL. After week 4 no additional increases were observed. There were no meaningful differences between doses.

In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, the observations in lipid parameters were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled population.

## Malignancies

In the placebo-controlled population, malignancies occurred at the same rate in patients receiving either sarilumab + DMARDs or placebo + DMARDs (1.0 events per 100 patient-years).

In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, the rates of malignancies were consistent with the rate observed in the placebo-controlled population (see section 4.4).

## Immunogenicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with sarilumab.

In the placebo-controlled population, 4.0%, 5.6%, and 2.0% of patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs, sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs and placebo + DMARDs respectively, exhibited a positive response in the antidrug antibody (ADA) assay. Positive responses in the neutralising antibody (NAb) assay were detected in 1.0%, 1.6%, and 0.2% of patients on sarilumab 200 mg, sarilumab 150 mg, and placebo respectively.

In the sarilumab monotherapy population, observations were consistent with the sarilumab + DMARDs population.

Antidrug antibodies (ADA) formation may affect pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. No correlation was observed between ADA development and either loss of efficacy or adverse reactions.

## Polymyalgia Rheumatica

The safety of sarilumab was studied in one Phase 3 study (SAPHYR) in 117 PMR patients of whom 59 received subcutaneous sarilumab 200 mg (see section 5.1). The total patient years duration in the sarilumab PMR population was 47.37 patient years during the 12-month double blind, placebo-controlled study. Safety data are available for up to 1 year.

## Infections

In the SAPHYR study, the proportion of patients with infections was lower in the sarilumab 200 mg with 14-week prednisone taper group (37.3%) compared to the placebo with 52-week prednisone taper group (50.0%). Serious infections were reported in 3 (5.1%) patients in the sarilumab 200 mg with 14week prednisone taper group (all of which were cases of bacterial infections) and 3 (5.2%) patients in the placebo with 52-week prednisone taper group (all of which were cases of COVID-19 infection). Laboratory abnormalities

## Neutrophil count

In the SAPHYR study, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 7 (12%) patients in the sarilumab group of which 2 (3.4%) were serious (decreases in neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10 9 /L).

## Liver enzymes

In the SAPHYR study, no sarilumab treated patients had an ALT or AST greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the placebo group, 2 patients had ALT elevations greater than 3x ULN.

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with sarilumab.

In the PMR population, 1 (1.8%) patient treated with sarilumab 200 mg exhibited a persistent antidrug antibody (ADA) response and none of the patients in the placebo group exhibited an ADA response. Positive response in the neutralising antibody assay was detected in the PMR patient with ADA response on sarilumab 200 mg. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies on the safety, and/or efficacy of sarilumab is unknown.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for Kevzara overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be closely monitored, treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC14

## Mechanism of action

Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype) that specifically binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R α ), and inhibits IL-6-mediated signalling which involves ubiquitous signal-transducing glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT-3).

In functional human cell-based assays, sarilumab was able to block the IL-6 signalling pathway, measured as STAT-3 inhibition, only in the presence of IL-6.

IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates diverse cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis and can activate hepatocytes to release acute-phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and joint destruction which are hallmarks of RA and pJIA. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as migration and activation of T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and osteoclasts leading to systemic inflammation, synovial inflammation, and bone erosion in patients with RA and pJIA.

The activity of sarilumab in reducing inflammation is associated with laboratory changes such as decrease in ANC and elevation in lipids (see section 4.4).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Following single-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg in patients with RA rapid reduction of CRP levels was observed. Levels were reduced to normal as early as 4 days after treatment initiation. Following single-dose sarilumab administration, in patients with RA, ANC decreased to the nadir between 3 to 4 days and thereafter recovered towards baseline (see section 4.4). Treatment with sarilumab resulted in decreases in fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, and increases in haemoglobin and serum albumin. Sarilumab treatment for PMR patients taking 200 mg once every 2 weeks has a similar effect compared to RA patients on the PD biomarker profiles (CRP and ANC) over time.

## Clinical efficacy

## Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

The efficacy and safety of sarilumab were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre studies (MOBILITY and TARGET were placebo-controlled studies and MONARCH was an active comparator-controlled study) in patients older than 18 years with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Placebo-controlled studies

MOBILITY evaluated 1197 patients with RA who had inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received sarilumab 200 mg, sarilumab 150 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks with concomitant MTX. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24, changes from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score at week 16, and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at week 52.

TARGET evaluated 546 patients with RA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNFα antagonists. Patients received sarilumab 200 mg, sarilumab 150 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks with concomitant conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24 and the changes from baseline HAQ-DI score at week 12.

## Clinical response

The percentages of sarilumab + DMARDs-treated patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses in MOBILITY and TARGET are shown in Table 4. In both studies, patients treated with either 200 mg or 150 mg of sarilumab + DMARDs every two weeks had higher ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates versus placebo-treated patients at week 24. These responses persisted through 3 years of therapy in an open-label extension study.

In MOBILITY, a greater proportion of patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg or 150 mg every two weeks plus MTX achieved remission, defined as Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) &lt; 2.6 compared with placebo + MTX at week 52. Results at 24 weeks in TARGET were similar to the results at 52 weeks in MOBILITY (see Table 4).

## Radiographic response

In MOBILITY, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score, and joint space narrowing score at week 52. Radiographs of hands and feet were obtained at baseline, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks and scored independently by at least two well-trained readers who were blinded to treatment group and visit number.

Both doses of sarilumab + MTX were superior to placebo + MTX in the change from baseline in mTSS at 24 and 52 weeks (see Table 6). Less progression of both erosion and joint space narrowing scores at 24 and 52 weeks was reported in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group.

Treatment with sarilumab + MTX was associated with significantly less radiographic progression of structural damage as compared with placebo. At week 52, 55.6% of patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg and 47.8% of patients receiving sarilumab 150 mg had no progression of structural damage (as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less) compared with 38.7% of patients receiving placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg + MTX inhibited the progression of structural damage by 91% and 68%, respectively, compared to placebo + MTX at week 52.

The efficacy of sarilumab with concomitant DMARDs on inhibition of radiographic progression that was assessed as part of the primary endpoints at week 52 in MOBILITY was sustained up to three years from the start of treatment.

## Physical function response

In MOBILITY and TARGET, physical function and disability were assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg or 150 mg + DMARDs every two weeks demonstrated greater improvement from baseline in physical function compared to placebo at week 16 and week 12 in MOBILITY and TARGET, respectively.

MOBILITY demonstrated significant improvement in physical function, as measured by the HAQ-DI at week 16 compared to placebo (-0.58, -0.54, and -0.30 for sarilumab 200 mg + MTX, sarilumab 150 mg + MTX, and placebo + MTX, every two weeks, respectively). TARGET demonstrated significant improvement in HAQ-DI scores at week 12 compared to placebo (-0.49, -0.50, and -0.29 for sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs, sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs, and placebo + DMARDs, every two weeks, respectively).

In MOBILITY, the improvement in physical functioning as measured by HAQ-DI was maintained up to week 52 (-0.75, -0.71, and -0.46 for sarilumab 200 mg + MTX, sarilumab 150 mg + MTX, and placebo + MTX treatment groups, respectively).

Patients treated with sarilumab + MTX (47.6% in the 200 mg treatment group and 47.0% in the 150 mg treatment group) achieved a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI (change from baseline of ≥0.3 units) at week 52 compared to 26.1% in the placebo + MTX treatment group.

## Patient reported outcomes

General health status was assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). In MOBILITY and TARGET, patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs every two weeks or sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs every two weeks demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo + DMARDs in physical component summary (PCS) and no worsening on the mental component

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

summary (MCS) at week 24. Patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs reported greater improvement relative to placebo in the domains of Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health Perception, Vitality, Social Functioning, and Mental Health.

Fatigue was assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue scale. In MOBILITY and TARGET, patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs every two weeks or sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs every two weeks demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo + DMARDs.

## Active Comparator-controlled Study

MONARCH was a 24-week randomised double-blind, double-dummy study that compared sarilumab 200 mg monotherapy with adalimumab 40 mg monotherapy administered subcutaneously every two weeks in 369 patients with moderately to severely active RA who were inappropriate for treatment with MTX including those who were intolerant of or inadequate responders to MTX.

Sarilumab 200 mg was superior to adalimumab 40 mg in reducing disease activity and improving physical function, with more patients achieving clinical remission over 24weeks (see Table 7).

## Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)

The efficacy and safety of sarilumab were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study (SAPHYR) in patients 50 years and older with PMR, diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology/European Union League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria. Patients had at least one episode of unequivocal PMR flare while attempting to taper corticosteroids.

In the SAPHYR study, patients with active PMR were randomised to receive sarilumab 200 mg every two weeks with a pre-defined 14-week taper of prednisone (n= 60) or placebo every two weeks with a pre-defined 52-week taper of prednisone (n=58). One patient was randomized but not treated in the sarilumab 200 mg arm. The number of patients who completed the study treatment period was 42 (70%) and 36 (62.1%) in the sarilumab group and placebo group, respectively. Patients experiencing a disease flare or unable to adhere to the assigned prednisone tapering schedule could receive corticosteroids as rescue therapy.

By design, the prednisone tapers in the treatment arms differed. The total actual cumulative prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose in the sarilumab arm (median 777 mg) was lower compared to placebo (median 2044 mg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary end point was the proportion of patients with sustained remission at Week 52. Sustained remission was defined as achievement of disease remission no later than Week 12, absence of disease flare from Week 12 through Week 52, sustained reduction of CRP (to &lt;10 mg/L) from Week 12 through Week 52 and successful adherence to prednisone taper from Week 12 through Week 52. Other endpoints included total cumulative corticosteroid dose over 52 weeks, time to first PMR flare, and patient reported outcomes.

## Clinical Response

A greater proportion of patients in the sarilumab arm achieved sustained remission at Week 52 compared to the placebo arm (p=0.0193). At 52 weeks, a higher proportion of patients in the sarilumab arm achieved each component of the sustained remission endpoint compared to placebo. The cumulative corticosteroid dose during the 52-week treatment period was lower in the sarilumab arm compared to placebo (see Table 8).

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Kevzara (sarilumab) in all subsets of the paediatric population in polymyalgia rheumatica (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Kevzara (sarilumab) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Rheumatoid arthritis

The pharmacokinetics of sarilumab were characterised in 2186 adult patients with RA treated with sarilumab which included 751 patients treated with 150 mg and 891 patients treated with 200 mg subcutaneous doses every two weeks for up to 52 weeks.

## Absorption

The absolute bioavailability for sarilumab after SC injection was estimated to be 80% by population PK analysis. The median tmax  after a single subcutaneous dose was observed in 2 to 4 days. After multiple dosing of 150 to 200 mg every two weeks, steady state was reached in 12 to 16 weeks with a 2- to 3-fold accumulation compared to single dose exposure.

For the 150 mg every two weeks dose regimen, the estimated mean (± standard deviation, SD) steadystate area under curve (AUC), Cmin, and Cmax  of sarilumab were 210 ± 115 mg.day/L, 6.95 ± 7.60 mg/L, and 20.4 ± 8.27 mg/L, respectively.

For the 200 mg every two weeks dose regimen, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and Cmax  of sarilumab were 396 ± 194 mg.day/L, 16.7 ± 13.5 mg/L, and 35.4 ± 13.9 mg/L, respectively. In a usability study sarilumab exposure after 200 mg Q2W was slightly higher (Cmax + 24-34%, AUC(0-2w)  +7-21%) after use of a pre-filled pen compared to the pre-filled syringe.

## Distribution

In patients with RA, the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 8.3 L.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of sarilumab has not been characterised. As a monoclonal antibody sarilumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.

## Elimination

Sarilumab is eliminated by parallel linear and non-linear pathways. At higher concentrations, the elimination is predominantly through the linear, non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while at lower concentrations, non-linear saturable target-mediated elimination predominates. These parallel elimination pathways result in an initial half-life of 8 to 10 days, and at steady-state an effective halflife of 21 days is estimated.

After the last steady state dose of 150 mg and 200 mg sarilumab, the median times to non-detectable concentration are 30 and 49 days, respectively.

Monoclonal antibodies are not eliminated via renal or hepatic pathways.

## Linearity/non-linearity

A more than dose-proportional increase in pharmacokinetic exposure was observed in patients with RA. At steady state, exposure over the dosing interval measured by AUC increased approximately 2fold with a 1.33-fold increase in dose from 150 to 200 mg every two weeks.

## Interactions with CYP450 substrates

Simvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate. In 17 patients with RA, one week following a single 200-mg subcutaneous administration of sarilumab, exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid decreased by 45% and 36%, respectively (see section 4.5).

## Polymyalgia rheumatica

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of subcutaneous sarilumab in PMR patients was determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis including sparse Ctrough  observations collected from 58 PMR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients treated with repeated subcutaneous administration of sarilumab 200 mg every two weeks. For this dose regimen, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and Cmax of sarilumab were 551 ± 321 mg.day/L, 27.0 ± 21.5 mg/L, and 46.5 ± 23.0 mg/L, respectively.PK data analyses suggest the median time to steady state in PMR patients to be approximately 24 weeks. There was accumulation of sarilumab following subcutaneous administration, with an accumulation ratio of 5-6-fold based on the mean trough concentrations.

## Special populations

## Age, gender, ethnicity and body weight

Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult patients with RA (ranging in age from 18 to 88 years with 14% over 65 years) showed that age, gender and race did not meaningfully influence the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab.

Body weight influenced the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab in adult patients. In patients with higher body weight (&gt;100 kg) both 150 mg and 200 mg doses demonstrated efficacy; however, patients weighing &gt;100 kg had greater therapeutic benefit with the 200 mg dose.

## Renal impairment

No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was conducted. Mild to moderate renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment were not studied.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was conducted (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated-dose toxicity, carcinogenic risk assessment and toxicity to reproduction and development.

No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of sarilumab. The weight of evidence for IL6Rα inhibition mainly indicates anti -tumour effects mediated by multiple mechanisms predominantly involving STAT-3 inhibition. In vitro and in vivo studies with sarilumab using human tumour cell lines showed inhibition of STAT-3 activation and inhibition of tumour growth in human tumour xenograft animal models.

Fertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a murine surrogate antibody against mouse IL-6R α showed no impairment of fertility.

In an enhanced pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study, pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys were administered sarilumab once-weekly intravenously from early gestation to natural birth (approximately 21 weeks) Maternal exposure up to approximately 83 times the human exposure based on AUC after subcutaneous doses of 200 mg every 2 weeks, did not cause any maternal or embryo-foetal effects. Sarilumab had no effect on maintenance of pregnancy or on the neonates evaluated up to 1 month after birth in body weight measurements, in parameters of functional or morphological development including skeletal evaluations, in immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in microscopic evaluations. Sarilumab was detected in the serum of neonates up to 1 month. The excretion of sarilumab in Cynomolgus monkey's milk has not been studied.

## Posology

pJIA

The recommended posology in patients 2 years of age and older is 4 mg/kg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks in patients weighing 10 to less than 30 kg or 3 mg/kg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg.

Sarilumab can be used alone or in combination with MTX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sarilumab should be administered by subcutaneous injection and the dose should be calculated based on the patient's body weight (kg) at each administration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time (see Table 1).

Patients must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving sarilumab.

## Patients that transition from 4 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg given once every 2 weeks

For patients who initially receive the 4 mg/kg dose and weigh between 27.5 to &lt;39.5 kg, the 0.65 ml volume of injection must be maintained until the patient reaches 39.5 kg. At 39.5 kg, the patient must transition to the 3 mg/kg dose (see Table 1).

The dose is capped at 200 mg given once every 2 weeks for patients weighing at or above 63 kg.

Dose reduction of sarilumab has not been studied in the pJIA population. The decision to resume or discontinue sarilumab should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual patient. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other treatment should be modified or stopped.

## Missed dose

If a dose of sarilumab is missed and it has been 3 days or less since the missed dose, the next dose should be administered as soon as possible. The subsequent dose should be administered at the regularly scheduled time. If it has been 4 days or more since the missed dose, the subsequent dose should be administered at the next regularly scheduled time, the dose should not be doubled.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Sarilumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients with positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology (see section 4.4).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab in children less than 2 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

## Subcutaneous use.

Injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper arm) should be rotated with each injection. Sarilumab should not be injected into skin that is tender, damaged, or has bruises or scars.

## Vial

The vial is intended for administration by a healthcare professional only. The 175 mg/ml vial is a ready to use solution for injection which does not need to be diluted. Withdrawal of the dose from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe. The needle or syringe should not be re-used.

The contents of the sarilumab vial should not be mixed with, or transferred into, the content of another vial of sarilumab. The vial is for single use only. The unused portion must be discarded (see section 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Serious infections

Patients must be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with sarilumab (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly.

Sarilumab must not be administered in patients with an active infection, including localised infections. The risks and benefits should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients who have:

- chronic or recurrent infection;
- a history of serious or opportunistic infections;
- HIV infection;
- underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection;
- been exposed to tuberculosis; or
- lived in or travelled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses.

Treatment with sarilumab must be withheld if a patient develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection. Once the infection is controlled, treatment with sarilumab may be re-initiated at the discretion of the healthcare professional.

A patient who develops an infection during treatment should also undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored.

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including sarilumab for RA. The most frequently observed serious infections with sarilumab in RA patients included pneumonia and cellulitis (see section 4.8). Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystis were reported with sarilumab. In isolated cases, disseminated rather than localised infections were observed in patients often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as MTX or corticosteroids, which in addition to RA may predispose them to infections.

## Tuberculosis

Patients must be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating treatment with sarilumab. Patients with latent or active tuberculosis must be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating treatment. Anti-tuberculosis therapy must be considered prior to initiation of treatment in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Healthcare professionals are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. When considering anti-tuberculosis therapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in tuberculosis may be appropriate.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Viral reactivation

Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies. Cases of herpes zoster were observed in clinical studies with sarilumab (see section 4.8). No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation were reported in the clinical studies; however patients who were at risk for reactivation were excluded.

## Laboratory parameters

## Neutrophil count

Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in ANC (see section 4.8). Decrease in ANC was not associated with higher incidence of infections, including serious infections.

- Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e., ANC less than 2 x 10 9 /L. In patients who develop an ANC less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L, it is recommended to discontinue treatment with sarilumab (see section 4.2).
- Neutrophil count must be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to clinical judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC results, see section 4.2.
- Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC, results obtained at the end of the dosing interval should be used when considering dose modification (see section 5.1).

## Platelet count

Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies. Reduction in platelets was not associated with bleeding events (see section 4.8).

- Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below 150 x10 3 /µL. In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50 x 10 3 / µL, treatment with sarilumab must be discontinued.
- Platelet count must be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to clinical judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on platelet counts, see section 4.2.

## Liver enzymes

Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with sarilumab.

Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with elevated transaminases, ALT or AST greater than 1.5 x ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT greater than 5 x ULN, treatment with sarilumab must be discontinued (see section 4.2).

ALT and AST levels must be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. When clinically indicated, consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin. For recommended dose modifications based on transaminase elevations, see section 4.2.

## Lipid abnormalities

Lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Treatment with sarilumab was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or triglycerides (see section 4.8). Lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment with sarilumab, then at approximately 6 month intervals. Patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia.

## Gastrointestinal perforation and diverticulitis

Cases of gastrointestinal perforation and diverticulitis have been reported in association with sarilumab. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients with and without diverticulitis. Patients presenting with symptoms potentially indicative of diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gastrointestinal haemorrhage and/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early identification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation. Sarilumab should be used with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis (see section 4.8).

## Malignancies

Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. The impact of treatment with sarilumab on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with sarilumab (see section 4.8) . Injection site rash, rash, and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients must be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Sarilumab must be stopped immediately (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Vaccinations

Concurrent use of live vaccines as well as live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment with sarilumab as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving sarilumab. Prior to initiating treatment, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.

## Cardiovascular risk

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) should be managed as part of usual standard of care.

## Polysorbate 20 (E 432)

This medicinal product contains 2.28 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1.14 ml of solution for injection which is equivalent to 2 mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Sarilumab exposure was not affected when coadministered with MTX based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses and across study comparisons. MTX exposure is not expected to be changed by sarilumab coadministration; however, no clinical data was collected. Sarilumab has not been investigated in combination with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

drug levels compared to subjects without RA. Blockade of IL-6 signalling by IL6Rα antagonists such as sarilumab might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered medicinal products concentrations.

The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by sarilumab may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of sarilumab in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or concentration of the medicinal product (e.g., theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.

Caution should be exercised in patients who start sarilumab treatment while on therapy with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., oral contraceptives or statins), as sarilumab may reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP3A4 activity, leading to decreased exposure and activity of CYP3A4 substrate (see section 5.2). Interaction of sarilumab with substrates of other CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP2D6) has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment (see section 4.5).

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sarilumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Sarilumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with sarilumab.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether sarilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. The excretion of sarilumab in milk has not been studied in animals (see section 5.3). Because IgG1 are excreted in human milk , a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue sarilumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No data are available on the effect of sarilumab on human fertility. Animal studies showed no impairment of male or female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Kevzara has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Paediatric population

Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA) Summary of the safety profile

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (36.6%), neutropenia (31.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (14.0%), injection site erythema (9.7%), pharyngitis (9.7%) and alanine aminotransferase increased (9.7%).

## Infections

In the pJIA study, the rate of infections was 146.6 events per 100 patient-years. The most common infections observed were nasopharyngitis (36.6%) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) (14.0%). The majority of nasopharyngitis and URTI events were mild.

## Injection Site Reactions

In the pJIA study, injection site reactions (ISRs) occurred in 13 (14.0%) patients and the most commonly reported ISR was injection site erythema (9.7%). The majority of these events were mild and none of the ISRs required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption.

## Laboratory abnormalities

## Neutrophil count

In the pJIA study, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 10/52 (19.2%) patients weighing in ≥30 kg and 20/41 (48.8%) patients weighing 10 to &lt;30 kg. The frequency of decreased neutrophil count was higher until Week 12. Decrease in ANC was not associated with an occurrence of infections, including serious infections.

## Monocyte count

In the pJIA study, decrease in monocyte counts occurred in 4 (4.3%) patients and were mild in severity and non-serious.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Liver enzymes

In the pJIA study, one (1.1%) patient had ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Nine (9.7%) patients overall had ALT increase and majority were mild in severity and all were nonserious

## Lipids

In the pJIA study, triglyceride levels of ≥150 mg/dL (1 x ULN) were observed in one (1.1%) patient. Three (3.2%) patients overall had elevation in triglycerides, and all were mild in severity and nonserious. No significant changes in mean LDL, HDL or total cholesterol were observed during the entire 156-week treatment period.

## Immunogenicity

In the pJIA population, 3 (4.3%) patients treated with the recommended dose exhibited an antidrug antibody (ADA) response. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in one pJIA patient with ADA response. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of antibodies on the safety, and/or effectiveness of sarilumab is unknown.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for Kevzara overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be closely monitored, treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC14

## Mechanism of action

Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype) that specifically binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R α ), and inhibits IL-6-mediated signalling which involves ubiquitous signal-transducing glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT-3).

In functional human cell-based assays, sarilumab was able to block the IL-6 signalling pathway, measured as STAT-3 inhibition, only in the presence of IL-6.

IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates diverse cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis and can activate hepatocytes to release acute-phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and joint destruction which are hallmarks of RA and pJIA. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as migration and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

activation of T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and osteoclasts leading to systemic inflammation, synovial inflammation, and bone erosion in patients with RA and pJIA.

The activity of sarilumab in reducing inflammation is associated with laboratory changes such as decrease in ANC and elevation in lipids (see section 4.4).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Following single-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg in patients with RA rapid reduction of CRP levels was observed. Levels were reduced to normal as early as 4 days after treatment initiation. Following single-dose sarilumab administration, in patients with RA, ANC decreased to the nadir between 3 to 4 days and thereafter recovered towards baseline (see section 4.4). Treatment with sarilumab resulted in decreases in fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, and increases in haemoglobin and serum albumin. In patients with pJIA, decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and neutrophil count were observed after sarilumab administration.

## Clinical efficacy

## Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)

Supportive efficacy and safety data were assessed in a multicentre, open-label, two-phase study in patients aged 2 to 17 years of age with polyarticular- juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) diagnosed according to American College Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria who had an inadequate response to current therapy. This study was divided into a dose range finding portion and a confirmatory portion. Three doses were investigated in the 12-week core treatment phase of the dose range finding portion. Following the dose selection, patients were enrolled to receive the recommended dose [3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (q2w) in 42 patients weighing ≥30 kg (Group A) and 4 mg/kg q2w in 31 patients weighing ≥10 kg and &lt;30 kg (Group B)]. A total of 101 patients were treated, including 73 patients who received the recommended dose regimen from baseline and 20 patients who had their dose switched to the recommended dose during the study.

The efficacy of sarilumab in paediatric patients with pJIA is based on pharmacokinetic (PK) extrapolation and the established efficacy of sarilumab in RA patients. The extrapolation is further supported by the efficacy evaluation that was conducted and based on JIA ACR 70 and 90 response rate, change from baseline for Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-27 (JADAS), and proportion of patients with clinical remission. Efficacy was assessed up to 48 weeks in the 73 patients that received the recommended dose from baseline.

Of these 73 patients, baseline mean disease duration and JADAS-27 were 2.48 years and 22.73, respectively. At baseline, 84.9% of patients had received at least one csDMARD (mainly MTX), 13.7% received systemic glucocorticoids, and 19.2% had prior treatment with biological DMARDs (mainly TNFi). The patients treated had subtypes of JIA that, at disease onset, included rheumatoid factor positive (17.8%), negative polyarticular JIA (65.8%), or extended oligoarticular JIA (16.4%).

## Clinical response

JIA ACR responses were seen as early as Week 2. The proportion of patients with JIA ACR 70 response rate were 76.7% and 87.7% at Week 12 and Week 48, respectively, and JIA ACR 90 response rate were 42.5% and 69.9% at Week 12 and Week 48, respectively.

Change from baseline in JADAS-27 CRP was -17.46 at Week 12 and -20.75 at Week 48 for the patients on the recommended dose. At Week 48, 51.6% of patients on the recommended dose were in remission (inactive disease per Wallace criteria for 6 consecutive months).

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Kevzara (sarilumab) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(including rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Paediatric population

## Polyarticular- juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)

The pharmacokinetics of sarilumab in pJIA patients was characterized by observed and population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 101 paediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age who were treated with repeated subcutaneous doses of sarilumab.

For 3 mg/kg sarilumab (patients with a body weight ≥30 kg) given every 2 weeks, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin, and Cmax of sarilumab were 294 ± 148 mg.day/L, 9.84 ± 6.35 mg/L, and 29.2 ± 15.0 mg/L, respectively by population PK analysis.

For 4 mg/kg sarilumab (patients with a body weight 10 to &lt;30 kg) given every 2 weeks, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin, and Cmax of sarilumab were 375 ± 102 mg.day/L, 14.5 ± 8.56 mg/L, and 37.3 ± 8.10 mg/L, respectively by population PK analysis.

Consistent with RA adult patients, sarilumab is eliminated by parallel linear and non-linear pathways, in pJIA patients, these parallel elimination pathways result in an initial half-life of 5 to 7 days.  Time to steady state was about 10 weeks longer compared to RA adult patients. Following subcutaneous administration at Week 48, accumulation ratio was approximately 5-fold based on the observed mean trough concentrations (11.6 mg/L and 14.2 mg/L) compared to single dose exposure (2.24 mg/L and 3.10 mg/L) for 3 and 4 mg/kg q2w, respectively. Steady state concentrations were within the range of exposures in adult RA patients following 200 mg every 2 weeks.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated-dose toxicity, carcinogenic risk assessment and toxicity to reproduction and development.

No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of sarilumab. The weight of evidence for IL6Rα inhibition mainly indicates anti -tumour effects mediated by multiple mechanisms predominantly involving STAT-3 inhibition. In vitro and in vivo studies with sarilumab using human tumour cell lines showed inhibition of STAT-3 activation and inhibition of tumour growth in human tumour xenograft animal models.

Fertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a murine surrogate antibody against mouse IL-6R α showed no impairment of fertility.

In an enhanced pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study, pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys were administered sarilumab once-weekly intravenously from early gestation to natural birth (approximately 21 weeks) Maternal exposure up to approximately 83 times the human exposure based on AUC after subcutaneous doses of 200 mg every 2 weeks, did not cause any maternal or embryo-foetal effects. Sarilumab had no effect on maintenance of pregnancy or on the neonates evaluated up to 1 month after birth in body weight measurements, in parameters of functional or morphological development including skeletal evaluations, in immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in microscopic evaluations. Sarilumab was detected in the serum of neonates up to 1 month. The excretion of sarilumab in Cynomolgus monkey's milk has not been studied.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Kevzara 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Kevzara 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

sarilumab

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

In addition to this leaflet, you will be given a patient card, which contains important safety information that you need before and during treatment with Kevzara.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Kevzara is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Kevzara
3. How to use Kevzara
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Kevzara
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Kevzara is and what it is used for

## What Kevzara is

Kevzara contains the active substance sarilumab. It is a type of protein called a monoclonal antibody.

## What Kevzara is used for

Kevzara is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) if previous therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Kevzara can be used alone or together with a medicine called methotrexate.

## It may help you by:

- slowing down damage to joints
- improving your ability to perform daily activities.

Kevzara is used to treat adults with polymyalgia rheumatica after corticosteroids have been used and did not work well or if you experience a relapse while decreasing the dose of corticosteroids (taper). Kevzara can be used alone or together with a medicine called corticosteroid.

## How Kevzara works

- Kevzara attaches to another protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks its action.
- IL-6 plays a major role in the symptoms of RA such as pain, swollen joints, morning stiffness, and fatigue.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Kevzara

## Do not use Kevzara:

- if you are allergic to sarilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have an active severe infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:

- you have any infection or you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to fight infection: this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your infection worse.
- You have tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, your doctor will check you for TB.
- You have had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do a blood test to check your liver function.
- You have had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.
- You have ever had any type of cancer.
- You have recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Kevzara.

You will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You will also have the tests during your treatment. This is to check for low blood cell count, liver problems, or changes in your cholesterol levels.

Every time youget a new pack of Kevzara, it is important you note down the name of the medicine, the date of the administration and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot') and keep this information in a safe place.

## Children and adolescents

The Kevzara pre-filled syringe has not been studied in children 2 years of age and older with pJIA and is not intended for use in children.

Kevzara is not recommended in children under 2 years of age. Kevzara must not be given to children with pJIA weighing less than 10 kg.

## Other medicines and Kevzara

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. This is because Kevzara can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Kevzara works.

In particular, do not use Kevzara and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using:

- a group of medicines called 'Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors' (used for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer)
- other biological medicines used in the treatment of RA

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Kevzara can affect the way some medicines work: this means the dose of other medicines may need changing. If you are using any of the following medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Kevzara:

- statins, used to reduce cholesterol level
- oral contraceptives
- theophylline, used to treat asthma
- warfarin, used to prevent blood clots.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Talk to your doctor before using Kevzara if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not take Kevzara if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it.
- The effects of Kevzara on an unborn baby are not known.
- You and your doctor should decide if you should use Kevzara if you are breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

The use of Kevzara is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you are feeling tired or unwell after you use Kevzara, you should not drive or use machines.

## KEVZARA contains polysorbate 20

This medicine contains 2.28 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1.14 ml of solution for injection which is equivalent to 2 mg/ml. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How to use Kevzara

Treatment should be started by a doctor experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA or polymyalgia rheumatica. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Adult patients

The recommended dose is one 200 mg injection every two weeks.

- Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medicine based on results of blood tests.

Kevzara is given as an injection under the skin (called 'subcutaneous' injection).

## Learning how to use the pre-filled syringe

- Your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will show you how to inject Kevzara. Following these instructions, Kevzara can be self-injected or administered by a care-giver after proper training.
- Carefully follow the 'Instructions for Use' provided in the carton.
- Use the pre-filled syringe exactly as described in the 'Instructions for Use'.

## If you use more Kevzara than you should

If you have used more Kevzara than you should, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## If you miss a dose of Kevzara

If it has been 3 days or less since the missed dose:

- inject your missed dose as soon as you can.
- then inject your next dose at your regular time.

If it has been 4 days or more, inject the next dose at your regular time. Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection.

If you are unsure when to inject your next dose: ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for instructions.

## If you stop using Kevzara

Do not stop using Kevzara without talking to your doctor.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.

## 1. What Kevzara is and what it is used for

## What Kevzara is

Kevzara contains the active substance sarilumab. It is a type of protein - called a 'monoclonal antibody'.

## What Kevzara is used for

Kevzara is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) if previous therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Kevzara can be used alone or together with a medicine called MTX.

It may help you by:

- slowing down damage to joints
- improving your ability to perform daily activities.

Kevzara is used to treat adults with polymyalgia rheumatica after corticosteroids have been used and did not work well or if you experience a relapse while decreasing the dose of corticosteroids (taper). Kevzara can be used alone or together with a medicine called corticosteroid.

## How Kevzara works

- Kevzara attaches to another protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks its action.
- IL-6 plays a major role in the symptoms of RA such as pain, swollen joints, morning stiffness, and fatigue.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Kevzara

## Do not use Kevzara:

- if you are allergic to sarilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have an active severe infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:

- you have any infection or, you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to fight infection and this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your infection worse.
- you have tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, your doctor will check you for TB.
- you have had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do a blood test to check your liver function.
- you have had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.
- you have ever had any type of cancer.
- you have recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Kevzara.

You will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You will also have the tests during your treatment. This is to check if you have a low blood cell count, liver problems, or changes in your cholesterol levels.

Every time you get a new pack of Kevzara, it is important you note down the name of the medicine, the date of the administration and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot') and keep this information in a safe place.

## Children and adolescents

The Kevzara pre-filled pen has not been studied in children 2 years of age and older with pJIA and is not intended for use in children.

Kevzara is not recommended in children under 2 years of age. Kevzara must not be given to children with pJIA weighing less than 10 kg.

## Other medicines and Kevzara

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. This is because Kevzara can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Kevzara works.

In particular, do not use Kevzara and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using:

- a group of medicines called 'Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors' (used for disease like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer)
- other biological medicines used in the treatment of RA.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Kevzara can affect the way some medicines work: this means the dose of other medicines may need changing. If you are using any of the following medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Kevzara:

- statins, used to reduce cholesterol level
- oral contraceptives
- theophylline, used to treat asthma
- warfarin, used to prevent blood clots

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not take Kevzara if you are pregnant - unless your doctor specifically recommends it.
- The effects of Kevzara on an unborn baby are not known.

## Driving and using machines

The use of Kevzara is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you are feeling tired or unwell after you use Kevzara, you should not drive or use machines.

## KEVZARA contains polysorbate 20

This medicine contains 2.28 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1.14 mL of solution for injection which is equivalent to 2 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How to use Kevzara

- you/your child have/has any infection or, you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to fight infection and this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your infection worse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you/your child have/has tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, your doctor will check you for TB.
- you/your child have/has had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do a blood test to check your liver function.
- you/your child have/has had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.
- you/your child have/has ever had any type of cancer.
- you/your child have/has recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination.

If any of the above apply to you/your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Kevzara.

You/your child will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You/your child will also have the tests during your treatment. This is to check if you have a low blood cell count, liver problems, or changes in your cholesterol levels.
