1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

|           | from the Netherlands describing the impact of a single dose of Nimenrix on the prevention of meningococcal disease. In addition, a cross- reference to section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC was included, to direct the physicians attention to the robust persistence and booster data in section 5.1 and information in section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include minor editorial changes to the SmPC and to bring the Product information in line with the latest QRD update. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |            |             | In 2018, the Netherlands added Nimenrix to the national immunisation programme as a single dose for toddlers at 14 months of age to replace the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine. A catch-up campaign with a single dose of Nimenrix for adolescents 14-18 years of age also initiated in 2018, and it became routine in 2020 leading to a toddler and adolescent national immunisation programme. Within two years, the incidence of meningococcal disease caused by groups C, W, and Y was significantly reduced by 100% (95% CI: 14, 100) in individuals 14-18 years of age, 85% (95% CI: 32, 97) in all vaccine eligible ages (direct effect), and 50% (95% CI: 28, 65) in non-vaccine eligible ages (indirect effect). The impact of Nimenrix was primarily driven by a reduction in group W disease. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.   |

| Grouping of variations to support the registration of a new vial/vial presentation (EU/1/12/767/008) to replace the existing vial/ampoule presentations. As a consequence of the introduction of the new vial/vial presentation, the vial/ampoule presentations (EU/1/12/767/005-006-007) are being withdrawn. Hence, the 0.9% NaCl Diluent in ampoules (primary packaging container) as currently manufactured at Delpharm Belgium is withdrawn, as well as the associated secondary packaging site (CRNA Belgium) used for the related pack-size. This grouping of variations supports the introduction of Pfizer Puurs Belgium as a manufacturing and quality control site for the 0.9% NaCl Diluent in vials used for MenACWY-TT Drug Product reconstitution for the new vial/vial presentation. In addition, release specifications have been updated to align with compendial requirements. Product Information (PI) revisions in line with the above changes affect Annex I, IIIA and IIIB, as well as Annex A (All Authorised Presentations). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to align SmPC section 4.4 and Annex II with the latest QRD requirement.

[…] One month after co-administration with a combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap) in subjects aged 9 to 25 years, lower GMCs were observed to each pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN]). More than 98% of subjects had anti- PT, FHA or PRN concentrations above the assay cut-off thresholds. The clinical relevance of these observations is unknown. There was no impact of co-administration on immune responses to Nimenrix or the tetanus or diphtheria antigens included in Tdap. The PL (section 2) has been updated accordingly.

| II/0053 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect new booster and persistence data with a follow-up of up to 5 years after vaccination with MenACWY-TT. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 7.1 was agreed during the procedure. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/07/2016 | 22/08/2016 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Nimenrix may be given as a booster dose in individuals who have previously received primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other conjugated or plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines. In clinical trials, the use of Nimenrix as a booster following primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other meningococcal vaccines (quadrivalent meningococcal A, C, W, and Y-DT conjugate vaccine or monovalent MenC conjugate vaccines) was evaluated. Nimenrix booster vaccination after priming in toddlers, children, adolescents and adults: For subjects primed with Nimenrix aged 1 year and above and boosted with Nimenrix 4 or 5 years later, more than 99.0% of all subjects achieved post-booster SBA titres 1:8 for both assays (studies MenACWY-TT-062, 048, 059, 088). One month after the booster vaccination, the GMTs elicited were significantly higher than those elicited by age matched naïve control groups, indicating that Nimenrix induces immune memory to groups A, C, W-135, and Y. The observed MenC booster response with Nimenrix was similar to that observed in subjects primed and boosted with a monovalent MenC-CRM conjugate vaccine. One year after Nimenrix booster, SBA titres 1:8 persisted in at least 95.5% of subjects (study MenACWY-TT-048, 12 to 23 months of age at primary vaccination).

The local and general adverse reaction profile of a booster dose of Nimenrix after primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other conjugated or plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines, was similar to the local and general adverse reaction profile observed after primary vaccination with Nimenrix, except gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea) which were very common.   |

| II/0040             | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC based on the results of a re-analysis that was performed excluding immunogenicity data from subjects impacted by GCP deviations for studies MenACWY-TT-036, MenACWY- TT-043 and MenACWY-TT-038, and which included antibody persistence Year 3- and Year 4- results from study MenACWY-TT-043, and Year 4- results for study MenACWY-TT-032. Further, the pooling of clinical safety data in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated, and section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated with removal of the sentence on the need for a booster dose for increased clarity. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 26/03/2015 | 28/07/2015 | SmPC | The information in section 5.1 of the SmPC for 3 of the original Nimenrix studies has been updated as a consequence of the reanalysis of data following issues identified with GCP. The MAH has excluded data from subjects who had not been properly consented, or where serological data was missing. This includes 119 subjects from MenACWY-TT-036 (out of a total of 1025 subjects), 106 subjects from MenACWY-TT-038 (out of a total of 1501 subjects), and 9 subjects from MenACWY-TT-043 (out of a total of 689 subjects). The reason for the majority of exclusions from MenACWY-TT-036 and MenACWY-TT-038 was consent issues, rather than missing serological data. Furthermore, data from Years 3 and 4 in study MenACWY- TT-036 show persistent immunogenicity in adolescents. Persistence results from study MenACWY-TT-032 (Years 4 and 5 in toddlers) have also been updated to try to minimise the potential of selection bias, since subjects with rSBA MenC titres <8 before Year 4 were offered revaccination and excluded from later time points.

It is agreed that this presentation of the immunogenicity data is more meaningful, and more accurately describes the persistence of response through Years 4 and 5. The MAH has also presented updated pooled safety information including data from two additional studies. An update without data from excluded sites following issues identified with GCP has also been presented. These updates do not significantly affect the reporting rates of solicited or unsolicited symptoms in either age-group. The variation does not have any impact on the overall benefit risk balance of Nimenrix, which remains positive.   |
