## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Acute myeloid leukemia

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and accounts for ~80% of all cases of acute leukaemia [1]. Worldwide, there are approximately 260,000 new cases of AML each year [2]. With an average incidence of 1 to 3 cases per 100,000 individuals [2], roughly 7000 to 21,000 cases can be estimated per year in Europe. Incidence increases with age and peaks in adults 65 years of age or older [1]. Slightly more than half of all patients are ≥ 60 years of age [3]. Despite recent developments in understanding the scientific basis of AML and its treatment, there has been little progress in increasing the long-term survival rates in AML patients. If left untreated most patients  with  AML will die from their disease. If patients are treated, the 5-year survival rate from time  of  diagnosis  is  ~20%  [4].  With  standard  treatments,  there  is  a  high  rate  of  first  remission  for patients with de novo (previously untreated) AML, however, ~75% of these patients will ultimately suffer a relapse, in most cases within 2 years [5].

The  basic  therapeutic  approach  to  AML  treatment  has  changed  little  over  the  last  20  years.  The approach classically involves 2 separate treatment phases:

- (1)  induction chemotherapy, with a standard regimen of 3 days of an anthracycline and 7 days of cytarabine, aims at inducing a temporary bone marrow hypoplasia and the regeneration of the normal haematopoietic clone.
- (2)  consolidation  therapy,  which  consist  of  multiple  courses  of  intensive  consolidation  therapy which can be haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or high or intermediate does of cytarabine, aims at reducing the undetectable burden of leukemic cells to a level low enough that long-term disease- free survival (ie, a cure) might be possible.

With standard induction chemotherapy, complete remission is obtained in nearly 70% of the patients [5-7].  For  consolidation  therapy,  the  most  effective  antileukemic  approach  is  allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation (SCT). However, this technique carries a high risk of initial mortality and a significant risk of long-term morbidity associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease, which tends to offset the therapeutic  benefits  of  a  low  likelihood  of  relapse.  Chemotherapeutic-based  approaches  with  or without  autologous  stem  cell  rescue  can  be  performed  relatively  safely,  but  the  risk  of  disease recurrence remains high. Patients with relapsed AML have a particularly poor prognosis.  A number of cytotoxic agents and combination regimens have been used for salvage chemotherapy and remission rates  from  20  -  70  %  have  been  described.  However,  the  period  of  remission  lasts  only  typically between 4-6 months.

Currently, authorised drugs for the treatment of AML in the EU include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, cytararabine, mitoxantrone, all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide.

## About the product

Gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  (CMA-676)  is  a  humanized  (CDR-grafted)  IgG4  isotype  monoclonal antibody against the CD33 antigen (hP67.6) that is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin  dimethyl  hydrazide  (NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH)  via  the  bifunctional  AcBut linker. The hP67.6 antibody (non-cytotoxic by itself) binds to the CD33 antigen, is internalised and, hence,  delivers  the  calicheamicin  derivative  to  the  inside  of  the  leukaemic  cell  [16-21].  The  CD33 antigen is expressed on the external surface of normal and leukaemic myeloid cells, and leukaemic blasts in more than 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but not on normal precursor haematopoietic  cells  [10,  11].  The  antibody  linked  to  the  conjugate  is  internalized  into  lysosomes, where  acidification  releases  the  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH  moiety.  The  latter  undergoes spontaneous  reaction  with  reduced  glutathione  (GSH)  within  the  cell,  where  it  is  activated  and  the anti-tumour  effect  can  occur  [12].  The  calicheamicins  are  potent  anti-tumour  antibiotics  that  were initially  identified  by  their  ability  to  damage  DNA  in  screening  tests  [13].  Their  anti-tumour mechanism is thought to occur by binding to the minor groove in the DNA and producing site-specific

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

double-strand  breaks  by  forming  p-benzene  diradical  [14,  15].  This  results  in  the  death  of  the leukaemic cell.

Mylotarg was approved by the FDA, in the USA in May 2000 for the treatment of AML patients who suffer from a first relapse, are ≥ 60 years old and are not candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. As a post-approval commitment, the applicant committed to carrying out a randomised consolidation study in de novo AML, which is still ongoing. Mylotarg was also approved in Japan in July 2005 for the indication of relapsed or refractory CD33 positive AML.

An  Orphan  Drug  Designation  based  on  significant  benefit  was  issued  18  October  2000  for  the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (EU/3/00/005). The current proposed indication is within the designation.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) is a chemotherapy medicinal product containing a recombinant humanised IgG4 kappa antibody linked to calicheamicin, a cytotoxic anti-tumour antibiotic isolated from fermentation of a bacterium. The antibody portion of Mylotarg binds specifically to the CD33 antigen. This antigen is expressed on the surface of leukaemic blasts in more than 80% of patients with acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML).  Upon  binding  to  the  CD33  antigen,  the  calicheamicin-CD33 complex is internalised within the leukaemia cell and calicheamicin is released from the conjugate via hydrolysis in the lysosome. The released calicheamicin then binds to the minor groove of the DNA causing site-specific double-strand breaks via the formation of a p-benzene di-radical. This ultimately leads to cell death by apoptosis.

## Active Substance

The  active  substance,  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin,  is  an  antibody-targeted  chemotherapeutic  agent comprised of three different parts:

- A.  a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody (hereafter termed 'hP67.6') conjugated to
- B. the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide (NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH) via
- C. a bifunctional linker.

The hP67.6 antibody, which is non-cytotoxic by itself, is directed against the CD33 antigen.

## 1. hP67.6 monoclonal antibody drug substance intermediate

## Manufacture

The  monoclonal  antibody  ('hP67.6')  is  manufactured  by  an  approved  manufacturer  in  compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).

The  hP67.6  antibody  is  produced  by  humanisation  of  the  anti-CD33  murine  antibody  hP67.6  by complementarity  determining  region  grafting  (CDR  grafting).  The  resulting  hP67.6  antibody  is  a genetically  engineered  human  IgG4  kappa  antibody,  which  contains  sequences  derived  from  the murine antibody in the antigen-binding region only to minimise human anti-murine antibody response. The IgG4 isotype was chosen because it has the longest circulating half-life of all isotypes and is least likely  to  participate  in  immune-mediated  mechanisms  such  as  complement  fixation  and  antibodydependent cellular toxicity.

The  established  cell  banking  system  is  adequate  for  the  reliable  manufacturing  of  a  monoclonal antibody. Criteria for the establishment of new WCB were provided. The cell bank testing is adequate. The development of the cell line, the creation of the cell bank and its testing follow a scientifically sound scheme and were sufficiently described. Generally the requirements of the relevant guidelines are met.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  the  control  of  source  and  starting  materials  has  been  adequately  documented.  Materials  of animal/human origin used in the manufacturing process of hP67.6 are described below (in the section 'adventitious agents'). Overall, materials used in the manufacturing process are adequately controlled.

The  transfected  recombinant  murine  plasmacytoma  cell  line  (designated  as  KD1)  is  grown  as  a suspension  culture  in  a  fed-batch  process.  The  fermentation  and  harvest  of  hP67.6  antibody  is straightforward and has been adequately described. The hP67.6 antibody purification process includes two  chromatographic  columns  including  a  Protein  A  chromatography  step).  Viral  inactivation  is obtained  by  low  pH  treatment  and  viral  DV50  nanofiltration.  In-process  controls,  including  control limits, are in place during fermentation, harvest and purification. The manufacturing process and inprocess  controls  have  been  sufficiently  described.  Establishment  of  controls  for  critical  steps  and intermediates are described in detail.

Process validation studies were presented demonstrating that the full-scale hP67.6 fermentation and purification  process  can  achieve  lot-to-lot  consistency  and  reproducibility.  The  contribution  of  each step of the purification process to the removal of impurities derived from the hybridoma cell line and the  culture  media  has  been  demonstrated,  showing a high and consistent removal of the impurities. Further, it has been shown, by a variety of methods, that the hP67.6 antibody integrity is not affected by the purification process.

A  detailed  and  adequate  rationale  for  the  changes  introduced  to  the  manufacturing  process  during development has been provided. It has been shown that changes (change in cell line, introduction of viral  filtration  step  and  introduction  of  recombinant  protein  A  resin)  were  without  influence  on  the quality of the hP67.6 antibody.

The applicant presented a comprehensive structural and functional profile of the antibody, primarily obtained  using  a  combination  of  chromatographic,  electrophoretic  and  mass  spectrometry  (MS) techniques.  Overall  the  hP67.6  antibody  has  bee  carefully  characterised  using  a  wide  range  of methods.

## Specifications

The analytical methods used in the release control of the hP67.6 antibody intermediate are to a great extent based on non- or semi-quantitative electrophoresis methods. More quantitative methods, such as chromatographic methods are only used to a limited extent. This is acceptable in view of the tests performed on the active substance, i.e. the conjugated antibody. The hP67.6 antibody characterisation study  clearly  revealed  that  several  varying  forms  of  the  antibody  exist  as  well  as  the  presence  of aggregated  forms  and  charge  variants  (determined  by  isoelectric  focusing).  This  variability  is controlled to some extent at the level of the unconjugated hP67.7 antibody and further at the level of the conjugated antibody.

Non-compendial analytical methods used for release testing have been specifically validated for use with the hP67.6 antibody. Batch results from a total of 54 lots have been provided. The data from the batches have met the acceptance criteria of the product specification in place at the time the batches were manufactured.

The level of host cell proteins (HCP) is measured using a semi-quantitative western blot assay which has  been  sufficiently  validated.  The  Applicant  also  performed  a  study  with  a  quantitative  ELISA method which confirmed the low levels of HCP found using the western blot assay. The Applicant provided a post-marketing commitment to implement the ELISA method for release of the antibody.

The  analytical  methods  used  for  release  testing  of  the  hP67.6  antibody  have  been  satisfactorily described and validated. The chosen test parameters and limits have been adequately justified with reference to development data, batch analysis and/or stability data.

## Stability

The requested shelf life for the hP67.6 antibody is adequately supported by stability data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Activated calicheamicin drug substance intermediate

## Manufacture, specifications and stability

The activated calicheamicin intermediate is manufactured by an approved manufacturer.

The  nomenclature,  structure  and  general  properties  of  the  activated  calicheamicin  derivative  have been described satisfactorily. Calicheamicin is obtained by bacterial fermentation and the manufacturers  and  the  fermentation  process  with  subsequent  synthetic  steps  have  been  described satisfactorily.  The  producer  microorganism  and  the  raw  materials  used  in  the  fermentation  process and the subsequent synthetic steps are adequately controlled and adequate in-process controls have been established and control ranges are supported by satisfactory validation studies.

The molecular structures of the activated calicheamicin-derivative and related substances have been adequately characterised. The analytical methods used for release testing of activated calicheamicin have been satisfactorily described and validated and the presented batch analysis results indicate that the process is under control. The chosen test parameters and limits have been adequately justified on the  basis  of  batch  data  and  are  acceptable.  The  in-house  primary  reference  material  has  been adequately  characterised  and  the  chosen  container  closure  system  provides  adequate  protection  for this substance. Satisfactory stability evaluation has been performed. The proposed re-test period and storage  condition  are  acceptable,  when  the  activated  calicheamicin-derivative  is  stored  using  the proposed container closure system.

## 3. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin drug substance

The drug substance is manufactured and controlled by an approved manufacturer in compliance with GMP.

## Manufacture

The drug substance gemtuzumab ozogamicin is formed when activated calicheamicin is added to a solution of hP67.6 antibody. The reaction, results in the covalent attachment of activated calicheamicin to the antibody. The resulting active substance consists of a mixture of conjugated and unconjugated  hP67.6  antibody.  The  conjugated  molecules  differ  in  the  number  of  calicheamicin moieties attached to the hP67.6 antibody.

Conjugation invariably leads to the formation of some undesired aggregated protein. Size exclusion chromatography  is  used  to  separate  monomeric  antibody  conjugate  from  the  aggregated  material formed. Process derived impurities are separated from gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  during the purification process. Impurities are reduced to a low level during purification and are controlled by adequate release specifications.

Two  materials  of  biological  origin  are  used  during  the  manufacture  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin. These substances are produced from bovine milk of US origin and are adequately controlled (see also ' adventitious agents ').

Critical  in-process  controls  as  well  as  non-critical  controls  are  specified  for  the  conjugation  and purification process to assure a consistent production of the drug substance.

Three  consecutive  production  batches  were  manufactured  to  demonstrate  that  the  process  met validation  acceptance  criteria.  The  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  drug  substance  process  validation exercise was successfully completed, documenting the ability to consistently produce drug substance with  predictable  and  acceptable  product  quality.  The  properties  and  consistency  of  the  validation batches of drug substance upon manufacture were evaluated using a battery of release tests.

Gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  has  been  characterised  structurally  by  spectroscopic,  electrophoretic  and chromatographic assays, and characterised functionally by ELISA and immunoassays. All characterisation testing was conducted on reconstituted Mylotarg drug product because of the limited stability of the drug substance. Data shows that the conjugation reaction does not change the antibody

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

structure,  including  the  glycosylation.  Likewise,  it  has  been  shown  that  binding  of  the  monoclonal antibody to CD33 cells is not affected by the calicheamicin conjugation.

Comparability studies have been conducted to evaluate whether changes introduced to the manufacturing  process  had  any  impact  on  the  quality  of  the  drug  substance.  These  changes  were introduced in particular to optimise the conjugation process, to minimise aggregate formation, and to obtain  higher  yields.  The  conjugation  reaction  is  influenced  by  several  factors.  The  comparability studies cover the very first material produced up to commercial material and consist solely of release test results. Additional characterisation studies were not performed.

The drug substance consists of a mixture of unconjugated antibody and antibodies to which a varying number of calicheamicin moieties are linked. The number of conjugated calicheamicin moieties can vary.  The  presence  of  significant  amounts  of  unconjugated  antibody  in  the  drug  substance  was recognised late in the development program after the pivotal clinical trials had been completed and the manufacturing process had been validated, i.e. after 2001. As such, the unconjugated fraction was not tracked in the clinical batches nor was it considered during process development. Therefore the data available  from  the  currently  manufactured  batches  cannot  be  linked  to  the  material  used  in  clinical trials  performed  prior  to  2001  with  regard  to  distribution  of  conjugated  and  un-conjugated  hP67.6 antibodies. Full comparison of batches (n=78) produced after 2001, when the test for low conjugation fraction was introduced, showed good consistency with respect to the low conjugation fraction in the commercial product and it is considered that the manufacturing process guarantees consistency in this respect.

As a test  for  low  conjugated  antibodies  was  not  available  at  time  of  production  of  material  for  the clinical  trials  it  can  not  be  assured  that  the  level  of  low  conjugated  antibody  was  the  same  in  the material used in non-clinical and clinical studies as it is in the product to be placed on the market. However, in  general,  the  comparability  study  covering  the  very  first  non-clinical  and  early  clinical batches, clinical batches and the first production batches up to the current production batches shows reasonably  consistent  release  test  results  among  the  batches  despite  differences  in  the  production process. SDS-PAGE analysis shows a higher purity and a lower level of aggregates in the commercial material  compared  to  the  very  first  batches  used  in  non-clinical  and  early  clinical  material.  On  the other hand, different concentrations of calicheamicin have been used in the conjugation reaction in the past compared  to the commercial  production process. At least in theory, the difference in concentrations of calicheamicin could have an impact on the calicheamicin conjugation level. In this respect it is noted that the proposed specification for the low conjugated fraction has been in place for several years for commercial lots placed on the market in the USA Since the assessment of the clinical efficacy and safety data did not reveal any signals related to the level of unconjugated antibody, there is sufficient reassurance over the clinical efficacy and safety with respect to the level of unconjugated antibody.

## Specifications

The  analytical  procedures  used  for  release  testing  include  state-of-the-art  methods  such  as  sodium dodecyl  sulfate  polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (SDS-PAGE),  isoelectric  focusing  (IEF),  high pressure  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  and  enzyme  linked  immunosorbant  assay  (ELISA).  These methods  have  been  appropriately  validated  and  are  adequate  for  the  assessment  of  the  active substance. The set of specification and limits were adequately justified on the basis of data obtained from numerous batches. All results were within specifications and the results are consistent, except for  the  very  first  non-clinical  and  clinical  batches,  which  had  a  lower  level  of  purity  as  shown  by SDS-PAGE and a higher level of aggregates and unconjugated calicheamicin.

The  specifications include aggregate and  unconjugated  calicheamicin  ozogamicin  as  well  as microbiological (endotoxins by LAL and bioburden) and general tests such as protein content. The non-reducing  SDS-PAGE  and  IEF  methods  used  for  identification  of  the  drug  substance  are  only qualitative  and  were  considered  insufficient.  Therefore,  following  the  request  from  CHMP  the applicant have  introduced  tests for peptide mapping  and  oligosaccharide  profiling to assure consistency of antibody variants. Potency is tested using a cytotoxicity assay and an immunoaffinity antigen binding ELISA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  specifications  proposed  for  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  are  considered  appropriate  to  ensure sufficient quality with respect to purity and level of impurities.

## Stability

Gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  drug  substance  has  limited  stability  and  it  is  therefore  shipped  to  the lyophilisation  site  immediately  after  manufacture  prior  to  the  completion  of  all  testing  and  formal release. Release of the resulting drug product batches is contingent upon acceptable results for drug substance release testing.

## Medicinal Product

Mylotarg  is  a  sterile,  white,  preservative-free  lyophilised  powder  containing  5  mg  of  gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a 20 ml amber vial. The inactive ingredients are Dextran 40, sucrose, sodium chloride, monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate. The finished product should be reconstituted with 5 ml of sterile  water  for  injections  which  is  not  provided  with  the  product.  The  reconstituted  product  is administered as an infusion following dilution in a solution of 0.9% sodium chloride.

## Pharmaceutical Development

The development of the lyophilised formulation has been thoroughly described and the rationale for the  selection  of  the  formulation  and  container  configuration  has  been  adequately  addressed  and justified.

## Manufacture

The finished  product  is  manufactured  by  an  approved  manufacturer  (fill  and  lyophilisation  by  Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc., USA and packaging by Wyeth Farma SA, Spain) in compliance with GMP. The  manufacturing  process together with in-process controls has been adequately described. Following the request from CHMP during evaluation, an in-process control test on residual moisture on the lyophilised powder was introduced and the limits for the in-process controls performed during lyophilisation (i.e. temperature, time and pressure) have been stated. The critical steps are defined and controlled and validation data of the critical steps, i.e. sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling,  holding  time from start of sterile filtration to start of lyophilisation and container closure system have been provided and are acceptable.

The  results  from  the  analysis  of  production  batches  show  that  the  manufacturing  process  used  is capable of consistently producing drug product of the required quality.

No new impurities are formed during manufacture and the purity/impurity profile of the drug product is comparable to that of the drug substance.

## Product specification

Specifications  and  release  criteria  for  Mylotarg  have  been  established  to  ensure  identity,  purity, potency, quality, and safety. Many of the analytical procedures used for testing the drug product are the  same  as  the  drug  substance.  Additional  testing  on  drug  product  includes  moisture  content, uniformity of content, and sterility. Following the request from CHMP during evaluation, the tests for extractable volume, opalescence and osmolality were added. Overall, all methods for release testing of the  drug  product  have  been  adequately  described,  justified  and  validated.  The  proposed  limits  are considered acceptable.

## Stability

The stability of the drug product has been extensively investigated on clinical and pilot batches. The data show that the drug product is stable for the proposed shelf-life of 36 months at 2-8°C. The data from clinical and pilot batches are comparable and indicate that the commercial batches (manufactured at twice the scale) have a comparable stability. Photostability data shows that the drug product should be  protected  from  light.  Simulated  clinical  admixture  infusion  studies  support  a  maximum  allowed time of 20 hours for product reconstitution, dilution, and administration (through the completion of infusion).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Microbiological  aspects  were  not  investigated  in  the  simulated  clinical  admixture  infusion  studies therefore, from  a microbiological perspective, the product  should  be used  immediately  after reconstitution and dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are  the  responsibility  of  the  user  and  would  normally  not  be  longer  than  20  hours  for  product reconstitution, dilution, and administration (through the completion of infusion)

## Adventitious agents

Materials  of  animal/human  origin  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  hP67.6  antibody  and gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been properly documented.

Compliance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMEA/410/01 Rev. 2) has been demonstrated.

It  is  noteworthy that the hP67.6 antibody was originally manufactured using one material of animal origin obtained from plasma pools not tested in compliance with EU requirements. The selection and screening of donors used for the production of this material was not clearly specified: epidemiological data was not presented, the overall safety strategy was not satisfactorily detailed to ensure traceability, test  kits  were  not  described  nor  validated,  etc.  The  Applicant  committed  to  not  place  Mylotarg produced with this material onto the EU market. Only Mylotarg produced with a material derived from plasma which complies with EU requirements and for which a plasma master file is available would be put on the EU market.

The  viral  validation  studies  have  demonstrated  efficient  and  consistent  removal  of  viruses  The combined reduction capacity of the chromatographic columns demonstrated an overall virus reduction of at least 4 log10 .for small non-enveloped viruses. Based on the overall data presented; i.e. control of starting  materials,  control  during  the  process  and  virus  validation,  the  risk  of  virus  transmission  to patients receiving Mylotarg is remote.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The pharmacology of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was investigated in vitro and in vivo . Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted according to GLP standards.

The toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats were conducted according to GLP standards, as claimed by the applicant.

## Pharmacology

In vitro studies evaluated the cytotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on CD33+ and CD33- cells in tissue culture assays, and comparisons were made with control conjugates with an antibody that does not  recognize  the  CD33+  cells.  Ex  vivo,  colony-forming  assays  were  conducted  with  bone  marrow samples from AML patients and with control conjugates. The behaviour of the antibody-calicheamicin conjugate in the body, the specificity of its anti-tumour activity and the extent to which it may affect normal  cells  was  assessed  in  vivo.  The  potential  for  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  to  affect  vital  body systems  (ie,  cardiovascular,  central  nervous  system  [CNS],  gastrointestinal,  hepatic,  and  renal)  has been investigated.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

The hP67.6 antibody component of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was found to bind only to CD33 + cells and was non-cytotoxic in tissue culture. As a human monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 isotype class, neither  complement-binding  nor  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  was  expected  or observed in test animals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro , antigen binding specificity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was indistinguishable from that of the uncoupled hP67.6 antibody. The relative  affinity  of  four  GMP  batches  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin was  determined  by  competitive  binding  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin versus radio-labelled  mP67.6 antibody  to  CD33 + HEL  92.1.7  cells.  Competitive  binding  was  in  the  order  of  10%  of  that  of  the hP67.6 antibody, which is within the limit of experimental error for this method. In terms of tissue specificity,  neither  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  nor  hP67.6  antibody  exhibited  any  unexpected  or unspecific binding to normal human tissues tested. In addition to HEL92.1.7 cells, hP67.6 antibody also stained microglia cells in the cerebellum, which are considered to be of mesodermal rather than neuroectodermal origin.  The  staining  patterns  of  the  microglia  cells  obtained  with  hP67.6  antibody were  similar  to  that  of  the  anti-CD68  antibody,  confirming  that  they  were  indeed  microglia  cells, which  are  considered  to  be  macrophages  and  thus  are  of  mesodermal  rather  than  neuroectodermal origin. The binding specificity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and the hP67.6 antibody to human normal peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow cells was identical.

In vitro cytotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in CD33 + and CD33 -cells was investigated in tissue culture assays. The IC50 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for the CD33 + HL-60 cell line was less than 1 pg/ml,  while  the  IC50 for  the  CD33 -Raji  cell  line  was  almost  [insert  value],  100  000-folds  higher. Control  assays  were  executed  with  control  antibody  conjugates  that  do  not  recognise  the  CD33 + antigen.

The cytotoxic effects  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  on  HL-60,  NOMO-l, NB4, NKM-l cell lines (all CD33 + ),  K562  cells  (weakly  CD33 + ),  and  Daudi  cells  (CD33 -)  was  investigated.  Concentrationdependent and specific cytotoxicity against CD33 + cell  lines  was  observed  using  flow  cytometry  to measure cell viability [LC50 approximately 0.125 ng/ml of calicheamicin equivalents (cal eq)]. Cells sensitive to gemtuzumab ozogamicin were temporally arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, except for NKM-1 cells. For the HL-60 cell line, morphological examination and DNA-fragmentation assays indicated that the primary cytotoxic effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be necrotic rather than apoptotic.

The in  vivo anti-tumour  effects  of  the  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  were  studied  in  a  HL-60  xenograft tumour mouse model. HL-60 xenograft tumours were established by subcutaneous implantation of 8 X 10 6 cells, which had been harvested from ascites. There were 5 nude mice per test group and 10 nude mice in the control group.  Tumour mass was determined on a weekly basis. Tumours were staged on average at 8 days post-implantation or when the tumour reached 150 mg. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered as a single dose given intraperitoneally. The data demonstrated a dose-response with an  anti-tumour  activity  at  doses  between  0.8  and  3.2  mg/m 2 of  cal  eq.  Significant  lethality  was observed at 3.2 mg/m 2 . At the lowest dose of 0.8 mg/m 2 , 2 out of 5 mice were tumour free at day 37 post-administration  of  treatment.  Using  doses  ranging  from  0.48  to  2.88  mg/m 2 of  calicheamicin equivalents per nude mouse (given on days 7, 11, and 15 post-implantation of tumour?), 5 out of 5 animals were tumour free on day 35. There was &gt;80% inhibition of tumour growth for every group treated  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Additional  experiments  with  this  xenograft  mouse  model examined  the  effectiveness  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  comparison  with  control  conjugate  nontargeting MOPC-21 antibodies that do not target CD33 + cells  specifically  but  still  contain  the  same calicheamicin  derivative.  With  the  corresponding  MOPC-21  conjugate,  a  20%  inhibition  of  tumour growth was observed.

The  effects  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  on  the  colony  forming  ability  of  human  leukaemia  bone marrow samples were investigated. Freshly thawed cell suspensions of bone marrow samples which were known to be capable of forming colonies in vitro were exposed to gemtuzumab ozogamicin or control treatments. At 2 ng/mL cal eq, 15% of adult AML patient (n=27) samples had &gt;60% inhibition of colony growth. At 10 ng/mL cal eq the number of samples with &gt;60% inhibition increased to 44%. AML patient samples (n=21) tested at 100 ng/mL cal eq showed high levels of nonspecific inhibition with the non-targeting control and 13 showed a 50% or greater drop in colony growth after incubation with  the  control  conjugate  compared  to  growth  with  controls  at  10  ng/mL  cal  eq.  Results  obtained from  similar  studies  using  normal  bone  marrow  suggest  that  normal  samples  are  resistant  to gemtuzumab ozogamicin at doses 4-fold higher than those used in the patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

Cytotoxicity studies in normal human megakaryocyte from 6 independent bone marrow donors showed variable results from little or no effect to progressive, cumulative cytotoxicity over 24 hours. Gene expression studies indicated that the observed variability could not be explained by differences in the glutathione pathway or multi-drug resistance genes.

- Safety pharmacology programme

The  potential  for  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  to  affect  vital  and  other  body  systems  has  been investigated.

Cardiovascular system: Three studies were conducted in beagle dogs. In the first study, gemtuzumab ozogamicin administered up to 40 mg protein/m 2 as a single bolus i.v. injection reduced mean arterial blood pressure for 20 minutes (gradually returning toward control values), slightly increased the heart rate  but  decreased  cardiac  output.  Both  P-wave  and  T-wave  amplitudes  had  a  high  degree  of variability. Vehicle-treated and gemtuzumab ozogamicin-treated animals did not show physiologically significant differences in P-wave and T-wave amplitudes.

In the second study, 13 mg protein/m 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered as a 30-minute i.v. infusion, causing no statistical changes in mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. However heart  rate  was  significantly  increased  at  all  time  points  starting  15  minutes  after  infusion.  P-wave amplitude was significantly increased at 20 minutes until the end of gemtuzumab ozogamicin infusion (30 minutes) through 90 minutes. T-wave amplitudes were significantly increased at all times starting 15 minutes after infusion.

In the third study, a single dose of 4 mg protein/m 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered as a 30-minute i.v. infusion, not causing any change in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, in comparison to vehicle-treated group. P-wave and T-wave amplitudes exhibited considerable variability  and  were  generally  not  different  between  vehicle-treated  and  gemtuzumab  ozogamicintreated dogs. All monitored electrocardiographic parameters were unchanged. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was without significant physiological effect on overall hemodynamic, cardiac function, or electrocardiographic parameters.

Hepatic function: In rats, i.v. infusion of either vehicle or gemtuzumab ozogamicin at doses of 7.5, 25 and 75 µg calicheamicin eq/kg had no influence on excretion of bromsulphalein sodium compared to the untreated group.

Gastrointestinal (GI) effects: Intestinal  motility  (mouse in  vivo study):  no  significant  changes  have been observed in urine of levels of protein, sodium, potassium and chloride excretion 5 hours after single i.v. administration of up to 250 µg calicheamicin eq/kg.

Autonomic Nervous System (pig ileum test): gemtuzumab ozogamicin at a concentration up to 0.75 µg calicheamicin eq/ml did not influence spontaneous motility and contractile responses to acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin and barium chloride in isolated guinea pig ileums, suggesting that CMA-676 demonstrates  no  anti-acetylcholine,  anti-histamine,  anti-serotonin  and  Ca 2+ antagonistic effects.

Effects of vehicle: by using the clinical gemtuzumab ozogamicin sample which contained dextran 40, the effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on the volume of urine and urinary electrolytes in rats was not evaluated because of severe hypouresis induced by dextran 40. Hypouresis induced by dextran 40 was not observed in mice.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were not conducted.

## Pharmacokinetics

A  limited  number  of  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  studies  in  animals  were  performed  with  gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In light of the absence of cross-reactivity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (hP67.6 antibody) with the CD33 antigen from other animal species, kinetic studies in animals can only be of limited value, as there will be no binding, specific intracellular uptake, or metabolism of the conjugate that underlies its therapeutic action in humans. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizes specific hP67.6 antibody binding to the CD33 antigen. The calibration standard for this ELISA was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Quantitation  of  plasma  concentration  of  hP67.6  antibody  includes  the antibody conjugate, the unconjugated hP67.6 antibody, and the fragments of the antibody conjugate or of  the  unconjugated  hP67.6  antibody,  which  recognize  the  CD33  antigen.  In  addition,  [3H]-labeled gemtuzumab ozogamicin was used in absorption, distribution, and excretion studies.

## · Absorption-Bioavailability

PK parameters of single dose bolus administered by i.v. route of gemtuzumab ozogamic have been described in rats and in monkeys. Rats received either 11.2 mg protein/m 2 or  9.1  mg  protein/m 2 of [3H]-labeled gemtuzumab ozogamicin in two separate studies. The highest mean concentration of total radioactivity in plasma ranged between 0.43-1 µ g equiv/ml at 0.083 hours. Total clearance averaged 0.03  ml/min/kg,  and  mean  t1/2 and  AUC  values  were  between  81-95  hours  and  18.8-22.9 µ g equiv·hr/ml,  respectively.  In  monkeys,  where  a  dose  of  16  mg  protein/m 2 was  administered,  the bioavailability of gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  appeared  slightly higher than in rodents. Plasma concentrations  of  the  unconjugated  calicheamicin  derivatives  were  low,  less  than  2%  of  circulating radioactivity in plasma for up to 120 hours after dosing.

## · Distribution

The distribution of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to tissues was evaluated after a single i.v. bolus of 9.1 mg protein/m 2 [3H]-labeled gemtuzumab ozogamicin in rats. Tissue samples, including blood and plasma as well as urine and faeces, were obtained up to 14 days (336 hours) after dosing. Peak concentrations of radioactivity in tissues were generally observed at the 1 or 6 hour sampling time, with lungs (0.08 µ g equiv/g), liver (0.07 µ g equiv/g), kidney (0.04 µ g equiv/g), heart (0.04 µ g equiv/g), bone marrow (0.03 µ g equiv/g), and adrenals (0.02 µ g equiv/g) having the highest concentrations of radioactivity from the tissues sampled. At 336 hours, concentrations of total radioactivity in these tissues declined to less than 0.01 µ g/g. Tissue/plasma ratios were generally &lt; 1, indicating that radioactivity was not extensively  distributed  beyond  the  plasma  compartment.  No  studies  were  performed  for  plasma protein binding.

- Metabolism

The  metabolism  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  has  been  investigated  in  human  liver  microsomes (HLM), human liver cytosol (HLC) and human leukaemia cells (HL-60). A total of 11 metabolites were found after incubation with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The biotransformation pathways identified in microsomes were hydroxylation and demethylation while the formation of NAc-epsilon calicheamicin and its derivatives appeared to be the major pathways in cytosol. Five metabolites of NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH,  including  NAc-epsilon  calicheamicin  and  its  isomer,  were produced from incubation in the HL-60 leukemia cells. Several common metabolites (M6, M7, and M8) were found in both liver and leukemia cell preparations.

Several  common  metabolites  (M6,  M7,  and  M8)  were  found  in  both  liver  and  leukaemia  cell preparations, suggesting that the metabolism of the calicheamicin into its derivatives may not be cell specific.  The  detection  of  NAc-epsilon  calicheamicin  and  its  derivatives  in  cells  supports  the hypothesis that the reactive diradical species of NAc-epsilon calicheamicin probably is formed via a glutathione-dependent  reduction  of  the  disulfide  bond  of  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH  within cells.

Both human liver microsomal and cytosolic metabolites were found in human hepatocytes suggesting that  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH  may  be  transported  into  human  hepatocytes.  CYP3A4  was identified as responsible for the oxidative  metabolism  of  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was the major enzyme system involved in the metabolism of NAcgamma calicheamicin DMH. In addition esterases and carbonyl reductase are reported to be important in  the  metabolism/hydrolysis  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  and  its calicheamicin  metabolites  were  found  in  the  urine  of  4  patients  receiving  9  mg/m 2 of  gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a single 2-hour i.v. infusion. This suggests that NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH may be the primary excreted hydrolytic product of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in vivo . Six further metabolites (M1, M5, M6, M7, M8, and M14) of NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH were identified in urine. The main urinary metabolite was NAc-epsilon calicheamicin and its derivatives, which are expected to be inactive metabolites.

- Excretion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As part of the tissue distribution study in rats, excretion of radioactivity after administration of a single i.v. dose of [3H]-gemtuzumab ozogamicin was examined in rats. The animals received a single bolus i.v. injection of 9 mg protein/m 2 of [3H]-gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Total recovery (% dose) from urine and faeces over the 14-day period was 71%, with the majority of the radioactivity found in faeces (58.6%). These results indicate that biliary excretion and/or gastrointestinal secretion are major pathways for the elimination of [3H]-calicheamicin derivatives. The elimination rate of radioactivity was slow, with a tissue half life of 115 to 281 hours.

- Pharmacokinetic drug interaction

Studies on pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not conducted.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

In  rats,  administration  of  doses  from  2.8  to  84  mg/m 2 of  hP67.6  protein  (10  to  300 µ g/kg  of calicheamicin equivalent) caused lethality at doses &gt;14 mg/m 2 of protein. The highest non-lethal dose was 9.8 mg/m 2 and the lethal dose was 28 mg/m 2 of protein. The primary causes of death were kidney and liver dysfunction. The animals were observed for a total of 14 days.

In monkeys, administration of doses from 36.9 to 73.8 mg/m 2 of hP67.6 protein (75 to 150 µ g/kg of calicheamicin equivalent) caused death at doses &gt;55.4 mg/m 2 of protein. The highest non-lethal dose was 36.9 mg/m 2 and the lethal dose 55.4 mg /m 2 of protein. The animals were observed for a total of 21 days.

In  chimpanzees,  2  animals  received  a  single  2-hour  infusion  of  12.5 µ g/m 2 of  calicheamicin derivatives  or  0.5  mg/m 2 of  hP67.6  antibody,  which  was  well  tolerated  with  no  signs  of  toxicity evident through the 15 days post-infusion period.

Overall,  administration  of  a  single  i.v.  dose  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  rats,  monkeys  and chimpanzees led to an observed decreased in body weight and food consumption, haematologic and clinical chemistry changes.

The  toxocitiy  of  calicheamicin  derivatives  have  also  been  investigated.  Gamma  calicheamicin  was found  to  be  the  most  toxic  compound,  followed  by  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  and  the  unconjugated NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  derivatives  (NAc  gamma  calicheamicin  DMH  AcBut  and  NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH). NAc-epsilon calicheamicin was found to be the least toxic compound.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Animals (rats, monkeys and dogs) were treated for a 6-cycle period (one treatment a week) after a recovery  period  (1  and  5  weeks).  A  total  of  5  studies  with  a  6-cycle  period  were  performed:  three studies  using  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  rats  and  monkeys,  and  two  studies  using  NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH in rats and dogs.

In  rats,  doses  of  &gt;10 µ g/kg  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  produced  effects  consisting  primarily  of clinical  observations,  as  well  as  body  weight,  food  consumption,  slight  anemia,  and  organ  toxicity observed  in  mammary  glands,  kidneys,  liver,  and  spleen.  At  30 µ g/kg  (1.2  mg/kg  or  8.4  mg protein/m 2 /week),  additional  organs  targeted  by  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  were  testes/epididymides and the bone marrow. At this dose, no reversibility of the toxic effects was observed for mammary glands,  kidneys,  liver  and  testes/  epidymides.  At  3 µ g/kg  (0.1  mg/kg  or  0.7  mg  protein/m 2 /week), clinical observations, pathological changes, and organ weight changes were reversible by the end of the  5-week recovery period and/or were not associated with microscopic changes in the spleen and bone marrow.

The proposed no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAL) for this study is 3 µ g/kg (0.7). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin used corresponded to 8.4 mg protein/m 2 /week. At a dose of 0.7 mg protein/m 2 /week and the MTD, the AUC0-∞ values for hP67.6 were 106 and 1420 µg eq·h/mL,  respectively.  At  8.4  mg  protein/m 2 /week,  the  AUC0-∞ value  for total  calicheamicin derivatives was 9.2 µg eq·h/mL.

Gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  was  evaluated  for  toxicity  in  a  6-cycle  study  in  rats  (15/sex/group)  at dosages of 0, 0.7, 2.8, and 8.4 mg protein/m2/week. Dosages were administered IV once weekly for 6

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks. To  evaluate  potential  antibody  effects,  a  fifth  group  (15/sex)  was  given  the  unconjugated hP67.6 antibody in vehicle at  an  i.v.  dose  of  8.4  mg/m 2 /week.  There  were  no  deaths  related  to  the hP67.6 antibody alone. There were no hP67.6 antibody-related effects found in clinical observations, body  weight,  food  consumption,  ophthalmoscopic  parameters,  hematologic,  clinical  chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, and in macroscopic and microscopic findings .

In  monkeys, the spectrum of gemtuzumab ozogamicin toxicity was similar to that observed in rats. The  NOAEL  dose  was  5 µ g/kg  of  calicheamicin  (corresponding  to  0.2  mg  protein/kg  and  2.46 mg/protein/m 2 ).  The  MTD  was  45 µ g/kg  (22.14  mg  protein/m 2 /week),  which  was  the  highest  dose administered.

## · Genotoxicity

The genotoxic potential of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in an in  vivo micronucleous test using cyclophosphamide as a positive control (see study design and results in table 1).

Table 1 - Gemtuzumab ozogamicin in vivo micronucleous test

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

## · Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Following daily administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to male rats for 28 days at doses of 0.02 to 0.16 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.01 to 0.11 times the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis),  gemtuzumab ozogamicin  caused  decreased  fertility  rates,  reduced  sperm  counts  and  sperm  motility,  and  an increased  incidence  of  sperm  abnormalities.  These  findings  were  attributed  to  primary  effects  on spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and did not resolve following a 9-week recovery period.

Daily  treatment  of  pregnant  rats  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  during  organogenesis  at  a  dose  of 0.060 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.04 times the recommended human single dose on a mg/m 2 basis) produced increased embryo-foetal mortality, and gross external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. This  dose  was  also  associated  with  maternal  toxicity  (decreased  weight  gain,  decreased  food consumption).

## · Local tolerance

Local tolerance studies were not conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

Local  injection  sites  were  evaluated  macroscopically  in  a  single-dose  toxicity  study  in  rats  and macroscopically  and  microscopically  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  monkeys.  No compound-related findings were observed at the injection sites.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

Studies assessing the immunotoxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were not performed.

Regarding  immunogenicity  after  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  administration,  there  was  an  antibody response to the hP67.6 antibody in the hP67.6 antibody-alone group and in gemtuzumab ozogamicin groups at ≥ 2.46 mg/m 2 /week. At the NOAEL dose of 2.46 mg/m 2 /week, the AUC0-∞ values for the hP67.6 antibody and total calicheamicin derivatives were 439 and 3.05 µg eq·h/mL, respectively; at a dose of 22.14 mg/m 2 /week, the AUC0-∞ values for hP67.6 antibody and total calicheamicin derivatives were 5250 and 38.0 µg eq·h/mL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Toxicity studies performed using the derivative NAc.gamma calicheamicin DMH in rats at 1, 10, 30 or 100 µ g/kg did not provide additional information. This derivative was also tested in dogs, where 1, 5, 25, or 50 µ g/kg treatments did not cause deaths. The NOAEL level for this study was 1 µg/kg.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An anticipated maximum of 7,500 doses per year in the EU, or 0.04 kg active protein conjugate, are expected to be administered in the next five years. This usage translates into a predicted environmental exposure concentration in the aquatic compartment of 1.3 x 10-7 µg/L, based on the CHMP guideline on environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CPMP/SWP/4447/00, 01 Jan 2006) and does not account for patient metabolism, or the expected environmental degradation of Mylotarg via hydrolysis and photodegradation. This estimated exposure concentration is below the 0.01 µg/l threshold.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was shown to target the CD33 myeloid differentiation antigen expressed on the HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, several other CD33 + human leukaemia cell lines and  on bone marrow samples from AML patients. There was no significant binding to other human tissues. The  non-clinical  pharmacological  rationale  for  clinical  development  in  the  proposed  orphan  AML indication is supported by the non-clinical data presented.

An activity was observed in several patients that had undetectable CD33 antigen on their leukaemic blasts.  This  activity  might  be  best  explained  by  non-specific  uptake  of  conjugate  in  patients  whose leukaemia was highly sensitive to the effects of calicheamicin. This activity was also observed in vitro in a CD33 -cell line, although cytotoxicity was detected at concentrations higher that seen for CD33 + cell lines.

Regarding safety phamacology, no significant neurobehavioral, gastrointestinal, urinary changes were observed  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  appropriate  animal  models  at  doses  consistent  with  the proposed human dose. No studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been conducted since the claimed indication for gemtuzumab ozogamicin is for its use as single agent treatment for AML. Therefore, studies on interactions with other agents used for the treatment of AML were not required.

## Pharmacokinetics/Toxicology

Both human liver microsomal and cytosolic metabolites were found in human hepatocytes suggesting that  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH  can  be  transported  into  human  hepatocytes.  CYP3A4  was identified as responsible for the oxidative metabolism of NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH. However, since NAc-gamma calicheamicin DMH is transformed to other non-oxidative metabolites, inhibition of CYP3A4 is unlikely to result in significant drug-drug interactions in humans.

In rats and monkeys, the toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was dominated by cytotoxic actions on dividing cells after high doses, and by renal tubular and hepatic damage. Consistent with the known ability  of  calicheamicin  to  cause  double-stranded  breaks  in  DNA,  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  was clastogenic  in  the  mouse in  vivo micronuleus  test.  In  reproductive  toxicity  studies,  gemtuzumab ozogamicin  was  shown  to  affect  fertility  both  in  male  and  female  rats.  The  toxic  effect  on  male fertility has to be considered severe and not reversible, while an effect on female fertility is considered treatment-related and reversible. In the developmental toxicity studies a severe grade of embryofoetal toxicity, including several morphological anomalies, was observed at all doses tested suggesting that gemtuzumab  ozogamicin is teratogenic in rat when  administered i.v. during organogenesis. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin must not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.

Due to the absence of cross-reactivity of the hP67.6 antibody to different laboratory species, animal studies  can  only  be  of  limited  value  as  there  is  no  binding,  specific  intracellular  uptake,  and metabolism of the antibody conjugate that underlies the therapeutic action of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in humans. The only non-clinical safety study conducted in an animal species with cross-reaction to the  antibody was a study conducted in chimpanzee. Apart from changes in some blood parameters, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was well tolerated at the tested doses, albeit that the highest single dose was below the MTD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, the safety assessment of gemtuzumab ozogamicin mainly relies on the clinical safety data since  no  other  relevant  animal  species  (besides  chimpanzee)  is  available  and  data  from  a  surrogate model, such as a murine model, were not submitted.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  estimated  exposure  concentration  of  Mylotarg  is  below  0.01  µg/L.  At  this  predicted  exposure level in the environment the risk is regarded as negligible. Mylotarg is not stable in aqueous solution and is degraded by light. As indicated in the labelling, toxic waste disposal procedures prescribed for anticancer drugs must be used if the product must be discarded.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

The clinical programme of gemtuzumab ozogamicin comprised three phase I/II dose-finding studies (0903A1-101-US, 0903A1-102-US, and 0903A1-103-JP) and three phase II, open-label, single-arm, US/EU)  as  a  single-agent  therapy.  These  three  pivotal  studies  involved  patients  with  relapsed  or refractory  CD33-positive AML and were conducted at 74 investigational sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the

3-part, multidose, multicentre clinical trials (0903B1-201-US/CA, 0903B1-202-EU, and 0903B1-203applicant. community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. It was proposed that gemtuzumab ozogamicin is administered under the supervision of physicians experienced in the treatment of acute leukaemia and in facilities equipped to monitor and treat leukaemia patients. The proposed posology of gemtuzumab ozogamicin  was 9 mg/m 2 , infused over a 2-hour period. The proposed treatment course with gemtuzumab ozogamicin was a total of 2 doses, with 14 days interval between the doses. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was not to be administered as an i.v. push or bolus. The reconstituted and diluted gemtuzumab ozogamicin solution was to be infused over a 2-hour period. Mylotarg was to be given peripherally or through a central line. There were no controlled trials demonstrating efficacy and safety using gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, gemtuzumab ozogamicin would only have to be used as a single chemotherapeutic agent and not in combination chemotherapy regimens outside clinical trials

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been investigated in a phase I dose escalation study (0903A1-101-US) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute AML, at doses ranging from 0.25 to 9 mg/m 2 and in a phase I study (0903A1-102-US) in paediatric patients with AML.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at the therapeutic dose (9 mg/m 2 ) were further studied in the three phase II pivotal studies 0903B1-201-US, 0903B1-202-EU, and 0903B1203-EU/US (see designs, clinical efficacy section).

Enzyme  linked  immunosorbent  assays  (ELISA)  and  enzyme  immunoassay  (EIA)  were  used  in pharmacokinetic studies of hP67.6 conjugate, both for the antibody and for calicheamicin moieties. Methods  were  validated  in  human  plasma,  calculating  assays  performance  as  accuracy,  precision (within assay and day-to-day reproducibility), linearity, limit of quantification, stability of samples and matrix effects. Pharmacokinetics analyses were performed using standard non-compartmental analysis. ANOVA analysis using dose-corrected data was used.

## · Absorption

No bioavailability or bioequivalence studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were conducted as the drug is administered intravenously.

## · Distribution

Phase I studies demonstrated that the distribution of hP67.6 antibody decreased at the highest dose levels.

From phase II studies, the highest plasma concentration of hP67.6 antibody was observed shortly after the end of the 2-hour infusion. When pharmacokinetic analyses were performed following the second administration (14 days after the first dose) plasma concentration of hP67.6 antibody was higher. A decrease in leukaemic cells was observed after the administration of the first dose. The mean Cmax of hP67.6 antibody following the first dose for patients who received 9 mg/m 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was 3.0 mg/L, with values that ranged from 0.4 to 18.3 mg/L. The Cmax increased to 3.6 mg/L (0.3 to 10.6  mg/L) after  the  second  dose.  The  mean  increase  in  Cmax  was  approximately  20%,  clinically,  a small  difference  considering  the  high  inter-patient  variability.  In  agreement  with  these  studies,  a decrease in the volume of distribution at steady state (VSS) of hP67.6 was observed across the first and second dose period, which is consistent with the changes seen in other pharmacokinetic parameters. VSS was 18 L during the first dose period, and decreased to 10 L during the second dose period. Large inter-patient  variability  was  also  noted  for  the  volumes  of  distribution  with  CVs  of  approximately 100%. The estimated volumes of distribution for hP67.6 were consistent with those estimated from preclinical biodistribution studies reported in the literature that used various radiolabeled anti-CD33 antibodies.

The Cmax for  unconjugated  calicheamicin  following  a  dose  of  9 mg/m 2 of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin was 0.005 mg/L.

## · Metabolism

Based  on  various in  vitro assays,  it  was  found  that  several  enzyme  systems  in  human  liver microsomes, hepatocytes, and cytosol are involved in the activation/metabolism of the non-antibody active  moiety  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin,  NAc-gamma  calicheamicin  DMH.  Enzyme  systems involved include esterases, carbonyl reductase, and the involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in the oxidative metabolism steps.

## · Elimination

Clearance (Cl) of hP67.6 antibody from plasma was 0.52 l/h after the first dose and 0.20 l/h after the second dose. The terminal half-life (t1/2) for hP67.6 was 62 hours after the first dose and 90 hours after the second dose. The last observable t1/2 for total calicheamicin was 41 hours following the first dose and  64  hours  following  the  second  dose.  The  last  observable  t1/2 for  unconjugated  calicheamicin derivatives  was  143  hours  following  the  first  dose  and  104  hours  following  the  second  dose.  No human data was provided that allows a quantification of excretion.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The phase I dose escalation study showed that there was no dose-proportional increase in Cmax and AUC  values  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Concentrations  of  hP67.6  increased  as  the  doses  of gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  were  increased,  but  a  definitive  assessment  of  dose  linearity  was  not performed due to the large between-subject variability and the small number of patients studied within the  different  dose-treatment  groups.  Between-subject  variability  was  large  for  most  PK  parameters (see table 2). No data on within-subject variability were provided.

Table  2:  Summary  of  between-subject  CV%  for  studies  0903B1-201-US/CA,  0903B1-202-EU, 0903B1-203-US/EU (data for hP67.6 )

| Phase II study    | Cmax     | AUC     | T½       | Vz         |
|-------------------|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| 35-74%            | 76-88%   | 60-72%  | 95-111%  | 0903B1-201 |

| 0903B1-203 45-51% | 79-94%   |         | 50-217%  | 78-90%     |

## · Special populations

The first phase I study conducted in an adult population was not designed to examine the impact of age and sex on the pharmacokinetic parameters (PK parameters) of gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.

In  the  phase  II  studies,  patient  age  ranged  from  20  through  87  years  and  each  sex  was  equally proportional.  A  total  of  259  of  the  271  patents  (96%)  were  of  white  race.  Pharmacokinetics  of gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  was  assessed  in  elderly  patients  as  a  part  of  a  phase  II  study. Plasma pharmacokinetics  of  hP67.6  and  calicheamicins  (total  and  unconjugated  forms)  were  evaluated  and there  were  no  observed  relationships  between  patient  demographics  and  PK  parameters  for  either hP67.6  or  calicheamicin.  Pharmacokinetic  effects  based  on  gender,  body  surface  area,  and  ethnic origin were also examined but no relationship was determined.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A phase I study (0903A1-102-US) conducted in paediatric patients evaluated gemtuzumab ozogamicin doses ranging from 6 to 9 mg/m 2 . PK parameters were determined for 29 patients, 22 of whom had PK parameters determined after a second dose. A consistent and statistically significant change in hP67.6 PK measurements was observed between the first and second dose period.  AUC increased by 63% and  77%,  with  a  corresponding  decrease  in  clearance  for  the  6  mg/m 2 and  9  mg/m 2 groups, respectively. The volumes of distribution also decreased for all dose groups.  Children receiving a 9 mg/m 2 dose had the following hP67.6 PK parameter estimates (mean ± SD): Cmax 3.47 ± 1.04 mg/L; AUC 136 ± 07 mg · h/L; Cl 0.12 ± 0.15 l/h/m 2 ; Vss 6.5 ± 5.5 l/m 2 ; half-life 64 ± 44 h. These results are consistent with those seen in the adult population. The inter-subject variability within dose period was large for most parameters.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

A  limited  assessment  of  possible  drug  interaction  with  acetaminophen,  diphenhydramine,  and hydroxyurea on hP67.6 pharmacokinetics was done. Most patients were pretreated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. The hP67.6 AUC for patients who received pre-treatment were found to be similar to those for patients who did not receive pre-treatment.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is cytotoxic to the CD33 + HL-60 human leukaemia cell line. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin produces significant inhibition of colony formation in cultures of adult leukaemic bone marrow  cells.  The  cytotoxic  effect  on  normal  myeloid  precursors  leads  to  myelosuppression.  In preclinical animal studies, gemtuzumab ozogamicin demonstrated antitumour effects in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukaemia xenograft tumour in athymic mice.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

In  study  0903A1-101-US,  saturation  of  the  CD33  antigen  by  hP67.6  was  evaluated  with  doses  of gemtuzumab ozogamicin between 0.25 to 9 mg/m 2 . High variability in saturation was observed when the hP67.6 AUC was less than 100 mg · h/L.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Based on preclinical studies it is believed that gemtuzumab ozogamicin exerts its antineoplastic effect by being internalized following binding to CD33-positive antigen on cells. However, at the clinical level  pharmacodynamics  of  gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been scarcely documented. The selected dose  of  9 mg/m 2 seems  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  is  associated  with  a  high  degree  of  CD33 saturation. Its role in effective therapy has also been shown.

The pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (the antibody hP67.6, total calicheamin and unconjugated cailcheamin) has been studied in patients only. The analytical methods used were appropriate and adequately documented, however the specificity of the hP67.6 ELISA was considered poor. The CHMP considered that the low specificity was likely to be related to the large analytical variability observed and could have influenced the interpretation of the pharmacokinetics data.

After administration of the first recommended 9 mg/m 2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, given as a 2-hour infusion, the elimination half-life of total and unconjugated calicheamicin was about 41 and 143  hours,  respectively.  After  the  second  9 mg/m 2 dose,  the  half-life  of  total  calicheamicin  was increased to about 64 hours, and the AUC was about twice that in the first dose period. The AUC for the unconjugated calicheamicin increased 30% after the second dose. Age, gender, body surface area, and weight did not affect the pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in paediatric patients followed the profile and variability of adult  patients and mean pharmacokinetic parameters are similar to values reported in adults. Based on preclinical studies,  the  excretion  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin was  mainly through faeces, probably through the biliary excretion of metabolites. Dose proportionality could not be demonstrated.

The  pharmacokinetics  in  special populations was  scarcely studied by  covariate analysis.  No association with gender, age and weight was observed. No data were provided in patients with hepatic or  renal  impairment.  Mild  to  moderate  renal  and  hepatic  impairment  is  unlikely  to  influence  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to a clinically relevant extent. Due to lack of clinical data, caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment. The PK in children has been studied and the PK parameters were similar to those achieved in adults, based  on  a  surface-area  normalised  dose.  The  clinical  experience  in  children  and  adolescents  is limited. Based on the information available at the time for the marketing authorisation application, 6 mg/m 2 represents a dose that is tolerable in this population (relapse paediatric patients).

No clinical drug-drug interaction studies were performed for gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, demonstrated that clinically achievable levels of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and calicheamycin do not inhibit the catalytic activity of CYP enzymes or induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A4. Clinically relevant drug interactions involving gemtuzumab ozogamicin and concomitant medicinal products that are substrates of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely to occur.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response studies

Study 0903A1-101-US: Open-label, single-arm, phase I dose-escalation study aiming at determining the MTD, the safety and tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients with AML.

Forty-one patients aged ≥ 16 to ≤ 70 years with CD33 + AML who were not in remission or relapsed after  remission  were  enrolled  in  the  study  in  successive  dose  levels  of  0.25,  0.5,  1,  2,  4, 5,  6,  and 9 mg/m 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was given as a single 2-hour i.v. infusion per dose with a minimum of 14 days between doses. This time interval between doses was chosen as dose clearance is expected in approximately 12 to 15 days. The chosen interval was expected to avoid accumulation, while maintaining a level of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to prevent disease recurrence. Two  patients  achieved  a  complete  response  (CR).  One  patient  received  one  dose  of  1  mg/m 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and the other received two doses of 4 mg/m 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In addition, 7 patients had clearance of leukaemic blasts from bone marrow and blood ( ≤ 5%) but without full recovery of peripheral blood platelet counts. Dose was not escalated beyond 9 mg/m 2 because of myelosuppression,  even  though  no  prospectively  defined  dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  had  been encountered. Because most patients (4 of 7) at this dose level experienced blast clearance and because CD33 saturation data suggested that a dose level of 9 mg/m 2 would effectively saturate CD33 sites in all patients regardless of leukaemia burden, 9 mg/m 2 was the dose selected for further trials.

Study  0903A1-102-US: Open-label  dose-escalation  study  with  the  primary  objective  of  determining the recommended dose, safety and tolerability of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in paediatric patients with AML.

Twenty nine paediatric patients (19 with relapsed AML and 10 with refractory AML) were enrolled in 3  ascending  dose  levels  of  gemtuzumab:  6  mg/m 2 ,  7.5  mg/m 2 ,  and  9  mg/m 2 .  Twenty-three  patients received a second dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, generally 14 days after the first dose. DLTs were observed  in  children  at  the  9  mg/m 2 dose:  grade  3 or  4 elevations  of  aspartate  aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed in 3 patients and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was seen in 1 patient. The dose of 6 mg/m 2 was selected as the recommended dose because the study was terminated before the 7.5 mg/m 2 dose level could be fully enrolled and evaluated.

Four  patients  achieved  CR  (two  at  6  mg/m 2 and  two  at  9  mg/m 2 )  and  4  experienced  complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), one at 7.5 mg/m 2 and three at 9 mg/m 2 , for an OR rate of 28% (8 of 29 patients) in patients ≤ 16 years old.  Of these 8 patients, 5 were patients in first relapse  and  3  were  patients  with  refractory  AML.  No  further  analysis  of  paediatric  efficacy  was performed.

Study 0903A1-103-JP : Single-agent, multicenter, phase I/II clinical trial conducted in Japan. Patients with  CD33 + relapsed  or  refractory  AML  were  enrolled  in  the  two  phases  of  the  study.  In  phase  I (dose-escalation phase) of the study, 20 patients were randomly assigned into 3 dose levels: 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 mg/m 2 of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The 9.0 mg/m 2 dose level was determined to be the MTD. Two of the 20 patients had CR and two had blast clearance. All four patients were treated at the 9 mg/m 2 MTD dose level. In phase II (efficacy and safety evaluation phase) of the study, patients were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treated with two doses (14 days apart) of 9 mg/m 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Five of the 20 patients (25%) achieved CR and one achieved CRp (5%).

## · Main studies

Three study reports (0903B1-201-US/CA, 0903B1-202-EU, 0903B1-203-US/EU) of open-label, phase II,  single-arm,  multidose  clinical  trials  pertinent  to  the  claimed  indication  were  submitted  (table  3). Because of the similarity  in  study  designs,  objectives,  patient  demographics,  and  dosing  schedules, data from the three studies were pooled to attain a larger efficacy population (277 patients).

## METHODS

Study Participants

The main inclusion criteria included CD33 + AML patients in first relapse (&gt;5% leukaemic blasts as determined  by  central  flow  cytometry  laboratory  tests)  and  are  summarised  in  table  4.  Patient inclusion criteria were similar for all studies. However, study 0903B1-202-EU also included patients with prior bone marrow transplant.

## Treatments

The  treatment  included  three  parts. Part  1,  induction  therapy,  consisted  in  two  doses  of  9 mg/m 2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and a 28-day follow-up after the last dose. Part 2, consolidation and followup, consisted in monthly evaluation for 6 additional months. Patients who had a complete remission (CR) or a complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) or who had clearance of blasts with  gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment were followed for efficacy and safety, and all others were followed  in  part  2  for  safety  only.    In  part  2  further  consolidation  therapy  (HSCT  or  other chemotherapy) was allowed, 30 days after the bone marrow clearing of blasts indicating remission. In part  3,  follow-up  assessments  of  disease  status  and  survival,  all  patients  who  achieved  CR  or  CRp continued to be followed (contacted every 3 months by telephone) for an additional 18 month after the follow-up period and every 6 months thereafter, until time of relapse or death or date of last follow-up. Patients  in  remission  after  the  first  course  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  were  eligible  for additional courses  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Only  data  from  the  first  course  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin treatment  for  these  patients  are  included  in  the  efficacy  analyses.  Hydroxyurea  use  was  allowed  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduce the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count to &lt;30 000/ µ l  before  gemtuzumab ozogamicin use if the initial WBC count was ≥ 30 000/ µ l. Premedication with acetaminophen and an antihistamine was  required  for  all  patients.  For  patients  responding  to  treatment  (CR,  CRp,  and  those  with ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow and clearance of blasts from the peripheral blood), additional post-remission treatment  for  AML  was  permitted  beginning  30  days  after  being  in  remission  after  gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment. Post-remission therapy options included autologous HSCT, allogeneic HSCT, or additional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients who did not respond to gemtuzumab ozogamicin were permitted to receive other treatment as soon as lack of response was documented.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  (patients  achieving  complete  remission:  CR)  of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The secondary objectives were to assess the duration of CR and complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), to assess the  pharmacokinetic properties and to assess possible predictors of response.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of patients attaining a CR. The secondary endpoints were the rates of CRp, relapse-free survival (from initial documentation of remission and post-HSCT), total survival (from first dose of study drug and post-HSCT), and time to platelet and time to absolute neutrophil  count  (ANC)  recovery.  Other  efficacy  endpoints  included  assessment  of  hematologic recovery, post-remission therapy, post-HSCT recovery and post-HSCT survival.  Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included all patients who were entered into the study. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population  included  those  ITT  patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin. Efficacy analyses were performed on the mITT population.

Two  sets of response criteria were used: Diagnostic criteria for AML  defined using the recommendations of a 1988 workshop sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, referred to in this application as 'protocol-defined  criteria',  and  diagnostic  criteria  for  AML  defined  using  the recommendations of a 2003 International Working Group (IWG) of investigators, referred to in this summary as 'IWG-defined criteria'. Remission status was determined using both the protocol-defined criteria and IWG-defined criteria (see definition in table 5).

a: When both bone marrow aspirate and biopsy results were available, both had to be ≤ 5% (protocol criteria) or &lt;5% (IWG criteria).  In cases of discrepancy between local and expert blast evaluations, the expert's evaluation overruled the local  investigator's  evaluation;  b:  These  criteria  cannot  be  documented  programmatically  because  they  were  not required for the per protocol analysis of remission; c:  Patients with no transfusions on the date of CR* or CRp* are considered  transfusion  independent.;  Abbreviations:  ANC  =  absolute  neutrophil  count;  CR  =  complete  remission defined  by  protocol  criteria;  CR*  =  complete  remission  defined  by  IWG  criteria;  CRp  =  complete  remission  with incomplete platelet recovery defined by protocol criteria; CRp* = complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery defined by IWG criteria; HSCT = hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; IWG = International Working Group; RBC = red blood cell.

No remission  (NR):  Patients  were  considered  to  be  in  NR  if  they  did  not  meet  all  the  criteria  for CR/CR* or CRp/CRp*.

Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined only for CR and CRp and was measured in months from the date of attaining a morphologic leukaemia-free state until the date of AML relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per protocol, the date of relapse was the date on which the investigator recorded an assessment of relapse. An IWG relapse was defined as the return of leukaemic blasts in the peripheral blood or increases in the bone marrow blasts to levels ≥ 5%.

Overall survival (OS) was measured for all patients from the date of first dose to the date of death. For analysis of OS by remission category, patients who did not receive at least 2 doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were excluded, as well as deaths that occurred before the end of part 1 (see treatment). These patients did not complete the treatment phase of the study and thus could not be evaluated for response.

Subgroup analyses were performed on the mITT population for remission, RFS, and OS. Efficacy was analysed  by  age  group  (&lt;60  or ≥ 60  years),  ethnic  origin,  sex,  duration  of  first  remission,  and cytogenetic classification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients who did not respond to the first dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin were considered treatment failures  and  did  not  receive  a  second  dose.  They  were  discontinued  from  further  treatment  with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, but were followed up in the study. Patients in remission after the first course of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  were  eligible  for  additional  courses  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin. Remission  categories  were  determined  after  additional  courses  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin,  but  no further efficacy analyses were conducted on this patient population.

## Sample size

The  assumption  was  made  that  the  response  probability  of  an  ineffective  drug  was  0.15,  with  the probability of accepting an ineffective drug ( α ) = 0.10. The response probability of an effective drug (i.e. the target level) was chosen as 0.30, with the probability of rejecting an effective drug ( β ) = 0.10. Based on these assumptions, the sample size of the first stage was 23 patients and the sample size required for the entire study was 55 patients.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Studies 0903B1-201-US/CA, 0903B1-202-EU, 0903B1-203-US/EU were open-label studies without randomisation. However, slides of bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow biopsies were blinded to both the patient's identity and temporal order of slides before shipment to the independent pathologist for analysis.

## Statistical methods

Sample size requirements and stopping rules were based on the CR rate and did not consider CRp rate nor  safety  profile.  The  designs  were  modified  and  the  decision  to  continue  the  studies  beyond  the interim analysis was not based solely on the CR rate, but resulted from an evaluation of the composite efficacy and safety information available at the time of the interim analysis.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

A total of 377 patients were screened and 277 patients were evaluated for efficacy after the pooling of studies. The overall patient disposition is summarised in table 6. Twenty-five patients were alive at the end of part 3.

## Conduct of the study

Each  of  the  studies  protocol  had  4  to  5  amendments,  mainly  on  clarification  points,  extension  of number of patients and exclusion of HIV positive patients.

## Baseline data

The phase II clinical trials included adult patients between 20 and 87 years of age. Fifty-five percent (55%)  of  the  patients  were  men  and  45%  were  women.  Prior  chemotherapy  for  AML,  baseline demographic and diseases characteristics are shown in table 7, 8 and 9.

## Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)

The median RFS was 6.4 months for patients with CR and 4.5 months for patients with CRp. The corresponding figures were 7.5 and 4.4 with the IWG criteria.

## Overall Survival

The median survival was 4.8 months. The early death rate (deaths from first dose to 28 days after the last dose) was 16% for all patients.  The probability of survival beyond 12 and 24 months was 0.22 and 0.12, respectively.

## Survival by remission category

The median OS, analyzed using protocol-defined criteria, was 12.2 months for patients with CR, 12.8 months for patients with CRp, and 4.2 months for patients not responding to treatment (12.9, 9.6 and 3.0, respectively according to IWG criteria). Overall survival was significantly different between CR and patients with no response and between CRp and patients with no response (p&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in survival between patients with CR and CRp (p=0.804). See figure 1.

## Time to Clearance of Leukaemic Blasts

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin produced rapid clearance of aspirate bone marrow blast cells. A total of 147 (53%) patients achieved blast clearance according to protocol-defined criteria. Of the patients who had blast clearance, 53% cleared blasts after the first dose, 46% cleared blasts after the second dose, and 1% cleared blasts after the third dose. Twenty-one (60%) of the CR patients and 16 (44%) of the CRp patients had blast cell clearance after the first dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

## Absolute Neutrophil Count Recovery

The  median  times  for  ANC  recovery  to  0.5  x  10 9 /L  for  the  CR  and  CRp  patients  were  40.0  and 43.0 days, respectively (CR vs. CRp, p = 0.249) and were significantly shorter than for NR patients (51 days; CR vs. NR, p=0.0001; CRp vs. NR, p=0.0023).

## Platelet Recovery

Time from first dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for patients to reach a platelet count of 25 x 10 9 /L was evaluated. The median recovery of platelet counts to reach 25 x 10 9 /L was 36.0 and 51.0 days for CR and CRp patients, respectively. These times were significantly shorter than those for NR patients (175 days, p=0.0001). One CRp patient did not achieve a platelet recovery to 25 x 10 9 /L.

## Other antileukaemic therapy and HSCT after treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin

Overall, 48.7% of patients received no other therapy after gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Median RFS was longer for CR patients who received HSCT than for patients who received other chemotherapy or no further  therapy  after  treatment  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  (p&lt;0.001).  A  summary  tabulation  of patients with RFS by post-remission therapy is presented below.

A significant difference in overall survival was observed among patients in remission who received therapy after treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. While the median survival for all patients was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12.2 months for CR and 12.8 months for CRp patients, the median survival for patients who received HSCT  (either  allogeneic  or  autologous)  after  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin-induced  remission  was 18.1 months  (17.1  month  in  IGW  analysis).  The  median  survival  for  patients  who  received  postremission chemotherapy was 10.7 months compared to 11.0 months for patients who did not have any post-remission  therapy  (10.0  and  10.3,  respectively  for  IGW  analysis).  Post-HSCT  survival  was similar for CR, CRp, and NR patients (p=0.070).

## Patients intended to undergo HSCT

In the pivotal phase II, 16% (44/277) of patients underwent post-gemtuzumab ozogamicin HSCT, 38% (16/42) patients with CR*, 24% (13/54) patients with CRp* and 8% (15/181) with NR*.  The median post-HSCT survival for all patients with remission was 11.8 months compared with 6.0 months for NR* patients.

## Patients over the age of 60 years with duration of first remission less than 12 months

Data from three clinical trials conducted by the United Kingdom MRC (AML-11, AML-12 and AML14), enrolled a total of 1068 patients across the trials and encompassed patients whose age was over 60 years.  The  majority  of  the  patients  had  a  first  relapse  duration  of  less  than  12  months.  These patients,  all  of  whom  were  in  first  relapse,  were  studied  for  outcomes  after  re-induction  treatment. Patients  in  this  age  group  with  a  first  relapse  experienced  CR  rates  in  the  order  of  11%  to  14% (n=706),  see  table  14.  Of  706  patients,  389  patients  received  re-treatment  following  relapse,  and second CR rates ranged from 15% to 19%.

a. CR is based primarily on the clearance of leukemic blast cells from the bone marrow, therefore, the 'CR' groups presented in this table includes patients with both CR and CRp.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

A total of 277 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy after the pooling of studies 0903B1-201US/CA,  0903B1-202-EU,  0903B1-203-US/EU.  The  median  age  of  patients  was  61  years  old.  The duration of first remission during previous treatment was &lt;6 months remission in 14% of patients, 612 months for 46% of patients and ≥ 12 months for 40% of patients in the trial. In general, patients with  duration  of  a  first  CR  less  than  12  months  have  a  poor  outcome  to  second-line  re-induction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapy.  Approximately,  70%  of  the  patients  received  high-dose  Ara-C  as  part  of  prior  first-line therapy. In the FAB classification, the M2 subtype was the most common (26%), 21% had M1, 20% had M4 and 11% had M5 at relapse. Cytogenetically, 40% of patients had an intermediate prognosis at first  relapse,  23  %  had  a  poor  prognosis  pattern  and  2%  had  favourable  prognosis. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) status was assessed. Most patients, regardless of remission category, demonstrated pre-treatment increased MDR pattern.

Efficacy  data  demonstrated  that  the  primary  goal  to  reach  a  response  rate  not  inferior  to  published results  from  studies  with  other  agents  is  hardly  reached  if  the  classic  CR  definition  (defined  in  the protocol and recommended by the CHMP) is used: only 13% of patients reached CR. Only when the group  of  patients  with  CRp  was  included,  the  ORR  rate  reached  26%  (35%  according  to  the  IWG response classification), which is comparable to data in the literature for true CR (from 20-70% in the series reviewed by the Applicant). The response rate did not vary with age, cytogenetic classification or  gender,  but  did  vary  with  duration  of  first  (previous)  remission.  A  total  of  53%  achieved  blast clearance (not identical to CR) according to protocol-defined criteria. Of the patients who had blast clearance, about half cleared blasts after the first dose, and half after the second dose. Median times for ANC recovery to 0.5 x 10 9 /L for the CR and CRp patients were 40.0 and 43.0 days, respectively. Median recovery time of platelet counts to 25 x 10 9 /l for CR and CRp patients was 36.0 and 51.0 days, respectively. Thus both results indicate that gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment may belong to the socalled intensive therapy, since severe myelosuppression is observed.

In  terms  of  consolidation  therapy,  25  (35.2%)  of  the  71  OR  patients  received  either  allogeneic  or autologous  HSCT  while  they  were  in  remission  (11  CR  patients  and  14  CRp  patients).  A  total  of 96 (34.7%) patients received only other chemotherapy that was not part of a preparative regimen for HSCT.  A  significantly  greater  proportion  of  NR  patients  than  OR  patients  received  additional chemotherapy only (p&lt;0.001). Overall, 48.7% of patients received no other therapy after gemtuzumab ozogamicin, with no difference in frequency between OR and NR patients.

Median relapse-free survival (RFS), the secondary efficacy parameter, was 6.4 months for CR and 4.5 months  for  CRp  patients  (half  the  patients  received  consolidation  therapy  with  autologous  or allogeneous stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy alone). For those 35 patients who received no consolidation, the RFS was 2.5 months for the CR+CRp group.

The median overall survival (OS) was 4.8 months for all patients. The early death rate (death within 28 days) was 16%. Median survival for responders (CR+CRp) was 12.5 months, in part a reflection of consolidation therapy, since it was 18.1 months for those receiving consolidation versus 11.0 months for those receiving no consolidation. The difference from the much shorter RFS in this last group (2.5 months)  indicates  that  many  of  these  patients  received  and  tolerated  further  chemotherapy  after relapse.

Conclusions  on  the  influence  of  age,  sex,  previous  response,  cytogenetics  or  biomarkers  (data  not shown) on survival is not possible to evaluate, since only 35 patients received no further therapy and the rest received various types of intensive consolidation therapy.

Overall,  the  three  small  phase  II  studies  demonstrated  that  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  is  a  potent myelosuppressive agent which has a limited selectivity for leukaemic cells since the CR rate was 13% (26% CR+CRp) in first relapse AML patients. The RFS was 6.4 months for CR patients, including the consolidation therapy, but only 3.8 months for the CR patients (2.5 months for the overall remission group) receiving no consolidation therapy.

## Consultation of the oncology scientific advisory group

Following the CHMP request, an oncology Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) meeting was convened on  30  November  2006  to  provide  advice  on  the  list  of  questions  raised  by  the  Committee,  in  the context of the restricted claimed indication i.e, Mylotarg is indicated for induction treatment of CD33positive acute myeloid leukaemia patients in first relapse who are not considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy . The following questions were raised and discussed:

- One of the limitations of this application was that the modest proportion of CR and CRp and the  lack  of  reliable  data  on  duration  of  remission.  Furthermore,  with  reference  to  CPMP Scientific Advice CPMP/727/99,  CR  and  CRp  were  considered  insufficient  to establish therapeutic  efficacy  in  the  proposed  therapeutic  indication.  In  the  proposed  therapeutic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indication,  progression-free  survival  and  overall  survival  would  have  been  considered  the relevant  primary  endpoints.  What  type  of  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  patients  in  first  relapse would not be considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy? What are the treatment options available for these patients?

AML patients  with  a  first  relapse  are  generally  treated  with  chemotherapeutic  regimens,  including high-dose induction regimens in younger patients and allogeneic HSCT. A number of cytotoxic agents and combination regimens have been used for the salvage chemotherapy, and CR rates from 20 - 70 % have been described with remission duration of typically 4 to 6 months, results which vary depending on  prognostic  factors  such  as  duration  of  the  first  remission,  cytogenetics  and  age.  However,  the SAG/CHMP considered that in the case where patients are not eligible for high-dose induction-type regimens, this would not mean that they are ineligible for any other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Indeed, a number of treatment options are available, including for example low-dose cytarabine or hydroxyurea but more in a palliative setting. Thus, it is difficult to define and discriminate a population of patients with a first relapse who would not be considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy.

- Based on the proportion of CR and CRp, and other available clinical efficacy results, can it be concluded that treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin is associated with a clinical benefit for the  patients  in  the  claimed  indication?  Is  the  study  population  representative  of  the  target population in the claimed indication?

The oncology SAG considered that the claimed indication refers to a theoretical situation where no other therapeutic option is available. For this indication, the clinical studies presented do not provide sufficient data to estimate the proportion of responders or clinical benefit. The study population is not representative of the target population for the claimed indication since patients were eligible for other cytotoxic chemotherapy and some of the patients underwent high-dose chemotherapy and allogeneic HSCT afterwards.

Concerning a claimed indication for acute myeloid leukaemia patients with a first relapse, the activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as compared to available treatment options is unclear. In terms of relevant clinical  endpoints,  there  is  no  comparative  data  available.  In  addition,  activity  of  gemtuzumab ozogamicin compared unfavourably with a number of cytotoxic agents and combination regimens that have a proportion of CR ranging from 20% to 70%, as described in the literature. Therefore, the SAG is of the opinion that the study population is not representative of the target population for the claimed indication.

## - Would a randomized controlled trial with single-agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the claimed indication be feasible in European Union? What would be the comparator?

The SAG considered that the claimed indication refers to a theoretical situation where no other option is  available  (indeed  some  of  the  patients  were  afterwards  treated  with  high-dose  chemotherapy  and HSCT).  This  population  is  difficult  to  identify  and  no  studies  are  considered  feasible.  Concerning patients  that  are  not  eligible  for  chemotherapeutic  regimens,  theoretically  one  could  envisage  a randomized trial against the investigator's choice. There should be considerable interest for such a trial to achieve sufficient enrolment and make the trial feasible. In light of the modest activity observed and the  significant  toxicity,  it  is  doubtful  that  further  investigation  of  single-agent  treatment  with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (or other existing agent) is deemed of sufficient interest.

## - From a clinical perspective, what are the most important benefits, toxicity and risks associated with treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin? What is the strength of evidence and what are the remaining uncertainties?

The SAG considered that the anti-leukemic activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been established but it is difficult to quantify the clinical benefits in the context of other available treatment options. It is not possible to assess the treatment effect in terms of relevant clinical endpoints such as relapse-free survival  and  overall  survival  since  the  study  population  is  not  deemed  representative  of  the  target population  for  the  claimed  indication.  Whether  the  potential  benefits  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin compare favourably with those of alternative treatment options is yet unknown. Concerning toxicity, gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  does  not  have  an  unusual  profile  compared  to  other  AML  induction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regimens, which typically show severe and long-standing myelosuppression. However, differences for gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  include  infusion-related  side  effects,  liver  toxicity  and  VOD,  especially when combined with HSCT.

During  an  oral  explanation  to  the  CHMP,  the  applicant  argued  that  it  was  not  feasible  to  conduct further studies in the sought indication against either active comparator, placebo, or supportive care due to the current state of knowledge, the small target population, and medical ethics. On that basis, the applicant requested that Mylotarg be considered for a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. In addition, the applicant provided an overview of ongoing and planned clinical trials.

The CHMP acknowledged the lack of a single standard treatment for AML in first relapse, and the practical difficulties in conducting a randomised controlled trials in this setting. However, the CHMP considered  that  a  randomised  trial  against  e.g.  the  investigator's  choice  could  be  envisaged.  In addition, the CHMP considered that the planned and ongoing randomised phase III trials to assess the efficacy and safety of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination and used as a first-line anti-leukaemic agent, would not provide any relevant information on the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the claimed indication.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

The assessment of the safety profile of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was based on three dose-escalation phase I studies and three pivotal phase II studies. A total of 495 patients with AML were exposed to gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the clinical studies, including 29 children; 442 additional patients were exposed to gemtuzumab ozogamicin in a single arm ongoing prospective observational study.

- Adverse events

In  the  pivotal  studies,  the  most  frequent  abnormalities  were  hematologic  abnormalities,  including platelets  (99%),  total  absolute  neutrophils  (98%),  white  blood  cells  (96%),  and  lymphocytes  (94%) abnormalities.  The  most  frequent  (reported  in ≥ 30%  of  the  patient)  non-hematologic  adverse  drug reactions  (ADR)  were  fever  (74%),  chills  (60%),  nausea  (55%),  and  vomiting  (47%).  Nonhematologic ADR occurring in ≥ 10% of the patient are shown in table 15. Severe (grade 3 or 4) fever was reported in 12% of patients. All patients had grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. After a second course  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin,  the  most  frequent  non-hematologic  grade  3  or  4  ARs  were stomatitis  (15%),  pneumonia  (15%),  neutropenic  fever  (15%),  hypertension  (10%),  hypotension (10%), respiratory distress syndrome (10%), and respiratory failure (10%).

Infusion related adverse reaction occurred on the same day of infusion. Symptoms generally started at the end of the 2-hour i.v. infusion and resolved after 2 to 4 hours post-infusion with supportive therapy of paracetamol, diphenhydramine, and intravenous fluids. The most frequent severe non-hematologic infusion-related  adverse  reactions  (ARs)  (National  Cancer  Institute  [NCI]  grade  3  or  4)  were  chills (8%), fever (6%), and hypotension (4%).

Three  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  in  patients  included  in  the  pivotal  studies. Myelosuppression was an expected and frequent complication of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. During the treatment phase, 267 (98%)  and  272  (99%)  patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, respectively. Patients with OR recovered to an ANC of 0.5 x 10 9 /L by a median of 43.0 days and platelet counts recovered to 25 x 10 9 /L by a median of 33.5 days after the first dose of gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Grade  3  or  4  anemia  was  reported  in  143  (52%)  patients.  During  the treatment  phase,  36  (13%)  patients  experienced  grade  3  or  4  bleeding,  including  epistaxis  (3%), cerebral hemorrhage (2%), intracranial hemorrhage (1%), hematuria (1%), melena (1%), and petechiae (1%).

In  the  pivotal  studies,  106  (39%)  patients  experienced  grade  3  or  4  abnormalities  in  liver  function tests,  including  hyperbilirubinemia  (29%),  abnormalities  in  levels  of  alanine  aminotransferase  (9%) and aspartate aminotransferase (18%), concurrent elevations of aminotransferases and bilirubin (9%). Most  of  the  observed  laboratory  changes  were  transient,  reversible,  and  required  no  medical intervention. Ascites was observed in 8 patients and were considered mild to moderate in severity.

A total of 16 episodes of veno-occlusive disease VOD (in 15 patients) were identified (16/299, 5%). The  incidence  of  VOD  in  patients  treated  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  who  had  no  prior  or subsequent HSCT was 1%. The risk of developing VOD was 19% for patients with a history of HSCT prior to gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration (see table 16). In patients who received HSCT after gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration, the risk of developing VOD was 16%.

a. 20 patients received 22 additional courses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

- b. 11 patients who received gemtuzumab ozogamicin and never had HSCT also received a second course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and 1 received 3 additional courses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
- c. 8 patients who received gemtuzumab ozogamicin and had HSCT received 2 courses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
- d. Patients were categorized as having 'HSCT before GO' or 'HSCT after GO' based upon the relative timing of the first HSCT and the first course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  Thus, patients who had HSCT both before and after gemtuzumab ozogamicin were included in 'HSCT before GO' and not in 'HSCT after GO.'  Patients who received courses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin before and after a single HSCT were included in 'HSCT after GO' and not in 'HSCT before GO.'
- e. 1 patient had 2 episodes of VOD.  This patient received gemtuzumab ozogamicin, had HSCT, and developed VOD.  A second course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered, after which the patient developed fatal VOD.  This patient and both of these episodes of VOD were included in the 'HSCT after GO' group based on the timing of the first course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin relative to HSCT.

During  the  pivotal  trials,  severe  grade  of  ADRs  (NCI  grade  3  or  4)  was  reported  for  tumor  lysis syndrome (TLS)(4 patients, 1%), mucositis (9 patients, 3%), nausea (24 patients, 9%), vomiting (11 patients,  4%), and diarrhea (2 patients, &lt;1%). Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported for 87 patients (31%).  The  most  frequent  infections  were  sepsis  (23  patients,  8%),  pneumonia  (13  patients,  5%), shock  and  infection  (4  patients  each,  1%),  stomatitis  and  herpes  simplex  (3  patients  each,  1%). Patients also reported ADR associated with severe renal impairments (10 patients, 4%), including face edema (3 patients, 1%), acute kidney failure and kidney failure (2 patients each, &lt;1%), generalized edema and kidney pain (1 patient each, &lt;1%). Patients experienced cardiovascular ADRs (83 patients, 30%), the most frequent (incidence ≥ 5%) of which were hypotension (13%), hypertension (6%) and tachycardia  (6%).  Severe  cardiovascular  ADRs  included  hypotension  (5%),  hypertension  (3%),  and chest pain, cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, tachycardia, and tachycardia sinus (1 patient each, &lt;1%). Skin ADRs included pruritus (18 patients, 6%) and skin rash (51 patients, 18%). Severe pruritus and skin rash was reported for 1 (&lt;1%) and 4 (1%) patients, respectively. Cutaneous herpes simplex was reported in 59 patients (21%). No patient in the pivotal trials experienced drug-related alopecia. ADRs associated  with  severe  neurologic  impairment  (grade  3  or  4)  were  reported  (10  patients,  4%)  , including 3 reports of confusion (1%), 2 reports of eye disorder (&lt;1%), and 1 report each of agitation, CNS  depression,  convulsion,  facial  paralysis,  hypertonia,  paresis,  somnolence,  stupor,  and  tremor (&lt;1% for each).

## Adverse events after post-remission therapy

Fifty-two  patients  received  HSCT  after  administration  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Among  these patients, 27 patients (52%) reported grade 3 or 4 ADRs that occurred after HSCT. The most frequent ADRs were VOD (10%), immune system disorder (8%), sepsis (8%), bilirubinemia (6%), stomatitis (6%) and kidney failure (6%).

Among the 109 patients who received additional antileukaemic therapy after gemtuzumab ozogamicin, 13  patients  (11%)  had  grade  3  or  4  adverse  events  related  to  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin,  including thrombocytopenia (3%), leukopenia (3%), sepsis (2%), and VOD (2%).

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Disease  progression  was  the  most  frequent  cause  of  early  mortality  in  the  phase  I.  In  study 0903A1-101-US, 6 of the 7 deaths within 30 days after gemtuzumab ozogamicin were due to disease progression and 1 was due to infection. In the pediatric study (0903A1-102-US), 3 deaths within 28 days after gemtuzumab ozogamicin were due to disease progression. In study 0903A1-103-JP, 14 of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 16 deaths in the dose-escalation phase of the study (phase 1) were due to disease progression, 1 was  due  to  pulmonary  hemorrhage  (occurring  on  the  same  day  as  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin administration) and 1 cause of death was unknown. In the pivotal studies, 44 of the 277 patients (16%) died within 28 days of receiving the last dose in the first course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment. Disease  progression  was  the  primary  cause  of  death  in  13  cases.  In  addition,  13  patients  died  of infection  (including  pneumonia,  sepsis,  septic  shock,  and  other  infections),  8  of  hemorrhage,  4  of multiorgan failure, 3 of respiratory failure, 1 of VOD, and 1 of anaphylactic reaction to amphotericin B.  One  cause  of  death  was  not  recorded.  In  15  patients  that  developed  VOD,  10  patients  had  fatal VOD or ongoing VOD at the time of death.

## · Laboratory findings

A total of 126 patients (46%) had a kidney laboratory values of potential clinical importance (PCI); most of these changes were related to potassium (34%) or sodium levels (17%); 16 patients (6%) had a creatinine level &gt;2 x upper normal limit (UNL), and 3 patients (2%) had elevated blood urea nitrogen (BNU) levels.

- Safety in special populations

Paediatric Population: Most of the deaths that occurred during the paediatric study 0903A1-102-US were  attributable  to  disease  progression  or  to  complications  associated  with  HSCT.  All  patients exhibited myelosuppression. Other toxicities included grade 3 or 4 fever (24%), hyperbilirubinemia (7%), mucositis (3%) and sepsis (17%). 5 (17%) of 29 patients developed VOD; 4 of these patients developed VOD after receiving HSCT.

Elderly: Detailed analyses of differences between patients ≥ 60 years of age and patients &lt;60 years of age suggest similarity with respect to the incidence of most frequent severe ADRs (data not shown).

Gender: Grade 3 or 4 ADRs for female and male patients were similar (data not shown).

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Clinical drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

Twenty-six (9%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events during part 1 of the pivotal studies; 15 (58%) of these patients discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events.

- Post marketing experience

From 01 May 2000 to 28 February 2005, 15 465 patients were exposed to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. There  were  895  reports  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs);  466  of  these  cases  reported  more  than 1 event. The system organ classes (SOCs) with the greatest number of serious events were blood and lymphatic system disorders (n=318), general disorders and administration site conditions (n=288) and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hepatobiliary disorders (n=221).  The most frequently reported SAEs were pyrexia (n = 103), sepsis (n=82), liver disorder (n=82), and AML (n=77). A total of 363 deaths have been reported to date in post-marketing up to 15 March 2005. Among the death reports, the SOCs with the most frequently reported primary events were hepatobiliary (n=81), neoplasms (n=58), and infections and infestations (n=56). The most frequently reported causes of death were AML (n=54), liver disorder (n=47), sepsis (n=26), and multiorgan failure (n=21).

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The  cumulative  experience  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  suggests  it  is  rather  well  tolerated  in patients  of  all  ages  receiving  treatment  for  AML  in  first  relapse.  The  safety  profile  did  not  differ between patients &lt;60 years and patients ≥ 60 years in the pivotal trials.

The main safety issues consisted of severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity including veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and infusion related events.

Myelosuppression is an expected and frequent complication of both conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Differentiated hematopoietic precursor cells that are CD33 + are  targeted  by  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  and,  consequently,  this  leads  to  myelosuppression. Severe  myelosuppression  occured  when  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  was  used  at  the  recommended doses:  98%  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  trials  experienced  grade  3-4  suppression  of  neutrophil  and platelet counts of at least 5-6 weeks duration. Despite platelet transfusions, 13% of patients had grade 3-4  bleeding  and  4%  had  cerebral  bleeding,  which  proved  fatal  in  8  patients.  The  neutropenia  was accompanied by infections (grade 3-4 in 31% patients), which is a relatively rare occurrence for AML treatment.  Deaths  due  to  infection  or  bleeding  have  been  reported  during  the  period  of  severe myelosuppression.  Therefore,  careful  haematologic  monitoring  is  required  and  systemic  infections must be treated.

Hepatotoxicity, including severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD), has been reported in association with the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a single agent, as part of combination chemotherapy regimen, and in patients without a history of liver disease or haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A multivariate  analysis  demonstrated  that  HSCT,  whether  performed  before  or  after  gemtuzumab ozogamicin,  was  a  significant  risk  factor  for  VOD.  It  has  been  shown  that  patients  who  received HSCT  before gemtuzumab ozogamicin (19%), and patients who  received HSCT  following gemtuzumab ozogamicin (16%), were at higher risk of developing VOD than patients who had not been  transplanted.  Death  from  liver  failure  from  VOD  was  reported  in  patients  who  received gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Grade 3 or 4 renal events were reported for 10 patients (4%), including face oedema (1%), acute kidney failure (1%), kidney failure (1%), generalized oedema, abnormal lab test and kidney pain (all &lt;1%). Grade 3 or 4 tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was reported for 4 patients (1%) involved  in  the  pivotal  studies.  TLS  may  be  a  consequence  of  leukaemia  treatment  with  any chemotherapeutic agent, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Renal failure secondary to TLS has been reported  in  association  with  the  use  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  Electrolytes,  tests  of  hepatic  and renal  function,  complete  blood  counts  and  platelet  counts  must  be monitored  during  gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy.

Gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  administration  can  result  in  severe  hypersensitivity  reactions  (3  SAEs related to hypersensitivity were reported during the pivotal studies), including anaphylaxis, and other infusion-related reactions, which may include severe pulmonary events. Most cases of hypersensitivity reactions  and  pulmonary  events  have  not  been  fatal.  In  many  instances,  infusion-related  symptoms occurred during the infusion or within 24 hours of administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

Severe  pulmonary  events  leading  to  death  have  been  reported  infrequently  with the use of gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  the  postmarketing  experience.  Signs,  symptoms  and  clinical  findings include dyspnoea, pulmonary  infiltrates, pleural effusions,  non-cardiogenic  pulmonary  edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These events occur as sequelae  of  infusion  reactions  and  patients  with  white  blood  cell  counts ≥ 30,000/ µ L  may  be  at  an increased risk.

Cardiovascular events (grade 3 or 4) were reported in 20% of patients. Early mortality (death within 28  days)  affected  16%  of  patients.  The  majority  of  deaths  in  follow-up  (208  patients)  were  due  to disease progression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No clinical drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  The potential for interaction of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with drugs affected by cytochrome P450 enzymes cannot be  ruled  out.  Patients  with  rare  hereditary  problems  of  fructose  intolerance,  glucose-galactose malabsorption  or  sucrase-isomaltase  insufficiency  should  not  take  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  As gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  contains  2-mmol  (or  46  mg)  sodium  per  dose,  patients  on  a  controlled sodium diet need to take this into consideration.

Two patients  in  a  Phase  I  study  developed  antibody  titers  against  the  calicheamicin/calicheamicinlinker portion of gemtuzumab ozogamicin after administration of three doses. One patient experienced transient fever, hypotension and dyspnoea; the other patient had no clinical symptoms. Patients treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not experienced drug-related alopecia.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin can produce a post-infusion symptom complex of fever and chills (grade 3-4 in 35% patients), and less commonly, hypotension and dyspnoea, which may occur during the first 24 hours  after  administration.  The  incidence  fell  from  31%  following  the  first  dose  to  10%  after  the second dose.

No cases of overdose with gemtuzumab ozogamicin were reported in clinical experience. Single doses higher than 9 mg/m 2 in adults were not tested. No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines were performed.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product was considered to be acceptable. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant  to  the  overall  clinical  performance  of  the  product  were  investigated  and  were  found  to  be controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  The  evaluation  confirmed  that  only  the  product  obtained  using  a source material from human origin from an authorised plasma source that is covered by a centrally approved Plasma Master File would be acceptable for release on the EU market. Data on viral/TSE safety  were  reassuring  and  it  is  considered  that  the  risk  of  virus  transmission  to  patients  receiving Mylotarg  is  remote.  Nevertheless,  the  purification  process  would  have  to  be  further  improved  to increase its viral removal capacity.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin  is  a  monoclonal  antibody,  cytotoxic  to  the  CD33  positive  HL-60  human leukaemia cell line. The binding of the anti-CD33 antibody portion of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with the CD33 antigen results in the formation of a complex that is internalized. Upon internalization, the calicheamicin derivative is released inside the liposomes of the myeloid cell, resulting in DNA double strand breaks and cell death. In preclinical animal studies, gemtuzumab ozogamicin has demonstrated anti-tumour effects in the HL-60 human pro-myelocytic leukaemia engraft tumour in mice.

Single  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  the  rat  and  cynomolgus  monkey.  The toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was dominated by cytotoxic actions on dividing cells after high doses, and by renal tubular and hepatic damage. No studies were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin induced clastogenic effects in mice in vivo micronucleus  test.  This  positive  result  is  consistent  with  the  ability  of  calicheamicin  to  cause double-stranded breaks in DNA.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin adversely affected fertility in  male  rats  (decreased  fertility  rates,  reduced sperm counts and sperm motility, increased incidence of sperm abnormalities). These findings were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

attributed to primary effects on spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and did not resolve following a 9week  recovery  period.  Daily  treatment  of  pregnant  rats  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  during organogenesis was associated with maternal toxicity and produced increased embryo-foetal mortality, gross external, visceral,  and skeletal  malformations. It was concluded that gemtuzumab ozogamicin may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

Overall,  there  were  no  issues  concerning  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  or  the  toxicology  of gemtuzumab ozogamicin that negatively affected the overall benefit-risk assessment.

## Efficacy

The  clinical  efficacy  data  presented  in  this  application,  was  based  on  open-label,  non-comparative studies.  The  antileukaemic  activity  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  was  observed  with  a  complete response rate (CR) of 13% in patients with a first relapse of AML following treatment [and complete response rate without full platelet recovery (CRp) was observed in 13% of patients]. The remission free  survival  (RFS)  was  6.4  months  for  CR  patients,  including  the  consolidation  therapy,  and  3.8 months for the CR patients receiving no consolidation. The overall survival, measured as secondary endpoint, was a median 4.8 months for all patients (ranging from 13.1 months for CR patients, 9.7 months for CRp patients, to 2.8 months for patients who did not meet the criteria of CR/CRp). The survival was longer for patients who received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation as consolidation therapy (10.3 - 18.1 months) than for all other patients (1.3 - 11.5 months).

The applicant provided information to compare the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the target population, with the data reported in the scientific literature. The methodological limitations of such historical comparisons were acknowledged.

## Safety

In  phase  II  clinical  trials,  the  most  common  grade  3  or  4  adverse  drug  reaction  were  fever,  chills, nausea, vomiting and thrombocytopenia, and were seen in the majority of patients. The main safety issues related to the  use  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  consisted  of  severe  and  long-standing myelosuppression, infusion-related side effects (reversible and manageable), hepatotoxicity (reversible), and highly lethal veno-occlusive disease (VOD), especially when given in combination with HSCT. With the exception of hepatic abnormalities and myelosuppression, many of the adverse events reported after treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin occurred with rather low frequencies as compared to those observed with other treatments of leukaemia.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The development of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for the re-induction treatment of CD33-positive acute myeloid  leukaemia  patients  in  first  relapse  who  are  not  considered  candidates  for  other  cytotoxic chemotherapy  was  based  on  three  single-arm  clinical  trials.  Complete  response,  defined  as  no evidence  of  remaining  tumour  and  haematological  recovery  within  one  month  after  remission induction  treatment,  was  the  primary  endpoint.  A  complete  response  rate  of  13%  and  a  complete response rate without full platelet recovery of 13% were observed in patients with a median age of 61 years old, with a first relapse, and receiving Mylotarg as single agent .

The main limitations of this application were the modest proportion of CR and the lack of reliable data on valid clinical  endpoints.  In  addition,  according  to  CHMP  guidelines,  this  full  application  should have been based on data generated by randomised controlled clinical trials rather than by open-label, non-comparative studies. The CHMP acknowledged the lack of established treatment for AML in first relapse,  and  the  difficulties  in  designing  randomised  controlled  trials  in  the  absence  of  standard comparator.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  claimed  indication  referred  to  a  theoretical situation  in  which  patients  in  first  relapse  would  not  be  considered  candidates  for  other  cytotoxic chemotherapy. A randomised trial against the investigator's choice could be envisaged.

Therefore, the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as compared to available treatment options was not demonstrated for the treatment of AML patients in first relapse who are not considered candidates for  other  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  The  clinical  studies  presented  did  not  provide  sufficient  data  to estimate the clinical benefit of gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment in the claimed indication. During the assessment, the CHMP consulted the oncology Scientific Advisory Group (see CHMP questions and SAG responses in 'Discussion on clinical efficacy' section). The outcome of the discussion was conveyed to the Committee and discussed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Important identified risks with gemtuzumab ozogamicin were severe and long-standing myelosuppression, infusion-related side effects and hepatotoxicity, including irreversible and highly lethal veno-occlusive disease (VOD), especially when given in combination with HSCT.

Randomised phase III trials to assess the efficacy and safety of gemtuzumab ozogamicin when used as a first-line anti-leukaemic agent are ongoing.

The benefit risk balance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in re-induction treatment of CD33-positive acute myeloid  leukaemia  patients  in  first  relapse  who  are  not  candidates  for  other  intensive  re-induction chemotherapy  regimens  (e.g.  high-dose  ARA-C)  is  not  considered  favourable  due  to  the  following grounds:

- Only a small proportion of complete responders were observed in the clinical trials and the efficacy  in  terms  of  duration  of  remission,  progression-free  survival  and  overall  survival  is difficult to quantify in the absence of randomised  controlled trial with single-agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
- Based  on  the  available  clinical  efficacy  results,  the  clinical  benefit  of  the  treatment  with gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not established for the target population.
- Treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin toxicity includes severe and long-standing myelosuppression, infusion-related side effects, liver toxicity and veno-occlusive disease.
- The  clinical  benefit  of  the  treatment  with  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  is  not  established  and therefore,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  use  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  the  claimed indication cannot be considered positive.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

In  this  application,  the  Applicant  has  provided  arguments  discussing  the  issue  of  similarity,  in  the context  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000,  regarding  the  orphan  medicinal  product Trisenox (arsenic trioxide) authorised in the EU for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia.

## The CHMP concluded that:

-  a  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal  product  Trisenox  containing  arsenic  trioxide  for induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) exists with orphan market exclusivity.

-  gemtuzumab ozogamycin and arsenic trioxide are considered not to be similar with regards to the mechanism of action since they act on different pharmacodynamic targets.

- gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not structurally similar to arsenic trioxide.

Therefore, the CHMP considered Mylotarg not to be similar to any of the authorized orphan medicinal products (as defined in Art. 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000) for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Mylotarg in the re-induction treatment of treatment of CD33positive acute myeloid leukaemia patients in first relapse who are not candidates for other intensive reinduction  chemotherapy  regimens  (eg,  high-dose  ARA-C)  was  unfavourable  and  therefore  did  not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## 2.7 Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 20 September 2007

Following the CHMP conclusion that the risk/benefit balance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the reinduction treatment of treatment of CD33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia patients in first relapse who are not candidates for other intensive re-induction chemotherapy regimens (eg, high-dose ARAC) was unfavourable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal. The applicant presented a number of arguments regarding the grounds for refusal.

The applicant presented in writing and at an oral explanation a number of additional analyses of the pooled  clinical  trials  data,  including  responder  analyses,  subgroup  analyses  and  survival  analyses censoring for further treatments. The applicant stated that the observed CR/CRp rate was of benefit and associated with clinical improvement, and argued that a randomized controlled trial of Mylotarg monotherapy has not been feasible in the target indication. The applicant considered that the target population as defined in a revised indication was adequately represented in the clinical trials and that the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  for  these  patients  was  comparable  to  that  seen  in  the  overall population. The  applicant  argued  that  among  the  side  effects  of  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin,  infusion related effects, liver toxicity, as well as the risk of veno-occlusive disease have been recognized and may  be  mitigated  by  preventive  measures  such  as  the  use  of  corticosteroids  for  infusion-related syndrome as in other treatments with  monoclonal antibodies, by avoiding gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment in patients with previous transplant or liver disease, and by exercising caution in the use of concomitant  hepatotoxic  drugs.  Furthemore,  the  applicant  commented  that  the  more  advantageous aspects of the safety profile of gemtuzumab ozogamicin include no drug-induced alopecia, low rate of severe mucositis, low rate of cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurologic events, and relatively low rate of infection. The applicant stated that the results of the gemtuzumab ozogamicin studies indicate clinical benefit with a positive benefit/risk balance in the target population.

Following  a  request  from  the  applicant  at  the  time  of  the  re-examination,  the  CHMP  convened  a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) inviting the experts to provide their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal,  taking  into  account  the  applicant's  response.  The  SAG  considered  that  there  was  no convincing evidence in the applicant's grounds for re-examination that would change the grounds for refusal. The SAG argued that one of the main problems with the data submitted is the fact that the trials  were  not  randomized  versus  a  suitable  control  (e.g.,  investigator's  choice).  Furthermore,  the pivotal trials with gemtuzumab included an ill-defined population, which in many cases could have been  exposed  to  intensive  re-induction  chemotherapy.  This  population  does  not  correspond  to  the claimed  indication.  Because  the  studies  and  claimed  populations  are  different,  it  is  impossible  to extrapolate the results observed to the claimed indication. Thus, based on the data presented, the SAG concluded that it is impossible to establish the efficacy and safety of gemtuzumab in a population that truly  consists  of  patients  in  first  relapse  who  are  not  candidates  for  other  intensive  re-induction chemotherapy regimens (e.g., high-dose ARA-C).  Nevertheless, a number of haematologists in the group expressed strong beliefs about the usefulness of this active compound for some AML patients in particular situations. However, the exact population for which they would currently use gemtuzumab remains very difficult to define, as this requires an individual patient's assessment of available options, including various re-induction regimens and types of HSCT, which are not scientifically established. For instance, frail patients with important co-morbidities that cannot tolerate high-dose chemotherapy yet sufficiently fit to tolerate the gemtuzumab associated toxicity might be considered for gemtuzumab on  a  case  by  case  basis.  It  was  also  agreed  that  this  would  to  a  large  extent  depend  on  the haematologists attitude to use more or less aggressive treatments. However, it was agreed that this is based on expert judgement and not hard evidence and that the applicant has not defined clearly what could be the target population, or presented data to support the efficacy in a suitable target population.

The CHMP also requested advice from the SAG on the following specific issues

What is the value of re-induction treatment (pre-transplantation) in relapsed AML? I.e., if a cohort of AML patients  in  first  relapse  who  are  eligible  for  HSCT  were  re-induced  with  Mylotarg  and  35% achieved  a  CR/CRp,  is  it  probable  that  the  cohort  as  a  whole  would  come  out  better  posttransplantation than if they were all transplanted up-front?

The SAG agreed that currently, it seems reasonable to assume, based on clinical and pharmacological arguments, and conflicting results from published research, that re-induction is beneficial in case of subsequent transplantation. It is possible that re-induction is really an important factor associated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

important clinical endpoints, or that at least it is useful to select patients that will most benefit form subsequent HSCT. Concerning a theoretical cohort of patients in first relapse eligible for HSCT, it is impossible to speculate the effect of gemtuzumab treatment on the final outcome. To some extent this situation  is  unrealistic  because  patients  eligible  for  HSCT  are  most  likely  candidate  for  reinduction treatment with more effective combination regimens.

Are there relapsed AML patients who are not suitable for re-induction with chemotherapy but would at a later stage (post successful re-induction with Mylotarg) be suitable for HSCT?

The experts agreed that  it  is  difficult  to  envisage  a  situation  where  patients  are  not  suitable  for  reinduction  chemotherapy  but  patients  are  suitable  for  HSCT  after  successful  re-induction  with Mylotarg. At least in theory, it is possible to imagine that there are rare situations where patients in full blown  relapse  with  very  poor  clinical  condition  due  to  the  leukaemic  multiorgan  infiltration  itself might achieve a complete remission after some reduced intensity chemotherapy or monotherapy. If this was followed by a surprisingly good improvement in organ function and performance status this could at least in theory allow HSCT. Therefore, at least in theory, there might be some rare patients not suitable for re-induction with high dose chemotherapy but successfully treated with Mylotarg that could receive the RIC transplant owing to this response.

In patients with relapsed AML, not being candidates for intensive chemotherapy, is the proportion of CR/CRp observed  with  Mylotarg  a  reliable  predictor  of  an  overall  favourable  effect  in  all  treated patients (ITT)?

According to the SAG, concerning the 35% of CR/CRp, it should be noted that these results are based on patients that in many cases could have been exposed to intensive re-induction chemotherapy. It is impossible  to  speculate  what  would  be  the  proportion  of  CR/CRp  observed  with  gemtuzumab  in  a population  that  truly  consists  of  patients  with  a  worse  prognosis  who  are  not  candidates  for  other intensive  re-induction  chemotherapy  regimens  (e.g.,  high-dose  ARA-C).  Although  traditionally CR/CRp is an endpoint for activity, it is also a relevant clinical benefit endpoint, provided that the response is of clinically significant duration. Of course, there should not be a detriment in terms of overall  survival  and  progression-free  survival,  so  that  this  endpoint  should  not  be  looked  at  in isolation.  However,  it  is  not  known  what  would  be  the  proportion  of  CR/CRp  associated  with gemtuzumab in the claimed indication or in a suitable indication, which definition remains elusive. Furthermore,  this  efficacy  endpoint  needs  to  be  weighted  against  the  observed  toxicities  which  are significant.

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The applicant presented its grounds for reexamination and discussed them with the CHMP during an oral  explanation  and  revised  the  claimed  indication  to  better  reflect  the  population  in  which  the applicant claimed that a positive benefit risk had been demonstrated, namely for re-induction treatment of  CD33-positive AML adult patients in first relapse who are not candidates for other intensive reinduction  chemotherapy  regimens  (e.g.  high-dose  Ara-C)  and  meet  at  least  one  of  the  following criteria: duration of first remission &lt;12 months, or age &gt;60 years.

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant and considered the views of the Scientific Advisory Group. The CHMP acknowledged that a number of haematologists and researchers have great interest in the product and in further studying its effects  but  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  data  submitted  in  the  current  application  do  not  allow  to conclude that the clinical efficacy of Mylotarg has been demonstrated in the applied indication.

The CHMP maintained the view that only a small proportion of complete responders were observed in the  clinical  trials  and  the  efficacy  in  terms  of  duration  of  remission,  progression-free  survival  and overall survival is difficult to quantify in the absence of randomised controlled trial with single-agent gemtuzumab  ozogamicin.  The  CHMP  maintained  the  view  that  Based  on  the  available  clinical efficacy results, the clinical benefit of the treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not established for  the  target  population.  The  CHMP  also  maintained  the  view  that  treatment  with  gemtuzumab ozogamicin toxicity includes severe and long-standing myelosuppression, infusion-related side effects, liver toxicity and veno-occlusive disease, and that because the clinical benefit of the treatment with gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  is  not  established,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  use  of  gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the claimed indication cannot be considered positive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

## Whereas

- Insufficient  data  have  been  presented  to  establish  the  clinical  efficacy  of  gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  Only a small proportion of complete responders were observed in the clinical trials and the efficacy in terms of duration of remission, progression-free survival and overall survival is difficult to quantify in the absence of randomised controlled trial with single-agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
- Based  on  the  available  clinical  efficacy  results,  the  clinical  benefit  of  the  treatment  with gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not established  for  the  re-induction  treatment  of  CD33-positive AML adult patients  in  first  relapse  who  are  not  candidates  for  other  intensive  re-induction chemotherapy regimens (e.g. high-dose Ara-C) and meet at least one of the following criteria: duration of first remission &lt;12 months, or age &gt;60 years.
- Treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin toxicity includes severe and long-standing myelosuppression, infusion-related side effects, liver toxicity and veno-occlusive disease.

the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Mylotarg  in  the  claimed  indication  cannot  be  considered  positive,  and therefore the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Mylotarg.
