## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval  of  Helixate Nexgen. This scientific  discussion  has  been  updated  until  1  January  2003.  For  scientific  information  on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Helixate NexGen is a recombinant human antihaemophilic factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa), which is derived from a cloned human factor VIII gene transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The approved therapeutic indications are as follows:

Treatment  and  prophylaxis  of  bleeding  in  patients  with  haemophilia  A  (congenital  factor  VIII deficiency). This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.

Antihaemophilic Factor VIII is the blood clotting factor deficient or absent in individuals with classic haemophilia  A,  an  X-chromosome-linked  bleeding  disorder.  The  frequency  of  clinically  severe bleeding correlates with the degree of FVIII deficiency. Replacement therapies for FVIII deficiency consist  of  either  plasma-derived  or  recombinant  FVIII  concentrates.  So  far,  the  main  advantage  of recombinant  products  is  the  higher  viral  safety.  The  major  complication  in  the  treatment  of haemophilia A is the occurrence of inhibitors against FVIII (neutralising antibodies) in up to about 30% of patients with severe haemophilia A, usually within the first 100 exposure days. Patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII levels &lt; 1-2% of normal activity) are at a far higher risk to develop an inhibitor. Helixate NexGen is a modification of the already licensed product Helixate. Both are produced by the same genetically engineered BHK cell line. The fermentation process is the same as for Helixate. In contrast  to  the  parent  product,  Helixate  NexGen  is  purified  and  formulated  without  the  addition  of human  albumin  as  stabiliser.  This  was  accomplished  by  the  development  of  a  new  purification process,  including  a  solvent/detergent  treatment  viral  inactivation  step,  and  a  new  formulation  with sucrose. The product is formulated with sucrose, glycine, histidine, calcium chloride and sodium chloride and is isotonic for intravenous injection. The protein to excipient ratio has been altered to produce three different fill sizes of equal volume after reconstitution. The applicant submitted applications for Kogenate Bayer and Helixate NexGen which are identical products.

In addition, human plasma protein and traces of host cell proteins and murine IgG, which derive from the fermentation and purification process, are found in the product.

The process steps of fermentation and harvesting are identical to those for the parent product Helixate. Harvest  is  continuously  collected  from  production  scale  fermenters.  A  plasma  master  file  for  the documentation of the human plasma protein used as starting material for the production of the human plasma-derived component of the fermentation media has been submitted. The manufacturing steps of fermentation and harvesting are monitored by adequate in-process controls.

For each dosage form, 2.5 ml solvent per vial is required for reconstitution. To ensure an extractable volume of 2.5 ml, an overfill of 0.6 ml is used to compensate for losses in transfer. The lyophilised powder for injection is presented in 10 ml, Type I glass (Ph.Eur.) vials with grey bromobutyl rubber (Ph.Eur.) stoppers. The solvent is presented in 10 ml, Type II glass vials (Ph.Eur.) with grey chlorobutyl rubber (USP) stoppers. Active substance Structure Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein. The full length protein consists of 2332 amino acids with a molecular weight of approx. 265 kD before, and more than 300 kD after glycosylation. The single chain protein is rapidly processed in cell culture resulting in a heterodimer with an 80 kD light chain deriving from the  C-terminus,  and  a  family  of  heavy  chains  with  molecular  weights  between  90  and  210  kD, including  the  90  kD  N-terminal  sequence  and  varying  amounts  of  the  B-domain.  In  the  B-domain, which is not required for the co-factor activity of FVIII, most of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites are located. The protein also contains 10-12 O-linked glycans. Evidence suggests that all or most of the O-linked glycans reside in the B-domain. Gene construction, producer strain, cell banks The production cell line is the same as that used for the parent product Helixate. A master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB) of the production cell line (31A3BS-R3) were  established.  Factor  VIII  mRNA  was  isolated  from  MCB  and  post-production  cells  and completely  sequenced.  No  point  mutations  or  deletions  were  detected,  indicating  that  FVIII  is accurately transcribed and stable. It could be demonstrated that no detectable rearrangements occurred during fermentation. Fermentation and purification Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  purification  process  to  remove  host  cell  impurities  and  process-related  impurities  consists  of chromatographic steps, a virus inactivation step and an ultrafiltration/diafiltration step. The clearance capacity of the purification process for fermentation and purification related impurities was analysed. The process  is  monitored  by  adequate  in-process  controls.  Reproducibility  of  the  commercial  scale purification process with regard to operational parameters is sufficiently shown. The product received at the end of purification is considered as the active substance.

## Active substance characterisation

The active substance has been extensively characterised using state of the art techniques. The presence of functional sites consistent with plasma-derived FVIII was verified. Von Willebrand Factor is the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

carrier protein of FVIII in plasma. The binding of activated FVIII to phospholipids is a prerequisite for the physiologic function of FVIII as cofactor of activated factor IX. Binding of rFVIII-SF to vWF and phospholipids was tested and verified in vitro by ELISA-techniques.

The oligosaccharide structure of glycoproteins for human therapeutic use can affect the pharmacokinetic profile, immunogenicity, specific activity, and physico-chemical characteristics.

Both  Helixate  and  Helixate  NexGen  products  continue  to  be manufactured  by  the  identical fermentation  process  conditions  and  facilities.  Investigations  to  date  indicate  that  improved  growth conditions  during  the  cell  scale  up  have  resulted  in  a  change  of  oligosaccharide  pattern  with  an increase of highly branched N-linked oligosaccharides (HBNLO).

In  the  development  of  rFVIII,  the  oligosaccharide  structures  were  reported  to  be  qualitatively equivalent to plasma derived FVIII (pd FVIII). In both rFVIII and pd FVIII, highly branched N-linked oligosaccharides  were  observed  as  well  as  other  structures  representing  the  normal  mammalian repertoire. In literature similar results  were  reported  for  porcine  FVIII  and  another  licensed recombinant FVIII product. From these data it was concluded that the presence of HBNLO in rFVIII and rFVIII-SF is consistent with the natural presentation of the molecule and not a unique feature of these preparations.

The  main  objective  was  to  develop  a  stable,  pharmaceutically  acceptable  formulation  without  the addition  of  human  albumin  as  stabiliser.  The  selection  of  the  formulation  is  comprehensively discussed. The choice of excipients has been evaluated and justified.

Specification of the active substance Every batch released has to meet the documented specifications established. The control methods used to routinely analyse the active ingredient have been described in detail, including standards, controls and  test  validity  criteria.  The  validation  of  the  methods  has  been  carried  out  sufficiently.  An oligosaccharide-mapping test has been implemented. A release specification for alpha-galactose will be implemented. Batch to batch consistency Satisfactory batch analysis data are provided. The  main  objective  was  the  comparison  of  pilot  scale  and  commercial  scale  batches.  The  results demonstrated  comparability  of  the  batches  purified  by  the  pilot  scale  and  the  commercial  scale processes. Both production scales were also compared in a pharmacokinetic study (see Part IV). Stability of active ingredient The stability of the active ingredient is being investigated in an ongoing study. The submitted results of two research scale and two pilot scale purification batches are provided. The results predict a 24 month storage period at an intended temperature of -30°C or colder. Three commercial scale batches will be placed into the long-term stability program. Other ingredients Excipients are of Ph.Eur. quality. Product development and finished product Product development Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  fill  size  and  injection  volume  was  minimised  to  2.5  ml  for  all  dosage  forms  (250,  500,  1000 IU/vial). Based on the physico-chemical characterisation of the formulation, the conditions for a new lyophilisation cycle were developed. The choice of the conditions have been sufficiently evaluated and justified.

## Clinical trial formula

The same batch formula has been used for production of pilot and commercial scale batches used in clinical trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacturing process

The manufacturing process is typical for a protein parenteral product. Briefly, one or more purification batches containing the active ingredient, diluted with formulation buffer to target potency and sterile filtered, undergo aseptic filling and freeze drying.

Appropriate in-process controls including processing times and prefiltration bioburden are performed.

## Finished product specification

The  manufacturer  has  set  appropriate  release  criteria  for  the  finished  product.  Control  tests  are adequately described. The potency is determined by one-stage assay, which is also used for potency determinations  of  the  already  licensed  product  Kogenate/Helixate.  The  US  standard  Mega-1,  an intermediate  purity  concentrate,  is  used,  which  was  calibrated  against  the  3 rd WHO-Standard. Discrepancies in potency determinations of recombinant FVIII concentrates depending on the method and the standard used have been observed for all presently available recombinant FVIII products. The Company  will  undertake  a  study  with  the  objectives  to  establish  a  recombinant  FVIII  standard calibrated against the 6 th International Standard.

Batch analyses The release specifications were validated with batch analysis data from five qualification batches. Finished product stability The proposed shelf life is 23 months, including 21 months storage at 2°C to 8°C and two months at temperatures not more than 25°C. The product should be used immediately after reconstitution. The applicant is carrying out an extensive, ongoing stability study over 24 months covering all dosage forms. Regarding the time points for analysis of the test parameters, the study is following the ICH Guideline on Stability Testing of Biologicals/Biotechnologicals. Stability is monitored by a variety of methods. Results support the proposed shelf-life. Immunoaffinity matrix The immunoaffinity matrix used for the purification of rFVIII-SF is identical to the one employed for purification of the parent product. Sufficient data were provided about the process validation and for consistency of the murine antibody and  immunomatrix  production.  The  analytical  validation  of  the  methods  used  is  sufficient.  The stability of the MAb and the immunomatrix has been demonstrated in sufficient detail. Viral safety Cell line development and fermentation require several additives of biological origin. The Company appropriately discussed the virus safety of these components. Materials of bovine origin used during cell  bank  development,  fermentation  and  purification  were  sourced  from  countries  that  have  no reported  cases  of  BSE.  A  human  plasma-derived  product  is  used  for  fermentation.  As  the  source material for this product was tested according to the requirements for plasma derived products and the manufacturing process contains, besides other steps, pasteurisation for virus inactivation, there is in principle no virus safety concerns with the use of this material. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cell line testing was performed according to the current guidelines by in vitro and in vivo assays.

## Routine testing for adventitious viruses is performed.

The effectiveness of the S/D step for the inactivation of enveloped viruses has been demonstrated. The immunoaffinity  chromatography  contributes  to  virus  safety  but  its  effectiveness  is  strongly  virus specific.

The effectiveness of sanitisation of columns was investigated.

## Immunoaffinity matrix

For fermentation of the MAb, two human plasma-derived additives were used. The production of both additives includes a pasteurisation step for viral inactivation. The purification procedure of the MAb includes  steps,  which  contribute  to  the  virus  safety.  In  addition,  the  coupling  process  has  a  high

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effectiveness for viral inactivation. Therefore, there is no viral safety concern arising from the use of the immunoaffinity column.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  newly  developed  purification  process  is  described  and  appropriately  monitored  by  in-process parameters. Validation data revealed the robustness of the purification process concerning the removal of impurities. The active substance has been extensively characterised using state of the art techniques. The presence of functional sites consistent with plasma-derived FVIII was verified and glycosylation extensively studied. Virus safety with regard to enveloped viruses was demonstrated. On the basis of the data provided and the agreed follow-up measures, the quality of the product is satisfactory for the grant of a Marketing Authorisation.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Introduction The  development  of  rFVIII-SF  included  the  production  of  a  pilot  scale  for  clinical  studies  supply, followed by an approximate 3-fold increase in the purification scale for commercial lot production. Evaluation  of  rFVIII-SF  derived  from  the  full-scale  process  was  also  performed  to  assess  potential alterations. Pharmacodynamics Activity of the compound was demonstrated in vitro in both clotting and FXa assays and the molecule was demonstrated to bind von Willebrand Factor (vWF). rFVIII-SF was found to be similar to the parent compound rFVIII (Helixate) in its ability to induce coagulation in FVIII deficient animals. Safety  pharmacology  investigated  the  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  since  assessment  of other organ systems was not considered necessary based on the mechanism of action and the fact that the  parent  product (rFVIII)  was  not  found  to  affect  other  organ  systems.  In  studies  performed  with rFVIII-SF in rats and rabbits no relevant safety issues were detected. Pharmacokinetics Nine  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed.  Parameters  assessed  included  area  under  the  curve (AUC),  maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax),  terminal  half-life  (t½),  plasma  clearance  (CL)  and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss). There were no significant differences between rFVIII-SF and the parent compound, rFVIII, or between the different scale and fill size products. Changes  in  oligosaccharide  pattern  induced  slight  but  not  significant  changes  in  pharmacokinetic parameters, with a tendency towards increased bioavailability. Toxicology Acute toxicity Single infusion toxicity was studied in mice, rats and rabbits with rFVIII-SF from different scales or an excipient control. Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute toxic effects for rFVIII-SF. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Subacute toxicity

Male and female rabbits and dogs received injections of rFVIII-SF or an equal amount of excipient control for five consecutive days. One group of animals was sacrificed one day after, the second group 28 days after the last infusion. All animals tolerated the infusions. There were no unusual necropsy observations found. There were no adverse effects except the development of antibodies to the rFVIIISF protein (four of six rabbits, three of four dogs).

## Mutagenic potential

Mutagenicity studies were not performed with rFVIII-SF. rFVIII-SF utilizes the same cell bank and fermentation  starting  materials  used  in  rFVIII.  Prior  tests  of  the  parent  molecule,  rFVIII,  included reverse mutation assays, a chromosome aberration test and a male dominant lethal test, all of which were negative.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Oncogenic/carcinogenic potential

Oncogenic  potential of  rFVIII  had been  evaluated by  an in vitro transformation assay  and tumorigenicity of the cell line and BHK DNA in nude athymic mice. In those studies, no transforming activity was observed. No carcinogenicity study was performed in view of the nature of the product and its proposed indication.

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive  toxicology  studies  were  not  performed  as  FVIII  deficiencies  primarily  occur  in  male patients.

## Neoantigenicity

In order to determine if the new process for purification induces physical or conformational changes that  produce  new  epitopes  on  the  rFVIII  model,  several  neoantigenicity  studies  were  performed.  In different  studies,  different  pilot  and  full  scale  lots  as  well  as  different  fill  sizes  were  tested.  No evidence for the existence of new epitopes on the rFVIII-SF molecule was seen in any of the tests.

- 1.) Two pivotal studies (Study BAY 14-2222/0102 in North America [NA] and Study BAY 142222/0101  in  Europe  [EU])  in  previously  treated  patients  (PTP)  with  severe  haemophilia  A (FVIII&lt;2%), divided into:

It  has  to  be  recognised  that  these  types  of  experiments  do  not  provide  reliable  information  about neoantigenicity in man. Toxicity of excipients Excipients are sucrose, histidine, sodium chloride, calcium chloride and glycine. Data were provided on the lowest published toxic dose for each component and toxicities associated with multiple dose administration.  From  the  data  provided,  no  risk  to  patients  would  be  expected  from  the  excipients used. Discussion on non-clinical aspects The pharmacodynamic studies presented show that FVIII-SF is able to affect bleeding time and aPTT as  parameters  of  bleeding  disorder.  The  acute  and  subacute  toxicological  investigations  provide  no evidence  that  rFVIII-SF  has  a  different  toxicological  risk  than  the  parent  compound  rFVIII.  The results of the non-clinical investigations show that rFVIII-SF is a product with acceptable preclinical pharmacological  and  toxicological  properties.  Concerning  neoantigenicity,  only  clinical  data  can provide valid information. 4. Clinical aspects The approved therapeutic indications are as follows: Treatment  and  prophylaxis  of  bleeding  in  patients  with  haemophilia  A  (congenital  factor  VIII deficiency). This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease. The company submitted documentation on the following studies: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Stage I: pharmacokinetic trial, cross-over with rFVIII, n= 35 patients (20 in NA and 15 in EU)

Stage II/III: repeat pharmacokinetic trial at week 24, n=24 patients (19 in NA and 5 in EU)

Stage II/III: clinical efficacy and safety over 6 months, n= 71 patients (38 in NA and 33 in EU)

Stage IIIS: surgical procedures, n=15 (3 in NA and 12 in EU)

Stage IIIE: clinical efficacy and safety over 18 (NA) and 24 (EU) months, n= 65 patients (35 in NA and 30 in EU).

- 2.) Study BAY 14-2222/100124, pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study (n=20 patients) comparing the rFVIII-SF from pilot scale production used in the above mentioned trials with products from the commercial-scale production.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 3.) Study BAY 14-2222/0104 (EU) and Bay 14-2222/0105 (NA):  two open trials of efficacy and safety in paediatric patients (previously untreated or minimally treated, PUP, MTP), started in October 1997, intended to enrol a total of 60 patients with a minimum of 18 PUPs each in US and Europe. Final study analysis is scheduled for when all patients have completed 2 years on study, or 20 exposure days, whichever comes later.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacological and toxicological studies, detailed in Part III of the dossier, showed the biological activities  and  safety  pharmacology  of  rFVIII  and  rFVIII-SF  to  be  comparable.  Therefore,  human pharmacodynamic studies were not considered necessary. Pharmacodynamic parameters were studied in the pharmacokinetic studies performed in patients.

## Pharmacokinetics

Study BAY 2222/0102 (NA) and 2222/0101(EU) Both studies were of open label, randomised, cross-over design comparing administration of 50 IU/kg of either rFVIII or rFVIII-SF given intravenously over 10 minutes. Administration of either product was on two different days separated by a washout period of at least 5 days in the NA study and 4 days in the EU study. As primary pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the area under the curve (AUC) and the  maximum  concentrations  Cmax were  calculated.  Further,  the  terminal  half-life  (t½)  and  the incremental FVIII recovery (%·kg/IU) were determined. Blood was sampled pre-infusion and within 10 minutes of the end of the infusion, then at 30 min, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30 (EU) or 36 (NA) and 48 hours. For determination of FVIII the one-stage assay was used. The estimated potency per vial was used for the labelling of batches and for the calculation of PK parameters. Stage I 20 [NA] and 15 [EU] male patients with severe hemophilia A (&lt;2%) were recruited. In both, the NA and  the  EU  study,  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  determined  were  comparable,  but  there  was  a tendency for higher FVIII levels after rFVIII infusions than after rFVIII-SF (see table 1). In the NA study, bioequivalence of rFVIII and rFVIII-SF for the calculated PK parameters AUC, Cmax, t½ could be demonstrated. In the EU study, statistical analysis failed to show equivalence between rFVIII and rFVIII-SF for the parameters AUC and Cmax, whereas t½, mean residence time (MRT) and recovery values  were  equivalent.  The  Company  presented  a  reasonable  explanation.  In  both  studies,  aPTT values showed similar degrees of shortening appropriate to the level of FVIII following infusion of both  rFVIII  and  rFVIII-SF.  The  aPTT  values  are  comparable  with  those  obtained  after  infusion  of plasma-derived FVIII.

Stage II/III - Repeat pharmacokinetic investigation at week 24

Following administration of rFVIII-SF over 24 weeks, a 48-hour repeat pharmacokinetic profile was obtained. All 19 of the NA Stage I patients who continued into Stage II/III participated in the week 24 pharmacokinetic study. Five patients participated in the repeat kinetic part of the EU study. For the NA study,  equivalence  was  demonstrated  for  AUC,  Cmax and  t ½  (see  table  2).  Concerning  the  EU study, data obtained at week 24 appeared comparable although the small number of patients precluded formal statistical conclusions.

The values obtained from the EU study, especially the repeat PK study, are higher than from the NA study. In contrast to the NA-study, in the EU-studies most of the patients did have residual (i.e. prior to the infusion) FVIII levels &gt;1 (up to 4) IU/dl. These high residual values influence the concentrationtime-curve. Thus, it was concluded that the PK data obtained in the NA study were more reliable.

This study demonstrated bioequivalence between pilot and commercial scale products.

It can be concluded from the data provided that the pharmacokinetic profile of rFVIII-SF is consistent with  the  profile  for  the  parent  product  rFVIII  and  other  FVIII  products.  The  data  from  the  repeat pharmacokinetic study in NA demonstrate that rFVIII-SF can maintain a consistent pharmacokinetic profile over a 24 week period of treatment. Study BAY 2222/100124 Pilot vs. Commercial-scale product bioequivalence study This  was  a  single  centre,  randomised,  crossover  bioequivalence  study  conducted  in  22  PTPs  with severe haemophilia A. Two lots of pilot-scale material and one lot of commercial-scale material were used. Twenty patients received two single infusions of rFVIII-SF including one infusion of the pilotscale  and  one  infusion  of  the  commercial-scale  product.  These  were  administered  in  a  cross-over fashion with a minimum of 5 days washout between treatments. The patients received approximately 50 IU/kg of the study drug during both infusions. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters for the pilot-scale and the commercial-scale products yielded comparable results, documenting bioequivalence in terms of AUC and Cmax (table 3). Table 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters in pilot vs. commercial-scale products AUC (%·h·kg/IU) Cmax (%·kg/IU) t ½ (h) The PK parameter values tend to be higher than in the PK studies of stage I (at least compared to the NA data). This is partly related to the relatively high residual FVIII levels in 3 of the patients in this study. Furthermore, the use of a less concentrated solution (100 IU/ml compared with 200 IU/ml in the stage I trial) may have resulted in less dosing losses during the administration of the product.

The Company will perform a pharmacokinetic study to further investigate the influence of changes in oligosaccharide pattern on pharmacokinetic parameters in man.

## Clinical trials

The Company presented studies meeting the requirements of the available CHMP Note for Guidance CHMP/198/95  final.  In  order  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  rFVIII-SF,  two  open  labelled multicenter studies were performed, study BAY 14-2222/0102 in NA and study BAY 14-2222/0101 in EU. Both studies were designed to include efficacy and safety investigation following administration for  a  six-month  period  (Stage  II/III)  as  well  as  administration  to  patients  undergoing  surgery (stage IIIS). Those patients who participated in the stage I and II/III pharmacokinetic trial were included in these studies. One patient in the EU participated in stage IIIS only. Sixty-five patients completed an extended 24 (EU, n=30) and 18 (NA, n=35) month follow-up (stage IIIE). During the first 2 (EU) and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4 (NA) weeks of home treatment, patients were to be given prophylactic infusions three times weekly with a dose of 20 IU/kg intravenously. After this period patients returned to their pre-study regimen, either continuous prophylaxis or on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes. Dosage was according to patient needs. FVIII recovery was measured on samples taken at pre- and 10 minutes post-infusion at weeks 4, 12 and 24. FVIII concentrations were measured using a one-stage method.

## Clinical efficacy

## Efficacy in PTPs

The primary clinical efficacy variable was the number of treatments required per bleed during stage II/III/IIIE. A secondary variable was the subjective patient assessment (no response, moderate, good, excellent). In the NA study (n=35), during the 18-month observation period, a total of 1710 bleeding episodes were reported which were treated with a mean dosage of 27.5 ± 8.1 IU/kg. Of these 1710 bleeding episodes 13.8% were severe bleedings. Overall, 95% of bleeds responded to 1 or 2 infusions. Patients  rated  their  overall  responses  as  excellent  (23.9%),  good  (59.1%),  moderate  (15.8%)  or  no response  (0.8%).  In  the  EU  study  (n=29),  during  the  24-month  observation  period,  a  total  of  875 bleeding  episodes  were  reported,  of  which  15%  were  severe  bleedings.  Overall,  91%  of  bleeds responded  to  treatment  with  one  or  2  infusions.  Patients  rated  their  overall  response  as  excellent (17.4%),  good  (58.4%),  moderate  (16.6%),  or  no  response  (0.9%).  In  both  studies,  FVIII  recovery levels remained consistent from baseline across stage II/III (24-week period) with no loss of activity.

Bleed./month Bleed./year IU/kg/year 2482 ± 1422 In  the  NA  study,  3  surgical  procedures  were  performed  in  three  patients  In  the  EU  study,  surgical procedures  were  performed  in  12  patients  who  underwent  19  surgical  procedures.  rFVIII-SF  was administered per protocol in bolus infusions. One of the patients was given a continuous infusion in violation  of  the  protocol.  Haemostasis  was  rated  as  either  good  or  excellent.  No  post-operative complications were reported. Of the total of 22 surgical procedures, 11 were minor procedures (e.g. teeth extraction). The patients with minor surgical procedures received 393 ± 192 IU/kg/surgery over 9.4 ± 5 exposure days. The patients with major surgical procedures received 1747 ± 766 IU/kg/surgery over  a  mean  of  25.6  ±  14  exposure  days.  Blood  transfusion  was  necessary  during  two  surgical procedures. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In general, from the data provided (number of infusions, patients' response), rFVIII-SF was shown to be an effective replacement therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleedings in haemophiliacs including  surgical  procedures.  In  a  few  cases  where  patients  received  more  than  4  follow  up treatments for bleeding, the company was asked to comment and provided satisfactory explanations.

In order to fully assess the efficacy data, the number of infusions used to control bleeding episodes were correlated with the FVIII total consumption per bleeding episode and the number of bleeding episodes  during  the  observation  period.  The  values  of  mean  consumption  per  body  weight  and  per year and the mean number of bleedings per year (see table 4) are in accordance with values from other plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII products. The Company also provided the individual values of the  FVIII  consumption  per  bleeding  episode  (summarised  dosages  from  all  follow-up  treatments).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Individual  data  confirmed  that  the  values  achieved  during  treatment  with  rFVIII-SF  lie  within  the expected range for other FVIII products.

## Efficacy in PUPs and MTPs (BAY 14-2222/0104 (EU) and BAY 14-2222/0105 (NA))

In October 1997, two clinical trials were initiated in Europe and North America to study the safety and efficacy  of  rFVIII-SF  in  young  children  with  severe  haemophilia  A  who  have  been  previously untreated (PUPs) or minimally treated (MTPs). The Company provided interim reports up to the end April 1999. Up to the date of this analysis, a total of 61 patients had been treated with at least one infusion, i.e. in the EU study 31 (19 PUPs and 12 MTPs) and in the NA study 30 (18 PUPs and 12 MTPs). Of these 61 patients, 53 patients are severe haemophiliacs with a residual FVIII activity &lt;1% and  8  patients  have  a  residual  FVIII  activity  between  1  and  2%.  Exposure  data  for  all  patients  are summarised in Table 5.

From the 73 patients included in the PTP studies, 58 patients (79.5%) reported adverse events (AE) and thereof 13 (17.8%) patients reported drug-related AEs. These 13 patients reported 24 drug-related AEs of  which  19  (80%)  were  classified  as  mild,  4  (16%)  as  moderate  and  1  (4%)  as  severe.  This severe AE, attributed as possibly drug-related, was observed in a patient who developed intermittent chest pain and palpitations. The drug-related AEs were rash/pruritus (4 patients), injection site reaction (3),  chest  pain/malaise  (2),  hypertension  (1),  inhibitor  increase  (1),  unusual  taste  in  the  mouth  (1), sweating  (1),  rhinitis  (2).  Further  AE's  classified  as  only  remotely  drug  related  were  seborrheic dermatitis increase, diarrhoea, stinging in the face, lipothymia and hyperesthesia (arms).

Approximately 90% of bleeding episodes responded to treatment with one or two infusions. The data upon consumption and frequency of bleeding is summarised in Table 6. Table 6: Overview of the efficacy parameters from the PUP/MTP study up to end April 1999 (*data not per bleeding episode) On the basis of the available data, rFVIII-SF does not appear to be different to other FVIII products in terms of effective treatments of PUPs and MTPs. Clinical safety Safety in PTPs (studies BAY 14-2222/0102 and 0101) Medicinal product no longer authorised

No vital  sign  changes  or  laboratory  abnormalities  in  renal,  hepatic,  or  haematologic  function  were associated with infusions of rFVIII-SF. As the majority of patients had pre-existing hepatitis and/or HIV disease, elevated transaminase values could be seen at baseline and intermittently throughout the study.  However,  no  patient  showed  a  persistent  or  progressive  elevation  in  hepatic  transaminases during treatment.

Development of FVIII inhibitors (BU&gt;0.6) was regularly screened at baseline and after 4, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment and once or twice during Stage IIIE. In the EU study, inhibitor titre was measured using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay whereas in the NA study the classical Bethesda Assay was  performed.  The  Nijmegen  modification  results  in  fewer  false  positive  inhibitor  values.  FVIII

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inhibitor  formation  was  observed  in  one  of  the  71  patients  in  Stage  II/III.  This  patient  with  a  preexisting low-titre inhibitor (0.5 BU) experienced a transient increase in inhibitor titre (up to 1.34 BU).

ELISA determinations were performed to detect  antibodies  to  mouse  (C7F7),  baby  hamster  kidney (BHK) cells and rFVIII protein. Again these investigations were performed at baseline and after 4, 12 and  24  weeks  of  treatment.  Two  patients  in  the  EU  study  showed  transient  positive  ELISA measurements to rFVIII protein. Another patient had elevated ELISA measurements at pre-study and at  nearly  all  other  time  points.  However,  FVIII  recovery  measurements  were  not  affected  in  these patients.

In general, the presented data indicate that the adverse event profile for rFVIII-SF in PTPs does not differ from that of plasma-derived or other recombinant FVIII products. Concerning immunogenicity of rFVIII-SF, from 71 patients enrolled in stage II/III there are 59 patients with severe haemophilia (FVIII&lt;1%) who had received more than 10 exposures (range 14-178) over a 6 month observation period. Taking into account the difficulties to assure reliable inhibitor measurements in some cases, so far there has been no evidence of development of de novo inhibitors in PTPs. There were 5 isolated cases where patients received another FVIII product during the study. Explanations were provided and in  no  case  was  insufficient  efficacy  with  rFVIII-SF  the  reason  for  the  administration  of  another product.

In ongoing trials in PTPs and PUPs, two batches with higher HBNLO levels have been used. These batches were used in the PTP studies in 25% and 37%, respectively, of total infusions. There has been no  clear  trend  associated  with  these  lots  in  terms  of  number  of  infusions  used  to  control  bleeding. Recovery  data  are  only  available  for  two  PUPs.  No  AE  were  reported  in  any  trial  as  specifically related to these two batches. Furthermore, there was no meaningful difference in AE reporting based on exposure to these batches. No patients in PTP trials displayed a change in inhibitor status. Of the reported inhibitors in the PUP trials, all occurred prior to exposure to these batches.

Safety in PUPs and MTPs (Study BAY 14-2222/0104 (EU) and BAY 14-2222/0105 (NA)) Of 61 patients who received at least one infusion, in 44 patients a total of 249 AEs were reported. Only 8 of these AEs were considered as possibly or probably related to the rFVIII-SF, i.e. 6 cases of inhibitor development, a forearm bleed following venipuncture and one case of constipation. In total 8 patients  have  developed  an  inhibitor  (4  PUP  and  4  MTP,  3  low  and  5  high  titre  inhibitors).  The inhibitors occurred after a median of 6.5 days (range: 2-16). Given the still small number of patients who have more than 20 exposure days (17/61, approx. 30%), a final  estimation  of  efficacy and safety in PUPs and MTPs, especially incidence of inhibitors, is not possible. The Company will provide ongoing data on a regular basis. Following the assessment of the 2 nd and 3 rd PSURs, section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the SPC was updated in line with the core SPC for Factor VIII products in order to include the inhibitor incidence rate  in  PUPs  (Previously  Untreated  Patients).  In  addition,  a  minor  modification  regarding  allergic reactions to mouse/hamster proteins was added as well as fever as ADR's, as requested by CHMP Clinical experience with batches showing a changed glycosylation pattern As previously described in this report, a change in glycosylation pattern (higher HBNLO levels) has been observed in final batches of rFVIII-SF and rFVIII. Clinical experience with rFVIII-SF Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Clinical experience with rFVIII

Three  different  treatment  clinics  were  actively  surveyed  regarding  their  evaluation  of  safety  and efficacy associated with a marketed rFVIII batch with higher HBNLO levels. 600 000 units of this batch  were  distributed  in  the  area  serviced  by  these  three  clinics.  There  were  no  adverse  events reported. In  an  ongoing prophylactic infusion trial, 5 patients received this batch and 15 received a batch  with  a  low  level  of  HBNLO.  No  adverse  events,  inhibitor  formation  or  joint  bleeds  were reported during the time periods that either the high level or low level batches were used for infusion therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Post-marketing surveillance study

From  the  presented  clinical  experience  for  batches  of  both  products  with  an  increase  in  HBNLO content (rFVIII: 19 batches; rFVIII-SF: 2 batches), no apparent adverse or inferior safety or efficacy observations have been identified. Therefore, there are no concerns related to this change that would prevent  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation.  However,  Tthe  Company  will  perform  a  postmarketing surveillance study with rFVIII-SF with particular focus upon any associations with HBNLO content.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

On  the  basis  of  the  presented  studies  which  included  overall  73  patients,  Helixate  NexGen  is  an effective and safe replacement therapy in PTPs. Given the small number of PUPs and MTPs who have more than 20 exposure days (17/61, approx. 30%), a final estimation of efficacy and safety (especially incidence of inhibitors) is not possible. Nevertheless, from the available data, Helixate NexGen does not appear to be different from other FVIII products in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of PUPs and MTPs. Therefore, a statement in the SPC regarding limited experience in paediatric patients is not considered necessary. The outcome of the ongoing PUP/MTP study and future studies will be reported on an ongoing basis with the periodic safety update reports.

Pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rabbits  indicate  that  oligosaccharide  pattern  changes  may  influence pharmacokinetic parameters with a tendency to increased bioavailability.

5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment Quality On the basis of the submitted data and the agreed follow-up measures, the quality of this product is considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  defined  in  the  SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to  the uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  Viral  safety  and  batch  to  batch consistency have been documented and the relevant tests will be performed according to the agreed specifications. Change in glycosylation pattern is being appropriately investigated in on-going studies. Appropriate  testing  has  been  implemented  to  assure  batch  to  batch  consistency  with  respect  to glycosylation. Non-clinical (pre-clinical) studies The pharmacodynamic studies presented show that rFVIII-SF is able to affect bleeding time and aPTT as  parameters  of  bleeding  disorder.  The  acute  and  subacute  toxicological  investigations  provide  no evidence that rFVIII-SF has a higher or different toxicological risk than the parent compound rFVIII. In  view  of  the  pathogenesis  of  haemophilia  A,  reproductive  toxicity  has  not  been  studied.  It  is acceptable that studies on mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed with rFVIIISF since prior investigations did not show that the parent compound had such toxicological risks. An animal model was used to assess neoantigenicity, however only therapeutic administration to patients can provide information regarding possible neoantigenicity. In conclusion, rFVIII-SF does not show evidence of toxicological risks as far as is assessable from animal toxicological studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Based on the pharmacokinetic trials the values of AUC0-48 (27-32 kg·h/IU), Cmax (2.1-2.2 %·kg/IU) and t½ (13-16 h) after application of 50 IU/kg rFVIII-SF comply with plasma-derived or other recombinant FVIII  products.  Further,  these  values  demonstrate  that  the  achieved  amount  of  FVIII  and  the maintenance of plasma levels are as expected according to the posology in the SPC.

The clinical data show that rFVIII-SF is effective to prevent and to control bleedings in PTPs with severe haemophilia A. Taking into account the difficulties to assure reliable inhibitor measurements in some cases, there has been no evidence of development of de novo inhibitors in PTPs. The incidence rates for the most common adverse events, i.e. rash/pruritus, injection site reaction, chest pain/malaise, and unusual taste in the mouth, indicate that drug-related adverse-events were similar in nature and number to those  in  similar  clinical  trials  with  other  FVIII  products.  Post-marketing  data  on  further

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients treated with rFVIII-SF will be needed in order to make a final assessment of the adverse event pattern.

Given the small number of PUPs and MTPs who have more than 20 exposure days, a final estimation of  efficacy  and  safety  (especially  incidence  of  inhibitors)  is  not  possible.  Nevertheless,  from  the available data, Helixate NexGen does not appear to be different from other FVIII products in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of PUPs and MTPs. Therefore, a statement in the SPC regarding limited  experience  in  paediatric  patients  is  not  considered  necessary.  The  outcome  of  the  ongoing PUP/MTP study will be reported on an ongoing basis with the periodic safety update reports.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Further information on the change in glycosylation pattern was requested from the company and the issue was referred to the CHMP's Biotechnology Working Party, where the company also provided an oral clarification. On the basis of the available information from on-going studies, the introduction of testing to assure batch to batch consistency, and relevant follow-up measures, the quality issues were considered resolved.

The animal pharmacokinetic studies and clinical safety and efficacy data on batches with the changed glycosylation  pattern,  did  not  raise  any  concerns  that  would  prevent  the  granting  of  a  marketing authorisation and relevant follow-up measures will be undertaken. Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Helixate  NexGen  was  favourable  in  the  treatment  and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
