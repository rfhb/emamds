## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Novel  influenza  viruses  may  emerge  following  the  reassortment  of  two  co-circulating  viral  strains (Belshe, 2005) or from a series of genetic mutations in one strain (Taubenberger et al., 2005; Tumpey et al., 2005). Pandemic influenza outbreaks occur when a new virus strain is able to infect humans and to  transmit  efficiently  from  person  to  person  in  a  previously  unexposed  population.  A  pandemic outbreak is expected to spread quickly and cause substantial global morbidity and mortality (Tumpey et  al.,  2005;  Johnson  and  Muller,  2002).  Due  to  the  anticipated  difficulty  in  producing  sufficient quantities of the specific pandemic vaccine against the emerging strain within such a short time after identification  and  confirmation  of  the  pandemic  influenza  viral  strain,  the  production  during  the interpandemic period of a vaccine such as AFLUNOV against a potential influenza pandemic viral strain (i.e., a pre-pandemic vaccine) may:

i)  Permit  early  vaccination  at  the  start  of  a  pandemic  (World  Health  Organization  [WHO]  phase  6) when the \"fast track pandemic\" vaccine is not yet available.

ii)  Prime  during  pre-pandemic  stages  (WHO  phases  3  to  5)  to  reduce  mortality  against  a  closely matched pandemic strain in those countries where infections are occurring.

iii) Reduce the chance of the emergence of a reassortant pandemic strain by vaccinating those (e.g., veterinarians, poultry workers, operators involved in the manufacturing of vaccines with pandemic-like strains, laboratory workers) at high risk of infection from both avian and human viruses.

Indeed,  even  a  vaccine  of  limited  efficacy,  such  a  pre-pandemic  vaccine,  is  expected  to  be  able  to mitigate a pandemic (Ferguson et al., 2006).

The H5N1 strain is still considered as a likely candidate from which pandemic influenza may evolve. Differently  from  the  recent  swine  influenza  pandemic  caused  by  the  A/H1N1  (A/California/7/2009) strain,  which  seems  to  be  easily  transmitted  between  humans  but  has  a  lower  mortality  rate,  with avian origin H5N1 strains causing influenza outbreaks transmission within the human population is rare but the mortality rate in infected humans can be high. From the start of the H5N1 outbreaks in mid2003 until  24  September  2009,  442  individuals  have  been  infected  with  laboratory-confirmed  avian H5N1 influenza, 262 of whom died

(http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian\\_influenza/country/cases\\_table\\_2009 \\_09\\_24/en/index.html).

This  MAA  took  into  account  the  'Guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  of  MAA  for  influenza vaccines derived from strains with a pandemic potential and intended for use before the pandemic is declared'  (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006).  The  pre-pandemic  vaccine  AFLUNOV  is  identical  to  the H5N1 pandemic  mock-up  vaccine,  previously  identified  as  Focetria,  already  approved  by  EMA  (May 2007, Commission decision) for pandemic use. Currently the name Focetria identifies the actual H1N1 pandemic vaccine and the name Foclivia has been attributed to the H5N1 mock-up vaccine. With the exception  of  antigen  composition  and  dose,  AFLUNOV  is  identical  to  authorized  inter-pandemic seasonal vaccine Fluad. Both vaccines are egg-derived, surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted with MF59C.1 (MF59), and are produced following the same manufacturing process.

AFLUNOV has been approved for the active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus in adults and elderly (18 years of age and over), outside of the context of a mock-up core dossier, that is, for prophylaxis before the pandemic is declared.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

AFLUNOV  is  an  egg-derived,  monovalent  vaccine,  containing  surface  antigens  from  an  H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) influenza virus.

The  formulation  proposed  for  AFLUNOV,  selected  basing  on  the  Clinical  Trials  performed  using pandemic strains, contains 7.5 µg HA of antigen/dose It is 6-folds lower that the total amount of HA present in conventional trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, that is 15 µg HA per strain (i.e. 45 µg HA/dose).

The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in an emulsion in a pre-filled syringe (single dose).

With  the  exception  of  antigen  composition  and  dose,  the  candidate  vaccine  against  avian  A/H5N1 influenza  is  identical  to  authorised  interpandemic  seasonal  Fluad.  This  egg-derived,  surface-antigen, inactivated, influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1  (MF59)  is  produced by an identical manufacturing process.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The Active  Substance  (Monovalent  Pooled  Harvest,  MPH)  is  a  buffered  sterile  suspension  containing predominantly the purified outer membrane proteins, Haemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA), of the H5N1 avian influenza virus strain.

## Manufacture

The  influenza  avian  vaccine  of  the  present  application  has  been  developed  from  Fluad,  a  Novartis seasonal, trivalent influenza vaccine and is produced by the same manufacturing process.

The manufacturing process of Monovalent Pool Harvest (MPH) involves the cultivation of the pandemic influenza  virus  strain  in  embryonated  chicken  eggs,  harvesting  of  allantoic  fluid,  concentration  by ultrafiltration  and  formaldehyde  inactivation,  followed  by  whole  virus  purification  using  sucrose gradient centrifugation and diafiltration.

The HA and NA antigens from the surface of the purified whole virus are solubilised by treatment with a detergent (CTAB). The solubilised antigens are then separated from the non-solubilised components of the virus by centrifugation. The resultant supernatants are treated with a polystyrene based resin to remove CTAB. The polystyrene resin is removed by filtration and the resulting MPH is filter sterilised.

## Embryonated Eggs

The Influenza Virus Strain is propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. While Master and Working seed lots are grown in specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs the Monovalent Pooled Harvest is produced using Production eggs. The SPF status of the flock is compliant with the chapter entitled 'Chicken Flocks free from Specified Pathogens for the Production and Quality Control of Vaccines' of Ph.Eur. monograph on Vaccina ad Usum Veterinarium, chapter.

## Preparation and control of Virus Seeds

The  reference  virus  (H5N1  NIBRG-14)  was  manufactured  by  Reverse  Genetics  (RG)  technology  and provided by NIBSC, UK, an authorized WHO reference laboratory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According  to  Ph.Eur.  the  Master  Seed  (MS)  is  obtained  after  no  more  than  15  passages    from  the approved reference virus. H5N1 MS was obtained after one passage from the reference virus received from the WHO reference laboratory. Aliquots of MS are aseptically filled into sterile sealed vials, and stored in a freezer at a temperature lower than -60  C.

The Working Seed (WS) is obtained after only one passage from the MS using SPF eggs. WS is QC tested and the vials are stored at a temperature lower than -60  C. WS is tested for HA and NA identity, absence  of  mycoplasma,  sterility,  infectivity,  HA  titre  and  egg  infectivity  (spot  HA  test)  to  assure identity and microbial quality.

## Virus cultivation

Pre-incubated, candled, fertile hens eggs are disinfected by fumigation and are held until inoculation at a  controlled  temperature.  The  virus  inoculum  is  prepared  from  the  WS  at  a  dilution  calculated  to ensure total egg infection and maximum virus yield and is injected into the allantoic cavity of each production  egg.  After  inoculation,  the  eggs  are  incubated  at  an  optimum  temperature  and  time  for maximum virus yield. After incubation the eggs are cooled to 2-8°C and thereafter fed directly into the Harvesting room.

## Harvesting of Allantoic Fluid

The allantoic fluid (AF) is collected into the harvesting vessel. The resultant fluid is then clarified by centrifugation, collected in a refrigerated tank, which is then connected to an ultrafiltration system to concentrate the allantoic fluid.

## Inactivation

An aqueous solution of formaldehyde is added to the clarified concentrated allantoic fluid .  The content of the tank is then transferred to a sanitised and temperature controlled inactivation vessel and stirred throughout the inactivation period. The inactivation cycle depends upon the characteristics of specific virus strains. The inactivation temperature is selected in order not to compromise antigenicity.

## Purification

The virus is removed from the inactivated allantoic fluid using continuous flow isopycnic ultracentrifugation  and  a  sucrose  density  gradient,  which  concentrates  and  purifies  the  virus.  The different fractions which contain the purified virus are collected and tested.

The  fractions  are  pooled  together,  and  stored  under  controlled  temperature  conditions.  The  Pool  is diluted with PBS and then diafiltered. The Pool is sampled and tested . After the sampling a clarifying filtration takes place with pre-filters and filters of different pore sizes. The filtered product represents the Whole Virus Concentrate, and it is sampled for testing. A Polysorbate 80 solution is added to the Whole Virus Concentrate and the product is stored waiting for the Split test results.

## Haemagglutinin and Neuraminidase solubilisation

Following the split test results, CTAB Solution is added to the Whole Virus Concentrate to solubilise the HA  and  NA  antigens.  The  product  is  then  centrifuged  under  continuous  flow  and  the  supernatant collected.

A polystyrene resin, suspended in PBS, is added to the Subunit Supernatant Pool to absorb the CTAB. Afterwards, the product undergoes a clarifying filtration to remove the resin, and a stabilizer solution is added and the product is then filtered into a closed sterile stainless steel tank.

## Filling, storage and transportation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After the filtration described above, the monovalent pool is transferred to Rosia, where it is sampled for  Bioburden,  and  sterile  filtered  into  a  sterile  container.  The  Monovalent  Pooled  Harvest  is  sterile filtered.  An  Integrity  Test  of  the  sterilising  filter is  performed  before  and  after  filtration.  The  filtered Monovalent Pooled Harvest (i.e. the Active Substance) is sampled for release testing and stored at 28°C in a stainless steel tank.

## Process Validation and/or Evaluation

Consistency of production was demonstrated by data provided on three H5N1 full-scale batches and further  supported  by  batch  analysis  results  of  the  inter-pandemic  vaccine  production  campaigns  of previous years.

MPHs are manufactured in compliance with GMP and according to requirements of the Ph.Eur. Studies have  been  carried  out  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  antigen  production  process  to  inactivate potential viral, bacterial and mycoplasma contamination in addition to influenza viruses.

The formaldehyde inactivation step has been evaluated for three consecutive production egg harvests for H5N1.

The optimum quantities of polysorbate 80 and of CTAB to allow complete splitting of the virus vaccine strain is determined in the QC laboratory, prior to application to production lots. The optimal conditions are determined on the basis of the electrophoresis patterns, the haemagglutinin and the neuraminidase activity identified in the lots. Tests are performed to determine the levels of potential impurities, which may arise in Monovalent Pooled Harvest. Limits are applied to these impurities.

Transportation between Novartis Siena and Rosia sites is carried out using validated procedures.

## Characterisation

The  Active  Substance  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  monograph  for  'Influenza  Vaccine,  Surface  Antigen, Inactivated'.  It  is  a  sterile  suspension  containing  predominantly  the  purified  outer  membranes proteins: HA and NA of the influenza virus strain. The crystal structure of HA has been determined to atomic resolution for the native HA, for the HA bound to a number of different receptor analogues, for proteolytic  fragments  of  HA  which  have  gone  through  the  conformational  changes  required  for mediating membrane fusion, and for HA complexed with neutralizing antibody.

Influenza virus NA structure has been determined with structural studies of NA in complex with specific monoclonal antibodies, by electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography amino acid sequencing and gene sequencing.

The  concentrations  of  potentially  contaminant  substances  (formaldehyde,  barium  sulphate,  sodium citrate, and CTAB) are controlled during the process or in the MPH. Limits are applied. Polysorbate 80 is also used as an excipient of MF59C.1 adjuvant and is not considered as a residual of production but is  nevertheless  tested  on  the  MPH.  It  is  concluded  that  the  impurities  in  the  Active  Substance  are sufficiently controlled.

## Specifications

The MPH complies with the Ph.Eur. monograph 01/2006:0869 on Influenza Vaccine (Surface Antigen, Inactivated).

The MPH is tested for release for Haemagglutinin Identity and Content (SRID), Neuraminidase Identity (ELISA),  Viral  inactivation,  Purity  (SDS-PAGE),  Sterility,  CTAB,  Polysorbate  80,  Barium,  Citrates, Endotoxin, Formaldehyde, Ovalbumin Content and Appearance. Specifications have been selected to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as much as possible in accordance to the Ph.Eur. monograph for the influenza vaccine (surface antigen inactivated).

Specification  for  Appearance,  Haemagglutinin  identity  and  content,  Neuraminidase  Identity,  Viral Inactivation, Purity, Sterility comply with Ph.Eur. for the Monovalent Bulk. A limit for Endotoxin and Ovalbumin is set up on the Active Substance to ensure that the Ph.Eur. specification for the Final Lot (i.e. monovalent at 7.5 µg HA/dose) is met.

Due to the presence of the adjuvant in the Finished Product, the test for Formaldehyde is performed on the Monovalent Pooled Harvest. Ovalbumin is also controlled on the Active Substance. The acceptance limits have been set to ensure that the Ph.Eur. limits for the Finished Product (i.e. monovalent at 7.5 µg HA/dose) are not exceeded. The concentrations of the other substances used during manufacture of the vaccine (i.e. CTAB, Barium, Citrates, Polysorbate 80) are controlled in the Active Substance. The limit for the Citrates is calculated considering the content of HA on the Final Lot. It has to be noted that Polysorbate 80 is also used as an excipient of MF59C.1 adjuvant. Test for Barium may be omitted in case the barium treatment is not performed during production.

All  the  relevant  analytical  methods  have  been  validated  or  qualified  for  the  Active  Substance.  It  is acceptable that some analytical validations have been performed on the inter-pandemic strains, as the methods are not strain specific.

Influenza reference antigens and reagents for strain characterization and vaccine standardization are provided by WHO Collaborating Centres, usually National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK. The reference antigen and antiserum reagents are used to calibrate the haemagglutinin content of inactivated influenza vaccines by the single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) Test.

## Stability

The applicant  has  provided  stability  data  up  to  36  months  for  three  full-scale  batches  of  NIBRG-14 H5N1 Monovalent Pooled harvest. The key stability-indicating parameter are the HA content and purity, measured with the same methods and acceptance limits used at release. The data are consistent with the proposed shelf-life of 24 months for the active substance when stored at 2-8°C.

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

AFLUNOV  is  an  influenza  vaccine  for  human  use  (surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted  with MF59C.1) for pre-pandemic use.

The Finished Medicinal Product is a combination of MPH, MF59C.1 adjuvant bulk and buffer solutions. The vaccine application is based on the H5N1 Reverse Genetics Strain NIBRG 14, which is derived from the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

The  MF59C.1  adjuvant  is  an  oil-in-water  emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene  that  is  an intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of cholesterol. Squalene is a commercially available natural product distilled from shark liver oil. It is then redistilled and supplied by qualified manufacturers.

1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  process  for  the  Final  Bulk  preparation  consists  is  a  simple  mixing  operation.  The  formulated suspension is filled into syringes. The potency of the vaccine is expressed as the concentration of the HA protein.

The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.

## Description and Composition of the Finished Product

Each 0.5 ml dose of vaccine has the following composition:

## Pharmaceutical Development

AFLUNOV  contains  the  same  adjuvant  and  is  manufactured  with  the  same  process  used  for  Fluad. Fluad  a  surface  antigen,  trivalent  inactivated,  inter-pandemic  influenza  vaccine,  adjuvanted  with MF59C.1,  is  currently  the  only  influenza  vaccine  with  an  adjuvant  on  the  market,  and  has  been approved in 2000 through a Mutual Recognition Procedure in 12 EU countries. Fluad is also licensed and marketed in other European countries and outside Europe.

## Formulation Development

The  Finished  Product  is  a  combination  of  MPH,  MF59C.1  adjuvant  bulk  and  buffer  solutions.  The present core pandemic dossier describes the H5N1 mock-up vaccine.

The MF59 adjuvant has been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies for a range of different vaccines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since 1999, Fluad has been formulated using adjuvant containing citrate buffer to improve adjuvant stability, designated as MF59C.1. This formulation has been the one used for AFLUNOV.

## Manufacturing Process Development

The  first  production  of  the  Finished  Product  with  the  H5N3  strain  was  in  1999.  The  manufacturing process was the same of the seasonal influenza vaccine Fluad. Successively, the Finished Product was produced with the H9N2 strain in 2004 and with the H5N1 strain in 2005, with the same manufacturing process approved for Fluad in 2005.

From 2000, some changes in formulation and manufacturing process were introduced for Fluad and approved through the relevant MRP variations. However these differences, as already demonstrated for the variations submitted for Fluad, do not affect the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.

Thiomersal  was  previously  used  in  the  production  of  the  Active  Substance  (as  reagent  during  the process  and  as  preservative  at  the  final  stage)  and  of  the  Finished  Product  (as  preservative). Thiomersal was removed in two steps: in the first one it was removed from the active substance and finished product as preservative (remaining as traces); in the second one it was removed completely (in 2003).

Clinical  trials  performed  to  compare  Fluad  formulations  (with  and  without  preservative)  and  of  the stability studies confirmed that the presence of Thiomersal, as a preservative in Fluad, does not have any  impact  on  the  quality,  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the  product.  For  that  reason,  the  current licensed Fluad in pre-filled syringe is a thiomersal-free product.

Fluad with H5N3 strain was produced before 2003 with the preservative, while Fluad with H9N2 and H5N1 strains were produced in 2004 and 2005 without any preservative.

## Adventitious Agents

In addition to inactivation of influenza virus, the Ph.Eur. requires that the formaldehyde inactivation process be shown to be capable of inactivating avian leucosis viruses and mycoplasma. Studies have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the antigen production process to inactivate potential viral, bacterial and mycoplasma contamination in addition to influenza viruses.

CTAB, as detergent, could contribute to virus inactivation. Its capacity to inactivate mycoplasma has been validated.

Sucrose gradient centrifugation could contribute to virus removal as well as the centrifugation steps, which follow the Polysorbate 80/CTAB treatment.

With respect to the transmission of TSE, the only animal derived starting materials are eggs (used in production of the Drug Substance) and squalene (used in the MF59C. 1 adjuvant). There is no scientific evidence to suggest that eggs are likely to present any risk of contamination from TSE-agents. Copy of the  Declaration  of  compliance  with  the  annex  to  Directive  75/  318/  EEC,  as  amended  by  directive 1999/ 82/ EEC relating to TSE was submitted.

Regarding squalene, derived from shark liver, it does not present any risk of potential contamination from TSE agents as well.

With  regards  to  the  use  of  reverse  genetics  strains,  which  may  be  prepared  using  materials  from ruminant origin (foetal calf serum, bovine trypsin, Vero Cells), the TSE compliance was performed by NIBSC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture of the Product

## Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls

## Final Bulk Vaccine Process

The components are added to the Final Bulk container in a defined sequence. Dedicated sterile vessels are used for the preparation of the Final Bulk.

After the additions are completed, the bulk is stirred to allow adequate mixing. The pH of the Final Bulk is checked. Samples are taken for Final Bulk release control testing. The Final Bulk is then aliquoted by aseptic transfer into sterile containers. Each container is aseptically sampled and tested for sterility. The containers are stored at 2-8°C, until released for filling.

The adjuvant MF59C.1 is produced in Germany and transported to Italy, where it is filtered and used to formulate the Final Bulk. Bioburden is controlled before the sterilizing filtration, while sterility and other in-process parameters are monitored after filtration and before the addition into the Final Bulk mixing tank.

## Filling and packaging Process (Final lot syringes)

Filling  operations are carried out at the Rosia manufacturing site. Syringes are filled by a validated, aseptic  procedure  which  is  also  registered  for  Fluad.  The  packed  product  is  stored  at  2-8°C  until released.

## Product Specification

The  release  tests  are  the  same  approved  for  the  inter-pandemic  Fluad  vaccine  (except  for  the haemagglutinin  content  -  7.5  g/dose  vs.  15  g  for  each  strain/dose)  and  fulfil  the  Ph.  Eur. requirements for surface antigen influenza vaccine.

The specifications might differ from the Ph.Eur. monograph for the influenza vaccine (surface antigen inactivated) due to the presence of the MF59C.1 that could interfere with some analytical methods.

The specification for Haemagglutinin identity and content complies with Ph.Eur. for the Final Lot. This test  is  also  performed  in  the  Final  Bulk.  In  case  the  quantity  of  relevant  materials  to  carry  out  the assay is insufficient (a real possibility in a Pandemic emergency), this test will be performed only on the  Final  Bulk  and  will  not  be  repeated  in  the  final  lot.  The  specifications  for  squalene  content  and identity and for particle size distribution are specific to control the MF59C.1 adjuvant into the vaccine.

The Test for free formaldehyde is performed earlier in the process, on the Monovalent Pooled Harvest, rather than on the Final Bulk vaccine or the Final Lot, as required by Ph.Eur.  The MF59C.1 adjuvant in the Drug Product interferes with the performance of this test.

All the relevant analytical procedures have been validated or qualified for the drug product.

All  excipients used during production and in the formulation of Monovalent Pooled Harvest, MF59C.1 adjuvant and Final bulk Vaccine comply with Ph.Eur., except for squalene (in-house specifications).

## Batch analysis

Batch  analysis  results  of  three  H5N1  full  production  scale  lots  show  consistent  production  and  are consistent with results obtained for the seasonal Fluad vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability of the Product

The reported stability data, for three full-scale batches of AFLUNOV (Fluad H5N1) produced in 2005 and 2006 shows complete stability up to 36 months when the product is stored at the recommended temperature of 2°-8°C, protected from light. The key stability-indicating parameter is the potency as determined by the Haemagglutinin (HA) content assay.

Stability data of the Final Bulk of Fluad H5N1 demonstrates stability up to three months of storage at 2-8 °C in the bulk tank.

The  proposed  shelf  life  for  the  adjuvant  MF59C.1  of  3  years  when  stored  at  2-8  °C  is  sufficiently supported by data.

In general, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product have been presented in a satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The manufacturing processes for AFLUNOV and Fluad are the same and the formulation of AFLUNOV is the same as Fluad with the exception of lower antigen content.

Overall,  the  non-clinical  support  for  AFLUNOV  is  based  on  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies performed  with  Fluad®,  three  ferret  challenge  studies  with  AFLUNOV  and  the  reproductive  toxicity study with AFLUNOV in rabbits. Module 4 reported the same Non Clinical studies already assessed in the  previous  submission.  Only  new  data  for  the  pharmacological  section  (two  challenge  studies  in ferrets, see section 3.3.2) were reported in the current application.

The studies with MF59 adjuvant alone and MF59 adjuvant in combination with a wide variety of noninfluenza antigens also contribute to the overall non-clinical assessment. During the development of MF59 adjuvant and Fluad®, various formulations were tested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The  program  of  immunogenicity  and  challenge  studies  performed  with  AFLUNOV  is  reported  in  the Table 2.

Table 2: Non-clinical evaluation of AFLUNOV immunogenicity and efficacy

## Studies in mice

A  series  of  cross-protection/cross-reactivity  experiments  was  conducted  to  assess  the  immune response  and  protection  from  homologous  and  heterologous  viral  challenge  in  mice  following vaccination with AFLUNOV and non-adjuvanted H5N1 antigens.

In these experiments cross-protection was defined as the ability of a vaccine (e.g. a Clade 1 vaccine) to  protect  animals  from  challenge  with  a  heterologous  (e.g.  Clade  2)  viral  strain.  Instead,  crossreactivity was defined as the ability of a vaccine to induce antibodies in vivo that are able to recognize heterologous  virus  in in  vitro assays.  These  experiments  demonstrated  that  AFLUNOV  is  more immunogenic  than  non-adjuvanted  H5N1  antigens.  The  antibodies  induced  by  AFLUNOV  cross-react with at least one heterologous strain of H5N1 virus. Furthermore, AFLUNOV induced protection from homologous and heterologous viral challenge in mice. The vaccine was effective in preventing clinical signs  of  illness/death  and  viral  replication  in  brain,  lung  and  spleen  of  mice  challenged  with homologous or heterologous virus.

## Studies in Rabbits

Immunogenicity in rabbits was evaluated as part of the Study NoUBA0002: Intramuscular reproductive and developmental toxicity of Fluad H5N1 in rabbits, including a postnatal evaluation. The study design is summarized in the toxicology section.

Analysis of serum samples taken throughout the study confirmed the presence of antibodies using the hemagglutinin  inhibition  assay  (HAI).  The  results  of  this  study  are  important  to  confirm  AFLUNOV immunogenicity. The vaccine was immunogenic in maternal rabbits, developing foetuses and F1 pups. In particular HI titres were measurable beginning on day 15 of the study in all animals treated, and subsequently increased or remained sufficiently elevated to demonstrate continued immune response to the vaccine. Interestingly, anti-influenza antibodies at the time of C-sectioning were detected in all foetal  pooled  samples  at  levels  comparable  to  those  of  the  respective  maternal  samples.  The antibodies persist through the first 4 weeks of life in F1 offspring.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Studies in Ferrets

Three challenge studies in ferrets have been performed with AFLUNOV in order to study the protecting effectiveness of AFLUNOV in the most suitable animal model for human infection. These studies are briefly reported below.

Study No. CBI-PCS-008: A study to determine the efficacy of an H5N1 influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 in the ferret experimental challenge model.

Because of the need for priming infection with a heterologous strain in order to enhance responses in the  ferret  model,  as  previously  demonstrated  for  Focetria,  the  priming  was  included  in  this  study design.  From  the  results  it  can  be  concluded  that  AFLUNOV  containing  either  7.5 μ g  or  15 μ g  of A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) antigen was immunogenic and decreased viral titres in ferrets challenged with the homologous reverse genetics strain. The 15 μ g dose was slightly more immunogenic in ferrets but in humans the two doses appear equivalent (see clinical sections). Moreover, additional analyses were reported on the activity of neutralizing and hemagglutinin-specific antibodies against a heterologous virus strain (Influenza A NIBRG-23 (H5N1) reference virus, a reassortant prepared by reverse genetics from  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  (H5N1)  virus  and  A/PR/8/34).  The  vaccine  did  induce  antibodies  that were able to recognize (HI) and neutralize (MN) the heterologous virus NIBRG-23.

Although  this  study  has  been  well  performed,  some  doubts  on  the  interpretation  of  statistical  data were raised. Therefore in the second submission the Applicant provided two new challenge studies in ferret as follows.

## Study  No.  673-N106850:  Evaluation  of  the  protective  efficacy  of  Fluad  H5N1  vaccine  in  ferrets challenged with HPAI.

This  study  provided  additional  information  in  order  to  demonstrate  non-clinical  cross-protection  and cross-reactivity. In this study, ferrets were vaccinated with AFLUNOV prior to challenge with a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, A/Vietnam/1203/04.

## Study N°765-N106857: Evaluation of the protective and cross-protective efficacy of AFLUNOV Turkey and AFLUNOV Vietnam vaccines in ferrets challenged with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus

The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective and cross-protective efficacy of AFLUNOV vaccine  formulations  in  ferrets  given  a  lethal  challenge  of  highly  pathogenic  avian  influenza  (HPAI) strain A/Vietnam/1203/04. The vaccines used contained either hemagglutinin from clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (AFLUNOV Vietnam) or hemagglutinin from clade 2.2 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (AFLUNOV Turkey). The immune response was monitored using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralisation  (MN)  assays.  Survival,  body  weights  and  temperatures,  clinical  signs,  virus shedding,  and  clinical  pathology  were  the  parameters  used  to  assess  vaccine  efficacy  as  well  as haematological and clinical chemistry.

Overall  the  protective  efficacy  data  from  the  studies  673-N106850  and  765-N106857  were  more persuasive than the earliest ferret study and indicated the protective and cross-protective efficacy of AFLUNOV vaccine formulations in ferrets given a lethal challenge of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI).

## Studies with Fluad in mice

Since responses to influenza vaccine can be significantly impaired in the young and elderly, a series of studies were conducted to investigate the immune response in young (3 months) and old (18 months) mice  after  subcutaneous  or  intramuscular  administration  of  Agrippal®  vaccine  either  alone  or combined with MF59 (water formulation).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These  data  showed  evidence  of  immunogenicity  both  in  old  and  young  mice.  More  specifically,  the addition of MF59 to the vaccine formulation allowed a reduction of the amount of HA antigen needed to yield  antibody  titres  similar  to  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  and  resulted  in  complete  protection  of  mice against a lethal challenge.

## MF59 Adjuvant

MF59C.1 is an oil-in-water emulsion with a squalene internal oil phase and a citrate buffer external aqueous phase. The surfactants, sorbitan trioleate and polysorbate 80, serve to stabilize the emulsion. The components of MF59 adjuvant are described in the quality section of this assessment report.

MF59C.1  was  optimized  by  the  addition  of  citrate  buffer  to  provide  increased  stability.  Citrate  is  a common and a well-tolerated excipient and immunogenicity and toxicology studies have identified no notable  differences  between  the  two  formulations.  The  Applicant  studied  various  MF59-adjuvanted vaccines  in  various  animal  species,  including  hamsters,  guinea  pigs,  rabbits,  dogs,  goats,  and primates.

## Ratio of Antigen to Adjuvant

Based on observations in mice, the clinical development with MF59 at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) with antigen was  used  in  the  MF59-adjuvanted  subunit  inter-pandemic  influenza  vaccine  Fluad®.  Following  the clinical  experience  with  Fluad®,  the  formulation  for  a  'pre-pandemic'  or  'pandemic'  vaccine  was  not changed (pandemic-like strains H5N3 and H9N2). Clinical data with these vaccines, confirmed that the immunogenicity was significantly enhanced, as compared with a non-adjuvanted vaccine, using the 1:1 ratio of MF59:antigen.

## Mechanism of Action of MF59

One of the effects of MF59 is to generate a local immunostimulatory environment at the injection site, which activates local immune cells. This results in maturation of resident dendritic cells (DCs), further recruitment and activation of immune cells into the injection site, enhanced antigen uptake, enhanced maturation of DCs and enhanced migration of APCs to the local draining lymph nodes. Recently, the effects of MF59 on human immune cells were assessed directly in vitro and it was found that following immunization, MF59 enhances the immune response at a range of points, including the induction of chemokines to increase recruitment of immune cells to the injection site, enhanced antigen uptake by monocytes at the injection site, and enhanced differentiation of monocytes into DCs, which represent the gold-standard cell type for priming naïve T cells. A particularly important feature of MF59 may be that it facilitates DCs migration into draining lymph nodes where they can trigger the adaptive immune response  specific  to  the  vaccine.  Nevertheless,  further  studies  are  necessary  to  better  define  the mechanism of action of MF59.

So far there appears to be an impressive consistency between data obtained in vitro with human cells, and  the  in  vivo  data  from  mouse.  These  observations  suggest  that  MF59  induces  a  local  proinflammatory  environment  within  the  muscle,  which  promotes  the  induction  of  potent  immune responses  to  co-administered  vaccines.  Overall,  the  justification  for  the  use  of  MF59  as  adjuvant  is sufficiently supported, also in light of new studies reported in this submission.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Because of the nature of the product, in vivo secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not performed. This is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological  testing  of  vaccines  (CPMP/SWP/465/95)  and  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  potential  for  undesirable  pharmacological  activities  of  MF59  was  assessed  as  a  component  of repeated-dose toxicology studies in dogs (see below).

## Safety pharmacology programme

Standard  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  not  performed  with  AFLUNOV  in  accordance  with  the relevant guidelines, CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

## MF59C.1 adjuvant

On request of the CHMP within the Focetria procedure, the applicant further justified the approach not to  carry  out  dedicate  safety  pharmacology  study.  The  applicant's  approach  was  approved  to  be adequate and sufficient and it was included in the AFLUNOV file. This is in line with the WHO Guideline on Preclinical testing of Vaccines indicating that safety pharmacology should be considered in case of bacterial vaccines associated with specific toxins.

During the early development of MF59C.1 adjuvant, two repeat-dose studies in dogs were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of vaccine formulations containing antigens that are not related to this dossier. However,  both  studies  had  an  MF59C.1  group  and  a  saline/buffer  control  group,  and  included  the evaluation  of  cardiovascular  and  neurological  parameters.  This  information  provides  supportive secondary or safety pharmacological data for AFLUNOV, showing no pharmacological effects following administration of vaccine with MF59.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Because of the nature of the vaccine, the guideline for non-clinical testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95)  and  the  guideline  on  adjuvants  (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004)  state  that pharmacokinetic studies are not needed. This concept can be extended also to drug-drug pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction studies. Such non-clinical studies would not provide clinically-relevant information.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  or  classic  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  studies  with Fluad H5N1 or Fluad are not required according to CPMP/SWP/465/95 and EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004  because  they  are  considered  not  relevant  for  a  vaccine.  However, distribution  and  clearance studies on the MF59C.1 adjuvant constituent (squalene) were considered, since  it  may  play  an  active  role  in  metabolism  pathways  or  possess  other  pharmacological  actions. Squalene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is a constituent in dietary product (vegetable and fish oil). Clearance studies performed in rabbits injected intramuscularly with labelled squalene  ( 125 I)  demonstrated  that  it  is  rapidly  cleared  and  5%  remains  at  the  injection  site  for approximately  5  days  after  injection.  Overall,  considering  the  data  available  on  squalene,  the  low amount required and the route and frequency of administration in humans, the use of squalene should not constitute a risk factor in clinical use.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

A stand-alone toxicology program was conducted for MF59 adjuvant. These studies were performed with the various formulations of adjuvant alone and in combination with different antigens.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Toxicology  studies  were  performed  with  AFLUNOV  and  with  the  formulations  equivalent  to  Fluad (Agrippal  +  MF59).  The  toxicology  profile  for  AFLUNOV  could  also  be  extrapolated  from  the  studies conducted in mouse and ferret. The vaccine was well tolerated and effective in these species. These studies are described in pharmacological section of this AR.

## Single dose toxicity

No  formal  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  with  AFLUNOV.  However  single-dose studies were performed as Quality Control batch release tests suggesting absence of systemic toxicity both in rabbits and in mice, no pyrogenicity in rabbits and good local tolerability.

Other available information on single-dose toxicity and local tolerability of Agrippal administered with and  without  MF59W.1  (equivalent  to  MF59C.1  but  without  citrate  buffer)  are  those  obtained  in  the repeated-dose toxicity study (Experiment N° 940292) by considering the effects of the first dose only. The available information is considered adequate to show a lack of systemic toxicity and a moderate reaction at the injection site for Fluad (Agrippal + MF59) after single dose treatment.

## Repeat dose toxicity (Study 940292)

In a pivotal repeat-dose study three groups of rabbits received 0.5 ml of Agrippal® alone, MF59W.1 adjuvant alone (equivalent to MF59C.1 but without citrate buffer) or Agrippal® formulated together with MF59W.1 (equivalent to Fluad) by intramuscular route on day 1 and day 15 of the study. Each 0.5 ml  injection  contained  the  full  single  human  dose  of  trivalent  vaccine  (15  µg  HA  from  each  virus strain). In this study, conducted with a vaccine formulation comparable to Fluad®, no systemic toxicity was evident at a dose equal to six times the anticipated pandemic clinical dose.

The only adverse effects were limited transient local reactivity at the injection sites more evident after the  second  injection  with  adjuvanted  vaccine,  but  overall  it  was  well  tolerated.  The  results  showed absence of systemic adverse effects.

## Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity studies were not performed, according to the relevant guidelines, CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03 and WHO guidelines.

MF59  contains  a  natural  product  with  inherent  contaminants  (squalene).  Therefore,  MF59  adjuvant formulations (MF59 W.1 and MF 59C.1) were evaluated in a mutagenicity testing programme, using the  mouse  micronucleus  cytogenetic  assay  and  the  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay  (Ames  Test). These  studies  were  performed  under  GLP  and  showed  that  MF59  adjuvant  formulations  have  no genotoxicity potential.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  performed,  in  accordance  to  the  relevant  vaccines  guidelines, CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03 and WHO. The final product does not contain any known component or impurity at levels that would be expected to be of concern.

## Reproduction Toxicity

The pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study 940292 in rabbits with Fluad (Agrippal + MF59W.1) showed no test-article related toxic effects on sex organs (ovaries, testes and epididymis) after two intramuscular injections. Moreover the embryofoetal and developmental toxicity of MF59 was evaluated in rats and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rabbits. These pivotal studies were of adequate quality and performed under GLP. They indicated that MF59 is devoid of teratogenic or fetotoxic effect.

The reproductive toxicity of AFLUNOV was evaluated in a GLP study in rabbits (Study n. UBA00021: Intramuscular reproductive and developmental toxicity of Fluad H5N1 in rabbits, including a postnatal evaluation).  This  study  was  planned  according  to  the  EMA  guideline  on  pre-pandemic  influenza vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006). The object of this study was to assess the potential effects of AFLUNOV on reproductive and developmental toxicity in female rabbits and their foetuses or pups when  administered  by  intramuscular  injection  twice  the  clinical  dose  for  humans  of  7.5  ug,  before mating and during gestation. The study was well design to assess both objectives. AFLUNOV did not induce maternal/embryofoetal toxicity or teratogenic and post-natal development effects, resulting well tolerated. Additionally, the vaccine is immunogenic in maternal rabbits, in foetuses and in F1 pups for the first 4 weeks of life.

## Local Tolerance

No local tolerance studies with AFLUNOV are required according to CPMP/VEG/4717/03. An evaluation of  local  tolerability  was  reported  in  the  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  with  Fluad  (Agrippal  + MF59W.1) done in rabbits (Study N° 940292). This study demonstrated good local tolerability (a low order  of  local  reactivity)  for  all  formulations.  This  conclusion  is  further  supported  by  clinical  data  in humans.

## Other toxicity studies

In order to investigate the delayed contact hypersensitivity potential of Agrippal + MF59C.1 (Fluad) or MF59  alone,  two  GLP  studies  were  conducted  in  Guinea  pigs.  These  studies  showed  that  Fluad (Agrippal  +  MF59C.1),  MF59  and  MF59C.1,  apart  from  injection  site  reactions,  did  not  cause sensitisation in Guinea pig.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

AFLUNOV is an inactivated viral product and active substance is constituted by highly purified virus surface antigen proteins. The Drug Substance and the Drug Product do not contain nor consist of GMOs therefore there is no environmental risk for the product itself.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

In general, non clinical data were well organized to assess immunogenicity, systemic toxicity and local tolerability both in single and in repeated administration of various formulations of adjuvanted and non adjuvanted vaccines. Moreover, the Applicant provided three studies on protective activity using the ferret model with adequate disease markers. The earliest study is a GLP ferret challenge study with A/NIBRG-14(H5N1)  antigens adjuvanted with MF59  (AFLUNOV). This study showed that the formulation of vaccine containing either 7.5 µg or 15 µg of A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) antigen per dose is both  immunogenic  and  efficacious  in  reducing  the  viral  load  and  viral  shedding.  Two  most  recent studies  highlight  the  protective  and  cross-protective  efficacy  of  AFLUNOV  vaccine  formulations  in ferrets given a lethal challenge of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

No  data  were  produced  regarding  secondary  pharmacology  (safety  pharmacology)  with  respect  to potential effects on cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS systems. However there were sufficient clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tolerability  data  available  in  humans  with  Fluad  and  Agrippal  to  override  any  potential  concern. Moreover two repeat-dose studies in dogs were performed during the early development of MF59C.1 to evaluate its toxicity (with antigens unrelated to this dossier). These studies did not show secondary or safety pharmacological effects.

The toxicology program was designed based on EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006, CPMP/VEG/4717/03 and appropriate global regulatory requirements for the non-clinical testing of vaccines and adjuvants. The toxicology aspects of AFLUNOV were derived from the collection of non-clinical and clinical data generated on selected vaccine licensed formulations equivalent to AFLUNOV (Agrippal and Fluad) and a 'Reproductive  toxicity  study  in  rabbits'  performed  with  AFLUNOV.  This  study  demonstrated  vaccine' immunogenicity in maternal rabbits and developing foetuses; antibodies persisted through the first 4 weeks of life in F1. Moreover a stand-alone toxicology program was conducted for MF59 adjuvant.

All these studies fulfil regulatory requirements for the non-clinical testing of vaccines and adjuvants, as well as the guidelines on the development of pandemic vaccines derived from licensed manufacturing process. Finally, the release testing of AFLUNOV will assure the safety of individual clinical lots, and selected vaccine lots that are equivalent to those tested in toxicology studies.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on non-clinical aspects

Having considered that:

-  the process to manufacture antigens for AFLUNOV is the same process as used for Agrippal® and Fluad® vaccines and the MF59 adjuvant is identical to that used in Fluad®;
-  the release testing of AFLUNOV will assure the safety of individual clinical lots and selected vaccine lots that are equivalent to AFLUNOV were tested in toxicology studies;
-  AFLUNOV will contain lower doses of antigen than were tested in toxicology studies with seasonal vaccines, and the standard amount (0.25 mL) of MF59C.1;

it  could  be  concluded  that  the  submitted  data  on  various  antigens,  alone  or  in  combination  with MF59C.1, were sufficiently informative for the characterization of the pre-clinical toxicological profile of AFLUNOV. From the release  testing  program  for  AFLUNOV  finished  vaccine  batches  and  the  clinical experience with AFLUNOV, Fluad® and Agrippal®, the safety and tolerability profiles for AFLUNOV are predicted. Finally, considering that this submission is supported by the same Non-clinical documentation presented for Focetria®, that no major outstanding issues were raised for Non-clinical parts  of  the  first  AFLUNOV  submission  (Centralized  Procedure  N°  EMEA/H/C/804/0000)  and  that additional information included with the present application further supports the efficacy and safety of the proposed vaccine, no other preclinical studies were requested.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

Two  clinical  studies  (V7P37  and  V7P37E1)  have  been  conducted  with  H5N3  strain  to  investigate regimen, adjuvant and antigen amount. Based on the results of these studies, the subsequent studies have been conducted using Fluad formulated with H5N1 (see tabular overview below). Immunogenicity and safety data on the first and second (i.e., primary) AFLUNOV administrations have been analyzed and  were  presented  in  this  dossier  in  addition  to  evaluation  of  a  third  (booster)  vaccination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administered 6 months afterwards. The two H5N3 studies and all the H5N1 studies provide data for the 18-60 year olds. Two large AFLUNOV phase 2 and 3 studies (V87P1, V87P13) additionally provide data in adults above 60 years (see table 3).

## GCP

The studies presented were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, with approval from the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board.

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The first MAA for AFLUNOV was withdrawn by the Applicant in June 2008, based on the results of an EMA inspection that  showed  non-GCP  compliance  for  the  pivotal  study  V87P4.  The  negative  outcome  of  the  GCP inspection in 2008 triggered another GCP inspection of the new pivotal study (V87P13) that replaced V87P4. According to the Integrated Inspection Report on V87P13 (released on the 9 th  of August 2010), the  data  presented  in  the  clinical  study  report  were  accurately  described  and  hence  the  data  was deemed acceptable for evaluation.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  no  clinical  studies  conducted  outside  the European Union were included in this application (with reference to the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC).

Moreover, additional pediatric studies are planned in accordance with the PIP.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

According  to  the  EMEA  Note  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Evaluation  of  New  Vaccines,  pharmacokinetic studies  are  generally  not  required  for  injectable  vaccines,  and  kinetic  properties  of  vaccines  do  not provide information useful for establishing adequate dosing recommendations. The rationale for dose selection and dose schedule is discussed in sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 of this AR.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

Day 21 post vaccination was selected as the time point for assessing the immune response (IgG) by hemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  and  single  radial  hemolysis  (SRH)  assays,  as  routine  for  influenza vaccines. Twenty one days post vaccination is also the established time point to assess the immune response by antibody microneutralisation (MN).

For the criteria used for assessing immune response and more details on the assays mentioned above see Methods in section 3.5.3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

A total  of  six  studies  have  been  conducted  using Fluad  formulated  with  H5N1  (AFLUNOV)  and  were assessed in the present application. Moreover two other clinical studies (V7P37 and V7P37E1) have been conducted with H5N3 strain (Fluad H5N3) to investigate regimen, adjuvant, and antigen amount.

## 2.5.1. Dose response studies with H5N3 strain (Fluad H5N3)

## Study V7P37

Study  V7P37  was  an  observer  blind,  randomised,  comparative  dose  ranging  study  to  evaluate safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine containing the mock-up strain H5N3 as compared to a non-adjuvanted split influenza vaccine containing H5N3.

Fifty-five  healthy  adults,  between  18-40  years  old  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  Subjects  were randomised to receive adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine (7.5 μ g, 15 μ g or 30 μ g HA per dose) or the same dose  of  a  non-adjuvanted  comparator  vaccine  according  to  a  2-dose  schedule  (day  0,  day  21). Immunogenicity was assessed by microneutralisation assay (MN), haemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), and single radial haemolysis (SRH). Blood samples were drawn at day 0, 21, and 42. Antibody cross-reactivity was assessed against heterovariant H5N1 influenza strains.

Results:  Before  immunization  all  participants  had  serum  HI  titres  of  less  than  1:10.  As  previously shown also for other H5N1 vaccines, HI assays read-outs are prone to extreme variances caused by a number  of  factors  which  are  difficult  to  standardize  and  to  control  (especially  as  regards  choice  of erythrocytes). It  is  therefore  accepted  to  only  consider  SRH  results  in  combination  with  MN  results. Overall,  higher  seroprotection  and  seroconversion  rates  as  well  as  geometric  mean  titers  (GMTs) clearly correlate with the use of MF59 adjuvant and were not dose-related. Interestingly, the lowest antigen dose (7.5 µg, HA antigen, adjuvanted) was more immunogenic compared to the higher antigen doses (15 µg and 30 µg). With the candidate vaccine (adjuvanted) seroconversion rates between 1860% were achieved.

## Study V7P37E1

In  the  extension  study  V7P37E1,  28  subjects  who  completed  study  V7P37  were  revaccinated approximately  17  months  after  primary  vaccination  in  order  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  an additional  vaccine  dose  as  previously  formulated,  with  and  without  MF59C.1  adjuvant.  Of  the  28 subjects,  26  were  included  in  the  immunogenicity  analyses;  15  of  these  individuals  were  previously vaccinated  with  the  adjuvanted  formulations,  while  the  remaining  11  had  received  the  comparator vaccine. Immunogenicity was assessed by MN, HI and SRH. Serum samples were collected before and 3 weeks after revaccination.

Results:  At  baseline  none  of  the  subjects  had  detectable  antibodies  as  tested  by  HI  and/or  MN.  By SRH, subjects immunised with any dose of adjuvanted candidate vaccine still had detectable antibodies against both A/H5N3 and A/H5N1. Non-adjuvanted vaccine recipients had detectable antibodies only in the group immunised with the 15 μ g dose, and against A/H5N3 only. At re-vaccination with adjuvanted candidate  vaccine  H5N3,  GMTs  increased  significantly  when  compared  to  non-adjuvanted  vaccine. MF59C.1-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine induced antibodies that cross-protected against not only the H5N1 strains  from  1997-1998,  but  also  against  the  more  recent  and  virulent  strains  isolated  in  2003  and 2004  in  Vietnam  and  Hong  Kong,  which  exhibit  some  antigenic  drift  as  compared  to  the  original strains.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, this study was powered to test the non-inferiority of the 7.5 μ g compared with the 15 μ g dose. By all serological assays, the same or more CHMP criteria were met by the 7.5 μ g than the 15 μ g dose after the first and second vaccination, both for non-elderly adults and elderly subjects. These two doses  were  therefore  selected  for  the  pivotal  study  V87P1.  Results  from  booster  study  V7P37E1 confirmed  superiority  of  adjuvanted  versus  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  formulation.  The  effect  of  the booster immunization was only observable in groups given the various adjuvanted vaccine formulations, suggesting that non-adjuvanted vaccine was insufficiently or not at all able to prime. Like in  the  primary  vaccination  study  V7P37,  no  dose  dependency  was  seen  in  this  booster  study  (the lowest antigen dose was the most effective).

## 2.5.2. Dose and Formulation Selection Studies with H5N1 strain (AFLUNOV)

Based on Fluad-H5N3 results, 7.5 μ g and 15 μ g doses were investigated in the initial studies with the H5N1 vaccine strain.

Source: Table 14.1.1.2; According to protocol, some subjects did not take part in the booster part of the study, but are considered completers.

A large phase II study, conducted in 2006/2007, evaluated the immune response to a pre-pandemic Fluad formulation with H5N1. A total of 486 healthy subjects were stratified into non-elderly adult (1860 years) and elderly (&gt;60 years) age groups as recommended in EMA guidelines. Two vaccinations of either 7.5 μ g or 15 μ g both adjuvanted were given 3 weeks apart. The sample size was chosen to test for  non-inferiority  of  2  x  7.5 μ g  vaccinations  to  2  x  15 μ g  vaccinations  with  regard  to  the  immune response. A booster vaccination was given at day 202 (i.e., 6 months after the first vaccination) in approximately half of the subjects enrolled in each of the 7.5 μ g and 15 μ g groups and subjects were followed up for a further 6 months.

The  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  HI  GMT  ratio  of  7.5 μ g  over  15 μ g  group  for  the  total  population (adults below and above 60 years) was &gt;0.5; all point estimates for the percentages of seroprotected and  seroconverted  subjects,  in  addition  to  the  GMRs,  by  both  HI  and  SRH,  were  higher  after  two vaccinations of the 7.5 μ g compared with two vaccinations of the 15 μ g formulations in adults below 60 years.  In  adults  above  60  years  the  immune  responses  showed  greater  similarity  between  both formulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results for the smaller sample size study in adults below 60 years ( V87P2 , see table 3) confirmed that point estimates by all three serological assays were higher for the 7.5 μ g than for the 15 μ g AFLUNOV group. Additionally, consistently with the results of the Fluad-H5N3 studies, immunogenicity results of the non-adjuvanted 15 μ g H5N1 vaccine used in this study confirmed the need of including the MF59 adjuvant in the vaccine formulation.

In  conclusion,  an  analysis  across  studies  supported  the  decision  to  choose  the  lowest  antigen  dose (7.5µg  HA)  for  further  investigation  and  licensure  of  the  candidate  vaccine,  due  to  the  fact  that  all CHMP  requirements  were  met  in  the  three  dose  finding  studies  V7P3,  V87P1  and  V87P2  and  no advantage was detectable for the 15 µg HA neither for the 30 µg HA formulation.

## 2.5.3. Main studies

## Study V87P13

A  large  phase  III  study  has  being  conducted  on  3372  and  275  adults  below  and  above  60  years, respectively. Subjects received (randomization 4:1) either two vaccinations 3 weeks apart i) of 7.5 μ g AFLUNOV  3  weeks  after  a  seasonal  unadjuvanted  trivalent  influenza  vaccine  (Agrippal)  or  ii)  of seasonal vaccine Fluad 3 weeks after a placebo injection. This study is pivotal for the assessment of AFLUNOV safety. An immunogenicity subset was also included in the study. The sample size of the immunogenicity  subset  was  considered  sufficient  to  provide  adequate  estimates  for  the  endpoints specified in the CHMP criteria, and was not based on any statistical hypothesis. The study comprises a 6-month safety follow-up that was still ongoing when the original dossier was submitted. Final results of the 6-month safety study were submitted by D121 as addendum to CSRV87P13.

## Study V87P12

An additional phase III study investigated immunogenicity and safety of two vaccinations with 7.5 μ g Fluad-H5N1 of the same lot used in V87P13, administered 1, 2, 3 or 6 weeks apart to non-elderly adult subjects (ages 18 to 60 years). A total of 240 subjects were randomized at a 1:1:1:1 ratio.

## Study V101P1

The phase II study V101P1 investigated concomitant administration of a conventional seasonal vaccine or a pre-formulated tetravalent (3 seasonal strains + H5N1 strain) adjuvanted vaccine together with the pre-pandemic vaccine to assess the potential impact on the immune responses to either H5N1 or influenza  seasonal  strains  (A/H1N1,  A/H3N2,  and  B).  Study  V101P1  is  further  described  in  the supportive studies section.

## Methods

## Laboratory methods

As  previously  established,  immune  responses  can  be  measured  3  weeks  after  administration  of  H5 vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96; Nicholson et al., 2001; Stephenson et al., 2003; Bresson et al., 2006). Hemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  and  single  radial  haemolysis  (SRH)  assays  were  used  to  measure immune  responses based on the interpandemic experience with seasonal influenza vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96).  Given  the  limitations  of  the  HI  assay  to  measure  the  immunogenicity  of  H5 strains, a modified HI using horse instead of bird erythrocytes (Stephenson et al., 2004a) was used. Moreover in all studies presented in this application three serological assays (HI, SRH, and MN) were used in parallel to assess antibody responses to H5N1 viral antigens. The SRH assay, based on the method of Schild et al.1975 as recommended by CPMP/BWP/214/96, appeared to work equally well for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seasonal and H5N1 pandemic influenza strains. MN was performed according to previously established methods described by Nicholson (Nicholson et al., 2001).

In the absence of specific correlates of protection for pandemic influenza vaccines, as suggested by the pre-pandemic guideline (CHMP/VWP/263499/2006) all three CHMP criteria as assessed by HI and/or SRH assays should be met to satisfy the licensure requirements for a pre-pandemic vaccine.

In the absence of corresponding correlate of protection for MN against influenza A/H5N1 viruses, and based  on  available  reports  (Bresson  et  al.,  2006;  Lin  et  al.,  2006;  Treanor  et  al.,  2006), ≥ 4-fold increase  from  baseline  in  neutralizing  antibody  was  considered  appropriate  measure  of  immune response to H5N1.

## Interlaboratory Consistency

For  all  H5N1  studies,  except  V87P3,  HI  and  MN  assays  were  performed  at  the  Novartis  Clinical Serology Laboratory, Marburg, Germany, and SRH at the University of Siena, Italy. In study V87P3 the HI  and  MN  assays  were  performed  at  the  HPA  Laboratories,  Colindale,  London,  UK.  Correlation  and concordance  analyses,  based  on  subsets  of  sera  samples  from  study  V87P1  tested  at  HPA,  showed agreement for both HI and MN assay results produced by Novartis and HPA laboratories. Additionally, the  correlation  between  the  SRH  assays  performed  at  the  University  of  Siena  and  the  HI  and  MN assays performed by the other two laboratories was also high. Overall, based on the high correlation between  inter-  and  intra-laboratory  HI,  MN  and  SRH  assays,  all  serology  assays  appeared  to  be measuring  the  same  immune  response  with  an  acceptable  degree  of  consistency.  This  degree  of consistency  was  not  observed  in  study  V87P13,  where  the  HI  data  did  not  match  the  SRH  results, however this could be linked to the different study design.

## Inclusion/exclusion criteria

The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  all  studies  with  AFLUNOV  V87P1,  V87P2,  V87P3,  V87P12, V87P13 and V101P1 were in general identical. Subjects were not to be enrolled into the study if:

1. They  had  any  serious  disease  such  as:  cancer,  autoimmune  disease,  advanced  arteriosclerotic disease  or complicated  diabetes  mellitus,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  acute  or progressive hepatic disease, acute or progressive renal disease, congestive heart failure.
2. They  were  hypersensitive  to  eggs,  chicken  protein,  chicken  feathers,  influenza  viral  protein, neomycin or polymyxin, or any other component of the vaccine.
3. They had a history of neurological symptoms  or  signs, or anaphylactic shock following administration of any vaccine.
4. They had a known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function resulting, for example, from: immunosuppressive therapy, immunostimulants, HIV infection or HIV-related disease, etc.
5. Women who were pregnant, or women able to bear children but not willing to practice acceptable contraception for the duration of the trial.
6. Within the past 4 weeks they had received: another vaccine, any investigational agent.
7. Within the past 3-7 days, they had experienced: any acute disease, infections requiring systemic antibiotic or antiviral therapy, fever.
8. They were taking part in another clinical study, had surgery planned during the study or had other conditions which might interfere with the study.

## Study Participants

All  study  participants  were  aged  18  years  and  older  (see  Table  3).  Within  each  study,  demographic characteristics  were  stratified  by  age  to  include  both  adults  below  and  above  60  years  and  were generally balanced among groups within each age. Overall a high number of study participants were included  in  all  studies  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  the  prepandemic  vaccine.  With regard to demography and other baseline characteristics for both non-elderly (18-60 years) and elderly (&gt;60 years) adults of the enrolled population, the study criteria were fulfilled completely. However the number of elderly &gt;70 years of age is limited to only 69 individuals.

## Treatments

Refer to the Quality section for the composition of AFLUNOV (previously named Fluad-H5N1) influenza vaccine  containing  7.5  µg  A/Vietnam/1194/2004-like  (H5N1  Clade  1)  HA  antigen.  The  formulations prepared with 15ug or more of the same HA contained identical amounts of excipients and adjuvants.

Treatments are described in table 4. In Study V87P12 AFLUNOV was administered 1, 2, 3, or 6 weeks apart; in study V87P13 treatments were as follows:

| Study Day       | Adults                     | Adults               | Elderly                    | Elderly              |

AdjPanH5N1: Adjuvanted pandemic H5N1 (Fluad-H5N1); AdjSeasonal: Adjuvanted seasonal (Fluad) ; NonAdj Seasonal:NonAdjuvantedseasonal (Agrippal)

-  Investigational Vaccine

AdjPanH5N1: AFLUNOV (see above for composition)

-  Reference Vaccines

AdjSeasonal:  A  0.5mL  dose  of  AdjSeasonal,  trivalent  inactivated  MF59-adjuvanted  subunit  influenza vaccine,  contained  the  purified  viral  envelope-glycoproteins  neuraminidase  (NA)  and  hemagglutinin (HA), including 15 μ g of HA of the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B antigens recommended for the influenza season 2008/2009 in the Northern Hemisphere.

NonAdjSeasonal:  A  0.5mL  dose  of  NonAdjSeasonal,  non-adjuvanted  trivalent  inactivated  subunit influenza vaccine, contained the purified viral envelope-glycoproteins NA and HA, including 15 μ g of HA of  the  A/H1N1,  A/H3N2  and  B  antigens  recommended  for  the  influenza  season  2008/2009  in  the Northern Hemisphere.

## Objectives

All  studies  conducted  with  H5N1  influenza  strain  requested  different  objectives  to  describe  the immunogenicity and cross-reactivity as well as CMI of the candidate vaccine as described in table 3. Specifically:

Study V87P12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To evaluate the magnitude of antibody responses to two doses of MF59-adjuvanted egg-derived pandemic  monovalent  A/H5N1(MF59-PanH5N1)  influenza  vaccine,  each  containing  7.5 μ g of A/H5N1 antigen administered 1, 2, 3, or 6 weeks apart.

## Study V87P13

-  To evaluate the immunogenicity of two doses of adjuvanted pandemic H5N1 (AdjPanH5N1), each containing 7.5 µg of H5N1 antigen, versus the homologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain.
-  To evaluate the immunogenicity of two doses of adjuvanted pandemic H5N1 (AdjPanH5N1), each containing 7.5 µg of H5N1 antigen, versus the heterologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain.

## Outcomes and endpoints

The primary measures of immunogenicity were GMT (as determined by HI assay and MN assay), GMA (by SRH assay), GMR, Percentages of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Titer and SRH Area, Percentages of Subjects Achieving the thresholds of HI ≥ 40, SRH area ≥ 25 mm2, MN ≥ 20, MN ≥ 40, MN ≥ 80, four-fold rise in MN titers. HI, SRH and MN data provide a surrogate marker for efficacy in this application, although, as for all pandemic influenza vaccines, no direct correlation has been demonstrated between the immune response and clinical efficacy. For further information on the assays see section 3.5.3 Main Studies/Laboratory methods.

## Study V87P12

Immunogenicity was evaluated antibody titres by HI, SRH and MN assays on blood samples taken from all subjects:

-  before first vaccination (day 1)
-  on the day before the second vaccination on day 7, 15, 22 or 43
-  three weeks after the second vaccination.

## Study V87P13

The measures of immunogenicity versus both homologous and heterologous A/H5N1strains, collected for all evaluable subjects in study V87P13 included:

-  Geometric mean titers/area (GMTs/GMAs) on days 22, 43 and 64, as determined by HI, SRH, and MN.
-  Day 43/ day 22 and day 64/day 22 geometric mean ratios (GMRs).
-  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in antibody titer on days 43 and 64, as measured by HI and SRH.
-  Percentage of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥ 40/ SRH area ≥ 25mm² on days 22, 43 and 64.
-  Percentage of subjects with MN titers ≥ 20, ≥ 40, ≥ 80 on days 22, 43 and 64.
-  Percentage of subjects achieving at least a four-fold rise in MN antibody titer on days 43 and 64 compared to day 22.

## Sample size

## Study V87P12

The sample size in study V87P12 was chosen in order to comply with the CHMP requirements outlined in  document  CPMP/BWP/214/96  (50  subjects  for  immunogenicity  per  group).  240  subjects  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enrolled  in  four  groups.  All  enrolled  subjects  were  included  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  for immunogenicity and in the Safety set.

## Study V87P13

Sample size in study V87P13 was chosen in order to achieve an overall safety database that allowed for detecting adverse events with an underlying incidence of 0.1% in adults or 1% in elderly subjects with a probability of 95%. Subjects were enrolled into two age stratifications: 3372 adults (18 to 60 years) and  275  elderly (&gt;60  Years). Total 3371  subjects were  vaccinated  according to the randomization list. For the immunogenicity analyses, 258 subjects were enrolled in adults age group (18  to  60  years)  and  272  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  elderly  age  group  (&gt;60  years).  Total  95% adults  and  93-95%  elderly  subjects  were  included  in  Full  Analysis  Sets  (FAS)  at  second,  third  and fourth visit.

## Randomisation

When applicable, randomisation was stratified according age group (18-60, &gt;60 years). Within each stratum, the randomisation ratio was 4:1 (Fluad-H5N1: control) in study V87P13 and 1:1:1:1 into each of the 4 vaccine schedule groups in study V87P12.

## Blinding

Study V87P13 was performed as observer blind study, while study V87P12 was performed as an open label study (comparing different vaccine schedules).

## Statistical methods

Only descriptive analyses were performed. Safety data were summarised by providing frequencies and percentages  of  subjects  experiencing  each  adverse  reaction.  The  CHMP  considered  this  approach appropriate.

## Recruitment

This was a multicentre study (Germany, Finland) conducted in 2008/09.

## Conduct of the study

Immunogenicity was evaluated by HI assay, and additionally by MN and SRH, before and after each AdjPanH5N1 or AdjSeasonal vaccines injection at day 22, day 43 and day 64.

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characters of the subjects enrolled into each of the vaccine groups were balanced  in  both  the  age  groups  of  the  safety  set  and  immunogenicity  set.  Most  of  the  subjects enrolled  were  of  Caucasian  origin  in  both  the  vaccine  groups  and  age  groups  and  almost  all  the subjects met the entry criteria. The CHMP considered that demography and baseline characteristics of the 504 subjects of the immunogenicity subset were balanced across different vaccination groups and within both the non-elderly adult and elderly age stratifications.

In studies conducted with H5N1 only a few subjects were seropositive by MN at baseline (MN titres&gt;40 2%  adults,  1%  elderly  in  V87P13).  In  elderly  subjects  in  study  V87P1,  a  range  of  11%  to  24% (depending on dosage and assay) showed seroprotection to H5N1 at baseline, while for V87P13 this range was as described in the Outcomes and estimation paragraph. However it should be considered that baseline positive titres might reflect cross-reactivity due to previous exposure to the neuraminidase included in the H5N1 vaccine.

The Applicant submitted data taking as baseline serostatus values measured at day 22 only for the V87P13 study. Day 22 was indeed the visit at which subjects received the first H5N1 vaccine; hence by definition this was the H5N1 baseline.  Day 1 value as baseline for the V87P13 trial is 3 weeks prior to the H5N1 vaccine. For all other trials the Applicant provided serostatus at Day 1 (before vaccination studied).

## Numbers analysed

The following figure shows the numbers analysed within the study V87P13. Upon assessment drop-out rate and randomization error were deemed very low within study V87P13.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Immunogenicity against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine strain:

When assessed by MN assay, 65% of non-elderly adults and 55% of elderly adults exhibited at least a 4-fold increase from baseline in MN titres after two doses of AFLUNOV compared to 0% (non-elderly) and 10% (elderly) in the placebo group.

|                                 | Adults            | Elderly                |

| Day 64       | 98 (50%) (43-57)  | 68 (33%) (26-40) N=208  |

When assessed by HI and in contrast to a previous study V87P1, results by baseline serostatus showed that only 2/3 of the CHMP criteria were met after the second vaccination (Day 64) in both adult and elderly  groups  (see  also  the  next  paragraph  on  analysis  across  trials).  When  assessed  by  SRH,  all criteria (3/3) were met in both age groups but a high proportion of seropositive subjects at baseline was  observed.  Therefore,  since  by  SRH  assay  the  level  of  baseline  seropositivity  was  high,  the Applicant was requested to provide the baseline serostatus data by SRH:

These results from SRH assay showed that all 3 CHMP criteria were met in subjects seronegative at baseline as well. It was noted that in study V87P13 all subjects in the AFLUNOV arm received first a dose of seasonal non-adjuvanted vaccine and then at day 22 received the first  AFLUNOV administration.  In  the  protocol,  a  blood  drawing  at  day  0  was  not  included;  therefore  it  was  not possible to ascertain whether the high proportion of seropositive subjects at baseline by SRH in this study  was  due  to  the  previous  seasonal  vaccination  or  to  pre-existing  immunity.  Similar  data  was obtained with MN assay by baseline serostatus, supporting the immunogenicity of Aflunov.

## Immunogenicity against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 Heterologous strain:

In the analysis of cross-reactivity potential of H5 specific antibodies following two doses of AFLUNOV (A/H5N1/Vietnam/1194/04, NIBRG-14; clade 1), some levels of immune response against heterologous  influenza  virus  variant  A/H5N1/turkey/Turkey/05  (NIBRG23)  clade  2.2  was  detectable, with  seroprotection  rates  ranging  at  day  64  from  23%  to  59%  in  adults  and  from  25%  to  48%  in elderly by HI and SRH respectively. Only 1/3 CHMP criterion was matched after two vaccinations both in adults and elderly (seconversion rates measured by SRH). At 3 weeks after second vaccination (day 64) 36% of adults and 25% of elderly achieved 4-fold increase in MN titres.

## Ancillary analyses

## Concomitant administration of AFLUNOV with seasonal influenza vaccine (Study V101P1)

This  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  three  different  immunization  schedules  on  the immune  response  to  the  H5N1  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  strain  (Clade  1)  and  specifically  aimed  to investigate the concomitant  administration of  AFLUNOV  with  seasonal  influenza vaccine. This randomized,  placebo-controlled,  observer-blind,  multi  centre,  phase  II  study  was  performed  over  a period  of  approximately  7  months  for  each  volunteer  at  two  sites  in  Germany  in  a  population  of subjects  18  years  of  age  and  above.  A  total  of  601  subjects  were  enrolled  and  randomized:  199 received a pre-formulated tetravalent influenza vaccine (3 seasonal influenza strains + Fluad-H5N1 + MF59- adjuvant) and concomitantly a placebo on day 1, then 3 weeks later a dose of Fluad- H5N1; 203 which received a dose of Fluad-H5N1 and concomitantly a placebo on day 1, then 3 weeks later a dose of  the  tetravalent  vaccine;  and  199  which  received  one  dose  of  Fluad-H5N1  and  concomitantly  one dose  of  a  seasonal  trivalent  vaccine  for  the  2007/08  influenza  season  (Agrippal)  on  day  1,  then  3 weeks later received a second dose of Fluad-H5N1.

The results from this study showed that immune response to the H5N1 strain was not affected when AFLUNOV  and  a  conventional  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  were  administered  concomitantly  (for  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

H5N1 strain all 3 CHMP criteria were met after two injections of AFLUNOV by both HI and SRH assays). Similarly, immune responses to the seasonal strains, as assessed by HI assay, were not affected (all 3 CHMP criteria  were  met  for  all  three  seasonal  strains  3  weeks  after  receiving  one  dose  of  seasonal vaccine). Taken together these results indicated that immune responses met CHMP requirements for both  pre-pandemic  and  seasonal  influenza  vaccines  when  the  two  vaccines  were  administered concomitantly.

V87P3: unprimed arm; V87P12: 3 week apart schedule arm; V87P13 previously vaccinated with Agrippal. SP = seroprotection; SC = seroconversion or significant increase; GMR = geometric mean ratio day 43/day 1 in V87P1, V87P2, and V87P3, and day 64/day 22 in V87P13.  Note: Bold values when the respective CHMP criterion for HI and SRH assays is met. Results for study V87P1 are for the PP population; for studies V87P2, V87P3, V87P12, and V87P13 are for the FAS (for PP and FAS definition)

After two 7.5 μ g vaccinations with AFLUNOV all three CHMP criteria were met by SRH in all studies and in both age groups. As measured by HI assay, CHMP criteria were met in all studies except for adults below 60 years in studies V87P3 and V87P13 and for adults over 60 years in study V87P13 (for whom the seroprotection criterion was not met). The percentage of subjects achieving MN titers ≥ 40 and 4fold  increase  of  titers  from  baseline  were  generally  high.  As  observed  for  HI  and  SRH  results,  MN responses in the 7.5 μ g and 15 μ g formulations were overall similar. For elderly subjects in V87P1 and V87P2 and for both groups in V87P13 the results are lower.

## Antibody Persistence and Immune Response to a Third (Booster) Vaccination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data on antibody persistence 6 months after primary vaccination for AFLUNOV are provided by studies V87P1,  V87P2,  and  V87P3,  and  for  further  6  months  after  a  3rd  dose  in  study  V87P1  and  V87P2. Across  studies,  for  both  adults  below  and  above  60  years,  at  6  months  (day  202)  after  primary vaccination  HI,  SRH,  and  MN  titers  reduced  from  1/2  to  1/5th  of  their  post  vaccination  level,  still remaining above baseline. Following booster vaccination (studies V87P1 and V87P2) by all three assays in  both  age  groups  titers  increased  to  similar  or  higher  values  than  after  primary  vaccination.  All  3 CHMP criteria were met by HI and SRH. At 6 months after the third vaccination, by all assays and in both  age  groups,  GMT  decreased  but  remained  at  least  at  the  same  level  as  6  months  after  the primary  vaccination  and  2-  to  6-  fold  higher  than  baseline.  As  seen  for  the  primary  vaccination, antibody persistence and booster dose responses for 7.5 μ g and 15 μ g formulations of AFLUNOV were generally similar.

Taken altogether these results showed that although antibody titres decreased over 6 months, they quickly  increased  to  high  levels  after  a  booster  shot,  suggesting  there  was  immunological  memory. Therefore two vaccinations with 7.5 µg AFLUNOV primed the population and induced immunological memory,  so  that  the  third  vaccination  with  the  same  vaccine  could  be  considered  a  homologous booster.

## Cross-reactivity against Heterovariant H5N1 Strains

Immune responses to the heterologous strain A/H5N1/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (NIBRG23; clade 2.2) were tested in four studies as described in table 5.

After two vaccinations with AFLUNOV some levels of immune response to the heterologous strain was detectable: at least one CHMP criterion was met by SRH assay whereas no criterion was fulfilled by HI and MN assays.

In  study  V87P1 the immune response to a heterologous strain following administration of a booster vaccination with the same pre-pandemic vaccine, i.e. a third vaccination with AFLUNOV 6 month after the two primary vaccinations, was assessed in 70 adults and 36 elderly. After the third vaccination, the immune  response  (GMT  and  seroprotection)  to  the  heterologous  strain  increased  by  all  assays: seroprotection rates were 70% by HI, 83% by SRH and 73% of subjects had an MN titer ≥ 1:40.

In study V87P3, in addition to the naïve subjects (unprimed arm), subjects who were primed 6-8 years previously  with  two  vaccinations  either  with  MF59-adjuvanted  or  non-adjuvanted  H5N3  vaccines received  two  vaccinations  of  7.5µg  AFLUNOV.  Data  at  3  weeks  after  the  first  AFLUNOV  vaccination showed that subjects previously primed with two doses of a different pandemic vaccine strain (H5N3) developed a very effective anamnestic immune response to a variant H5 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/04) used for vaccination 6-8 years later.

## Cell mediated immunity (CMI)

CMI was investigated in studies V87P2 and V87P3. One injection of AFLUNOV was sufficient to induce an increase in the frequency of H5-specific CD4 T-cells with a memory TH0/TH1 phenotype, with high survival potential in vivo and the ability to expand and differentiate into effector cells upon infection. Two  vaccinations  were  needed  to  expand  long  lasting  H5N1-specific  memory  B-cells  that  further expanded upon boosting either with a vaccine formulated with the same pandemic strain or with a novel pandemic antigen.

## Subjects with underling conditions associated with influenza complications.

None of the studies in the Fluad-H5N1 group development program were designed to evaluate specific high-risk groups. The Applicant was requested to perform an analysis of immunogenicity and safety results  across  studies  for  subjects  exposed  to  AFLUNOV  who  reported  in  their  medical  history  at enrolment medically relevant co-morbidities. This analysis was conducted on the pooled database for studies V87P1, V87P2, V87P3, V87P13, in order to achieve a bigger sample size. Individual at risk for influenza  complications  were  defined  as  those  who  reported,  in  the  medical  history,  the  following diseases:

-  Mild to moderate Congestive Heart Failure. (Class I-III)
-  Mild to moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Stage 1-2)
-  Mild to moderate Asthma (Step 1-3)
-  Hepatic disease (Grade A)
-  Renal insufficiency (Stage 1-3)
-  Neurological/neuromuscular, or metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Obesity

This analysis showed that, within each study and age group, CHMP criteria were less frequently met for the subset of subjects with co-morbidities than for the whole study population, which could be due to the small number of subjects with co-morbidities. Seroconversion rates and GMRs were mostly similar to the whole population, suggesting that the immune response to H5N1 in these subjects is similar to that elicited in healthy individuals.

## Immunogenicity and safety data in the elderly.

In  order  to  ascertain  the  availability  of  sufficient  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  the  elderly  target population  as  claimed  by  the  Applicant,  they  were  requested  to  perform  a  stratified  analysis  of immunogenicity and safety results from studies enrolling elderly. In the pivotal safety study V87P13, 205  and  53  elderly  aged  &gt;60  years  were  enrolled  in  the  AFLUNOV  and  in  the  comparator  groups respectively. All subjects enrolled were aged 61-65 years and no subject in either of the two groups was older than 70 years. In study V87P1 the number of subjects aged &gt;60 years is 159, 69 of which were aged &gt; 70 years. Despite the relatively small sample sizes, after two vaccinations with 7.5µg AFLUNOV,  all  three  CHMP  criteria  for  the  A/H5N1/Vietnam/1194/04  strain  were  met  in  elderly regardless  of  the  age  strata  by  both  HI  and  SRH  assays.  With  the  exception  of  the  seroprotection criterion for the &gt;80 years which was not met by either of the assays, likely due to the really small number of subjects (N=5), all criteria were met also with the 15µg formulation of the vaccine.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No studies were performed in special populations. The following study V87P6, conducted in children from 6 months to 17 years of age, was not part of the core dossier, as it does not fall under the scope of the requested indication (adults above 18 years of age).

## V87P6

This was a randomized, controlled, observer-blind study designed to evaluate immunogenicity, safety and tolerability  of  two  doses  of  AFLUNOV  compared  to  two  doses  of  trivalent,  interpandemic  MF59seasonal  vaccine,  each  administered  3  weeks  apart  in  children  from  6  months  to  17  years  of  age. Between  94  and  145  individuals  were  exposed  to  H5N1  per  cohort.  The  secondary  immunogenicity objectives were to evaluate i) cross-protection, ii) persistence of specific antibodies 12 months after primary vaccination and iii) magnitude of antibody response to a 12 months booster dose of AFLUNOV. Less than 1% overall showed seroprotection at baseline by HI assay. Baseline titres bordered the limit of detection also by SRH and MN assays. AFLUNOV containing 7.5 μ g of H5N1 antigen per injection was immunogenic and all CHMP criteria were met after two vaccinations for all age groups. Persistence of immune response as well as effect of a booster vaccination were equally efficient in all age categories investigated in the overall clinical study program.

## Supportive study

## Study V87P12: Vaccination schedule

The 3 weeks apart vaccination schedule selection for AFLUNOV was based on the earlier pre-pandemic vaccine studies with H5N3 vaccines and on previously published studies. In addition, this study was conducted to evaluate the immunes responses of two 7.5 μ g Fluad-H5N1 vaccinations administered at 1, 2, 3, or 6 weeks apart in adults below 60 years.

All 3 CHMP criteria as assessed by HI and SRH at 3 weeks after the second vaccination were met when the second vaccination was given 2 weeks or more after the first one.

## 2.5.4. Discussion on clinical efficacy

AFLUNOV is a H5N1 vaccine intended for use in a pre-pandemic situation to protect from infection by zoonotic H5N1 strains as well as by pandemic H5N1 influenza virus, should such a human strain ever evolve.  Overall,  the  data  presented  in  this  dossier  provided  evidence  that  two  vaccinations  with AFLUNOV 7.5ug HA are sufficiently immunogenic since all CHMP criteria were met by SRH and MN for both the adult (18 - 60) and the elderly (&gt; 60) population. Although there are no CHMP criteria for MN, percentages of subjects achieving MN titers &gt;40 or a 4-fold increase of titers were comparable or only slightly lower than the SRH rates for seroprotection and seroconversion, respectively. With regard to the HI assay, lack of consistency in results across pivotal clinical studies and suboptimal results from the largest study V87P13 were observed and discussed. The difference in the results across studies depending on the assay used was not unexpected as already seen with Focetria.  However, a definitive explanation for the variability in immunogenicity by HI across pivotal studies V87P1 and V87P13 could not be found.

In toddlers, children and adolescents aged 6 month to 17 years all CHMP criteria defined in guideline CPMP/BWP/214/96 were fulfilled, although these surrogate markers for protection were established for adults and the ranges for children are not validated yet. Surprisingly HI results in these age categories correspond much better to SRH data compared to the adult and elderly population. In section 4.2 a statement was introduced regarding the limited experience with H5N1 in children between 6 months and 17 years of age. The available information in children was reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Overall the data on cross protection after two vaccinations with AFLUNOV provided some evidence of a priming  effect  of  the  vaccination  and  were  supportive  of  the  induction  of  immune  response  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

heterologous  strains.  However  the  results  on  cross-protection  were  sub-optimal;  the  number  of subjects contributing in most studies was small; in most studies, the effect of the vaccination could not be completely interpreted due to lack of data on serostatus at baseline. Therefore a cautious approach was  considered  necessary  on  this  issue  and  a  statement  on  the  limited  cross-reactivity  induced  by AFLUNOV  has  been  included  in  sections  4.4  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  In  study  V87P1,  following administration of the booster dose, GMTs and the percentages of subjects with a seroprotective titer to a heterologous H5N1 strain highly increased, as measured by all three serological assays. Therefore, cross-reactivity was enhanced by priming. The Applicant was asked to submit the follow up of study V87P1  (V87P1E1)  as  a  follow-up  measure  (FUM  4)  and  these  data  were  provided  on  the  15  of September. Study V87P3 showed that a heterologous booster with AFLUNOV could induce adequate serological  and  cell  mediated  immune  responses  in  subjects  primed  against  the  H5N3  strain  6  to  8 years previously, suggesting that a strategy of pre-pandemic vaccination with an adjuvanted vaccine would allow boosting with a single dose of the actual pandemic strain, once this is known, even 6-8 years later. This booster ability of the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine shows its protective function as a prepandemic vaccine. Therefore, despite the low cross reactivity to the heterologus A/H5N1/turkey/Turkey/1/05 strain following two vaccinations with AFLUNOV, these two vaccinations could  act  like  a  prerequisite  for  induction  of  an  effective  immune  response  upon  vaccination  to  a different pandemic strain at a later time point. These results were reflected in section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

Cell-mediated immunity was investigated in studies V87P2 and V87P3 using vaccine formulations with and without MF59 adjuvant. Although results looked promising, since no CMI correlates for protection exist for influenza or any other vaccines, relevance of read-outs from CMI assays cannot reliably be interpreted. The evaluation of cell-mediated immunity was also among the primary objectives of study V101P1.  CMI  results  from  this  study  were  lacking  at  the  time  of  opinion,  therefore  the  Applicant committed to submit these data in fulfilment of a FUM by January 2011.

Concomitant administration of AFLUNOV with a conventional subunit seasonal influenza vaccine did not negatively impact the immune response to either the pandemic H5N1 strain or to the seasonal strains (study V101P1).

Supportive  study  V87P12  overall  demonstrated  that  the  time  point  for  giving  a  second  dose  of AFLUNOV is flexible at least within a window of 6 weeks following the first vaccination.

Due to the limited sample size, a clear conclusion on immunogenicity of AFLUNOV in the population most at risk for influenza  complication  could  not  be  drawn.  This  was  reflected  in  section  4.4  of  the SmPC. Additional studies to evaluate efficacy, safety an tolerability of AFLUNOV in patients with comorbidities and immunocompromised were requested to the Applicant as follow up measures (FUM 5 and 6).

With regards to the elderly population, overall immunogenicity and safety data were available for a total of 364 subjects &gt;60 years of age. This fulfilled the criteria for the size of the safety database of pre-pandemic vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006) but overall data on immunogenicity in elderly &gt;70  years  came  from  69  subjects.  Therefore,  although  extensive  experience  has  been  gathered  in elderly  with  seasonal  influenza  vaccines,  the  limited  availability  of  both  immunogenicity  and  safety data in the elderly above 70 years was reflected in section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 2.5.5. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

This application was based on a large number of clinical trials with a sufficient number of vaccinated subjects  to  demonstrate  acceptable  immunogenicity  of  AFLUNOV  after  two  doses  of  7.5  µg  H5  HA-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigen given 21 days apart. Evaluation of immune responses was performed according to standard test procedures as described in the relevant Note for Guidance on Harmonisation of Requirements for Influenza Vaccines applying HI, SRH and MN assays. All CHMP criteria for qualification of an acceptable influenza vaccine have been met using the SRH assay for both, the adult (18 - 60) and the elderly (&gt; 60) study population. Immunogenicity of influenza vaccine that is its ability to induce a satisfactory immunologic  response  is  considered  a  surrogate  for  clinical  efficacy  in  providing  protection  from infection. Studies on actual clinical protection from H5N1 are not possible due to the limited spread of the infection essentially limited to animal exposure.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The overall clinical safety data included:

1. safety  analyses  on  the  pooled  AFLUNOV  safety  database,  which  included  subjects  from  studies V87P1,  V87P2,  V87P3  (all  subjects  exposed  to  AFLUNOV  in  study  V87P3  were  included  in  the pooled  safety  analyses  regardless  of  the  priming  status)  and  V87P13.  Safety  data  for  studies V87P12  and  V101P1  were  presented  as  stand  alone  mainly  in  support  of  different  vaccination schedules  and  concomitant  administration  of  a  trivalent  subunit  seasonal  influenza  vaccine, respectively.
2. the analysis of the safety profile of the MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluad;
3. Fluad post-marketing surveillance data.

## Patient exposure

The  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  has  been  evaluated  in  six  clinical  trials  involving  approximately 4,000  adults  and  elderly  receiving  AFLUNOV  (at  least  7.5  µg  HA,  adjuvanted).  There  were  3678 subjects 18-60 years of age, 264 subjects 61-70 years of age, and 41 subjects greater than 70 years of  age.  The  pivotal  safety  study  V87P13  was  specifically  designed  to  make  a  direct  comparison between the safety profile of AFLUNOV and that of the MF59-adjuvanted seasonal vaccine Fluad and contributed most of the data for the pooled analysis. This phase III study was performed at multiple study sites, in a population of healthy subjects aged 18 to 60 years and over 60 years of age. The study sample size was calculated so that the overall safety database from the clinical trials would be sufficiently large to detect rare (at ≤ 0.1% frequency) adverse events (AEs) in adults below 60 years, and uncommon (at ≤ 1% frequency) AEs in adults above 60 years. For more details on study V87P13 see the clinical efficacy section of this AR.

The safety analysis for Fluad was based on a pooled clinical safety database of 14,586 subjects ≥ 18 years  of  age  (1383  aged  18-64  years,  12,913  aged  &gt;65  years,  and  290  subjects  with  underlying disease) from 42 historical clinical trials (plus an additional 8 extension studies). Fluad post-marketing surveillance  data  was  obtained  from  over  40  million  doses  distributed  since  the  initial  licensure  in September 1997 until April 30, 2008.

None of the studies in the AFLUNOV development program were designed to evaluate specific high-risk groups. The only study performed in children at the time of opinion was V87P6, discussed later on.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events (AEs)

The  assessment  of  safety  was  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  New  Vaccines  guidelines (CPMP/EWP/463/97, 1999). Overall, in the clinical trials conducted with AFLUNOV in adults aged ≥ 18, safety measures included:

-  Solicited AEs (i.e., local and systemic reactions) and selected indicators of reactogenicity (e.g., use of analgesic/antipyretic medication) on the day of vaccination and each of the following 6 days.
-  Unsolicited  AEs  (and  related  concomitant  medications),  as  defined  by  ICH  E2A,  collected  as predefined in the respective study protocols.

The results of adverse events were composed in the following way:

1. Solicited local and systemic AEs
2. Unsolicited AEs
3. Adverse Events after the Booster and 6 months follow-up
4. AEs after different vaccine schedules.

Pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported  local  reaction  across  all  study  vaccinations  (7,5µg  dose), followed by induration and erythema. A general tendency towards decreased reports of local reactions was observed with subsequent vaccinations. No consistent increase or decrease in local reactogenicity was observed when higher, 15µg antigen dose was administered. As expected, overall reactogenicity was higher for adjuvanted vaccine groups than for the Non-adjuvanted 15µg group.

Most frequently reported systemic AEs were myalgia, headache and fatigue. When comparing the two antigen  dose  groups,  no  consistent  increase  or  decrease  of  systemic  adverse  events  was  observed when  the  higher  (15µg)  dose  formulation  was  used.  Moreover  there  was  a  general  trend  towards

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreased reports of systemic reactions after the second and booster vaccination compared with the first. Most solicited systemic reactions were mild to moderate in severity, with exception of the booster dose in the 7.5 µg group (studies V87P1, V87P2): in the group of non-elderly (pooled data) after the third dose 5% suffered from severe Myalgia and 3% severe Arthralgia. Also in study V87P3 no severe local  reactions  have  been  seen,  except  for  a  few  cases  after  the  booster.  The  percentage  of  elderly reporting solicited systemic reactions was lower than those among non-elderly.

In comparison with the seasonal Fluad data, all systemic reactions, except for myalgia (witch occurred only by 14% of the seasonal Fluad recipients), were reported by similar percentages across groups.

## 2. Unsolicited AEs

Overall in study V87P13 after both vaccinations, similar percentages of AFLUNOV and seasonal Fluad recipients reported unsolicited AEs, both 'any' and possibly or probably related, as shown in table 8.

In Study V87P1 and V87P2, regardless of vaccine relatedness, the frequency of other unsolicited AEs within 3 weeks post vaccination was very low. During the 6 months follow-up period (i.e. onset more than 21 days after vaccination) AEs were only reported by subjects in the AFLUNOV 7.5ug group (2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  after  the  second  and  1  subject  after  the  booster  vaccination).  No  AE  was  judged  by  the investigator as probably or possibly related to vaccination. Reactogenicity after any vaccination was generally higher in the AFLUNOV groups than in the non-adjuvanted 15 group, as expected.

## 3. Adverse Events after the Booster and 6 months follow-up

AEs were collected 7 days after the booster vaccination, whilst unsolicited AEs were collected 3 weeks and SAEs up until 6 months after the booster dose. V7P37E1 study has assessed the effect of one dose. Most studies have tested only a two dose schedule: V87P12, V101P01 and V7P37. A third dose of AFLUNOV has been administered in studies V87P1, V87P2 and V87P5. The pooled analysis of data on safety of a booster dose of the current AFLUNOV formulation is limited to 87 adults and 38 elderly. Slightly  higher  numbers  can  be  considered  if  formulations  with  higher  antigen  content  (15  ug)  are included.  Based  on  available  data  no  clear  and  consistent  trend  for  an  increased  or  decreased reactogenicity was observed in subjects receiving a booster dose.

On D121 of the procedure, the Applicant has submitted the 6-months safety follow-up data from study V87P13 collected until the end of the study (day 224) in the Addendum to CSRV87P13.

## Subjects completion flowchart

(Appendix 16.2.2.1.3). FU=Follow Up

<!-- image -->

During the period from day 65 to day 224, only Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs) that  lead  to  a  physician's  visit,  AEs  that  lead  to  withdrawal  from  the  study,  and  concomitant medications associated with these events were collected. The analysis was provided both for adults and elderly. However, the investigated population does not properly represent the elderly, due to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

very  limited  cases  aged  over  65.  The  safety  profile  of  NonAdjSeasonal\\_AdjPanH5N1  group  was generally similar to that of Placebo\\_AdjSeasonal group for both adults and elderly.

## Adults

The percentages of AEs, SAEs, possibly or probably related AEs, AEs necessitating a physician's visit and  AEs  leading  to  hospitalization  were  similar  between  vaccinated  and  placebo  groups.  The  most commonly  reported  preferred  terms  were:  Nasopharyngitis,  Sinusitis,  and  Upper  Respiratory  Tract Infection.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  SAEs  was  1%  across  groups.  However  in  the NonAdjSeasonal\\_AdjPanH5N1 group gastrointestinal disorders were reported more frequently than in the placebo group and it was noted among SAE. Six cases of AEs were considered possibly related to the study vaccine in the NonAdjSeasonal\\_AdjPanH5N1 group and included also a case of vaccination failure,  laboratory  confirmed.  The  possibility  of  vaccination  failure  is  reported  in  section  5.1  of  the SmPC.

## Elderly

A  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  NonAdjSeasonal\\_AdjPanH5N1  group  (19%)  reported  at  least one AE when compared with Placebo\\_AdjSeasonal group (15%). The reported terms after visit four included: musculoskeletal pain, urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) resulted similar in frequency in both groups. They were the expected events corresponding to the age group and were judged not related to the study vaccine. The most commonly reported preferred terms were Sinusitis, Nasopharyngitis, Bronchitis, Back Pain, and Urinary Tract Infection.

A higher percentage of eye disorders (1%) was found in the NonAdjSeasonal\\_AdjPanH5N1 compared with the Placebo\\_AdjSeasonal group (0%). Among AEs necessitating a physician visit, 6% of Infections and Infestations and 3% of musculoskeketal events were found in the NonAdjSeasonal\\_AdjPanH5N1 vs 2% in the control group.

## 4. AEs after different vaccine schedules (study V87P12)

Overall a higher percentage of subjects reported local or systemic reactions after the first vaccination than after the second vaccination in all vaccine schedule groups. Pharyngitis was the most commonly reported  AE  in  the  safety  population,  reported  at  highest  frequency  (by  10%  subjects)  in  day1-22 group. None of the other spontaneously reported AEs were recorded at &gt;5% frequency in a vaccine schedule group. There were two reports (of erythema and pain) in one subject in day1-43 group and one report (Pruritus) in day1-15 group that were assessed to be possibly related to the vaccination.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

One death (a 77 year old man following an acute myocardial infarction) was reported in study V87P1 and it was considered unrelated to AFLUNOV. A total of four deaths, none assessed as vaccine-related, occurred  in  study  V87P4.  All  deaths  occurred  during  the  6-month  follow-up  period  after  second vaccination. No other deaths were reported in the 6 studies in adults ≥ 18 years.

## Sever AEs

In the six studies with AFLUNOV all SAEs were judged by the investigator as unrelated to the study vaccine except 2 cases of adults below 60 years and 3 SAEs in 2 adults above 60 years of age in the study V87P13. These 5 SAEs were assessed possibly or probably related to the vaccine: anaphylactic reaction, bronchial hyperreactivity and pneumonia, muscular weakness, leukocytoclastic vasculitis (all recovered, except the last two, which were still ongoing at the time of assessment).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory findings

No laboratory evaluations were assessed for the evaluation of safety in studies V87P1, V87P2, V87P3, V87P12 and V87P13.

Only in study V101P1 laboratory data regarding safety were evaluated. Blood was collected in a subset of  150  subjects  immediately  prior  to  vaccination  on  day  1  and  on  day  43  for  serum  chemistry  and haematology clinical laboratory testing. These included haemoglobin, red blood count (erythrocytes), MCV, MCHC, MCH, white blood count (leukocytes), platelet count, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), electrolytes and creatinine.

In the analysis of serum chemistry at baseline, a total of 10 subjects demonstrated lab values in the upper level of normal range. Elevated ALT was reported in 4 subjects; elevated AST was reported in 3 subjects; less that 4% of subjects demonstrated elevated levels in the rest of the parameters. A total of 23 subjects demonstrated lab values in the upper level of normal range in the analysis of the final blood draw. Elevated ALT was reported in 5 subjects; elevated sodium was reported by 9 subjects; less than 4% of subjects demonstrated elevated levels in the rest of the parameters.

In the analysis of haematology at baseline, a total of 7 subjects demonstrated lab values in the upper level of normal range. Less than 4% of subjects demonstrated such levels in any of the parameters assessed. A total of 5 subjects demonstrated lab values in the upper level of normal range at the final analysis. Less than 2% of subjects demonstrated such levels in any of the parameters assessed.

## Safety in special populations

Study V87P6 (children 6 months- 17 years of age)

Safety analyses were stratified by age; no other analyses of intrinsic factors were undertaken.

Solicited Local and Systemic reactions after first and second vaccinations (day 1-7 and day 22-28)

For  the  201 toddler subjects,  overall  reactogenicity  was  highest  after  the  first  vaccination  and decreased after the second vaccination. Most solicited reactions were mild or moderate, with no more than 2% of each solicited local or systemic reaction classified as severe in either vaccine group. Few of these reactions continued past the day 7 observation window and none continued at the end of the study. Erythema and tenderness were the most common solicited local reactions and irritability was the most common solicited systemic reaction in toddlers in both vaccine groups.

Of the 136 child subjects, 72% of AFLUNOV and 80% of MF59-Seasonal Fluad recipients reported at least  one  solicited  local  or  systemic  reaction  after  the  first  injection,  and  68%  and  56%  after  the second  injection.  Most  solicited  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate,  with  no  more  than  5%  of  each solicited  local  or  systemic  reactions  classified  as  severe  in  either  vaccine  group.  Pain  was  the  most common solicited  local  reaction;  no  more  than  5%  of  children  complained  of  severe  pain  after  any injection and headache was the most common systemic reaction in both vaccine groups.

For  the  134 adolescent subjects,  at  least  one  solicited  local  or  systemic  reaction  was  reported  for 91% of AFLUNOV and 88% of MF59-Seasonal Fluad recipients after the first injection, with a decrease to 82% and 78% respectively after the second injection. Most of the solicited reactions were mild or moderate, with no more than 5% of each solicited local or systemic reaction classified as severe in either  vaccine  group.  Pain  was  the  most  common  local  reaction.  No  more  than  5%  of  adolescents complained of severe pain, and headache was the most common solicited systemic reaction in both vaccine groups.

Solicited Local and Systemic reactions after booster vaccination (day 382-388)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the percentage of subjects reporting local reactions within 7 days of booster vaccination was higher than after both first and second dose, ranging across age cohorts from 60% to 81%. The most commonly reported reactions were tenderness for toddlers, pain at the injection site for children and adolescents followed by erythema. Within each age cohort most reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No severe local reactions were reported for children. Few local reactions continued past the 7days observation window and none continued at the end of the study.

Overall,  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  systemic  reactions  within  7  days  of  booster vaccination  ranged  across  age  cohorts  from  45%  to  69%.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic reaction was irritability and unusual crying for toddlers. There was an increase of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions after the booster vaccination compared with the primary administration.

## Unsolicited AEs 21 days following first and second vaccinations (day 1-43)

The  percentages  of  subjects  with  any  AEs  (other  than  solicited  local  and  systemic  reactions), regardless  of  their  assessment  of  relatedness,  were  similar  between  the  vaccine  groups  (AFLUNOV versus Seasonal).

## Unsolicited AEs (other than local and systemic reactions) 21 days following booster vaccination (days 382-403)

In  total  15  subjects  (8  toddlers,  3  children  and  4  adolescents)  were  reported  to  have  at  least  one possibly/  probably  related  AE  each.  All  possibly/probably  related  AEs  were  known  side  effects  of influenza  vaccination.  A  trend  towards  an  increased  local  and  systemic  reactogenicity  after  the administration  of  the  booster  dose  was  observed.  In  particular  in  the  toddlers,  severe  local  and systemic reactions after booster administration were much higher compared to the reactions observed after the first two administrations.

## Pregnant individuals

Although in all studies pregnancy was an exclusion criterion, a total of 13 pregnancies were reported after administration of AFLUNOV in studies V87P1, V87P12, V87P13 and V101P1.

Study V87P1: one pregnancy was reported; the woman delivered a healthy live-born baby.

Study V87P12: two pregnancies were reported; one woman received the two AFLUNOV vaccinations 3 weeks apart and one 6 weeks apart; both women delivered healthy live-born babies.

Study V87P13: seven pregnancies have been reported in the original application; however the study was  still  ongoing.  Overall  there  were  14  women  (two  in  the  Placebo/Fluad  group  and  12  in  the Agrippal/AFLUNOV group) who became pregnant during the entire study duration. Ten women (two in the Placebo/Fluad group and eight in the Agrippal/AFLUNOV group) delivered a live-born baby. One of these  babies  had  a  congenital  abnormality  (Agrippal/AFLUNOV  group),  another  baby  who  was  born without  abnormalities  (Agrippal/AFLUNOV  group)  however  was  diagnosed  with  a  congenital  cystic adenomatoid malformation by routine ultrasound at 20 gestational weeks which then disappeared at 32  gestational  weeks  and  the  baby  was  born  healthy.  Three  spontaneous  abortions  in  the  first trimester and one therapeutic abortion occurred, all in women from the AFLUNOV group.

Study V101P1: Three pregnancies were reported during the study. One live born delivery of a healthy baby (in a woman from AFLUNOV/Placebo + Tetravalent group), one spontaneous (in a woman from Tetravalent/Placebo + AFLUNOV group) and one therapeutic (in a woman from Tetravalent/Placebo + AFLUNOV group) abortion were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

## Concomitant Administration with Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (Study V101P1)

AFLUNOV was administered either before or after a tetravalent vaccine pre-formulated with H5N1 and the three seasonal influenza strains or concomitantly with a subunit seasonal influenza vaccine as first vaccination followed by a second AFLUNOV administration. Regardless of the timing of administration, reactogenicity of AFLUNOV was consistent with that observed for the other studies and for the pooled safety database. In particular, when AFLUNOV was administered concomitantly with Agrippal, overall reporting  of  solicited  reactions  did  not  increase.  As  expected,  solicited  local  reactions  were  more frequently reported for AFLUNOV than for Agrippal.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Overall  in  the  AFLUNOV  studies,  premature  withdrawals  due  to  AEs  were  infrequent:  within  the  21 days following primary course vaccination, less than 1% of the subjects across the two age groups withdrew  prematurely  due  to  an  AE.  No  subject  withdrew  during  the  21-day  period  following  the booster  dose.  During  the  6-month  follow-up  period  after  second/third  vaccination,  only  one  elderly subject (2%) of the total 66 withdrew due to an AE after the booster dose.

## Post marketing experience

No post marketing experience is available for AFLUNOV.

Seasonal  Fluad  (surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted  with  MF59)  has  been  marketed  since authorisation in 1997 and more than 27 million doses have been distributed. In clinical trials in total 14,028 subjects were administered one vaccination, 596 subjects received two vaccinations and 150 subjects  three  vaccinations.  Analysis  of  post-marketing  data  collected  demonstrated  a  good  safety profile.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

According to the Guideline on Influenza vaccines prepared from a virus with the potential to cause a pandemic  and  intended  for  use  outside  of  the  core  dossier  context  (CHMP/VWP/263499/2006),  a database of approximately 3000 adult subjects should be sufficient to evaluate the safety profile. All together in the submitted studies actually 3678 adult and 305 elderly subjects were exposed to 7.5 µg AFLUNOV. The mean age of non-elderly AFLUNOV recipients included in studies V87P1, V87P2, V87P3 and V87P13 was 40.9 years. Additionally 255 subjects received a higher dose of 15µg Fluad-H5N1. Such a sample size is sufficient  to  detect  rare  adverse  events  in  adult  (at ≤ 0.1  %  frequency)  and elderly (at ≤ 1%) and is in line with the above mentioned guideline.

However, most of the enrolled elderly population of the pivotal safety study V87P13 was in the age stratum 60-65 years, and only few subjects aged &gt;70 years were included in the study. The exclusion of subjects with co-morbidities and the relative young age of the elderly population make the results of the study not directly applicable to the clinical setting of people over 70; moreover elderly with comorbidities will likely be among those to whom the vaccine will be prescribed. The Applicant submitted a pooled analysis of safety and efficacy data from studies V87P1, V87P2, V87P3 and V87P13 focused on  subjects  whose  medical  history  at  enrolment  reported  diseases  associated  with  increased  risk  of complications  from  seasonal  influenza.  Results  from  this  analysis  showed  that  AFLUNOV  profile  of solicited  and  unsolicited  AE  in  the  subset  of  patients  with  co-morbidities  was  overall  similar  to  that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in the pooled safety database of the AFLUNOV dossier. These data are hampered by the fact that  i)  these  patients  are  not  representative  of  chronically  ill  patients  with  potentially  severe  comorbidities  (all  patients  were  judged  healthy  by  the  investigators  at  the  time  of  enrolment)  ii)  the number of subjects included in the analysis is small: a total of 280 adults and 109 elderly (&gt;60 years) exposed to one of the two 7.5 µg or 15 µg AFLUNOV formulations. Considering the lack of clinical data in  patients  with  co-morbidities,  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  perform  i)  a  study  to  evaluate  the efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  AFLUNOV  in  patients  with  co-morbidities;  ii)  a  study  to  evaluate efficacy and safety of AFLUNOV in immunocompromised patients (FUMs 4 and 5).

The  results  of  the  different  studies  have  shown  that  two  doses  of  AFLUNOV,  each  dose  containing 7.5µg of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 antigen, were safe and well tolerated, both in adult and elderly. No consistent increase or decrease in local reactogenicity was observed when higher, 15µg antigen dose was administered. No possibly/probably related death was reported.  Injection site pain was the most frequently  reported  local  reaction,  while  myalgia  and  headache  were  the  most  frequently  reported systemic  reactions.  Reactogenicity  was  generally  higher  for  the  adults  than  the  elderly.  The  rate  of AEs,  SAE  or  Withdrawals  has  been  comparable  between  the  different  groups.  A  general  tendency towards decreased reports of local and systemic reactions was observed with the second vaccinations. An increase of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions after the booster vaccination compared with the primary administration has been found in the paediatric study (V87P6).

Results  from  the  six-month  follow  up  study  V87P13  have  shown  that  the  safety  profile  of  the NonAdjSeasonal\\_AFLUNOV group was similar to that of Placebo\\_AdjSeasonal group for both Adults and Elderly, although a higher percentage of subjects in the AFLUNOV group (19%) reported AEs compared to the control group (15%).

The pooled analysis of data on safety of a booster dose of the current AFLUNOV formulation is limited to  87  adults  and  38  elderly.  Slightly  higher  numbers  can  be  considered  if  formulations  with  higher antigen  content  (15  ug)  are  included.  Based  on  available  data  no  clear  and  consistent  trend  for  an increased or decreased reactogenicity, compared to that observed after the first dose, was observed in subjects receiving a booster dose .

Data  on  pregnancy  from  clinical  trials  are  very  limited  and  difficult  to  interpret  without  appropriate comparison  with  unvaccinated  pregnant  women.  However  it  should  be  considered  that  more  than 90,000 pregnant women have been immunised with Focetria vaccine which contains the same amount of MF59 as AFLUNOV. Further data with Focetria are still awaited, but no major cause of concern has been  identified  so  far.  However,  as  AFLUNOV  is  intended  for  use  in  a  non-emergency  situation,  a cautious  approach  should  be  preferred  and  a  wording  suggesting  deferring  administration  after pregnancy was included in section 4.6 of the SmPC.

So  far,  there  was  no  consistent  difference  in  safety  profiles  of  the  four  different  vaccine  schedule groups receiving two vaccinations of 7.5 μ g of H5N1 antigen (study V87P12).

With  regard  to  the  concomitant  use  of  a  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  together  with  AFLUNOV,  no clinically relevant increase of reactogenicity has been found in study V101P1 with approximately 600 enrolled subjects.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

No  specific  safety  concern  has  emerged  from  the  analysis  of  the  safety  data  set  submitted  for AFLUNOV.  However,  considering  that  the  vaccine  is  intended  for  use  in  pre-pandemic  settings,  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cautious  approach  should  be  used  for  pregnant  women  and  elderly  due  to  the  limited  number  who have been vaccinated with AFLUNOV in the clinical studies.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

The Applicant provided a detailed description of the updated system of pharmacovigilance. From the assessment of all documents a clear picture has emerged of the organisation of the whole system as well  as  of  the  PhV  activities  to  be  conducted  by  the  Applicant  during  the  pre-pandemic  and  the pandemic phases.  The  system  described  appears  to  meet  the  needs  for  a  pre-pandemic  vaccine.  A statement  signed  by  the  applicant  and  by  the  qualified  person  for  pharmacovigilance  has  been provided,  indicating  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person  responsible  for pharmacovigilance  and  the  necessary  means  to  notify  any  adverse  reaction  occurring  either  in  the Union or in a third country. The CHMP considered that the PhV system as described by the Applicant fulfils the requirements and provides adequate evidence that the Applicant has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk management plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan and an Efficacy Follow-up Plan.

## Pharmacovigilance activities during the pandemic period

During the pandemic period, an enhanced pharmacovigilance activity will be implemented, in line with the  CHMP  recommendations  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines.  Key  elements  of  the  enhanced pharmacovigilance activity for spontaneously reported events will be as follows:

-  Due  to  a  probable  disruption  of  the  routine  pharmacovigilance  system,  resources  will  be concentrated on timely and effective monitoring of the safety profile of AFLUNOV.
-  Simplified  PSURs  will  be  submitted  on  a  monthly  basis  with  discussion  of  AESI  in  a  dedicated section.
-  Weekly  signalling  meeting  using  Proportional  Reporting  Ratio  and  denominator-based  sensitivity analyses as appropriate.
-  Disproportionality analyses of spontaneous reports using Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR).
-  Denominator-based sensitivity analyses using expected versus observed reporting rates.
-  PASS study
-  Pregnancy registry
-  In the case of H5N1 pandemic, the Applicant should perform a pregnancy study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of AFLUNOV in pregnant women (FUM).

Clinical Study Report to be provided by December 2014   | SmPC, section 4.1 This indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects (…).

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  MA  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product:

-  the SmPC will be updated whenever new relevant safety data are reviewed and analysed.
-  In  the  pre-pandemic  phase,  vaccinated  individuals  that  come  in  contact  with  an  avian  influenza virus (e.g. poultry workers, cullers, veterinarians) could be followed-up (symptoms and seroconversion titres)
-  The protocols of effectiveness studies, when developed and agreed with public health authorities, should be included in the RMP updates. If national authorities have established plans to monitor vaccine effectiveness for specific pandemic vaccines, those plans, if publicly available, should also be incorporated in the RMP.
-  During the pandemic period, the same conditions as those described in the document on CHMP recommendations for pandemic influenza vaccines will apply.
-  The plan for the pandemic period should include a dedicated surveillance study on immunocompromised  subjects;  all  planned  studies  should  be  ready  to  start  at  the  time  of  (or before)  pandemic  declaration;  protocols  (as  well  as  the  organization  structures  and  ethical approvals) should be provided before the WHO's Phase 6 declaration.
-  Stickers reporting at least brandname and batch number should be used to assure the traceability of the vaccination during both prepandemic and pandemic phase. Moreover a specific educational plan dedicated to HCPs and patients should be put in place by the Applicant.
-  The  Applicant  should  continue  to  assess  the  cross-reaction  of  sera  of  subjects  immunised  with AFLUNOV  (produce  by  Vietnam  strain)  against  emerging  drifted  strains  of  H5N1  as  they  are identified, in order to monitor the usefulness of pre-pandemic vaccine (FUM).

## User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 2.8. Benefit-risk balance

## Benefits

-  Beneficial effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  H5N1  strain  is  considered  as  a  likely  candidate  from  which  pandemic  influenza  may  evolve.  In contrast to the recent influenza pandemic caused by the A/H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) strain, which seemed  to  be  easily  transmitted  between  humans  but  had  a  lower  mortality  rate,  the  avian  origin H5N1 strains caused so far influenza outbreaks with rare human transmission but high mortality rate (63%). In case of a H5N1 pandemic, the use of a pre-pandemic vaccine, even if not perfectly matched to  the  pandemic  virus  and  perhaps  giving  very  low  protection,  may  nevertheless  prevent  some infections and deaths whilst waiting for the specific pandemic vaccine.

Overall the production of a vaccine against a potential influenza viral strain during the interpandemic period may: i) permit early vaccination at the beginning of a pandemic when the 'first track pandemic' vaccine is not yet available; ii) prime during pre-pandemic stages to reduce mortality against a closely matched pandemic strain in those countries were infections are occurring; iii) reduce the chance of an emergence  of  a  reassortant  pandemic  strain  by  vaccinating  those  (e.g.  veterinarians,  poultry workers…) at high risk of both avian and human virus infection.

The production process of AFLUNOV is based on long experience with the other Applicant's influenza vaccine,  the  interpandemic  Fluad.  In  addition,  objections  raised  in  the  context  of  the  Focetria  MAA have  been  taken  onto  consideration  in  the  present  application.  Therefore,  the  process  is  well established and raises no substantial quality concerns.

The benefit of a prepandemic vaccine is assessed primarily based on the CHMP immunogenicity criteria and the use of animal challenge data. As already established for several other vaccines, the addition of an adjuvant (regardless of the HA dose) increases the vaccine's reactogenicity. However, important advantages of including an appropriate adjuvant are immune potentiation and antigen sparing, which are  especially  important  in  pandemic  situations.  The  vaccine  was  proven  to  induce  satisfactory antibody responses in healthy adults below and above 60 years of age, with low HA antigen quantities. However,  although  no  major  concerns  exist  on  the  adequacy  of  a  two  dose  schedule,  it  may occasionally be insufficient to complete full maturation of a developing anti H5 immune response, in particular  as  regards  potential  immunity  against  H5N1  variants  different  from  the  vaccine  strain. Additionally, results from the only submitted paediatric study to date suggested a sufficient immune response also in the group aged 6 months-17 years (study V87P6).

In subjects primed against the H5N3 strain, a heterologous booster with AFLUNOV administered after 6 to 8 years from the priming induced high and rapid serological and cell mediated immune responses against both strains and a variety of others. Thus the strategy of pre-pandemic vaccination with an adjuvanted vaccine would allow boosting with a single dose once the actual pandemic strain is known even  6-8  years  later.  This  suggested  that  immunological  memory  had  been  induced  by  the  H5N3 vaccination  series  which  persisted  several  years  and  that  B  cells  can  rapidly  be  expanded  upon  an adjuvanted booster vaccination containing a different pandemic strain.

Concomitant administration of AFLUNOV with a conventional subunit seasonal influenza vaccine did not negatively impact the immune response to either the pandemic H5N1 strain or to the seasonal strains.

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

At present the benefit of AFLUNOV can only be assumed from the data on the immunological responses elicited  following  a  primary  series  and  a  booster  against  the vaccine strain and against antigenically drifted strains of influenza A/H5N1 virus. SRH and MN assays were considered the most appropriate serological tests for assessing immunogenicity of AFLUNOV, as it has already been the case for Focetria H5N1. However it is not fully understood why immunogenicity results obtained by the Applicant with HI assay are not always satisfactory. In particular, the lack of consistency across pivotal studies for some results  measured  by  HI  and  the  suboptimal  results  obtained  with  the  HI  assay  in  the  largest  study V87P13 are still unexplained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  expected  benefit  of  AFLUNOV  is  to  prime  immunological  response  in  fully  susceptible  subjects against  H5N1  virus  and  therefore  to  allow  shorter  time  to  induce  appropriate  protection  against clinically apparent infection and/or severe disease in case of an influenza pandemic due to H5N1. This is based on an assumption that vaccination with AFLUNOV containing antigens derived from A/Vietnam /1194/2004 will provide a clinically useful degree of cross-protection against a H5N1 strain causing the pandemic.  Results  reported  for  AFLUNOV/Prepandemic  Influenza  Vaccine  H5N1  from  heterologous challenge showed limited cross-reaction. For these reasons the applicant is requested to continue to evaluate cross-reactivity and cross-protection in the post-authorisation period against emerging strains considered to have some potential to cause a pandemic.

## Risks

-  Unfavourable effects

AFLUNOV  is  commonly  or  very  commonly  associated  with  a  range  of  local  and  systemic  adverse reactions but these are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use of the vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-70 years. The experience of AFLUNOV in the elderly and in a population with co-morbidities is limited. No data are available in immunocompromised patients.

Although  limited  safety  data  are  available  for  AFLUNOV  in  the  elderly  population,  post-marketing experience with Fluad (containing adjuvant MF59) in elderly subjects is extensive. Overall, considering the cumulative exposure, including all age groups, the reporting frequency of all adverse events is 1.4 cases per 100,000 sold doses. The observed differences in AEs between adults and elderly subjects are consistent with what observed in clinical trials and do not seem to represent a safety risk.

Data on pregnancy outcomes are limited.

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The current safety database of AFLUNOV was considered to be sufficient to describe adverse reactions that occur uncommonly and to give an indication of any rare events. However, there are some adverse reactions known to be very rarely associated with influenza vaccines and it was not possible to predict if  higher  rates  might  be  observed  with  AFLUNOV  compared  with,  for  example,  seasonal  influenza vaccines. Safety in elderly subjects above 70 years of age was not assessed.

As the vaccine is intended for use in a non-emergency situation, careful consideration should be given to  its  administration  to  pregnant  women,  for  whom  vaccination  could  be  deferred  till  the  end  of pregnancy. Sporadic cases of pregnancy were reported in some studies, but the number of cases was very  small  and  no  firm  conclusion  could  be  drawn.  However,  safety  of  AFLUNOV  in  specifically vulnerable populations or in risk populations might be extrapolated from Focetria H1N1 which has been widely used during the current pandemic. Final data on pregnancy outcomes with Focetria H1N1 are awaited, thus final conclusions on the safety profile of AFLUNOV during pregnancy cannot be drawn at present.

## Benefit-risk balance

-  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Data  on  the  immunological  responses  elicited  following  a  primary  series  and  a  booster  vaccinations against the vaccine strain and against antigenically drifted strains of influenza A/H5N1 virus, supported the claim that AFLUNOV, in the interpandemic period may i) permit early vaccination at the beginning of a pandemic when the 'first track pandemic' vaccine is not yet available;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ii) prime during pre-pandemic stages to reduce mortality against a closely matched pandemic strain in those countries were infections are occurring;

iii)  reduce  the  chance  of  an  emergence  of  a  reassortant  pandemic  strain  by  vaccinating  those  (e.g. veterinarians, poultry workers…) at high risk of both avian and human virus infection.

These  benefits  together  with  the  acceptable  safety  profile  of  AFLUNOV  are  considered  of  significant clinical relevance and overcome the uncertainties due mainly to the limited experience in elderly and in subjects with co-morbidities or immunocompromised. Of note, the limited experience with AFLUNOV during pregnancy suggests as a precautionary approach to defer the administration of the vaccine.

## 2.8.1. Conclusions on benefit-risk balance

In conclusion, as with any rare, catastrophic event, it is impossible to determine the likelihood of an H5N1 pandemic. Therefore the benefit of a pre-pandemic vaccine is not easy to predict. Vaccination with pre-pandemic influenza virus vaccine (if specific) could be an effective way to reduce the threat of a possible influenza pandemic while an acceptable safety profile can be concluded from the currently available  safety  data  base.  Thus,  following  thorough  evaluation  of  immunogenicity  and  safety  data provided in the MAA the CHMP is of the opinion that a two doses regimen of AFLUNOV has a favourable benefit/risk ratio in the prophylaxis of infection by H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus.

The overall benefit-risk balance of AFLUNOV is positive.

## 2.8.2. Risk management plan

A  risk  management  plan  including  an  Efficacy  Follow-up  Plan  was  submitted.  The  CHMP,  having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  in case of pandemic, pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns
-  additional risk minimisation activities were required (as listed in paragraph 3.7).

## 2.9. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the riskbenefit balance of AFLUNOV in the prophylaxis of infection by H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

Furthermore, the CHMP takes note that the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan is not fully completed yet as only some of the measures are completed. The CHMP reviewed the already available paediatric data of studies subject to this plan and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
