## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Melanoma

Melanoma is a malignant tumour of melanocytes. Melanocytes are dendritic-like cells located in various anatomic sites derived from the neural crest. These sites include the base of the epidermis, the eye, and epithelia of the nasal cavity, oropharynx, anus, vagina, and urinary tract. They produce a brown pigment, melanin, which colours the skin, hair, and eyes. The majority of melanomas are cutaneous (approximately 90%), the second largest category is ocular melanoma (approximately 5%). In the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) report on almost 85,000 cases diagnosed between 1985 through 1994 the percentages of melanomas that were cutaneous, ocular, mucosal, and unknown primaries were 91.2%, 5.2%, 1.3%, and 2.2%, respectively. The other melanomas that can develop in mucous membrane tissue of the nose, mouth, genitalia, and anus (mucosal melanoma) are exceptionally uncommon, as are the extremely rare melanomas that may develop as apparent primary lesions originating in an internal organ (unknown primary melanoma). Melanoma usually occurs in adults, but it may occasionally be found in children and adolescents.

In early stage melanoma, surgery remains the recommended curable treatment. In metastatic melanoma, therapeutic approaches studied include chemotherapy, biochemotherapy, nonspecific immune adjuvants, cancer-specific vaccines, cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, and specific immunostimulants. Systemic chemotherapy remains the gold standard treatment of metastatic melanoma, in the case of patients with a good performance status and no major co-morbidities for whom radical surgery is unsuitable. However, to date non-surgically resectable advanced or metastasized melanoma is not curable with available therapy.

Two drugs are approved in the European Union (EU) for treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma: dacarbazine (DTIC) and fotemustine. DTIC, approved in Europe for 30 years, is considered to be the most active single agent for the management of advanced melanoma, and has been reported to induce objective tumour responses in 7% to 20% of patients. Fotemustine, approved only in some European countries, showed a higher response rate compared to DTIC (15.2% vs. 6.8%, p=0.043), but with no significant difference in time to progression (1.8 vs. 1.9 months p=0.139) or overall survival (7.3 vs. 5.6 months, p=0.067). Moreover, the randomized trial found that fotemustine was much more toxic than DTIC.

The  lack  of  clinically  significant  beneficial  long-term  effects  of  surgery,  radiation  therapy,  and chemotherapy  for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  has  led  to therapeutic efforts with immunotherapy.  High  doses  of  IL-2  have  been  reported  to  produce  durable  responses  in  a  small number of patients who can tolerate it. To date, the only immunotherapeutic agent authorized in the EU is IFN-alfa-2B. It is indicated in malignant melanoma as adjuvant therapy for patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk for recurrence. Single agent IFN-alfa-2B therapy treatment yields response rates of about 15% in metastatic melanoma with infrequent long-term responders and occasional long-term survival.

## About the product

Oblimersen sodium, a synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, is a linear strand of DNA comprised of 18 nucleotides. The chemical name of oblimersen is deoxyribose, phosphorothioate (5'TCT-CCC-AGC-GTG-CGC-CAT- 3'), heptadecasodium salt. Additionally, a sulphur atom is replacing one of non-bridging oxygen atoms in the backbone. The sulphur modification is introduced to make oblimersen more resistant to metabolic clearance in-vivo.

Oblimersen  belongs  to  a  class  of  drugs  known  as  antisense  therapy,  expected  to  represent  a pharmacologic mechanism for selectively reducing production of a target protein. The nucleotides in an  antisense  drug  are  linked  in  a  sequence  that  is  complementary  to  the  normal  (sense)  strand  of messenger  ribonucleic  acid  (mRNA),  the  precursor  to  final  translation  of  the  protein.  When  the antisense drug binds to its complementary sequence of mRNA, the mRNA is enzymatically cleaved by ribonucleic acid nuclease-H (RNase-H), preventing translation of the protein. Oblimersen is designed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  inactivate  the  B-cell  leukemia/lymphoma  2  ( bcl-2 )  messenger  RNA  (mRNA)  that  directs  the synthesis of Bcl-2 protein.

Although a plethora of proteins are thought to be involved in the control of cellular apoptosis, members of the Bcl-2 family are through to be critical and central regulators. Bcl-2, the founding member of the family, appears to be a predominantly integral membrane protein and is found in the outer mitochondrial membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or outer nuclear membrane. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that has been implicated in the modulation of sensitivity to different classes of anticancer drugs by preventing cell death in several tumour cell systems. In melanoma cells, Bcl-2 expression is found in up to 90% of cases and high Bcl-2 expression has been associated with shorter survival and resistance to chemotherapy. The down-regulation of the Bcl-2 protein can potentially restore the intrinsic apoptotic pathways and re-sensitize the malignant cells to undergo programmed cell death upon delivery of an appropriate death signal or therapy.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Genasense  is a sterile, preservative-free concentrate for solution for infusion , which is presented as 10 ml single dose vials containing 30 mg/ml of oblimersen (free acid) as active substance.

Excipients are water for injections, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment.

The primary container consists of a single use Type I glass vial with rubber stopper.

## Drug Substance

Oblimersen  sodium,  a  synthetic  phosphorothioate  oligonucleotide,  is  a  linear  strand  of  DNA comprised of 18 nucleotides and a sulphur atom replacing one of non-bridging oxygen atoms in the backbone.  It  is  a  drug  substance  not  described  in  any  Pharmacopoeia  and  hence  an  in-house monograph has been proposed as the quality standard.

Oblimersen sodium is a white to pale yellow, amorphous powder obtained after freeze-drying and is freely  soluble  in  water  and  it  is  reversibly  hygroscopic.  The  chemistry  of  the  thiolation  reaction produces essentially equal amounts of (R) and (S) diastereomers.

## · Manufacture

The manufacturing process is performed in 3 main stages: synthesis, chromatography and ultrafiltration / freeze-drying, each of which include several steps.

In general, the information about the quality of the starting materials, reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials is correctly established. Both in-process controls and intermediate controls are suitable to obtain the quality defined.

Batch  analysis  data  are  presented  and  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  manufacturing process.

## · Specification

The drug substance specification has been established taking into account the relevant ICH Guidelines for setting new chemical entity specifications and includes test for appearance, identity, assay, related impurities, water content, heavy metals, volatile organic impurities, sodium content, bacterial endotoxins and microbial burden.

Batch analysis data of 50 batches of active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

- Stability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long-term stability data up to 36 months are available for two batches of the active substance, and up to 24 months for one batch, representing commercial process and scale, manufactured at the intended commercial supplier, and packaged in a primary container-closure system of identical composition to the container-closure system to be used for storage of commercial material.

Stability samples were evaluated for appearance, assay, purity/related impurities, moisture, and sodium using the same analytical methods and acceptance criteria used for Drug Substance release testing. Stability samples were assessed for microbial burden and bacterial endotoxins, using release test methods and acceptance criteria.

The stability studies were designed to evaluate frozen , refrigerated, and controlled room temperature as  potential  storage  conditions  for  the  active  substance  post-approval.  Accordingly,  stability  test conditions  and  frequency  were  set  to  evaluate  the  active  substance  quality  in  accordance  with  ICH recommended test frequency for long term stability (-20 ± 5°C; 5 ± 3 °C; and 25 ± 2 °C/60 ± 5% RH), intermediate storage conditions (30 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH), short term accelerated stability (40 ± 2 °C/75 ± 5% RH), and photostability.

The results justify a retest period proposed by the company in the intended packaging.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The objective of the pharmaceutical development program was to develop an aqueous formulation that was  stable  and  compatible  with  the  container/closure  system.  An  oblimersen  sodium  (free  acid) concentration of 30 mg/ml was selected for commercialization.

The  selected  excipients  are  commonly  used  for  parenteral  formulations.  The  drug  substance  is dissolved in water for injection and the solution is adjusted for pH and made isotonic with sodium chloride.

The primary container/closure system  consists of a 10 ml Type I glass vial closed with a butyl rubber stopper coated with ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE).

The clinical formulation used in the clinical trials is identical to the one proposed for marketing.

- Manufacture of the Product

The drug product is manufactured by Chesapeake Biological Laboratories, Inc (Maryland, USA). An inspection of this manufacturing site was carried out by Sweden in August 2006. The findings of the inspection are in compliance with the Community Good Manufacturing Practice requirements. Manufacturing mainly consists of preparation of the bulk solution, followed by sterile filtration and filling in the vials.

Validation studies have been carried out on the sterilisation/depyrogenation of the vials and steam sterilisation of stoppers, filters and aseptic equipment in three production-scale batches and is satisfactory . The in process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

## · Product Specification

The  drug  product  specifications include appropriate tests for appearance,  colour  of solution, identification  (HPLC,  mass  spectrometry),  assay  (HPLC,  95-105%),  related  impurities  (HPLC), volume in container, pH, particulate matter, sterility (Ph Eur) and bacterial endotoxin.

Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies

- Stability of the Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  stability  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  refrigerated  and  controlled  room  temperature  as potential storage conditions for drug product post-approval. Accordingly, stability test conditions and frequency were set to evaluate the drug product quality in accordance with ICH recommended test frequency for long term stability (5 ± 3ºC and 25 ± 2ºC/60 ± 5% RH), intermediate storage conditions (30 ± 2ºC/60 ± 5% RH) and short-term accelerated stability (40 ± 2ºC/75 ± 5% RH). At each specified test point,  stability  samples  were  evaluated  for  appearance,  assay,  purity/related  impurities  (HPLC)  and pH.  Stability  samples  were  assessed  for  particulate  matter,  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins  at  lot release and every 12 months thereafter.

A photostability and a temperature cycling (freeze-thaw) study was also conducted.

Long-term stability data up to 36 months and 18 months are available for 4 and 3 batches, respectively which  have  been  manufactured  at  the  same  site  using  an  identical  process  and  container-closure system as that proposed for commercial product.

The available stability data allow a practical shelf life and storage conditions to be defined.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  over  many  years  by  Genta,  Aventis,  their associated contract research organizations, and academic laboratories. All pivotal toxicology studies included appropriate toxicokinetic monitoring and were GLP-compliant.

## Pharmacology

Primary pharmacodynamic studies have evaluated the mechanism of action of oblimersen and the effects on various cancer models, including in vitro and in vivo systems. Only studies conducted to evaluate the primary pharmacodynamics in melanoma model have been considered as relevant for the requested therapeutic indication. Studies with in vitro and in vivo models of melanoma are limited and it should be considered as a limitation as this is the clinical indication requested for oblimersen in this application.

Oblimersen was selected in a series of 40 phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides that were designed to recognize target sites distributed from 750 bases upstream of the initiation codon to the 3'-end of the  published  cDNA bcl-2 sequence.  These  oligonucleotides  were  evaluated  for  downregulation  of bcl-2 mRNA  expression  in  cultured  T-24  human  bladder  carcinoma  and  MCF-7  human  breast adenocarcinoma cells.

518A2 human melanoma cells were exposed to 25 to 200 nM of oblimersense, G4126 mismatch control, or G3622 reverse sequence oligonucleotide. Results showed that oblimersen (200 nM) caused a nearly complete loss of bcl-2 mRNA within 24 hours and 61% decrease in Bcl-2 protein at 48 hours. The decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels was related to the concentration of Oblimersen (35%, 33%, 47%, and 61% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM, respectively). In contrast, exposure to the G3622 reverse sequence and G4126 2-base mismatch control oligonucleotides resulted in only modest inhibition of Bcl-2 protein production (~17% at 200 nM).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The impact of oblimersen regarding antineoplastic activity has been investigated in melanoma cells. Published  literature  support  the  hypothesis  that  reduced  levels  of  Bcl-2  can  make  melanocytes  and 518A2 cells more vulnerable to apoptotic mechanisms programmed in the cell or stimulated by the actions  of  cytotoxic  anticancer  drugs.  These  results  have  demonstrated  sequence-specific bcl-2 antisense activity and antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo, either as a single agent or in combination with several chemotherapeutic agents, including dacarbazine (DTIC).

However, studies suggest that the mechanism whereby oblimersen produces drug-induced cytotoxicity in the 518A2 melanoma line is not dependent on levels of Bcl-2 and call into question the validity of Bcl-2 as a target in this cell line.

In  vivo  studies  have  been  performed  regarding  the  antineoplastic  activity  of  oblimersen  using  a xenograph  model  of  518A2  melanoma  cells  in  SCID  mice,  including  both  monotherapy  and combination therapy with dacarbazine (DTIC). When oblimersen was given at 5 mg/kg/day s.c. for 14 days as monotherapy a 59% reduction in tumour weight was observed after 21 days (0.39+0.12g vs. 0.96+0.20g in the saline control, p&lt;0.004). Reverse and mismatched control oligonucleotides had no significant effects. This effect was associated with a 66-72% reduction in bcl-2 gene product whereas the maximum change observed with the reverse or mismatched oligonucleotide controls was 19%. In addition, the decrease in tumour weight was associated with an increase in the number of apoptotic tumour cells (Oblimersense 3.38%, control 0.69%). Reverse and mismatched control oligonucleotides had  no  marked  effects  (0.69%  and  0.85%  respectively).  Body  weight  and  overt  signs  indicated  no toxic effects of oblimersen but there was an increase in spleen weight which was much less with the reverse sequence oligonucleotide and absent with the mismatched oligonucleotide.

The  effect  of  combined  Oblimersen  plus  dacarbazine  therapy  in  melanoma  tumour  bearing  mice resulted in a marked decrease in tumour weight (to 0.02+0.02 g) with complete tumour ablation in 3/6 mice.  Dacarbazine  (DTIC)  alone  also  induced  anti-tumour  effect,  reducing  tumour  weight  from 1.53+0.15 g to 0.44+0.10 g. Reverse and mismatched oligonucleotides did not further reduce tumour weight  with  respect  to  DTIC  alone.  The  rate  of  apoptosis  in  the  three  remaining  tumours  in  the Oblimersen/DTIC combination group was about four fold that in the DTIC alone group. Body weight and  overt  signs  indicated  no  toxicity  of  oblimersen  above  that  of  DTIC.  In  the  presence  of  DTIC, Oblimersen  induced  an  increase  in  spleen  weight  with  no  comparable  effect  of  the  reverse  or mismatched control oligonucleotides. In a repeat of the experiment in groups of 7 mice with lower control  tumour  weights  (0.97+0.22g),  the  Oblimersen/DTIC  combination  therapy  induced  complete tumour ablation in all mice.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

In order to address a possible immunostimulatory effect of oblimersen a methylated counterpart including 5'- methyl cytosines in the CpG motifs has been tested. This modification is known to abrogate immune stimulation of oligonucleotides. Methylated oblimersen has a similar antitumour effect reducing tumour growth in the 518A2 human melanoma model in SCID mice.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Standard safety pharmacology studies have not been performed, however, no physiologically significant alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, ECG waveform or CNS effects were observed after repeat-dose toxicity studies with Oblimersen in rats, dogs and monkeys. In these studies WBCs and APTT levels were increased while prothrombin time remained unchanged.

Hemodynamic safety pharmacology studies done in monkeys supported no physiologically significant alterations  in  blood  pressure,  heart  rate  or  ECG  waveform  attributed  to  the  test  article.  However  a fatality  occurred  in  one  monkey  in  a  pharmacokinetics  study  after  a  rapid  IV  bolus  administration. Similar, serious adverse effects, including deaths, have been noted when other oligonucleotides have been administered as rapid IV bolus doses in monkeys .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been done.

## Pharmacokinetics

Oblimersen was metabolized into a 17-mer oligonucleotide (N-1) and a 16-mer oligonucleotide  (N-2) in  all  species.  The  N-1  metabolite  has  an  affinity  and  biological  activity  comparable  to  the  parent oblimersen, whereas the N-2 metabolite has a lower affinity but retains biological activity.

Two methods have been validated for the analysis of oblimersen and N-1 and N-2 metabolites, a highperformance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection method (HPLC/UV) and a capillary gel electrophoresis with UV detection (CGE/UV). Both methods resulted acceptable to measure the active ingredient, however, total criteria of acceptance were not met for the metabolites quantification. The HPLC/UV method has a nominal range of 0.3 to 20 µg/mL, with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.3 µg/mL and the CGE/UV has a range of 0.05 to 2.50 µg/mL, with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.05 µg/mL.

## · Absorption-Bioavailability

In monkey, rats and dogs, plasma levels were at steady state levels at or near 5 hours after the start of infusion in each dosing cycle. Concentrations of oblimersen and its N-1 and N-2 metabolites in plasma were  dose-dependent,  with  no  evidence  of  accumulation.  There  were  no  significant  differences between males and females. The pharmacokinetics of oblimersen and its metabolites in the last cycles were similar to values in the first cycle of treatment at each dose level. Although the values for the N1  and  N-2  metabolites  were  reported  to  be  50%  and  15%,  respectively  of  those  for  the  parent molecule, the values were highly variable. The pharmacokinetic parameters estimated in this analysis are  consistent  with  the  observed  pharmacokinetics  in  humans,  in  that  oblimersen  is  rapidly  cleared from blood after IV administration with a half-life of approximately 2 hours.

The AUCall for oblimersen in monkeys dosed with 7 mg/kg for 8 cycles IV infusion were between 174.70-200.5  µg/mL/h.  The  N-1  AUCall  was  81.52-97.59  µg/mL/h  and  N-2  AUCall  was  5.43-16.28 µg/mL/h. Similar plasma concentrations were observed in rats and dogs, therefore, an almost direct comparison between animal to human pharmacokinetics could be inferred.

The systemic bioavailability assessed in monkeys after daily SC injections of 7 mg/kg/day for 4.5 days resulted to be 68-70%. The Cmax at steady state for oblimersen was 7.79 µg/mL, and were 3.80 µg/mL and 1.63 µg/mL for N-1 and N-2 metabolites, respectively.

## · Distribution

Tissue  distribution  is  only  available  in  female  mouse  as  part  of  published  studies.  After  IV administration of 35 S-Oblimersen to BALB/c mice at 5 mg/kg, radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed, with a volume of distribution (VSS) of 33 mL/g. Most of the radioactivity was initially protein bound (98% at 5 minutes after dosing), although only 23% of the plasma radioactivity was associated with protein at 24 hours after dosing. Radioactivity was higher in tissues compared with plasma after the 10-minute sampling time, with a tissue-to-plasma ratio of 87 for kidney, 17 for liver, 5  for  spleen,  3.5  for  gut,  and  2.5  for  heart  and  lung;  no  radioactivity  was  detected  in  brain. Additionally, significant levels of radioactivity were found in the bone marrow over the time course studies, with detectable levels measured 72 hours after administration.

After  SC  dosing,  plasma  levels  reached  steady  state  by  Day  3.  At  steady  state,  half  the  plasma radioactivity was protein bound, with 66 to 86% of radioactivity associated with oblimersen. By Day 14, most of the radioactivity had disappeared from plasma. Radioactivity appeared to accumulate in the organs, with a significant increase between Day 3 and Day 7; radioactivity was still detectable at 21 days post-infusion in the kidney, liver, spleen, heart, lung, gut, and bone marrow. Tissue-to-plasma ratios were 99 for kidney, 30 for liver, 8.5 for gut, 6.5 for spleen, 1 for heart, and 0.7 for lung; no radioactivity was observed in brain after 30 minutes (0.5 hour). Oblimersen represented an average of 67% of total radioactivity in the liver and 77% in the kidney.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Oblimersen is highly protein bound in the plasma of rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans (99.6-999%) assessed in an in vitro protein binding using ultrafiltration. Moreover, it was found that labelled Oblimersen was bound to the lipoprotein-deficient lipoprotein fraction (albumin and α -1 glycoprotein) regardless of oblimersen concentration, what enhanced the in vitro cellular uptake of oblimersen into human melanoma cells, suggesting endocytosis of oligonucleotide by the cells.

## · Metabolism

The metabolism of oblimersen has been assessed in vivo and in vitro studies. The pharmacokinetic studies  on  monkey  and  rat  showed  that  plasma  samples  analyzed  contained  mainly  oblimersen  and two metabolites, N-1 and N-2 accounting for 50% and 15% of the parent compound at steady state. The in vitro studies performed with human hepatocytes evidenced that oblimersen was metabolized steadily over the first 60 minutes, generating mainly N-1, N-2 at lower concentrations and minor N-3 and  N-4  metabolite  concentrations.  Another  in  vitro  study  assessed  the  metabolism  of  oblimersen when  incubated  with  a  mixture  of  endonuclease  and  5´-exonuclease,  showing  that  the  parent compound was metabolized rapidly (within 5-10 minutes) giving a series of progressive N-1 chainshortened metabolites.

In addition, oblimersen did not inhibit CYP450 (CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). However, oblimersen seemed to inhibit CYP1A2, with a Ki of 6.0 µM.  Since  the  mean  steady-state  concentration  of  oblimersen  in  humans  following  continuous  IV infusion of 7 mg/kg/day was determined to be 3.154 µg/mL or 0.555 µM, the ratio Cmax (Css) to Ki for CYP1A2 is approximately 0.093 and therefore the possibility for drug-drug interactions for drugs metabolized  by  CYP1A2  is  considered  remote  using  the  criteria:  Cmax/Ki  &lt;  0.1.  In  vitro  studies showed  that  oblimersen  did  not  induce  the  activity  of  CYP450  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4).

## · Excretion

The excretion profile in mice administered with labelled oblimersen. Following IV bolus administration,  94%  of  total  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  urine  (55.5%)  and  faeces  (38.3%)  after three days. The urine radioactivity comprised mostly degradation products and little or no presence of parent compounds. No determination was performed in faeces.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

There is no specific study for oblimersen-Dacarbacine interaction, however, the co-administration of doxorubicin  and  oblimersen  in  a  model  of  MDA435/LCC6  human  breast  cancer  in  SCID  mice, modified  the  pharmacokinetic  of  this  latter,  lowering  the  clearance  and  increasing  the  AUC  of oblimersen and increasing the doxorubicin concentration in tumours.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

In monkeys, a dose-ranging study at single IV bolus doses of 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24 mg/kg did not produce any deaths. Animals showed diarrhea at doses ≥ 16 mg/kg. A dose-related activation of the alternative complement  pathway  and  increased  APTT  were  observed  at  all  doses  levels.  Recovery  from  all findings occurred within 2 weeks of dosing. In the safety pharmacology study monkeys were exposed to  30  mg/kg  of  oblimersen,  administered  as  either  a  single  IV  bolus  or  a  24-hour  IV  infusion.  No deaths or clinical signs were evident. However, all animals had elevated ALT, AST, LDH, and CK levels on Study Day 2, being more severe in the bolus injected animals. Animals receiving IV bolus injections,  but  not  those  receiving  IV  infusions,  also showed  significant  complement activation that occurred between 30 minutes and 2 hours post-dose. These animals did not exhibit alterations of blood pressure, heart rates or ECGs. However, in a pharmacokinetic study a death was reported in monkeys dosed at 7 mg/kg associated to complement activation cascade. The monkey had oblimersen plasma concentration of 68 µg/mL, while the group mean was 48 ± 2 µg/mL.

MTD was determined at 500 mg/kg using a micronucleus test in  mice  exposed  to  single  IV  bolus doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

In rats treated for 2 cycles, at 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg of IV oblimersen (15/sex/dose), even the lowest dose produced adverse effects,  with haematological changes,  macroscopic lymph nodes enlargement and microscopic changes in liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Haematological changes included increases in WBC and RBC counts and decrease platelet count at ≥ 6 mg/kg. Enzymes, such as ALT and ALP were raised in plasma at ≥ 6 mg/kg, while levels of AST, bilirubin, albumin, total protein, albumin bound to Ca and cholesterol decreased at 20 mg/kg. Kidney damage changes included increased BUN, Na and Cl in serum and decreased P and K at the end of cycle 2 at 6 mg/kg and in both cycles at 20 mg/kg. Macroscopically, kidneys were pale and lymph nodes and spleen enlarged at ≥ 6 mg/kg. Microscopic findings  were  evident  at ≥ 6  mg/kg  in  liver,  spleen,  lymph  nodes,  eyes,  kidneys  and  infusion  sites. Additional  studies  at  0.3,  3  or  6  mg/kg/day  (IV  perfused,  8  cycles,  21/sex/dose)  established  the NOAEL at 0.3 mg/kg/day for rats. In this study the dose of 3 mg/kg produced some deaths and related clinical signs since the 1st cycle. Changes in the haematology parameters and serum chemistry were observed at ≥ 3 mg/kg, with increased WBC count and decreased RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count. The serum chemistry showed increased AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin and decreased albumin, total protein and cholesterol. Organ weight was increased in liver, kidney and spleen at the end of cycle 8, correlating with the macroscopic and microscopic lesions. Infusion sites also showed adverse effects.

In the dog study, groups of Beagle dogs (3/sex/dose) were administered with IV perfusion of 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. No deaths were recorded and clinical signs were limited to the mid- and high-dose groups and included reduced appetite and feces output, swollen hind limbs, abdomen, urogenital area and penis, thin condition, cold to touch and decreased activity. Three high-dose dogs exhibited mild fluctuations  in  white  and  red  blood  cell  parameters  and  blood  chemistry  measures  that  changed  in accordance  with  the  recent  dosing  history  of  the  animal.  These  parameters  either  increased  or decreased at the end of the 2 dosing weeks and were similar to pretreatment values at the end of the washout  period.  Platelet  counts  were  decreased  in  a  dose-related  manner  and  platelet  size  was increased in the high-dose group. APTT was increased over 50% over controls in the high-dose group. Other changes in hematology and blood chemistry were within the ranges of historical controls. There were no findings in urinalysis parameters. Complement activation occurred in the high-dose group, as evidence by very low levels of CH50 at the end of the 2 dosing periods, with normal levels at the end of the washout period. Macroscopic effects included pale discoloration of the kidney in all high-dose dogs and in some mid-dose dogs. Microscopic examination revealed a diffusely basophilic epithelium with slight interstitial inflammation and degeneration/necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Additionally, mid-  and  high-dose  dogs  exhibited  proliferation  of  reactive  sinusoidal  cells  of  the  liver,  with  the occasional  presence  of  granular  basophilic  cellular deposits in liver;  however,  no  effects  on hepatocytes  could  be  seen.  Lymphoid  hyperplasia  (mandibular,  mesenteric  lymph  nodes)  was observed at mid and high dose and was characterized by the presence of lymphoid and lymphoblastic medullary cord cells and hypercellularity. Minimal to slight lymphoid cell aggregates were noticed in the bone marrow (sternal) at 30 mg/kg and in 2 low dose male animals. Thymic atrophy was found in males and 1 female dosed at 30 mg/kg. In this study, the NOAEL was considered to be 3 mg/kg/day.

In the monkey studies,  oblimersen was administer IV on Days 1-7 and Days 22-28 at doses 7, 28, or 56  mg/kg/day  (3/sex/dose).  Additional  groups  of  monkeys  (2/sex/dose)  were  administered  1.75 mg/kg/day  Oblimersen.  There  were  no  unscheduled  deaths  on  study.  Minor  clinical  signs  were observed at doses &gt; 1.75 mg/kg/day, mainly swelling around the surgical site that resolved during the recovery phase. There were no treatment-related effects on body weights, standard diet consumption, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, and blood pressure at any dose level. Similar to rats and dogs, oblimersen produced hematological changes: increased WBCs at 56 mg/kg and increased APTT (2- to 3-fold higher than pretreatment values) at 28 and 56 mg/kg. Elevation in some of the liver enzymes and reduction in albumin/globulin ratio appeared in groups dosed with 28/56 mg/kg. No treatmentrelated effects were noted in the urinalyses. Slight increases in levels of complement split product Bb were  noted  in  the  high-dose  group  on  Days  7  and  29,  but  levels  on  day  21  were  comparable  to pretreatment levels. At the end of the second dosing period, absolute and relative increases in spleen, kidney,  and  liver  weights  were  noted  at  56  mg/kg  and  increases  in  spleen  weights  at  28  mg/kg. Macroscopic changes included pale discoloration, pale foci, or enlargement of the kidney in monkeys receiving ≥ 7 mg/kg/day. Microscopic examinations revealed dose-related changes in kidney (tubular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

degeneration and/or necrosis), liver (hypertrophy of sinusoidal lining cells and single cell hepatocyte necrosis),  lymph  nodes  (histiocytosis  in  mandibular  and/or  mesenteric  nodes)  and  spleen  (slight increases in white pulp cellularity and loss of formation of germinal centers) at doses ≥ 7 mg/kg/day. In addition, treatment related changes in thymus (minimal or moderate histiocytosis) were observed after  2  dosing  cycles  in  high-dose  animals.  No  macroscopic  or  microscopic  changes  were  noted  in monkeys receiving 1.75 mg/kg/day. In this study the NOAEL was considered to be 1.75 mg/kg/day.

An additional chronic study in monkeys (8 cycles, 4/sex/dose), Oblimersen was administered at 1, 7, or 28 mg/kg/day on Days 1-7 of each cycle followed by continuous infusions of saline vehicle during the  washout  period  on  Days  8-21  to  maintain  catheter  patency.  Unscheduled  euthanasia  was performed on 4 monkeys during the study due to their poor and moribund condition: 2 females (on Days 46 and 108) and 1 male (on Day 71) receiving 28 mg/kg/day and 1 male (on Day 133) receiving 7 mg/kg/day. In this study toxicity was evident at all dose levels. While high-dose animals tended to show adverse signs as early as Cycle 1, low-dose animals tended to show adverse signs only from Cycle 4 onwards. The main findings comprised inflammatory changes at the infusion site at all dose levels  (which  were  considered  the  main  contributory  factor  in  the  early  euthanasia),  lesions  in  the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen at all dose levels, and lesions in the kidneys and bone marrow in midand high-dose animals. Changes in clinical pathology parameters generally were consistent with the infusion  site  and  liver  lesions.  Evidence  of  regression  of  lesions  was  observed  following  a  6-week recovery period, with the exception of glomerular nephropathy in the kidneys. Glomerulopathy was observed in the kidneys of 1 male and 2 females in the high-dose group and 2 males in the mid-dose group;  there  was  no  evidence  that  this  specifically  glomerular  change  had  regressed  during  the recovery  period,  although  the  tubular  nephropathy  and  other  renal  changes  showed  evidence  of reversibility. Depleted lymph node modules were present in all high-dose recovery animals and a one mid-dose male. Because toxic effects were observed at the lowest dose (1 mg/kg/day), the NOAEL could not be established in this study.

## · Genotoxicity

Oblimersen was non-genotoxic in a bacterial mutagenicity study (Ames test), in mammalian cells and in a micronucleus bone marrow assay.

## · Carcinogenicity

According to ICH Guidance S1A carcinogenicity studies were not tested.

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

Oblimersen was tested for teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. In a range finding study of embryofetal development in rats (7 mated females/group) Oblimersen was administered at doses 0, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day via IV continuous infusion (2 mL/kg/h) from Days 6 through 17 of gestation. Maternal toxicity  was  found  at  doses ≥ 3  mg/kg/day,  as  evidenced  by  adverse  clinical  signs  and  condition, decreased body weight gains and food intake, and gross pathologic changes, as well as by mortality at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day. Toxicity was associated with embryolethality at 3 mg/kg/day. In the main study (22 mated females/group) oblimersen was administered at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.52, or 3 mg/kg/day by IV continuous infusion (2 mL/kg/h) from Days 6 through 17 of gestation. Pathologic changes were noted at 0.52 mg/kg/day and mortality and gross pathologic changes occurred at 3 mg/kg/day. There was an increased  incidence  of  late  resorptions  in  1  litter  at  0.52  mg/kg/day  and  2  litters  at  3  mg/kg/day. Increased incidence of minor skeletal anomalies at 0.52 and 3 mg/kg/day was considered indicative of transitory  delays  in  ossification.  There  was  no  evidence  of  teratogenicity.  The  maternal  and  fetal developmental NOAEL doses were 0.1 mg/kg/day.

In rabbits, a range-finding study for embryofetal development was performed in groups of artificially inseminated female white rabbits (6/group) that were administered oblimersen at doses of 0, 0.3, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day via IV continuous infusion (2 mL/kg/h) from Days 7 to 19 of gestation. Maternal toxicity was observed at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, evidenced by mortality, abortions, and reduced body weights and food consumption. In the main study (22 inseminated female /group) oblimersen was administered at doses of 0, 0.6, 3, or 15 mg/kg/day by IV continuous infusion (2 mL/kg/h) from Days 7 through 19 of gestation. Maternal toxicity was observed at a lower dose of 3 mg/kg, evidenced by mortality, brown fur staining, aborted material, body weight loss, and reduced food consumption at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

high dose and decreased bodyweight and food consumption. At the highest dose tested, 15 mg/kg, fetal weight was reduced significantly, but malformations were not found. The maternal and developmental NOAEL doses were 0.6 mg/kg/day and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively.

## · Local tolerance

A local tolerance study investigating the irritant potential of oblimersen in its final formulation was performed  following  twice  daily  subcutaneous  injections  in  rabbits  for  7  consecutive  days.  All concentrations  produced  pathologil  evidence  of  local  irritation.  After  a  14-day  recovery  period, hemorrhagic and necrotic changes were still seen, but reparative changes were also seen. No specific study  has  been  performed  in  order  to  investigate  the  local  tolerance  of  oblimersen  following  IV administration, the clinical route of administration.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Studies on impurities

The impurity profile, and especially the level of N-1, N-2, N+1, N+2 mers and cyanoethyl impurities has  been  provided  for  all  batches  used  in  pivotal  studies  (repeat-dose,  genotoxicity  tests  and reproductive toxicity) for the assessment of their qualifications. The level of the impurities contained in oblimersen has been adequately tested in non-clinical studies.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Following the CHMP/SWP/4447/00  Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use naturally occurring substances such as vitamins, amino acids, peptides and proteins are deemed to have low environmental risk and are exempted from testing.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

The primary pharmacology has been studied in vitro and in vivo. It supports that oblimersen activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in the melanoma cell line A518A2 and that it could be efficacious in the  treatment of  melanoma. Correlation between oblimersen up-take, Bcl-2 protein down-regulation and antitumour responses have been shown, although additional therapeutically beneficial sequencedependent and sequence-independent non-antisense interactions cannot be excluded.

Regarding safety pharmacology the core battery of studies has not been completed as recommended in the  CPMP/ICH/539/00  Guideline  on  Safety  Pharmacology  Studies  for  Human  Pharmaceuticals. Moreover, in a pharmacokinetic study carried out in monkeys, an animal died following oblimersen administration as a rapid IV bolus. The mechanism leading to cardiovascular collapse and the potential risk in humans was requested to be discussed in more depth. In further safety pharmacology studies in monkeys  no  arrythmias  were  noted  and  relevant  data  was  provided  to  support  the  mechanism  of cardiovascular collapse observed. The lack of data on the effect of oblimersen on respiratory system has also been adequately justified.

Oblimersen has some immunostimulatory character. Although the manifestations seen in the toxicology and clinical studies are not of the severity or duration that would cause concern and occurred at dose levels above the clinical range.

Studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions with drugs that could be administered concomitantly with oblimersen are not considered essential based on the availability of pre-clinical and clinical data.

## Pharmacokinetics

Several concerns were raised regarding a possible post-treatment association of oblimersen with dacarbazine, the current main therapy available for advanced melanoma. Further information on the oblimersen interaction with dacarbazine or justification that the immediately administration of this drug is not going to influence upon oblimersen toxicity was requested. Additional data on T1/2 in monkeys showed that oblimersen is eliminated within 5-6 h after cessation of the administration, suggesting that dacarbazine interactions are not expected. Appropriate mention of the lack of studies in animals mimicking the post treatment association with dacarbazine in patients has been addressed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tissue distribution results  in the mouse are consistent with a large body of published data available and therefore, from a non-clinical point of view, the lack of distribution and excretion studies in rats, dogs and monkeys is solved and superseded by clinical data.

## Toxicity

The toxicity profile of Oblimersen was similar to the profile previously described with other antisense oligonucleotides: poor local tolerance, increased coagulation time, complement activation, hematotoxicity stimulation of the immune system, uptake of the test article in kidney and liver with subsequent  lesions.  However,  there  is  one  finding,  glomerulopathy,  that  has  not  been  reported  in previous  preclinical  toxicology  studies  and  that  has  not  been  reported  in  the  literature  on  antisense oligonucleotides.  Overall,  the  histopathology  findings  from  the  8-cycle  monkey  study  were  highly consistent  with  the  profile  of  other  anti-cancer  phosphorothioate  oligonucleotides  in  development, both in terms of the nature of the findings and the severity and dose-response for the various changes. A pharmacokinetic study carried out in male cynomolgus monkeys reported a death of 1 male monkey exposed to a single IV bolus doses of 7 mg/kg. Since there is a possibility of complement activation after an IV bolus administration, it was suggested a monitoring procedure to control accidental deaths. However, during the course of clinical trials, six patients accidentally received their full Oblimersen infusion over several hours instead of several days. As a result, concentrations were very high and in the same range as seen in the monkey bolus studies. In these overdose cases, neither cardiovascular collapse nor complement activations were documented and fever, malaise and renal impairment were readily  reversible.  Therefore  the  mild  hepatocellular  observed  in  the  liver  is  probably  related  to immunostimulation and not complement activation.

No  studies  of  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  have  been  performed.  Requirements  for fertility reproduction toxicity have been waived on the basis that oblimersen showed no evidence of genotoxicity in vitro or in vivo and that the targeted patient population with advanced (Stage III-IV) malignant melanoma have a life expectancy &lt; 18 months.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The applicant stated that all studies conducted in the Genasense clinical development program were performed in accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki as outlined in Directive 2001/20/EC

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics of oblimersen have been assessed in 3 primary studies (Studies GPK101 and GL208 Study GP202 Phase IIB) and in 7 supportive studies (Studies GM103, GB105, GP102, GP104, GP106, GL101, and GP202 Phase I).

The 3 primary studies assessed pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with:

- -advanced or metastatic Stage IV melanoma who received oblimersen 7 mg/kg/day by 7-day continuous IV infusion and DTIC at 1000 mg/m2 administered as a 1-hour IV infusion 120 hours after the start of the oblimersen infusion ( Study GPK101 ),
- -hormone-refractory prostate cancer who received oblimersen 7 mg/kg/day by 5-day continuous IV infusion and 75 mg/m2 docetaxel as a 60-minute IV infusion on Day 4 of the oblimersen infusion ( Study GP202 Phase IIB ),
- -advanced  Chronic  Lymphocytic  Leukemia  who  received  oblimersen  3.0,  4.0,  5.0,  or  7.0 mg/kg/day  as  a  5-day    (Cycle  1)  or  7-day  (cycles  subsequent  to  Cycle  1)  continuous  IV infusion (Study GL208) .

Based on a single subject

## · Absorption

## Not applicable

## · Distribution

Study GPK101 reported a mean volume of distribution (Vz)  as 0.281 L/kg. Study DMPK/USA/20040107 investigated by ultrafiltration the extent of binding to human plasma from healthy volunteers. Samples  were  analyzed  using  a  validated  capillary  gel  electrophoresis  method  with  ultraviolet detection (CGE/UV). Oblimersen was found to be highly protein bound in human plasma (99.60 ± 0.31%).

## · Elimination

## Metabolism

In  Vitro  t he  metabolism  of  phosphorothioate  oligonucleotides  occurs  by  sequential  removal  of nucleotide bases to form N-1, N-2, etc., metabolites in plasma and/or tissues by cleavage of single residues from the 3. terminus alone or both the 3' and 5' termini.

An in  vitro  metabolism  study  showed  that,  consistent  with  its  class,  the  metabolism  of  oblimersen primarily results in removal of bases in a sequential manner, resulting in formation of N- 1 (17-mer) and N-2 (16-mer) metabolites.

## Excretion

Only 8 of 24 subjects had sufficient measurable postinfusion samples to estimate clearance and elimination half-life.

Mean plasma CL for an average (70 kg) individual was estimated to be 6.1 L/h and the mean renal clearance  was estimated to be 0.058 L/h.

The mean half-lives (t1/2) of the N-1 metabolite (2.3 hours) and oblimersen (2.4 hours) were similar.

Plasma  concentrations  for  oblimersen  and  the  N-1  metabolite  reached  a  plateau  at  10  hours  and remained at this plateau through  the 144-hour time point.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Pharmacokinetic analyses from the 3 primary studies (Studies GPK 101, GL208, and GP202 Phase IIB)  showed  that  steady-state  plasma  concentration  (Css)  and  area  under  the  concentration  curve (AUC)  of  oblimersen  and  its  N-  1  and  N-2  metabolites  increased  with  increasing  doses  of OBLIMERSEN. Examination of dose proportionality exposure was assessed in 61 subjects in 2 of the primary  pharmacokinetic  studies  (Studies  GPK101  and  GL208).  Across  the  range  of  doses  studied (3.1 to 7 mg/kg/day), correlation steady-state plasma concentration to daily dose was consistent with linear pharmacokinetic behaviour.

Based  on  ratios  of  mean  Css,  the  exposure  of  subjects  to  the  N-1  and  N-2  metabolites  was approximately 45% and 19%, respectively, of the exposure to oblimersen. Plasma concentrations of oblimersen,  N-1,  and  N-2  reached  steady  state  by  10  hours  after  the  start  of  the  infusion  in  most subjects and remained at this plateau generally through the 144-hour time point.

## · Special populations

No specific studies have been conducted to assess the effects of intrinsic factors (gender, age, ethnicity) on oblimersen pharmacokinetics

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Three  in  vitro  studies  investigated  oblimersen  effect  for  inhibition  of  CYP450  isozymes  in  human liver microsomes. The CYP isozymes studied were CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Results showed no significant inhibition by oblimersen, with the possible exception of inhibition of CYP1A2. Inhibition of CYP1A2 was best described by a non-competitive inhibition model and not in metabolism-dependent fashion; the Ki for CYP1A2 was determined to be 6.0 µM. Since the Css of oblimersen in humans following a continuous IV infusion of  7  mg/kg/day is 3.154 µg/mL [0.56 µM) (Study GPK101), the ratio of Css to Ki for CYP1A2 is approximately 0.09.

In cultured human hepatocytes (Study XT043025), oblimersen at concentrations up to 57 µM did not induce any of the CYP450 isozymes tested, whereas most prototypical inducers cause a greater than two fold increase in CYP activity.

Based on findings from in vitro drug-drug interaction studies, the Applicant has not performed human drug-drug interaction studies.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

The primary function of oblimersen is to inactivate, by an antisense mechanism, the bcl-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) that directs the synthesis of Bcl-2 protein. Reduced levels of Bcl-2 can make cells more vulnerable to apoptotic mechanisms programmed into the cell or stimulated by the actions of cytotoxic anticancer drugs. In melanoma cells, , elevated Bcl-2 expression is found in up to 90% of cases and high  Bcl-2  expression  has  been  associated  with  shorter  survival  and  resistance  to  chemotherapy  in melanoma as well as in other cancers [Cerroni et al 1995; Iervolino et al 2002; Selzer et al 1998].

Oblimersense is a synthetic, 18-base, single-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that selectively targets the first 6 codons (ie, 18 bases) of bcl-2 mRNA. Formation of the mRNA/antisense duplex recruits an endonuclease (RNase H) that breaks down the bcl-2 mRNA strand, eliminating its ability to generate Bcl-2 protein. Due to its resistance to RNase H cleavage, the antisense strand is released from the mRNA, allowing the drug to bind again and induce cleavage of additional bcl-2 mRNA molecules. The destruction of the bcl-2 mRNA pool results in the selective reduction of Bcl-2 protein levels.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No specific pharmacodynamic study of oblimersen in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma was conducted.

## · Relationship between plasma concentration and effect (PK/PD)

The Applicant submitted two studies in order to confirm the relationship between plasma concentrations and effect.

The first  one  studied  oblimersen  PK/PD and clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute  myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving oblimersen (4 or 7 mg/kg/day) as a 9-day continuous IV infusion, with fludarabine, cytarabine, and G-CSF (FLAG) salvage chemotherapy starting on Day 6 of the infusion [Marcucci et al 2003]. Plasma PK were determined for 11 patients who received a total of 12 courses of oblimersen 4 mg/kg/day and 6 patients who received a total of 7 courses of oblimersen 7 mg/kg/day.

Relative differences in pretreatment and Day 5 (prior to initiation of salvage chemotherapy) levels of bcl-2 transcripts in AML cells from bone marrow aspirates were measured in 12 patients. Of these, 9 showed  down-regulation  (range,  6.5%  to  75.7%  decrease  in  Bcl-2  transcripts)  and  3  showed  upregulation (21.8% to 38.4) of bcl-2 mRNA, as assessed by RT-PCR. In 5 of the 12 patients, there was a  concordance  in  4  of  5  serial  samples  between  changes  in  bcl-2  mRNA  and  Bcl-2  protein  levels following administration of oblimersen.

Following the  development  of  a  validated,  highly  sensitive  (limit  of  quantification  [LOQ]:  50  pM) enzyme-linked  immunoassay  (ELISA)  method  for  assessment  of  oblimersen  in  various  biologic matrices, including plasma and bone marrow mononuclear cells, retained samples from this trial were analyzed to probe drug uptake in vivo [Dai et al  2005]. Paired bone marrow samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells for determination of intracellular oblimersen concentrations and bcl-2 mRNA were available from 8 patients, 5 treated with oblimersen 4 mg/kg/day and 3 treated with oblimersen 7 mg/kg/day. Results showed a significant cellular uptake of oblimersen in mononuclear cells from both blood  (0.47  to  19.4  pmol/mg  protein)  and  bone  marrow  (3.4  to  40.6  pmol/mg  protein)  in  samples collected following 72 and 120 hours of oblimersen exposure. Four of 6 patients who had intracellular drug concentrations over 5 pmol/mg protein showed downregulation of bcl-2 mRNA in bone marrow.

The  second  study  assessed  the  relationship  between  clinical  response,  plasma  and  intracellular oblimersen  concentrations,  and  changes  in  bcl-2  mRNA  and  protein  levels  in  bone  marrow mononuclear cells in 29 elderly subjects receiving oblimersen in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia [Marcucci et al 2005]. Bone marrow and plasma samples collected before induction treatment and after 72 hours of oblimersen infusion prior to initiation of chemotherapy were analyzed for plasma and intracellular oblimersen concentrations.

After 72-hour oblimersen infusion, Bcl-2/ABL mRNA copies were decreased compared with baseline (P = .03) in CR patients and increased in non-responders (NRs; P = .05). Changes in Bcl-2 protein showed a similar trend. Although plasma pharmacokinetics did not correlate with disease response, the median intracellular concentration of the antisense was higher in the CR patients compared with NRs (17.0 v 4.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively; P = .05).

## Clinical efficacy

Among  18  completed  clinical  studies  in  the  Genasense  clinical  development  program  2  studies provide efficacy data in the sought indication, advanced melanoma:

## · Dose response study

A  biologic  threshold  of  'total'  oblimersen  plasma  concentrations  of  1  µg/mL  has  been  postulated based on the results of the early-development clinical studies. Dose-limiting toxicity of thrombocytopenia was noted at 12 mg/kg/day administered for 5 days in Study GM103 and the MTD was 9 mg/kg/day administered for 5 days. It was anticipated that doses close to the MTD and well above the minimum effective dose would allow for greater depletion of Bcl-2 protein levels and thus enhance the chemosensitization response. Thus, a oblimersen dose of 7 mg/kg/day was selected.

The short plasma half life of total oblimersen and the relatively long half life of Bcl-2 protein in tumor cells form the basis for a continuous IV infusion as a rational method to deliver oblimersen. Depletion of Bcl-2 protein levels after 14 days of oblimersen infusion was not superior to that observed on Day 5.  This  suggested  that  these  relatively  shorter  infusions  of  oblimersen  might  be  equally  effective  at decreasing Bcl-2 protein levels and sensitizing cancer cells to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, administration of oblimersen by continuous IV infusion for 5 days was selected.

A oblimersen dose of 7 mg/kg/day for 5 days by continuous IV infusion appears to be well tolerated when administered in 21-day cycles. This dosing interval was selected based on the standard interval for administration of DTIC (every 21 days) in clinical practice.

## · Main study

The efficacy evaluation is based on study GM301, an open-label, active controlled, randomized, multicenter, phase III study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Key inclusion criteria included histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma, progressive local disease that was not surgically resectable or metastatic Stage IV disease measurable disease, ECOG status of 0-2 and adequate hematopoietic, renal and hepatic functions. Prior therapy (other than cyitotoxics) was allowed provided at least 4 weeks had elapsed prior to study entry. Patients were excluded in case of primary ocular or mucosal melanoma.

## Treatments

All  subjects  were  treated  in  21-day  cycles.  They  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  one  of  the following treatments:

- DTIC 1000 mg/m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Day 1 (Arm A), or
-  Oblimersen 7.0 mg/kg/day administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days and DTIC
- 1000 mg/m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes immediately upon completion of the oblimersen infusion (Arm B)

## Objectives/outcomes/endpoints

The primary objective was to compare survival in subjects with advanced malignant melanoma treated with DTIC alone versus survival of subjects treated with oblimersen plus DTIC.

The secondary objectives were to compare safety, progression- free survival, response rate, durable response rate, patient weight, performance status and tumour-related symptoms between the 2 treatment arms.

## Sample size

Based on the assumptions that, median survival time for subjects treated with DTIC would be 6 months, compared with a median survival time of 8 months for subjects treated with oblimersen plus DTIC, 750 subjects (375 subjects per treatment group), followed until 508 events occurred would provide a power of 90% to detect a significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the survival distribution at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomised to one of 6 strata which were defined by the following 3 criteria:

- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status: 0 versus 1 or 2
- -Disease  distribution  and  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  level :  Skin,  subcutaneous tissue, and/or lymph  node  metastases  without  visceral  metastases  and  normal  LDH  level  versus  any  visceral metastases or elevated LDH. Elevated LDH was defined as a value ≥ 10% greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) without other known medical causes unrelated to metastatic melanoma.
- -Liver metastases : Absent versus present

## Blinding (masking)

The study was open-label.

## Statistical methods

For the primary analysis survival distributions for the 2 treatment arms would be compared by using a 2-sided log-rank test for long term effect or Gehan-Wilcoxon test for short term differences. The logrank test at the 0.05 level of significance will be the primary analysis of the survival distribution in the ITT  population.  The  survival  distributions  will  be  described  graphically  by  presenting  the  KaplanMeier survival curves for all patients, and for each stratum. The survival distribution would be further compared between the two treatment groups by Cox Proportional Hazards Model.

## RESULTS

## Recruitment

A total of 771 subjects were randomized: 386 in Genasense plus DTIC group, and 385 in DTIC group.

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol dated 06 Jun 2000. The protocol was subsequently amended 4 times. The main amendments were two consecutive increase of sample size (amendment 2 and 3), and the anticipated survival time for subjects treated with Genasense plus DTIC changed from 9 to 8 months.

Follow-  up  of  subjects  was  extended  from  2  to  3  years  from  the  date  of  randomization  through protocol amendment No. 5 (dated 17 May 2004).

## Baseline data

Overall the distribution of subjects by age and race were similar between the treatment groups. More patients in the DTIC arm were male (65.7%) in comparison with the tested arm, Genasense+DTIC (61.1%).

Cancer history and disease characteristics at baseline by treatment group are presented in the table below:

## Prior treatment

With  respect  to  prior  treatment  for  melanoma,  subjects  were  required  to  be  chemotherapy-naive  to participate;  thus,  previous  cancer  treatments  included  only  surgery,  radiation,  immunotherapy,  and cytokine therapy. The percentage of subjects who had received previous cancer treatment by type of treatment was similar in the 2 treatment groups (see Table 13).

## Numbers analysed

A  total  of  159  study  sites  were  initiated;  771  subjects  were  randomised  at  139  study  sites  in  9 countries (oblimersen plus DTIC group, 386 [50.0%] subjects; DTIC group, 385 [50.0%] subjects). The majority of subjects were treated in the US (55.8 %).

Outcomes and estimation

## 6-month analysis

Accordingly to thee SAP, 508 events were necessary to provide a power of 90% to detect a significant difference  between  the  2  treatment  groups  in  the  survival  distribution.  Accordingly,  at  6-month minimum follow-up 535 events were reported.

In the Intent-to-Treat Population, 68.9% (266 of 386) of subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 69.9% (269 of 385) of subjects in the DTIC group had died.

The median survival time was 9.0 months in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 7.8 months in the DTIC group (hazard ratio = 0.89; log-rank test, p = 0.18).

## 24-month analysis

## LDH population efficacy analyses

The Normal LDH Population included 508 subjects (Genasense + DTIC group, N = 261; DTIC group, N = 247) which corresponds to about 60% of the ITT population (n=771). For the Abnormal LDH Population,  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  indicated  no  difference  between  treatment  groups.In  the normal LDH subgroup within the ITT Population at 24-month minimum follow-up, 76.2% (199/261) of subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 82.6% (204/247) of subjects in the DTIC group had died. The mean survival time was 11.4 months in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 9.7 months in the DTIC group (HR=0.79; 95 % CI 0.65-0.96; log-rank test, p=0.018).

Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints were all statistically significant in favour of the Genasense + DTIC group. See table below

- Study GM103

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  GM103  was  a  single-center,  open-label,  2-part,  Phase  I/II  study  in  which  subjects  with metastatic melanoma received 1 of the following 3 regimens:

Regimen A: Oblimersen 0.6 to 6.5 mg/kg/day by continuous IV infusion on Days 1 to 14 of each 28day cycle and DTIC 200 mg/m2 IV once daily on Days 5 to 9

Regimen B: Oblimersen 5.3 to 7.7 mg/kg/day as twice daily subcutaneous (SC) injections on Days 1 to 7 of each 28-day cycle and DTIC 800 mg/m2 IV as a single dose on Day 5

Regimen C: Oblimersen 5 to 12 mg/kg/day by continuous IV infusion on Days 1 to 5 of each 21-day cycle and DTIC 1g/m2 IV as a single dose on Day 6

The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  IV  and  SC  oblimersen, define  the  MTD  and  optimal  biological  dose  of  oblimersen  based  on  tolerability  and  biochemical response  criteria  (oblimersen-induced  Bcl-2  depletion  as  measured  by  immunohistochemistry  in evaluable  indicator  lesions),  to  define  the  plasma  concentrations  of  oblimersen  administered  by continuous  IV  infusion  in  a  subset  of  subjects  and  to  assess  the  clinical  response/efficacy  of oblimersen/DTIC in subjects with refractory or recurrent advanced melanoma during dose escalation A total of 33 subjects with Stage IV melanoma were enrolled in the study.

## Results

Total Css increased with dose escalation. CL appeared to be independent of dose for both routes of administration, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of oblimersen may be linear. There appeared to be no effect of DTIC coadministration on oblimersen pharmacokinetics.

In combination with a standard therapy (DTIC 800 and 1000 mg/m2), IV and SC doses of oblimersen ranging from 0.6 to 9 mg/kg/day were well-tolerated. The MTD was 9 mg/kg/day given as a 5-day continuous IV infusion. Antitumour effects were detected with doses as low as 4.1 mg/kg/day, but the only complete and partial responses were associated with doses of 6.5 mg/kg/day or higher.

In our view, the value of this study, in terms of clinical relevance, is questionable. No a valid rationale for the recommended dose of Genasense has been provided, since

The pharmacokinetic results should be interpreted with caution since sample size in each evaluated group was too small to draw reliable conclusions. Also, the analysis of samples was performed at 3 different  laboratories,  and  there  is  no  information  indicating  if  a  cross-validation  was  performed  to assess the similarities of the analytical methods.

Due  to  the  study  design,  the  demonstration  of  clinical  efficacy  was  not  possible,  and  no  formal statistical analyses were planned in the original protocol.

In summary, it is unclear for the assessor whether the design of this study is appropriate for providing useful information to be applied in clinical practice.

## · Study GM214

This  was  a  multicenter,  open-label,  non  comparative  study  in  subjects  with  advanced  malignant melanoma  that  responsed  or  had  a  stabilisation  of  the  disease  after  treatment  with  oblimersen  and DTIC  (Arm  B)  during  Protocol  GM301.  Subjects  who  received  DTIC  alone  (Arm  A)  in  Protocol GM301 were not eligible to participate in Protocol GM214.

All  subjects  were  treated  in  21-day  cycles.  Treatment  was  administered  as  received  in  study  301. Subjects  were  to  be  followed  for  up  to  2  years  from  the  Protocol  GM301  randomisation  date  after ending treatment in Protocol GM214. These subjects were also required to be followed in Protocol GM301 for up to 2 years from the date of randomization in that study. Accordingly, Protocol GM214 was  terminated  when  all  subjects  had  ended  treatment  and  had  been  followed  for  at  least  30  days following the last dose of study medication. Subjects who had not completed the 2-year follow-up in Protocol GM214 continued to be followed in Protocol GM301.

A total of 13 (31.0%) subjects completed the full 8 cycles in Protocol GM214 for a total of 16 cycles, including  the  8  cycles  received  in  Protocol  GM301.  One  subject  received  a  total  of  22  cycles  of therapy  across  Protocols  GM301  and  GM214.  Notably,  administration  of  the  protocol  specified therapy was maintained during long-term treatment. Although reductions in the dose of oblimersen were not allowed, adjustments of the DTIC dose were permitted if toxicity was observed. The dose of DTIC was reduced for only 3 (7.1%) subjects due to 1 or more adverse events. The median cumulative (total) dose of oblimersen administered across Protocols GM301 and GM214 was 475.8 mg/kg, and the total number of cycles administered across the 2 protocols ranged from 8 to 22.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since patients in this study were being followed in study 301, safety and efficacy results are included within study 301.

## GM214 was a continuation  Protocol  for  GENASENSE  (Bcl-2  Antisense  Oligonucleotide)  and Dacarbazine  in  Patients  with  Malignant  Melanoma  Who  Responded  to  This  Combination  in Protocol GM301

No efficacy  assessments  were  conducted  .The  only  analysis  population  was  the  Safety  Population, which was defined as all subjects who received any protocol therapy.

A total of 42 patients were enrolled: 34 (81.0%) subjects began treatment in Protocol GM214 after completing 8 cycles of therapy in Protocol GM301, as specified by protocol. Among the 8 subjects remaining, 4 subjects began treatment prior to completing 8 cycles in Protocol GM301 and 4 began treatment after completing more than 8 cycles in Protocol GM301.

All  subjects  were  treated  in  21-day  cycles  for  up  to  8  cycles.  As  administered  in  Protocol  GM301, subjects in Protocol GM214 were administered oblimersen 7.0 mg/kg/day by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days and DTIC 1000 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes immediately upon completion of the

Genasense infusion. Treatment in Protocol GM214 was to be started within 6 weeks of Day 1 of Cycle 8  in  Protocol  GM301.  Subjects  continued  on  protocol  therapy  until  one  of  the  withdrawal  criteria listed in Section 9.3.3 of the clinical study report was met or until they completed 8 cycles of protocol therapy.

A  total  of  29  (69.0%)  subjects  discontinued  protocol  therapy  early.  The  most  frequently  reported reason for this discontinuation was disease progression or relapse, which was reported for 21 (50.0%) subjects. The largest number of subjects who discontinued protocol therapy early withdrew in Cycle 2. A median of 6 cycles were completed.

The adverse events reported were consistent with those reported in Protocol GM301, and the number of  subjects  who  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events  was  low  (3  [7.1%]  subjects).  The  incidence  of clinically  meaningful  changes  in  laboratory  findings  was  low  and  limited  primarily  to  leukopenia, neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  Notably,  these  laboratory  changes  were  not  associated  with infection or bleeding-related events.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The demonstration of efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma was presented in a single, controlled pivotal study in the present application.

The study protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) were modified in several occasions, including a noteworthy  increase  in  sample  size  (from  270  to  450  and  then  to  750  patients),  redefinition  of endpoints  etc.  A  survival  benefit  was  not  evidenced  for  the  primary  analysis  (p=  0.18,  HR=  0.89, median time to survival 9 versus 7.8 months for oblimersen + DTIC and DTIC respectively).

Secondary endpoints (PFS, RR) with a 24-month follow up showed statistically significant differences in  favour  of  the  oblimersen  +  DTIC  arm  (a  difference  of  29  days  for  PFS,  78  versus  49  days,  p  = 0.0007, and RR of 13% versus 7.5% p= 0.07). The reliability of these findings was questioned due to the  open-label  of  the  study  (these  endpoints  relied  on  investigator's  measurements  and  no  blinded review of the data was performed). There were also multiplicity concerns claimed.

The applicant  also  declared  that  results  for  a  post-hoc  defined  group  of  patients  with  normal  LDH (LDH was partially controlled through stratification) showed statistically significant results across all study  endpoints.  Secondary  endpoints  cannot  be  considered  fully  reliable  due  to  the  possibility  of investigator bias, symmetry of assessments between study arms could not be guaranteed, multiplicity concerns and the possibility of data driven analyses.

## Clinical safety

The safety profile assessment of Genasense plus DTIC was based on study GM301 and the Clinical Safety Summary submitted by the applicant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Patient exposure

As of the cut-off date established for this application (01 Jul 2005), the safety of oblimersen has been evaluated in more than 1000 subjects who have received oblimersen only or oblimersen in combination with chemotherapy in completed and ongoing clinical studies.

## · Adverse events

Most  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  at  least  one  treatment  emergent  adverse  event:  365 subjects (98.4%) in the Genasense plus DTIC group versus 342 subjects (95%) in the DTIC group. The  majority  of  these  events  were  Grade  1  or  Grade  2.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  at  least  1 treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE)  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study treatment  was  greater  in  the  Genasense  plus  DTIC  group  (347  [93.5%]  subjects)  than  in  the  DTIC group (287 [79.7%] subjects).

Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were most often reported for the following system-organ classes :  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions (86.3%  versus  67.8%);  gastrointestinal disorders (79.2%  versus  71.4%);  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (46.1%  versus  31.4%); nervous  system  disorders   (46.1  versus  32.2%);  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders   (42%  versus 24.4%);  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissues  disorders   (39.6%  versus  27.2%);  and  respiratory disorders (36.4% versus 30.3%). The percentage of TEAE was always greater in the oblimersen plus DTIC group than in the DTIC group.

Pyrexia,  fatigue,  headache,  rigors,  myalgia  and  arthralgia  were  consistent  with  flu-like  symptoms previously reported with Genasense alone.

Pyrexia was the most frequently reported TEAE in the Genasense plus DTIC group. A total of 152 patients  (41%)  had  fever  during  the  cycle  1  and  approximately  25%  of  subjects  had  fever  in  the subsequent cycles. Fever occurred most frequently during the first three days of the treatment cycle.

A total of 249 subjects (67.1%) in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 154 patients (42.8%) in the DTIC group had at least 1 grade 3-4 TEAE. Neutropenia was the most frequently reported grade 4 adverse event in the both treatment groups (10.5% in the Genasense plus DTIC group versus 4.2% in the DTIC group). The use of G-CSF was increased in the Genasense plus DTIC group (16.4%) versus the DTIC group (7.8%).

Catheter-related complications (ie, central and peripheral catheters) were reported as treatmentemergent adverse events in 43 (11.6%) subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 5 (1.4%) subjects in the DTIC group .

Among subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group, those patients who were ≥ 65 years had a greater incidence of the following TEAE than subjects who were &lt; 65 years: anorexia, thrombocytopenia and weakness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of population was male in the both groups: 60.6% in the Genasense plus DTIC group versus 62.2% in the DTIC group.  Female patients who received Genasense plus DTIC had a ≥ 10% greater incidence of the following TEAE than male subjects: neutropenia and anemia.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

A total of 149 subjects (40.2%) in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 97 subjects (26.9%) in the DTIC group had at least  1  serious  treatment  emergent  adverse  event.  In  the  Genasense  plus  DTIC group,  the  most  frequently  reported  serious  TEAE  included  pyrexia,  thrombocytopenia,  nausea, vomiting, pulmonary embolism and injection site infection. Serious treatment related adverse events were more frequent in the GENASENSE plus DTIC group, including pyrexia and thrombocytopenia.

Deep venous  thrombotic  events  were  reported  for  27  subjetcs  (7.3%)  in  the  Genasense  plus  DTIC group versus 7 subjects (1.9%) in the DTIC group. These events were serious in 16 subjects (4.3%) in the GENASENSE plus DTIC group versus 4 subjects (1.1%) in the DTIC group.

Pulmonary embolism was reported for 11 subjects (3%) in the Genasense plus DTIC group versus 3 patients  (0.8%)  in  the  DTIC  group.  In  the  Genasense  plus  DTIC  group,  two  cases  of  pulmonary embolism had fatal outcome. The first patient had pelvic, abdominal and pulmonary metastases. The second patient had massive oedema of lower extremity in a context of serious sepsis.

The incidence of grade 3-4 bleeding events was greater in the DTIC (3%) group than in the Genasense plus DTIC group (2.1%). One case had fatal outcome in the Genasense plus DTIC group versus five in the DTIC group.

Grade 3 and Grade 4 or serious cardiac events were reported at a relatively equal incidence in both groups (Grade 3/4, 3.8% of subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 2.8% of subjects in the DTIC group; serious, 3.8% of subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 3.3% subjects in the DTIC group).

Serious infections  were  reported  in  38  (10.2%)  subjects  in  the  Genasense  plus  DTIC  group  and  12 (3.3%) subjects in the DTIC group. The most frequent serious infections in the Genasense plus DTIC group were injection site infection (10 [2.7%] subjects), pneumonia (7 [1.9%] subjects), bacteremia (6 [1.6%] subjects), sepsis NOS (6 [1.6%] subjects), cellulitis (5 [1.3%] subjects), and neutropenic sepsis (2 [0.5%] subjects).

In the Genasense plus DTIC group, 29 patients (7.8%) died during treatment due to an adverse event. The most frequent fatal adverse events in this group were disease progression (14 events), cardiac or cardiorespiratory  arrest  (6  events),  sepsis  or  pneumonia  (3  subjects),  hepatic  failure  (2  events), multiorgan failure (2 events) and pulmonary embolism (2 events).

Three subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group had a fatal adverse event related to study drug.

## · Laboratory findings

Postbaseline shift in hematology parameters to grade 3 or 4 by parameter and treatment group

|                | GENASENSE plus DTIC N = 371   | DTIC N = 360   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Hemoglobin     | 16 (4.3%)                     | 16 (4.4%)      |
| WBC count      | 73 (19.7%)                    | 35 (9.7%)      |
| Neutrophiles   | 104 (28%)                     | 50 (13.9%)     |
| Lymphocytes    | 62 (16.7%)                    | 25 (6.9%)      |
| Platelet count | 69 (18.6%)                    | 26 (7.2%)      |

Postbaseline shifts to a worse grade in hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet count were more frequently observed in the Genasense plus DTIC group than in the DTIC group as shown in the table above.

There were no shifts to Grade 4 in coagulation parameters in either treatment group. Shifts to Grade 3 values in coagulation parameters were more frequent for subjects receiving Genasense plus DTIC than for those receiving DTIC. Concomitant antithrombotic treatment clearly was a factor in the occurrence of shifts in coagulation parameters in both treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  majority  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  normal  values  for  alkaline  phosphate, AST/SGOT, and bilirubin at baseline.

Overall, treatment with Genasense plus DTIC increased the frequency of abnormal shifts in all liver function parameters except bilirubin. Importantly, this effect appeared to diminish through the course of treatment so that the majority of subjects with abnormal values had values that returned to normal or near normal by the end of the study.

The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had normal serum creatinine and BUN values at baseline.

A greater number of subjects in the Genasense plus DTIC group experienced clinically meaningful shifts toward hypophosphatemia during protocol therapy (33.2% versus 11.2%). The majority of subjects in the group who had shifts to Grade 3 had recovered by the end of treatment. The results for other serum chemistry parameters did not indicate any meaningful differences between treatment groups.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal analyses of drug-drug or drug-disease interactions have been conducted.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total of 69 subjects (18.6%) in the Genasense plus DTIC group and 39 subjects (10.8%) in the DTIC group  discontinued  protocol  therapy  due  to  TEAE.  These  adverse  events  were  most  frequently reported for the general disorders and administration site conditions class.

## · Post marketing experience

## Not applicable

- Discussion on clinical safety

The percentages of adverse events observed in the Genasense group were sometimes as far as 3 times higher than in the DTIC group. The rate of AE in the oblimersen group was twice that reported to the control arm. Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 67.1% of subjects in the oblimersen plus DTIC group and 42.8% of subjects in the DTIC only group.

Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, is more frequent in the combination arm. Moreover, infections as AE with Grade 3 or Grade 4 occurred in 42 (11.3%) subjects in the oblimersen plus DTIC group and 13 (3.6%) subjects in the DTIC group.

Serious treatment-related AEs were reported in 37.1% of subjects receiving oblimersen plus DTIC and 26.9% of subjects receiving DTIC only. An increased incidence and severity of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia when oblimersen was added to DTIC was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall the toxicity of Genasense in combination with DTIC in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is extensively higher than the toxicity observed with the approved therapy for this pathology in terms of both frequency and severity of AEs and laboratory parameters alterations.

Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way and there are no unresolved quality issues which might have negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Non-clinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies support that oblimersen activates the intrinsic pathway  of  apoptosis  in  the  melanoma  cell  line  A518A2  and  that  it  could  be  efficacious  in  the treatment of melanoma.

The  non-clinical  toxicology  programme  of  oblimersen  showed  a  poor  local  tolerance,  increased coagulation time, hematotoxicity, stimulation of the immune system and uptake of the test article in kidney and liver with subsequent lesions.

## Efficacy

A  single,  open  label,  controlled  pivotal  study  was  presented  as  proof  of  efficacy  in  the  present application, with overall survival as the primary endpoint.

The  study  protocol  and  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  were  modified  in  several  occasions, including  a  noteworthy  increase  in  sample  size  (from  270  to  450  and  then  to  750  patients)  and redefinition of secondary endpoints. A Survival benefit was not evidenced for the primary analysis (p= 0.18, Hazard Ratio= 0.89, median time to survival 9 versus 7.8 months for oblimersen + dacarbazine (DTIC) and DTIC respectively).

Secondary endpoints (Progression Free Survival (PFS), Response Rate (RR)) with a 24-month follow up showed statistically significant differences in favour of the oblimersen + DTIC arm (a difference of 29 days for PFS, 78 versus 49 days, p = 0.0007, and RR of 13% versus 7.5% p= 0.07). Results for a post-hoc  defined  group  of  patients  with  normal  Lactic  deshydrogenase  (LDH)  (LDH  was  partially controlled through stratification) showed statistically significant results across all study endpoints but it was considered hypothesis generating.

However, the reliability of these findings was questioned due to the open-label of the study (these endpoints  relied  on  investigator's  measurements  and  no  blind  review  of  the  data  was  performed), potential  issues  with  the  symmetry  of  assessments  between  treatment  groups  and  concerns  on  the control of alpha error spending due to multiplicity.

## Safety

The toxicity of oblimersen in combination with DTIC in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is higher than the toxicity observed with the approved therapy for this pathology in terms of both frequency and severity of adverse events and laboratory parameters alterations. more frequent in the combination arm. Moreover, infections as adverse event with Grade 3 or Grade 4

The rate of adverse events in the oblimersen group was twice that reported to the control arm, being the frequency for some adverse events as far as 3 times higher than in the DTIC group. Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 67.1% of subjects in the oblimersen plus DTIC group and 42.8% of subjects in the DTIC only group. Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, is occurred in 42 (11.3%) subjects in the oblimersen plus DTIC group and 13 (3.6%) subjects in the DTIC group.

Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 37.1% of subjects receiving oblimersen plus DTIC and 26.9% of subjects receiving DTIC only. An increased incidence and severity of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia when oblimersen was added to DTIC was observed.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The  toxocity  of  Genasense  in  combination  with  DTIC  in  the  treatment  of  metastatic  melanoma  is higher  than  the  toxicity  observed  with  the  approved  therapy  for  this  pathology  in  terms  of  both frequency and severity of AEs and laboratory parameters alterations.

No survival benefit has been demonstrated and due to multiplicity concerns and the fact that the main study  has  been  open-label,  results  from  secondary  endpoints  or  post-hoc  subgroups  cannot  be considered reliable and might not reflect true findings.

Taking into account all methodological deliberations uncertain findings of this magnitude (median improvement of PFS of 24-29 days or 5% for ORR) does not outweigh the impaired safety profile of a burdensome therapy (i.v. continuous administration for 5 days). Therefore the benefit-risk ratio is considered negative.

In conclusion, the CHMP the concluded that benefit-risk ratio is considered negative based on the following grounds:

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Genasense  in  combination  with  dacarbazine  for  the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

- No statistical significant difference in the primary analysis of Overall Survival has been observed (p = 0.18). The observed median overall survival was 9 versus 7.8 months for oblimersen + DTIC and DTIC respectively, and the hazard ratio was 0.89;
- The reliability of the results of the secondary endpoints is questioned due to the open label nature of the study and multiplicity issues. Additional subgroup analyses on Overall Survival can only be considered as hypothesis generating;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Genasense therapy was associated with a relevant increase of adverse events, which is felt to outweigh the uncertain benefits;
- Taking into consideration that efficacy has not been established and the significant toxicity associated with Genasense treatment, the benefit / risk balance is negative;

## 3 RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION OF 26 APRIL 2007

Following the CHMP conclusion that the risk-benefit balance of Genasense in combination with dacarbazine for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma was unfavorable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal. The applicant presented a number of arguments including:

- -Advanced melanoma has unique characteristics that should be considered when interpreting the data from Study GM301, especially as related to progression-free survival (PFS).
- -All data should be considered as relevant.
- -LDH is an important factor for data interpretation and disease management.
- -The safety profile of Genasense is both predictable and manageable, and exhibits a positive benefit/risk ratio given the nature of the disease.

Concerning the CHMP ground for refusal that no statistical significant difference in the primary analysis of overall survival has been observed, the applicant argued that the CHMP negative opinion is primarily based on the analyses of data from the pivotal study with very limited follow up information (e.g. 6-month minimum follow up). The applicant argued that the more mature data, with the full 24month minimum follow up provided, should be considered. The applicant claimed that efficacy had been demonstrated, among others, by the consistent results and clear trend toward statistical significance for overall survival at 24 months minimum follow-up (p = 0.077). The applicant also argued that approximately 50% of study patients could not complete more than two cycles of treatment and that the results are 'diluted' by patients who had insufficient treatment and who discontinued early because of rapid progression of disease.

Concerning the reliability of the results of the secondary endpoints that has been questioned by the CHMP, the applicant argued that in an open-label study, investigator bias is always a concern. They indicated that the protocol was specifically designed with symmetrical assessments on both study arms, and that unscheduled assessments represent the natural history of the disease. They also claimed that sensitivity analyses confirmed the findings to be robust, that the results were consistent across the different endpoints and that improvement in PFS was associated with a clinically meaningful prolongation of survival. Moreover, the applicant argued that known baseline prognostic factors such as LDH should be considered with respect to treatment outcome.

Lastly,  concerning  the  adverse  events,  which  the  CHMP  has  felt  to  outweigh  the  benefits,  the applicant claimed that the adverse event profile of Genasense is predictable and manageable, that the toxicity  is  generally  reversible  and  that  the  safety  profile  of  the  Genasense/DTIC  combination compares favourably with other drugs used in the treatment of advanced melanoma.

Following a request by the applicant, the CHMP consulted the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) for Oncology  about  the  grounds  for  refusal  for  the  re-examination  procedure  of  Genasense.  The  SAG considered that a clinically and statistically significant difference in overall survival would in principle be  required  to  establish  efficacy  in  this  setting.  The  SAG  agreed  that  no  statistical  significant difference  has  been  proven  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  overall  survival  although  it  was  agreed  that consistency  of  the  results  of  the  6  months  and  24  months  analysis  was  of  interest.  The  claims  of efficacy presented by the applicant are based on non-statistically significant findings or on exploratory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyses  that  are  difficult  to  interpret.  The  exploratory  analyses  presented  (secondary  endpoints, subgroup  analyses)  might  be  interesting  from  a  hypothesis  generating  point  of  view,  however  this should not only be based on post hoc data exploration but also on sound pharmacological rationale. At present the latter is lacking as the potential in vivo pharmacodynamic mechanisms in human have not been  elucidated.  Concerning  the  safety  profile,  the  SAG  also  considered  that  the  safety  profile  of Genasense would have been acceptable if a clear clinical benefit had been shown in the primary endpoint.

## Overall conclusions on grounds for reexamination

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant and considered the views of the SAG. The CHMP maintained the view that no statistical difference was observed in terms of the primary endpoint overall survival. Concerning secondary endpoints and exploratory subgroup analyses, the CHMP also maintained the view that the small treatment difference observed in the secondary endpoint PFS cannot be regarded as established due to lack of independent review, and that LDH sub-group analyses were data driven and hypothesis generating. In conclusion, the CHMP maintained the view that efficacy had not been established in the claimed indication. Concerning the safety profile, the CHMP concluded that significant toxicity was observed with Genasense and that it could have been acceptable if a benefit in terms of overall survival had been established. However, since no clinical benefit has been established in terms of overall survival or other clinical benefit endpoint, the CHMP maintained the view that the benefit risk balance was negative.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

## Whereas

- No statistically significant difference as regards the primary endpoint Overall Survival has been demonstrated in this single pivotal trial;
- Data driven subgroup analyses on Overall Survival can only be considered as hypothesis generating;

Taking into consideration that efficacy has not been established and that significant toxicity is associated with Genasense treatment, the benefit / risk balance is negative, and therefore the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Genasense.
