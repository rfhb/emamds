## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for abacavir / lamivudine, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on cardiovascular events from the literature regarding abacavir, including a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that the warnings and precautions for use of products containing  abacavir  need  to  be  revised  to  adequately  reflect  the  current  level  of  information  on cardiovascular  events  and,  in  line  with  the  current  therapeutic  guidelines,  that  a  recommendation discouraging the use of abacavir containing products in patients with high cardiovascular risk should also be included in the product information. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing abacavir/ lamivudine should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for abacavir / lamivudine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing abacavir / lamivudine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
