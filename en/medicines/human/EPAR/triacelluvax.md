## Overview

On 11 January 1999, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for the whole European Union to Chiron S.p.A for Triacelluvax (Combined diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine), indicated for active immunisation of children from 6 weeks up to 7 years of age against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.

Triacelluvax was only marketed in Italy. On 15 October 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder notified the European Commission of its decision to voluntarily withdraw the Marketing Authorisation for Triacelluvax for commercial reasons. Alternatives are available in Europe, either as individual or combined vaccines.

On 28 January 2002, the European Commission adopted the decision withdrawing the Marketing Authorisation for the medicinal product for human use \"Triacelluvax\". Pursuant to this decision, the European Public Assessment Report for Triacelluvax has been removed from this website.
