## 2.3.2. Clinical study

P200 -A Phase III, Open-Label, Clinical Trial to Study the Safety and Immunogenicity of the Quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP Particle (VLP) Vaccine (V501) in 9- to 15 Year-Old Japanese Boys;

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

Primary objective:

- (VLP)Vaccine (V501) induces high seroconversionrates for the vaccine HPV types (6,11,16 and 18) at 1 month post dose 3 in 9- to 15-year-old Japanese boys.

Exploratoryobjectives:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 1) To demonstrate that administration of V501 induces noninferior geometric mean titers(GMTs) for serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 at 1 month post dose 3 in Japanese boys aged 9- to 15-year-old 1 month post dose 3.
- 2) To describe the persistence of the serum antibody titersfor the vaccine HPV types 24 months followingthethirddoseofV501.
3. 3)Toestimate the immuneresponseforthevaccine HPV types(6,11,16and18)at1 monthpost dose 3 using GMTs.

## Studydesign

Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm study. The trial was conducted at 4 trial centers in Japan.

- c) Comparison of GMTs at 1 month post dose 3 (9 to 15 years old Japanese boys vs. 16 to 26 years old Japanese men)

Safety and tolerability endpoint: Adverse events (AEs), vaccine related AEs, and new medical conditions were evaluated at each study vaccination. Specifically, injection-site AEs were recorded between days 1-5,systemic AEs days 1-15,serious AEs(SAEs)days 1 to 15 of each study vaccination

## Immunogenicity:

- 1) The primary endpoint HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 seroconversion percentages and GMTs at 1 month (Month 7), and secondary endpoints 12 months (Month 18) and 24 months (Month 30) post dose 3 were evaluated by computing point estimates and constructing 95% CI. A Calculation of the CI is based on the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson (1934). Successofthisstudyrequired thatthepointestimatesofseroconversionpercentage onthe HPV typesexceed90%.Positivebyserologywasdefined ashavinga titer atorabove the serostatus cutoff [20 milli MerckUnits/mL(mMU/mL),16mMU/mL,20 mMU/mL,and 24 mMU/mL for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 types, respectively].

## Efficacyresults

## Primary endpoint:

- -For the primary endpoint, at 1 month post dose 3 (Month 7), the seroconversion percentages (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 were 94.9% (88.5%, 98.3%), 99.0% (94.4%,100%), 99.0% (94.5%,100%), and 99.0% (94.4%,100%),respectively.The point estimates fortheseroconversionpercentageswere&gt;9o%oforeachHPVtype;therefore,theprimaryobjectiveof the study was met.

Exploratoryendpoints:

- (  s HPV type. Marked HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 antibody responses were observed for the entire duration of the study.
- -The GMTsfor anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 at 1 month post dose 3 (Month 7), as assessed by cLIA, were 482.9 mMU/mL, 1,052.8 mMU/mL, 3,878.3 mMU/mL, and 1,114.5mMU/mL, respectively.The GMTs for all HPV types declined after Month 7.The GMTs at Month 18 and Month 30 were 222.0 and 177.5 mMU/mL for HPV 6;259.9 and 181.5 mMU/mL forHPV 11;1,154.1 and 831.3mMU/mL for HPV 16; and212.1and144.2mMU/mLforHPV18.

Assessor's comment: The applicant wrote that results demonstrated non-inferiority of the serum antibody titers among younger individuals in comparison to older ones in case of Gardasil.

## Safetyresults

Evaluationofthesafetyand tolerabilityafter3-doseregimenofquadrivalentHPVL1VLPvaccinationin 9 to15year-oldJapaneseboysdemonstrated theresultsasfollows.

- -From Day 1 through Month 7 (Period I); the proportion of AEs reported from Day 1 to Day 15
- -The proportion of injection-site AEs and systemic AEs were 64.0% and 21.0%, respectively.
- (34.0%), and injection site erythema (31.0%). A severe injection-site AE was reported only in 1

- -No subjects reported vaccine-related SAEs, death or AEs leading to study discontinuation during Period I and Period II.
- -Overall, during the entire study period, administration of the 3-dose regimen of the qHPV vaccine to 9-to15-year-oldJapaneseboyswasgenerallywelltolerated.

Assessor's comment: As the study size was small (N=1oo),chance for rare AEs and SAEs to happenwaslow.Anyhow,describedAEs arewellknown and arepreviouslydescribedforGardasil.

Rapporteursdiscussiononclinicalaspects demonstrated high seroconversion percentages for the HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18) at 1month post dose 3 and induced strong immune responses for the HPV types. Generated anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 Japanese men (Protocol V501-122).The immune response for the HPV types (6, 11,16 and 18) persisted up to 24 months post dose 3.

Theresults are in agreement with previously reported studies.No concern regarding lacking efficacy is raised from this study.

Thestudypopulationwasrelatively small(N=1oo) and therefore the chance to detectrareAEs and SAEs islow.The safetyresults are alsoin agreementwithpreviouslyreported studies.Nonewsafety concern is raised from this study.

## 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.

## 4. Additional clarification requested

None.
