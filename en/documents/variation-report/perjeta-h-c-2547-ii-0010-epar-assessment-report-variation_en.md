## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy in women, with an estimated 1.67 million new cases diagnosed in 2012 in the world. Breast cancer ranks  as the fifth cause of death from cancer overall (522,000 deaths worldwide, 143,000 deaths in Europe) (Globocan, 2012).

Most breast cancers in the Western world (around 94%-95% of breast cancer patients in the US and Europe) are diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the breast, with or without loco-regional lymph node spread (Howlader et al, 2011; Sant et al, 2003), and referred to as early breast cancer (EBC). At this stage, the disease is usually operable and can be treated surgically with curative intent. However, the disease can also be inoperable. Primary inoperable breast cancer includes locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer.

Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) describes a subset of invasive breast cancer where the initial clinical and radiographic evaluation documents advanced disease confined to the breast and regional lymph nodes. LABC occurs at first presentation in about one-fifth of breast cancer patients worldwide, with lower incidence in countries with established screening programmes but as high as 60% in some other  countries  (El  Saghir  NS  et  al,  2011).  Usually,  the  definition  of  LABC  includes  large  'operable' primary breast tumours (stage IIB, IIIA) and/or those involving the skin or chest wall and/or those with extensive lymphadenopathies (stage IIIB, IIIC) (Macdonald SM et al., 2011).

Inoperable LABC is a heterogeneous designation encompassing a range of clinical situations from neglected low-grade Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers to rapidly progressing usually ERnegative disease (ESO-ESMO 2nd international consensus guidelines for advanced breast cancer (ABC2), 2014). A more homogenous form of LABC is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) which has a distinct clinical and pathological course. IBC is a subtype characterised by erythema and oedema of a third or more of the skin of the breast with a palpable border, and an aggressive clinical course (European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Recommendations, 2013). Inflammatory breast cancer is always considered stage T4 disease (T4d) (Tumour-node-metastases (TNM) staging system). Patients with IBC have an even worse prognosis than women with LABC. Median survival for women with IBC at diagnosis is around 2.9 years, compared with 6.4 years for women with LABC and &gt; 10 years for patients with other non-T4 breast cancers (Hance et al, 2005). Inflammatory breast cancers are more frequently human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive than other breast cancer types (Charafe-Jauffret et al, 2004; Zell et al, 2009).

HER2 is involved in regulating cell growth, survival and differentiation (Sundaresan et al, 1999). Amplification and/or overexpression of HER2 occurs in around 15% to 20% of breast cancers (Wolff et al, 2007; Chia et al, 2008; Ross et al, 2009) and is a marker of the HER2-positive and luminal-B intrinsic sub-types of breast cancer (Sorlie et al, 2004). HER2 overexpression/amplification ('HER2positivity') is associated with increased tumour aggressiveness, higher rates of recurrence, and increased mortality (Borg et al, 1990; Ross et al, 1998; Menard et al, 2001; Brown et al, 2008; Curigliano et al, 2009; Ross et al, 2009).

Surgery is the main modality of local treatment for breast cancer, and surgery and/or radiotherapy can control loco-regional disease in the majority of patients. Conventionally, adjuvant systemic therapy is given after loco-regional therapy to eradicate micrometastatic disease and reduce the chances of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

distant (and local) relapse (European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Recommendations, 2013).

Neoadjuvant therapy is given prior to surgery and has become a treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Although originally developed for patients with large and/or inoperable tumours to enable definitive surgery to be performed, neoadjuvant therapy may also be used in patients with operable early breast cancer to try to avoid a mastectomy and enable breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to take place. Neoadjuvant therapy is also the primary modality of therapy for patients with inflammatory breast cancer, regardless of tumour size (Dawood et al, 2011). According to the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines and ESMO Clinical Recommendations the treatment modalities (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy) used in adjuvant treatment may also be used pre-operatively.

Neoadjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer include trastuzumab which is indicated in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant trastuzumab therapy, for locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours &gt; 2 cm in diameter (EPAR Herceptin).

## About the product

Pertuzumab  (Perjeta)  is  a  recombinant,  humanized,  immunoglobulin  (Ig)G1κ  monoclonal  antibody, which  targets  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2,  also  known  as  c-erbB-2),  a transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.

By  binding  to  the  subdomain  2  epitope  of  the  extracellular  domain  of  HER2,  Pertuzumab  prevents hetero-dimerization  of  HER2  with  other  members  of  the  HER  family  (HER1,  HER3  and  HER4).  As  a result, ligand-activated downstream signalling is blocked by pertuzumab. Pertuzumab is also capable of activating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). When combined with trastuzumab,  pertuzumab  provides  a  more  complete  blockade  of  the  HER  pathway  resulting  in augmented anti-cancer activity in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

Pertuzumab was authorised on 4 March 2013 in the following indication:

Perjeta is indicated for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in adult patients with HER2positive  metastatic  or  locally  recurrent  unresectable  breast  cancer,  who  have  not  received  previous anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

The present application is to extend the use of Perjeta for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

The applied indication was:

Perjeta is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer (&gt; 2 cm in diameter) as part of the treatment for early breast cancer.

The recommended indication is:

Perjeta is indicated for use in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence (see section 5.1.).

The recommended initial loading dose of Perjeta is 840 mg administered as a 60 minute intravenous infusion, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a maintenance dose of 420 mg administered over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial loading dose of trastuzumab is 8 mg/kg body weight administered as an intravenous infusion followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg body weight.

When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 , administered thereafter on a 3 weekly schedule. The dose of docetaxel may be escalated to 100 mg/m 2  on subsequent cycles if the initial dose is well tolerated (the docetaxel dose should not be escalated when used in combination with carboplatin, trastuzumab and Perjeta).

The medicinal products should be administered sequentially and not mixed in the same infusion bag. Perjeta and trastuzumab can be given in any order. When the patient is receiving docetaxel, this should be administered after Perjeta and trastuzumab. An observation period of 30 to 60 minutes is recommended after each Perjeta infusion and before commencement of any subsequent infusion of trastuzumab or docetaxel (see SmPC section 4.4).

Perjeta should be administered for 3 to 6 cycles in combination with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy, as part of a treatment regimen for early breast cancer. Following surgery, patients should be treated with adjuvant trastuzumab to complete 1 year of treatment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk assessment was submitted for pertuzumab in accordance with the \"Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use\" (EMEA, 2006). Proteins and peptides are exempted from the need to provide an environmental risk assessment, because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the results of two phase II studies, NEOSPHERE (WO20697) and TRYPHAENA (BO22280) in support of the proposed indication.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

In addition to the above studies there are two additional studies ongoing:

## APHINITY (BO25126/TOC4939g/BIG-4-11):

This is an ongoing, randomized, two-arm Phase III study of adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy plus  pertuzumab  or  placebo  in  patients  with  primary  operable  breast  cancer.  Recruitment  into  the study  is  complete  (4805  patients)  and  the  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committees  (IDMC)  have reported  no  unexpected  safety  signals  as  of  December  2013.  A  CHMP  Scientific  Advice  for  the APHINITY trial was sought in October 2010. The primary analysis is expected to take place in 2016 and final clinical study report in May 2017.

## BERENICE (WO29217):

This is a non-randomized, open label, phase II study designed to evaluate pertuzumab in combination with  trastuzumab  and  two  different  neoadjuvant  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  regimens  in patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory or early stage breast cancer. The study will enrol a similar patient population to that enrolled in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies. The primary endpoint of the study is cardiac safety of pertuzumab in combination with two commonly used neoadjuvant regimens. Secondary endpoints include overall safety and pCR rate. The study is planned to enrol approximately 400 patients (200 patients in each cohort). Safety and efficacy data from the neoadjuvant period are anticipated in May 2017.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The MAH presented PK data from the NEOSPHERE study. In this study, optional biomarker sample repository (BSR) blood samples were collected from consented patients in order to better understand/predict pertuzumab/trastuzumab efficacy, dose responses, safety, pertuzumab/trastuzumab mode of action, progression of breast cancer, and associated diseases.

Pertuzumab was administered as a loading dose of 840 mg intravenous (IV) followed by 420 mg IV q3w. Trastuzumab was administered as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg IV q3w. Docetaxel was administered at an initial dose of 75 mg/m 2  escalating to 100 mg/m 2  q3w. During the entire pre- and post-surgical period, all patients received appropriate chemotherapy as per standard of care, as well as any surgery and/or radiotherapy as required.

Pertuzumab serum concentrations were measured in BSR blood samples obtained on days 14-21 postdose of Cycles 2 and 4 (two samples per patient were planned). Samples were obtained from 139 patients:  Arm B, n=49; Arm C, n=45; and Arm D, n=45.

Trastuzumab serum concentrations were measured in BSR blood samples obtained on Days 14-21 post-dose of Cycles 2 and 4. Samples were obtained from 135 patients: Arm A, n=41; Arm B, n=49; and Arm C, n=45.

A new PK ELISA using a monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody against trastuzumab was developed and validated to measure trastuzumab in the presence of pertuzumab to enable PK evaluation for clinical trials in which both trastuzumab and pertuzumab are administered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PK results collected in NEOSPHERE were compared with the prediction of previously developed population PK (popPK) models for pertuzumab and trastuzumab, developed with 481 and 595 patients respectively. The popPK model for pertuzumab was based on 12 clinical trials in patients with solid tumours, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Lean body weight and serum albumin concentration were identified as significant covariates for pertuzumab PK in that model.

No immunogenicity data (anti-therapeutic antibodies) were collected in NEOSPHERE.

## Results

## Pertuzumab

With a loading dose of 840 mg and a 420 mg maintenance dose every 3 weeks (q3w), the steadystate concentrations of pertuzumab were reached after the first maintenance dose. In previously submitted studies with the same dosage schedule pertuzumab demonstrated linear PK at a dose range of 2-25 mg/kg with respect to dose proportionality and time-independence.

NEOSPHERE patients had a slightly lower median lean body weight (LBW) (44.6 kg versus 49.2 kg) and a higher median albumin (ALBU) (4.4 g/dL versus 3.9 g/dL) compared with the previous pertuzumab popPK model population but after correcting for baseline differences in weight and ALBU the popPK model predictions matched the observed pertuzumab serum concentrations. Pertuzumab Cycle 2 observed serum trough serum concentrations had a mean of 70 f.lQ/mL, and 98% (130 of 133) of patients in Arms B, C, and D had a serum trough serum concentration &gt;20 f.lQ/mL. For the model-predicted trough serum concentrations at Cycle 2, the mean was 60 f.lQ/mL and 97% (130 of 134) of the patients had a predicted trough serum concentration &gt;20 f.lQ/mL.

The median CL of the NEOSPHERE patient was 0.204 L/day, which was slightly lower than the typical CL of 0.235 L/day estimated in the prior popPK model.

## Trastuzumab

Patients in NEOSPHERE had a slightly lower median body weight (64 kg versus 67.5 kg) and a slightly lower median serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels (18 IU/L versus 19 IU/L) compared with the previous trastuzumab popPK model population.

The trastuzumab PK results were similar across the three arms in NEOSPHERE. The modelled PK profiles over-predicted the observed trastuzumab serum concentrations, even after correcting for baseline covariates: measured trastuzumab trough concentration at Cycle 2 was 32.4% lower than the model-predicted value. Trastuzumab Cycle 2 observed trough serum concentrations had a mean of 34 µg/mL, and 64% (83 of 129) of patients in Arms A, B, and C had a trough serum concentration &gt;20 µg/mL. For the individual model-predicted trough serum concentrations, the mean was 36 µg/mL, and 98% (127 of 129) of the patients had a predicted trough &gt;20 µg/mL.

The clearance in NEOSPHERE patients was higher than the values from the popPK model, even after correcting for the difference in covariates. However trastuzumab CL values were similar between patients with or without pertuzumab (p=0.103, comparing Arms A and B) and patients with or without docetaxel (p= 0.160, comparing Arms B and C).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The analysis of pertuzumab PK in NEOSPHERE showed that patients had lower lean body weight and higher  serum albumin concentrations than patients in the pertuzumab pop PK model, resulting in a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lower observed clearance in NEOSPHERE patients. After correcting for baseline differences, the pop PK model  represented  well  the  pertuzumab  PK  observed  in  NEOSPHERE  patients  indicating  that pertuzumab PK is similar between neo-adjuvant and MBC patients. Further,  pertuzumab PK did not appear to vary between study treatment arms, suggesting it was not affected by the presence of coadministered trastuzumab, docetaxel, or both.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Overall, the PK results presented suggested that the previous popPK pertuzumab model adequately described the distribution of the NEOSPHERE pertuzumab PK serum concentrations. The observed trough concentrations appeared similar across treatment groups. Therefore, drug-drug interactions are not expected between pertuzumab and trastuzumab or between pertuzumab and docetaxel. The PK results of pertuzumab in the NEOSPHERE study are consistent with the predictions from the previous population PK model (see SmPC section 5.2).

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

No formal dose-response studies were conducted for this indication, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The proposed dose of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting is the same as the dose used in the metastatic setting.

## 2.4.2. Main studies

## Study NEOSPHERE (WO20697)

Study NEOSPHERE is a randomised, multicenter, multinational Phase II study evaluating the combination of trastuzumab plus docetaxel versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel plus pertuzumab versus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab versus pertuzumab and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced, inflammatory or early stage HER2 positive breast cancer.

## Neoadjuvant (Pre-Operative) Treatment

Study treatment was administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, as follows, prior to breast surgery:

- Arm A: Trastuzumab IV + docetaxel IV (T+D)

A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab was required on Day 1, Cycle 1, and a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg thereafter. The starting dose for docetaxel was 75 mg/m 2  for Cycle 1 then 100 mg/m 2  for Cycles 2-4, if no dose limiting toxicity occurred.

- Arm B: Trastuzumab IV + pertuzumab IV + docetaxel IV (Ptz+T+D)

A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab and 840 mg of pertuzumab was required on Day 1 Cycle 1; thereafter, maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg and 420 mg, respectively, were required from Cycle 2 onward. The starting dose for docetaxel was 75 mg/m 2  for Cycle 1, then 100 mg/m 2  for Cycles 2-4, if no dose-limiting toxicity occurred.

- Arm C: Trastuzumab IV + pertuzumab IV (Ptz+T)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A loading dose of 8 mg/kg of trastuzumab and 840 mg pertuzumab was required on Day 1 Cycle 1; thereafter, a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg and 420 mg, respectively, were required from Cycle 2 onward.

• Arm D: Pertuzumab IV + docetaxel IV (Ptz+D)

A loading dose of 840 mg of pertuzumab was required on Day 1 Cycle 1; thereafter, a maintenance dose of 420 mg was required from Cycle 2 onward. The starting dose for docetaxel was 75 mg/m 2  for Cycle 1, then 100 mg/m 2  for Cycles 2-4, if no dose-limiting toxicity occurred.

Adjuvant (Post-Operative) Treatment

- Arms A, B, and D:

Patients in Arms A, B, and D received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by FEC (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m 2  IV, epirubicin 90 mg/m 2  IV, then cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2  IV) on Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (i.e., Cycles 5 - 7), with each cycle lasting 21 days. Cycle 5 administration was not to occur until 2 weeks after surgery. Thereafter, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was to be given every 3 weeks from Cycle 8 continuing until Cycle 17 for patients in Arms A and B and until Cycle 21 for patients in Arm D.

• Arm C:

Patients in Arm C received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m 2  IV for Cycle 5. From Cycle 6, docetaxel was escalated to 100 mg/m 2  for three cycles (i.e., Cycles 6 - 8) if no doselimiting toxicity occurred. For Cycles 9 to 11, patients received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by FEC (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m 2  IV, epirubicin 90 mg/m 2  IV, then cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2  IV) on Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (each cycle lasting 21 days). From Cycle 12 until Cycle 17, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was continued.

## Objectives

## Primary Objectives

- To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment of trastuzumab plus  docetaxel, as compared to trastuzumab, pertuzumab plus docetaxel or to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and to compare pertuzumab plus docetaxel with trastuzumab, pertuzumab plus  docetaxel,  in  patients  with  T2-4d  HER2-positive  breast  cancer,  based  on  complete pathological response rate. The primary objective was evaluated when all patients received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment and surgery or had withdrawn from the study whichever was earlier.

## Secondary Objectives

- To evaluate the safety profiles of each treatment regimen, including pre-operative (neoadjuvant) and post-operative (adjuvant) treatment.
- To determine the time to clinical response, time-to-response, disease free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for each treatment arm.
- To  evaluate  the  biomarkers  that  may  be  associated  with  primary  and  secondary  efficacy endpoints in accordance with each treatment arm.
- To evaluate the rate of breast conservative surgery for all patients with T2-3 tumors for whom mastectomy was planned at diagnosis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: Post-surgery pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the breast

The primary endpoint was post-surgery pCR rate in the breast, evaluated after patients had received 4 cycles of treatment and surgery or had withdrawn from the study, whichever occurred first.

Definition of pCR: pCR is defined as absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast at microscopic examination of the tumor remnants after surgery following primary systemic therapy.

Absence of residual in situ disease was not required for a pCR in these studies. This definition is abbreviated to bpCR (pathological complete response in the breast) and corresponds to the definition, ypT0/is, according to the TNM classification.

Two other more stringent definitions of pCR are in common use: tpCR (total pCR) and GBG pCR (German Breast Group pCR). Differences among these definitions are reported in the Table below.

*TNM classification (confirmed by pathology after initial treatment): y = status post initial therapy; T = tumor; N = nodes; is = in situ; EBC = early breat cancer; GBG = German Breast Group; I-SPY = Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis; NSABP = National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project

Note: The MAH justified the choice of the bpCR definition as that preferred by Michelangelo Foundation (a scientific non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of cancer research and involved in EBC research) at the time of study design. However, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the most appropriate definition of pCR to use, and to enable cross-trial comparisons, data were prospectively collected in both NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA to allow assessment of pCR by all three definitions. Pathological complete response rates according to the tpCR and GBG pCR definitions are considered exploratory endpoints for both studies (see section on Comparison across trials, pCR by definition).

The pCR rate is the proportion of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that achieve a pCR.

Assessment of tumour specimens by the pathologist was done according to institutional standards for processing and interpretation of pathologic specimens was maintained as per local practice. There was no centralised review of the pathology specimens.

## Secondary endpoints:

Clinical response rate: Clinical response was defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). Clinical response rate was defined as the proportion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  patients  who  achieved  a  clinical  response  (CR  or  PR)  during  Cycles  1-4  (pre-surgery).  Clinical response was to be assessed at each cycle, between Days 15-21 or on study Day 1 of the next cycle.

The clinical response during neo-adjuvant period or the clinical response at the last assessment was to be determined based on the tumour measurements by the MAH in combination with the tumour response assessment (PD or No-PD) by the investigator. Tumour response was assessed using clinical breast examination (CBE) of the breast, axilla and supraclavicular fossa and/or mammography or other conventional methods prior to each cycle of therapy, as per local medical practice. CBE and mammography were required at baseline and after completion of Cycle 4, prior to surgery.

Baseline  breast  tumour  assessments  measured by  mammogram and CBE were mandatory, but any additional assessments employing conventional methods, (ultrasound, CT scan, X-rays, MRI) were also collected. During the neoadjuvant treatment phase and after completion of all pre-operative treatment cycles,  tumour  response  assessment  could  be  performed  using  any  of  the  conventional  methods, provided that the same techniques were used for evaluating the target lesion.

Tumour assessments were made based upon the RECIST 1.0 criteria with some modifications that were required due to the study design and eCRF pages used to capture tumour assessment data.

The best tumour response was defined separately for the primary, secondary breast lesions, all breast tumours, axillary nodes, ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes and for all nodes examined as being the best tumour response (CR&gt;PR&gt;SD&gt;PD) a patient achieved during the neoadjuvant period.

The overall best tumour response was derived, based on the best tumour response for all lesions (breast and nodes).

Time to clinical response: This is defined as the time to clinical response, i.e. the time from the date of first dose received to the first date of assessment of clinical response.

Breast conserving surgery (BCS) rate: This is defined as the proportion of patients with T2-T3 disease for whom a mastectomy was planned at study entry, and who subsequently underwent BCS. Patients with  inflammatory  breast  cancer  were  excluded  from  this  analysis  since  these  patients  underwent mastectomy irrespective of their response to neo-adjuvant treatment.

Disease-free survival (DFS): This is defined as the time from the first date of no disease (i.e. date of surgery) to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death. Evidence of contralateral in situ disease was not to be considered PD.

Progression-free survival (PFS): This is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documentation  of  progressive  disease  or  death  from  any  cause.  Patients  without  post-baseline assessments but known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization.

Evaluation  of  biomarkers: Tumour  samples  from  the  primary  tumour  (biopsy)  were  collected  and tested in a central pathology  laboratory for HER2  status  and  tumour  tissue  biomarkers  for pertuzumab/trastuzumab response prediction.

For eligible patients, the following biomarkers, that may be predictive of response to pertuzumab/trastuzumab and/or prognostic for breast cancer, were assessed in tumour tissue:

- expression of HER-family receptors or related receptor-tyrosine kinases e.g., IGF1-R, EGFR, HER2, HER3, assessed by qRT-PCR and/or IHC

- HER ligands (amphiregulin and betacellulin) assessed by qRT-PCR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Markers/components of the HER signal transduction or alternative signalling pathways (pAKT and PTEN protein expression assessed by IHC; c-myc, gene amplification assessed by FISH, mutational status of PIK3CA assessed by a PCR based assay)

## Sample size

400 patients were planned to be randomized into the study. With 400 patients and an overall alpha level  of  0.2  the  study  would  have  80%  power  to  detect  an  absolute  percentage  increase  of  15% between each of the three primary comparisons.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomly assigned, by a central randomization centre using dynamic allocation in the order in which they were enrolled, to Arm A, B, C or D and stratified by operable (T2-3, N0-1, M0), locally advanced (T2-3, N2 or N3, M0; T4a-c, any N, M0) and inflammatory (T4d, any N, M0) breast cancer and oestrogen and/or progesterone positivity.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was open-label. Pathologists were not formally blinded as to treatment allocation.

## Statistical methods

A pCR rate of 25% was expected in arm A (trastuzumab and docetaxel) and arm D (pertuzumab and docetaxel).  A  pCR  rate  of  40%  in  arm  B  (trastuzumab,  pertuzumab  and  docetaxel)  or  arm  C (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) was to be considered of clinical interest. The following three individual hypotheses were tested using a two-sided Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test at an alpha level of 0.2.

Arm A versus arm B

- Null hypothesis: pCR A rate = pCR B rate
- Alternative hypothesis: pCR A rate ≠ pCR B rate

Arm A versus arm C

- Null hypothesis: pCR A rate = pCR C rate
- Alternative hypothesis: pCR A rate ≠ pCR C rate

Arm D versus arm B

- Null hypothesis: pCR D rate = pCR B rate
- Alternative hypothesis: pCR D rate ≠ pCR B rate

As  there  were  three  individual  comparisons  a  Simes  multiplicity  adjustment  was  applied  to  the individual p-values obtained at the end of the study to maintain the overall false positive risk at 0.2.

The ITT population includes all randomized patients, regardless of whether they received any study medication. All efficacy outputs were produced for the ITT population. The per protocol (PP) population, is a subset of the ITT population. It excludes patients who were deemed to have any major protocol violations prior to the adjuvant phase of the study. The PP population includes patients who received ≥ 3 cycles (and not &gt; 4 cycles) of their randomized study medication in the neoadjuvant setting. The PP analysis was to occur only if this population differs in total number of patients by ≥ 10% of the ITT population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety population includes patients who received at least one dose of study medication and at least one safety assessment performed at baseline. Patients were assigned to treatment groups according to treatment actually received.

## Results

## Participant flow

<!-- image -->

Note: Withdrawal indicates withdrawal from study treatment. Patients withdrawing from treatment could still undergo primary surgery and could still be ongoing in the post-treatment follow-up period. Withdrawal at any time up to the first adjuvant trial treatment cycle was counted as withdrawal from the neoadjuvant phase.

a One patient randomized to Arm D actually received Arm A treatment, and was therefore included in the Arm A safety population.

b One Patient was randomized to Arm D but received treatment according to Arm B.

c One Patient was randomized to Arm B but received treatment according to Arm C.

d One Patient withdrew from adjuvant treatment due to an adverse event of left ventricular dysfunction, incorrectly reported as interruption of study treatment.

e One patient: updated since Primary CSR due to reporting error in neoadjuvant period.

## Recruitment

Recruitment occurred between 17 December 2007 and 22 December 2009. All enrolled patients had completed treatment and were either in follow-up or had withdrawn from the study as of 15 February 2011. Patients were recruited across 59 centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom).

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol Amendments

Version B (dated 4th December, 2007) introduced the following changes:

- Addition of a fourth treatment arm (arm D), in order to evaluate the efficacy of pertuzumab, in the absence of trastuzumab, in the neoadjuvant setting, with corresponding update of schedule of assessment and dosing information. There was a total of 29 patients who had been recruited on the original protocol prior to introduction of this arm.
- Increase  in  the  number  of  patients  participating  in  the  study  from  180  to  400,  and corresponding increase in the number of centers, from 45-55 to 100.
- Amendment of efficacy endpoints, hypothesis testing and analyses to reflect addition of arm D and increased patient numbers.
- Addition of an exclusion criterion, to exclude patients with insulin-dependent diabetes from the study.
- Clarification of the offset dosing schedule.

## Version C (11th December 2008) made the following change:

Correction  of  the  tumour-node-metastasis  (TNM)  classes  used  to  classify  patients'  disease  for  the stratification groups operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory cancer for this study.

Version D (27th June 2009) made the following significant changes:

· Updates to: the definition of post-menopausal women, the contraceptive requirements for women of child bearing potential in accordance with the ICH M3 guideline, and the pregnancy testing scheduling.

- Clarification of clinical response definition.

## Protocol Deviations

The  majority  of  protocol  deviations  reported  were  minor  and  did  not  exclude  patients  from  the  Per Protocol (PP) population. Across the treatment arms between 8 and 11 patients (7.5-10.3%) per arm reported at least one inclusion criteria violation, of which the majority was due to a positive or missing baseline pregnancy test result. Between 7 and 14 patients (6.5-13.1%) reported at least one exclusion criteria violation, the most common of which was missing data for, or impaired liver function. Five to 11 patients (4.7-10.3%) recorded a protocol deviation whilst on study, for various reasons.

One  patient  had  a  pulmonary  lesion  that  was  confirmed  as  metastases,  which  violated  exclusion criteria. The patient was withdrawn from the study after receiving 2 cycles of treatment. Two patients had missing screening values and were reported as having a violation of primary tumour measuring less than 2 cm. However, both patients had cycle 1 tumour measurement values &gt; 2 cm.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint: pCR

Pathological response rates (bpCR) by treatment arm are presented in the Table below.

Table 5: Summary of pathological complete response rate including treatment comparisons (ITT population)

<!-- image -->

pCR data by subgroups are presented under 'Comparison performed across trials'.

## Secondary endpoints

## Clinical Response Rate

Clinical  response  analyses  are  presented  by  assessment  modality.  The  majority  of  patients  were assessed by mammography/X-ray or CBE. Since CBE was assessed at each neoadjuvant cycle, while mammogram/X-ray was only required to be assessed at baseline and cycle 4 as per protocol, CBE was deemed the most sensitive method of assessing tumour progression.

CR rate was highest in arm B (31%) and lowest in arm C (17%) in patients where CBE was used to assess the primary lesion. Correspondingly SD was lowest in arm B and highest in arm C. Disease progression was low in all arms.

*overall response is derived based on the sum total of breast tumors and all nodes examined.

The majority of patients achieved an unconfirmed clinical response (i.e., CR or PR) in the primary lesion, as assessed by CBE (Table 6). The highest rate was reported in arm B (88.1%), followed by arm A (79.8%) then arm D (71.4%), and the lowest was in arm C (67.6%).

## Breast Conserving Surgery

Just over half the patients on study were originally planned to undergo a mastectomy. The majority of these went on to have mastectomy and/or axilliary surgical resection; however between 18-32% across the treatment arms were able to have BCS (defined as quadrantectomy or lumpectomy). The proportion of patients achieving BCS was lowest in arm C and highest in arm D.

## Baseline Biomarker Levels

The levels of all biomarkers were assessed at baseline, for the overall study population as well as per study arm. All biomarker baseline levels were well balanced per arm, as judged by the median level, with  no  notable  imbalances  between  any  of  the  four  study  arms.  The  number  of  samples  analysed varied by biomarker, either for technical reasons or due to tumour tissue availability being a limiting factor (65.9% - 99.8% of patients had samples analysed across the various biomarkers). However, in general, the number of samples analysed per biomarker was well balanced across the arms and overall a high rate of sample coverage was reached for the biomarker analyses.

PIK3CA  mutation  status  was  assessed  in  65.5%  of  the  study  patients.  Within  the  overall  PIK3CA biomarker population, 32% of samples were identified as carrying a PIK3CA mutation. This was also balanced across the treatment arms. For the betacellulin and amphiregulin PCR assays, whilst mRNA levels  were  above  the  specified  limit  of  detection,  the  quantities  detected  were  very  small  in  the majority of patients. The median levels of betacellulin and amphiregulin mRNA across the treatment arms were very low, and were less than the limits of variability for these assays.

Samples  from  399  patients  were  tested  for  Fc  gamma  receptor  polymorphisms.  Incidences  of  the phenotypes  of  interest  were  broadly  balanced  across  the  treatment  arms;  however  numbers  of patients with certain phenotypes were too low to allow further meaningful analyses.

A treatment interaction test using logistic regression was carried out to explore whether there was a relationship between biomarker levels and pCR rate. Using this test, a significant association with the treatment benefit seen in arm B compared to arm A was observed only for HER2 membrane protein levels, as assessed by IHC (odds ratio = 3.91; p = 0.0236). 17 significance tests were performed at the alpha=0.2 level, with no adjustment for multiplicity.

## Ancillary analyses

For  the  primary  endpoint,  three  pre-specified  hypotheses  were  tested,  and  a  Simes  multiplicity adjustment was applied to these comparisons (of arm A versus arm B, arm A versus arm C and arm D versus arm B) accordingly. Since the pCR rate in arm D indicated that pertuzumab given as a single antibody  with  docetaxel  has  noteworthy  activity,  an  additional  post-hoc,  exploratory  analysis  was carried  out,  to  test  the  difference  in  pCR  rates  between  arms  A  and  D.  This  analysis  showed  no statistically significant difference between the arms (p=0.3263). This comparison was not pre-specified and hence was not powered to allow any firm conclusions.

Figure 4: Overview of the dosing schedule

## Neoadjuvant

Study  treatment  is  defined  as  neoadjuvant  (pre-surgery)  and  adjuvant  (post-operative  surgery) treatment.  The  investigational  medicinal  products  (IMPs)  were  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab.  FEC, carboplatin and docetaxel were administered in accordance with their local prescribing information and were not regarded as IMPs.

Trastuzumab was administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1 for patients in Arms A and C and Day 1 of Cycle 4 for patients in Arm B.

Pertuzumab was administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1 for Arm A and C patients and Day 1 of Cycle 4 for Arm B patients.

Docetaxel  was  administered  at  75  mg/m 2   as  an  IV  infusion  over  60  (±10)  minutes,  after  the pertuzumab  infusion  observation  period.  From  Day  22  onwards  (three  weeks  after  the  first  dose), docetaxel  was  escalated  in  the  subsequent  cycle(s)  to  100  mg/m 2 (except  for  patients  in  the pertuzumab +TCH arm [Arm C] where there was no escalation of the docetaxel dose) if no limiting toxicity was observed.

Neoadjuvant FEC was administered as an IV bolus or as an infusion (in accordance with local policy) on Day 1 of treatment in Arms A and B. FEC was given every three weeks for three cycles, as follows:

- 5-Fluorouracil was given as a dose of at 500 mg/m 2 , with dose capping at 1200 mg
- Epirubicin was given as a dose of 100 mg/m 2
- Cyclophosphamide was administered at 600 mg/m 2 , with dose capping at 1200 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Carboplatin was given every three weeks for six cycles to patients in Arm C. The Calvert formula was used to calculate the dose (given in mg, not mg/m 2 ) of carboplatin: Dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/mL x min) x [GFR mL/min + 25]. Dose (mg) = 6 x [GFR mL/min + 25].

## Adjuvant

Adjuvant  trastuzumab  was  given  at  a  dose  of  6  mg/kg  IV,  every  three  weeks  (q3w)  from  Cycle  7 onwards (which had to occur at least 2 weeks after surgery). If the interval between Cycle 6 Day 1 and Cycle  7  Day  1  was  more  than  four  weeks  a  reloading  dose  of  8  mg/kg  was  required  for  Cycle  7. Trastuzumab was to be continued for a maximum of one year in total (i.e., until Cycle 17 for Arms A and C patients and until Cycle 20 for Arm B patients).

Additional  radiotherapy,  hormonal  therapy  and  chemotherapy  post-surgery  and  during  adjuvant trastuzumab  treatment  was  to  be  allowed,  if  considered  necessary  by  the  investigator.  For  those patients  who  received  anthracycline-based  neoadjuvant  therapy  and  who  are  deemed  by  the investigator  to  require  further  chemotherapy  post-surgery,  the  combination  of  cyclophosphamide, methotrexate  and  fluorouracil  (CMF)  was  to  be  suggested.  For  those  patients  who  have  received carboplatin-based  neoadjuvant  therapy  and  who  are  deemed  by  the  Investigator  to  require  further chemotherapy postsurgery, the regimen fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) was to be suggested.

## Rationale for dosage selection

Based on pharmacokinetic and clinical data, an IV dosing interval of three weeks was determined for pertuzumab (half-life of approximately 17 days). A loading dose of 840 mg (followed by 420 mg q3w), was capable of attaining steady-state trough and peak concentrations by the second cycle. The half-life of trastuzumab is approximately 28.5 days, which supports a dosing of every three weeks.

The  intravenous  chemotherapy  regimens  used  for  docetaxel,  FEC  and  carboplatin  are  based  on published data and routine clinical usage. Intravenous docetaxel was used at the starting dose of 75 mg/m 2   and  was  escalated  up  to  100  mg/m 2 according  to  individual  tolerability.  Higher  doses  of epirubicin  were  shown  to  be  superior  to  lower  doses  of  epirubicin  (60  mg/m 2 )  in  the  treatment  of breast  cancer,  and  so  the  dose  of  epirubicin  used  in  this  study  was  100  mg/m 2 .  The  use  of  5fluorouracil  (500  mg/m 2 IV)  in  combination  with  an  anthracycline  (epirubicin  in  this  protocol)  and cyclophosphamide was considered a standard regimen.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  make  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  tolerability  of  neoadjuvant treatment with one of the studied treatment regimens. The primary objective was evaluated when all patients had received six cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, had their surgery and all necessary samples taken, or withdrew from the study whichever was earlier.

The secondary objectives were:

· To make a preliminary assessment of the activity associated with each regimen as indicated by the rate  of  pathological  complete  response  (pCR;  defined  as  the  absence  of  invasive  neoplastic  cells  at microscopic examination of the tumor remnants after surgery, following primary systemic therapy) in the breast.

· To evaluate the safety profiles of each treatment regimen, including pre-operative (neoadjuvant) and post-operative (adjuvant) treatment (i.e., trastuzumab).

·  To  investigate  the  overall  survival  (OS),  the  time  to  clinical  response  (CR),  time-to-response, disease-free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for each treatment arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· To investigate the biomarkers that may be associated with primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in accordance with each treatment arm.

·  To  investigate  the  rate  of  breast  conserving  surgery  for  all  patients  with  T2-3  tumours  for  whom mastectomy was planned at diagnosis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint:

## Cardiac safety:

- Incidence of symptomatic cardiac events as assessed by the Investigator (Grade 3, 4 or 5 symptomatic LVSD)
- Clinically significant LVEF declines over the course of the neoadjuvant period (LVEF decline of ≥10% from baseline and to a value of &lt;50%)

## Secondary endpoints:

pCR (key secondary endpoint): The main efficacy endpoint was pCR rate in the breast, evaluated after six cycles of treatment and surgery or following withdrawal from the study, whichever occurred sooner. pCR  was  defined  at  the  time  of  surgery  and  the  rate  is  the  proportion  of  the  ITT  population  that achieved a pCR. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated around the observed pCR rate for each treatment arm in order to show the variability associated with the point estimate. A pCR assessment was considered invalid if response to 'Microscopic assessment of primary tumor' is related to invasive carcinoma only (i.e., 'Associated with invasive carcinoma' or 'Distant from invasive carcinoma' ticked).

Clinical  response  rate: Tumour  response  was  defined  as  complete  response  (CR),  partial  response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) and was identified as per local practice. Clinical response rate was defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a response of CR or PR at any time pre-surgery. Tumour response was assessed at each cycle, between Days 15-21 or on Study Day 1 of the next cycle.

Time to clinical response: Time to clinical response was the time from the date of first dose received to the first date of assessment of clinical response.

Breast conserving surgery rate: This  was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved breast conserving  surgery  out  of  the  ITT  population  without  inflammatory  breast  cancer  (these  patients received mastectomy irrespective of their response to neoadjuvant treatment).

Overall survival (OS): This was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients who were alive or lost to follow-up were censored at the last known alive date. Patients with no post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization plus one day.

Disease-free survival (DFS): This was defined as the time from the first date of no disease (i.e., date of surgery) to the first documentation of PD or death. Any evidence of contralateral disease in situ was not considered as PD. DFS was described separately in patients who achieved a pCR from those who did not. DFS was also described for the overall ITT population. Patients who were withdrawn from the study without documented PD were censored at the date of the last assessment when the patient was known to be disease-free.

Progression-free survival (PFS): This was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documentation of PD or death. Patients who were withdrawn from the study without documented PD were censored at the date of the last assessment when the patient was known to be free from PD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients  without  post-baseline  assessments  but  known  to  be  alive  were  censored  at  the  time  of randomization plus one day.

## Secondary safety endpoints:

- o Incidence of symptomatic cardiac events and asymptomatic LVEF events
- o LVEF measures over the course of the study
- o Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs
- o Laboratory test abnormalities.

## Explorative endpoints: Evaluation of biomarkers

## Sample size

The sample size was based on the primary (safety) endpoint. Approximately 75 patients per arm were planned to be recruited into the study (225 in all).

## Randomisation

Eligible patients were  randomized  via  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS)  at  a  central randomization center. Patients were randomly assigned using dynamic allocation to Arm A, B or C, and stratified by:

a) Breast cancer type: operable (T2-3, N0-1, M0), locally advanced (T2-3, N2 or N3, M0; T4ac, any N, M0) and inflammatory (T4d, any N, M0) breast cancer

- b) Hormonal receptor status: hormone receptor positive (ER+ and/ or PR+) versus negative (ER- and PR-).

Treatment was started within five working days after randomization.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

The safety population included patients who received any amount of study medication. Patients were assigned to treatment groups as treated.

Intent  to  Treat  (ITT)  Population  consisted  in  all  patients  randomized,  regardless  of  whether  they received  any  study  medication,  were  included  in  in  the  ITT  population.  Patients  were  assigned  to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes. All efficacy outputs were produced for the ITT population.

Formal  hypothesis  testing  was  not  planned.  For  pCR  (the  main  efficacy  endpoint)  the  approximate expected pCR rates were: Arm A: 50%, Arm B: 45% and Arm C: 40%. With the planned sample size, if  these  response  rates  were  observed,  the  minimum  true  efficacy  (lower  bound  of  exact  95% confidence interval) of the estimates would be approximately A: 38.9% B: 33.8% C: 28.9%.

For the assessment of incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), if the true underlying incidence was 3%, the probability of observing more than five such events in a treatment arm was 0.025.

Secondary endpoints were calculated and summarized for descriptive purposes only. Clinical response rate and the proportion achieving BCS in each treatment arm were tabulated, together with their associated 95% CIs. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median time to clinical response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for each treatment arm. The Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by, operable, locally advanced, inflammatory breast cancer and oestrogen and or progesterone receptor positivity was used to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR, i.e., the magnitude of treatment effect) and its 95% CI, for descriptive purposes only.

Figure 5: Patient disposition

## Recruitment

Patients were recruited at 44 centres across 19 countries (Bahamas, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada,  Croatia,  Germany,  Great  Britain,  Italy,  Mexico,  New  Zealand,  Portugal,  Republic  of  China, Republic of Korea, Republic of Serbia, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland). The period of trial was 26 November 2009 to 21 June 2011 (Clinical cut off).

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendment

The protocol was amended once for the following reasons:

- Protocol requirement for a mammogram between Study Day -14 and start of treatment: Extension of the window for the mammogram to be performed in screening period (from 14 days prior start of treatment to up to 42 days prior to the start of treatment) has been made to remove the need for a second 'study' mammogram if patient has recently received a mammogram as part of standard practice. In addition, centres were able to use MRI in place of mammography according to local practice.
- To provide information on the 'Emergency Medical Call Centre Help Desk' for medical emergencies outside regular business hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To clarify schedule of ECG assessments in treatment period of study
- To provide information on Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) reporting.
- To clarify need for clinical breast exam and mammogram at end of Cycle 6 and prior to surgery.
- Clarification of CBC assessment schedule by treatment arm in neoadjuvant period of study.
- Clarification that Steering Committee will also look at key safety outputs from the neoadjuvant portion of the study.
- To clarify that investigators may adjust dose of study medications based upon small changes in body weight or body surface area.
- Clarification of modifications of dosing of non-investigational medicinal products (IMPs; i.e., docetaxel, carboplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide)

## Protocol Deviations

## Major Violations

More patients in Arm A reported an inclusion criteria violation (14%, vs 5% in Arm B and 7% in Arm C), all of which were designated as major violations. The most commonly reported inclusion criteria violation was a missing pregnancy test result (there were no positive pregnancy test results); all of these patients did have a baseline pregnancy test performed, but this was done outside the allowed time window. Other inclusion violations occurred for a variety of reasons, with no notable difference across arms for any individual reason. Three patients in Arm A entered the study with a primary tumor &lt; 2 cm in diameter. One patient in Arm A entered the study and received the first cycle of treatment, despite  not  having  confirmed  HER2-positive  breast  cancer;  this  patient's  tumor  was  IHC  0/1+,  and HER2-positivity  was  not  determined  by  FISH.  The  patient  (who  remained  in  the  study  at  the investigator's discretion, until surgery was complete) was subsequently withdrawn on Study Day 191, for this reason. In addition, one patient in Arm C did not have the eCRF page filled in for FFPE tissue availability, and so was reported as not having tissue available for HER2 testing; however, this patient was tested and was found to be IHC 3+ and HER2-positive by FISH. One patient in Arm B and two patients in Arm C entered the study with a baseline LVEF reading of &lt; 55%.

One  patient  in  Arm  B  violated  the  criterion  excluding  patients  with  metastatic  disease  or  bilateral breast cancer, since they were determined to have inflammatory metastatic breast cancer, and had presented with lung metastasis during screening. This patient was withdrawn on Study Day 24 for this reason. Approximately one quarter of patients in each treatment arm reported at least one on study protocol violation. The most common on-study violation was 'patient safety compromised', reported in 15%, 20% and 12 % of patients across Arms A, B and C, respectively. This category included patients for whom tumor assessments/CBE, LVEF measurement, or hematology evaluations were omitted for at least  one  scheduled  assessment,  as  well  as  patients  who  received  an  incorrect  dose  of  study treatment.

## Minor violations

More patients in Arm A reported an exclusion criteria violation (12%, vs 5% in Arm B and 8% in Arm C): all but the above noted case of metastatic disease, were minor violations. The majority of these were due to impaired liver function, as indicated by laboratory assessments.

## Time to clinical response

Median time to clinical response was shortest in Arm A (3.6 weeks) followed by Arm C (4.9 weeks) and then Arm B (6.9 weeks). However, the range in time to response was wide (between 1 and 18-20 weeks across arms).

## pCR by age

The  great  majority  of  patients  in  both  studies  were  &lt;65  years  of  age.  Despite  the  small  patient numbers in the age group &gt; 65 years and regardless of the pCR definition used, consistent trends are seen for patients in both age groups compared with the overall population, i.e., a higher pCR rate in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study.

## Clinical responses

Clinical responses were evaluated slightly differently in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies (see methods). To assist comparison between the studies, overall assessment of response (i.e., for breast and lymph nodes) based on CBE is provided for the two studies. Evaluation based on CBE is shown since this was scheduled at every cycle and in all patients in both studies and because CBE includes assessment of lymph nodes as well as the breast. In both studies the majority of patients achieved a clinical  response  (CR  or  PR)  during  the  neoadjuvant  period.  Very  few  patients  in  either  study experienced disease progression (PD) as their best response to neoadjuvant. However, some patients in the NEOSPHERE study (mainly patients in the Ptz+T arm) experienced disease progression during the  neoadjuvant  period  after  initially  appearing  to  have  stable  disease.  Only  one  patient  in  the TRYPHAENA study experienced disease progression during the neoadjuvant period. This patient, with LABC, was randomized to receive FEC/Ptz+T+D and experienced PD after one cycle of FEC (before any pertuzumab or trastuzumab had been given). Overall, clinical response rates and clinical CR rates were consistent with the pCR findings in the two studies, with numerically higher pCR rates occurring in the TRYPHAENA study and, within the NEOSPHERE study, the highest pCR rates occurring in the Ptz+T+D arm and the lowest in the Ptz+T arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall clinical response and clinical CR rates were also higher in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study. Patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm of the TRYPHAENA study were less likely to achieve a clinical CR than patients in the other two arms of this study. Patients in this treatment  arm  received  less  neoadjuvant  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  (three  doses/cycles)  than patients  in  the  other  two  arms  of  the  study  (six  doses/cycles),  and  these  patients  also  started pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  later  (Cycle  4,  compared  with  Cycle  1  in  the  other  two  arms  of  the TRYPHAENA study).

## Breast Conserving Surgery

Excluding patients with IBC (who according to current guidelines undergo mastectomy regardless of response to neoadjuvant therapy) the majority of patients in both studies had a mastectomy: 25.0%33.0%  of  patients  underwent  BCS  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  and  32.9%-33.3%  of  patients  in  the TRYPHAENA study underwent BCS, regardless of original intent. Overall rates of BCS were similar in the NEOSPHERE study, although patients in the Ptz+D arm were slightly more likely to undergo BCS. Overall rates of BCS were similar in the three arms of the TRYPHAENA study.

Of  the  patients  with  T2-T3  disease  for  whom  a  mastectomy  was  planned in the  NEOSPHERE  study, 18.0%-31.7%  actually  underwent  BCS.  In  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  patients  with  T2-T3  disease  for whom a mastectomy was planned were less likely to undergo BCS in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm compared with the Ptz+T+FEC/Pt+T+D and Ptz+TCH arms of the study.

For the NEOSPHERE study, full details of the planned versus actual surgical procedures are provided, for  the  overall  patient  population,  and  split  by  treatment  group.  For  TRYPHAENA,  a  listing  of  the planned and actual surgery for breast cancer is provided.

## Clinical studies in special populations

Efficacy analyses for the following patient subgroups were performed for both studies and are presented above: Age group ≥65 years, Age group ≥75 years, Race (White, Black, Asian, Other), Region (Europe, Asia, North America, South America and Other).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3. Supportive study

A summary of efficacy data from the CLEOPATRA study, which was the pivotal trial for the approval of pertuzumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), was included in present application.

In metastatic breast cancer, the approval was based on a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CLEOPATRA) in 808 patients with HER2-positive MBC. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel.

The improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in the pertuzumab arm was statistically significant [HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-0.75; p&lt; 0.0001, log-rank test]. Moreover, a statistically significant improvement in OS of 15.7 months was observed with a HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.56-0.84; p=0.0002). The median OS was 56.5 months in the pertuzumab+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm versus 40.8 months in the placebo+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The MAH provided data from two open-label phase II studies (studies NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA), randomised and multi-centre. Both studies had similar patient populations, but differed slightly with regard to treatment regimens and main objectives. Nonetheless, several of the endpoints were identical.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria define the target population as female patients &gt;18 years with early breast cancer that are HER2-postive (HER2+), where the primary tumour is &gt; 2 cm with no metastasis. The study population is considered to reflect future patients that could benefit from pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting and the MAH has adequately reflected the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the SmPC (see SmPC section 5.1).

The choice of treatments and doses reflect current clinical practice and are as such acceptable. With regards to the NEOSPHERE study, it is however noted that the treatment regimens included Fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) in the adjuvant regimens only. The neoadjuvant regiments consisted in HER2-therapy (trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab) in combination with a taxane (docetaxel). In operable cases, the timing of treatment (pre- versus post-operative) has no effect on long-term outcomes (Mieog et al, 2007). Due to the well-known cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab, it is not be administrated concomitantly with anthracyclines (see SmPC trastuzumab (Herceptin)), while the combination of trastuzumab and a taxane is safer in terms of cardiotoxicity (Senkus et al. Annals of Oncology, 2013). However, in order to increase the chances of pCR, the CHMP noted that it would have been preferable to add, e.g. FEC or TCH in the neoadjuvant setting in the NEOSPHERE study. The MAH argued that the study was designed so FEC chemotherapy was given after surgery in order to isolate the effect of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting which is a reasonable argument.

The results from the TRYPHAENA study showed that the pCR rates were higher (compared with the NEOSPHERE study) and comparable across all three treatment arms. However, there was no control arm in the TRYPHAENA study, which was designed with safety measures as primary objective and efficacy measures as secondary objectives. One would expect higher pCR rates if the anthracycline component of the NEOSPHERE regimen was brought forward, and there is no scientific reason to expect that the additional benefit of pertuzumab would be lost, if FEC was given in the neoadjuvant setting. Overall, and also taking into consideration the solid evidence from the CLEOPATRA study (see

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

section on supportive data) and the expected confirmatory results from the APHINITY study (see further below), the design of the NEOSPHERE study is considered acceptable from a scientific point of view to support the applied extension of indication.

The MAH was also requested to compare and discuss the TRYPHAENA study with similar neoadjuvant trials published in the literature. Despite the limitations of cross-trial comparison, it was observed that the tpCR rates are consistently higher in the TRYPHAENA study. Thus, there is no reason to suspect that the addition of FEC in the neoadjuvant setting would dilute the effect of pertuzumab, or in other words, there seems to be an added benefit of combining FEC+trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

Docetaxel dose escalation was not permitted in Arm C of study TRYPHAENA, consistent with standard practice for the TCH regimen. The rationale is endorsed. When administered with Perjeta the recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 , administered thereafter on a 3 weekly schedule. The docetaxel dose should not be escalated when used in combination with carboplatin, trastuzumab and Perjeta (see SmPC section 4.2).

The pCR was defined as ypT0/is and the MAH has also provided results based on the different definitions of pCR. To fulfil the definition of tpCR (ypT0/is ypN0) as referred to in the Draft Guidance on The role of the pathological Complete Response as an 4 endpoint in neoadjuvant breast cancer studies (EMA/CHMP/151853/2014) adequate data on staging and management of axillary lymph nodes would be needed. In both NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies, sentinel node biopsy at study entry was not prospectively collected. However, 5 and 10 patients were identified by the MAH. Of the 5 patients enrolled in NEOSPHERE, 2 were sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive and 3 SLN-negative, none was enrolled in the D+T+Ptz arm. In the TRYPHAENA, the number of retrieved sentinel node biopsies was 10 of whom 5 achieved a bpCR and tpCR. None had any further axillary sampling or axillary surgery reported and the axillary nodal status at primary surgery was based on baseline SLN biopsy result. Hence, the low number of patients for whom the SLN status is available together with the lack of further axillary evaluation did not allow any conclusion on the potential impact of nodal status on bp/tpCR.

The Applicant has used dynamic allocation in the NEOSPHERE study due to the likelihood of small strata. Although less preferred since such deterministic schemes should be avoided as discussed in the CHMP guideline (EMA/295050/2013), it was considered acceptable.  To support the dynamic allocation, the p-values were supplemented with randomisation test that supported the primary analysis.

Both studies were open-label. Blinded review of the specimens and central review of pathology slides was requested but not provided as many sites are now closed since the NEOSPHERE study is complete and the TRYPHAENA study has been running for several years. Nevertheless, efficacy outcomes (PFS and DFS) at 5 years in the NEOSPHERE showed HRs in favour of Arm B (pertuzumab containing arm). Although the NEOSPHERE study was not designed to detect a difference in terms of PFS/DFS/OS between the different treatment arms, it is still encouraging to see these results in favour of the pertuzumab arm. Also, recent data from the GEPAR-SEPTO trial (comparison of two forms of paclitaxel) support the findings in the TRYPHAENA study (Untch M et al., Abstract S2-07, 2014 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium). Thus, the likelihood of biased reviews of pathology slides/specimens in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies is considered to be very low.

The MAH noted that in general the pathologists were not informed of patients' treatment allocation. According to the results of a survey performed by the MAH, pathologists were only aware of treatment arm in 4.6% (19 patients) in NEOSPHERE and 9.8% (22 patients) in TRYPHAENA. Thus, assuming that these results were all biased, it would still not change the overall results. Furthermore, an analysis of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pCR status by region shows that pCR trends in the different regions are consistent with the overall results.

The Applicant claimed that studies NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA were conducted in accordance with the principles of GCP. Several inspections were conducted by other national competent authorities. Only one inspection found critical and major issues in one centre participating in the TRYPHAENA study. These findings are not considered to have an impact on the overall benefit-risk balance of pertuzumab.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

There was a clear and statistically significant difference in bpCR of 16.8% in favour of the Ptz+T+D arm in NEOSPHERE study, where a bpCR rate of 45.8% was achieved, compared to 29% in the T+D. Ptz+T and Ptz+D had lower bpCR rates compared to T+D.  The tpCR (ypT0/is N0) rates showed the same pattern with a 17.8% difference in favour of the Ptz+T+D arm compared to the Ptz+T arm.

Regardless of treatment arm, the pCR rates achieved in the TRYPHAENA study were consistently high and similar across all treatment groups. In general, the pCR rates were higher compared to the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. The higher rate of pCR in the TRYPHAENA study reflects the higher number cycles of treatment in the neoadjuvant setting, and the use of the combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in all 3 treatment arms.

Clinical responses were evaluated differently in the two studies. In the NEOSPHERE it was based on clinical breast examination (CBE) and imaging, while in the TRYPHAENA study it was only based on CBE. Hence, cross-comparison of data may only be partially justified. There were high and similar overall response (CR+PR) rates in the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study and in all three arms of the TRYPHAENA study. Time to clinical response was around 6-7 weeks in all arms in the NEOSPHERE study. In the TRYPHAENA study, time to clinical response was 3.6 weeks in Arm A compared to 6.3 weeks and 4.9 weeks in Arm B and C respectively.

The number of planned mastectomies that underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS) was highest (31.7%) in the Ptz+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. However, this group of patients did not achieve the highest pCR rate. The BCS rates were similar between the three treatment arms in the TRYPHAENA study and comparable with the T+D and Ptz+T+D arms in the NEOSPHERE study. The NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies were not designed to show a difference in BCS and the reasons for choosing mastectomy or BCS were not collected. Thus, despite the higher pCR rate in arm T+D and Ptz+T+D, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the BCS.

There were very few patients over 65 years in the submitted studies. Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of Perjeta in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see SmPC section 4.2).

Pertuzumab has not been investigated in a paediatric patient population or in patients with hepatic impairment (see SmPC section 4.2).

The enrolled population was overall representative of the target patient population in both studies. However, a high percentage of tumours in both studies were classified unknown as histological grade (35% in NEOSPHERE and 20.4% in TRYPHAENA). There are no obvious reasons for 'unknown grade' in this group of patients, but it seems to be site-specific and not by geographic region. Furthermore, tumour grade is not required for treatment decision. However, recent publications show a clear link between pCR rates in low-grade vs. high-grade disease. A meta-analysis of neoadjuvant studies has shown that pCR rates were lower in patients with low-grade, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumours, and higher in the following tumour subtypes in increasing order: high-grade HR+, HR+/HER2+, triple negative, and hormone receptor-negative (HR-)/HER2+. In addition, patients with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

more aggressive tumour subtypes who achieved pCR seemed to have greater EFS benefit compared to patients who did not achieve pCR (Cortazar et al., Lancet 2014).  An analysis of pCR, excluding patients with tumours of 'unknown grade' showed that bpCR and tpCR were comparable with the findings in the ITT analysis (data not shown) which is reassuring. Thus, it seems that the overall estimate is not influenced by the population of patients with 'unknown tumour grade'.

tpCR is, as expected highest in the ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study and comparable between Arms A-C in the TRYPHAENA study with regard to patients with high-grade disease (poorly differentiated). Very few patients had low grade disease (well differentiated), and a meaningful comparison is not possible.

A comparison of high-grade HR+ disease with HR+ in general showed higher rate of tpCR in the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. This is in line with the findings in the meta-analysis by Cortazar et al, Lancet 2014. The same comparison in the TRYPHAENA study showed comparable effect in both groups. However, the subgroups are small and no firm conclusions can be drawn.

In the overall patient population of both studies, efficacy results are considered clinically relevant.

In both studies pCR rates and magnitude of improvement with pertuzumab were lower in the subgroup of patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumours compared to patients with hormone receptornegative tumours. In particular, in NEOSPHERE (study including non pertuzumab-containing control arm) subgroup analyses, patients with hormone receptor-positive disease had lower bpCR rates (5.9% - 26%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]) than patients with hormone receptornegative disease (27.3% - 63.2%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]).

The poor response in HR-positive disease in NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies is biologically plausible and consistent with the majority of data reported in the literature. However, the importance of HER2-targeted therapy in HR+ disease should not be neglected and hormone therapy alone has shown very low efficacy in patients with HR+/HER2+ disease in a number of trials (TAnDEM (Kaufman B et al. 2009, J Clin Oncol.); study eLEcTRA (Huober J, et al. 2009, Cancer Res.), study CALGB-40302 (Burstein HJ et al. 2014, J Clin Oncol). In addition, the published meta-analyses driven by the FDA (Cortazar et al. 2014, Lancet), which included individual patient data from approximately 12.000 patients, showed that there is a clear advantage in terms of long-term outcomes in patients with HER2+ disease, who achieve a pCR, irrespective of hormone receptor (HR) status. Moreover, the CLEOPATRA study clearly showed a Hazard Ratio for OS of 0.71 (0.51, 0.96) in patients with HR+ disease, compared with 0.61 (0.47, 0.81) in patients with HR-negative disease. Thus, the CHMP concluded that there is solid evidence for a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect of pertuzumab in HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic setting, regardless of hormone receptor status. In the context of the totality of data and the above discussion, it is reasonable to expect that this should also be the case in the neoadjuvant setting.

Regarding pCR data by disease stage/type, tpCR by disease stage/type seems to in line with the overall estimate. In both studies, pCR rates were similar in patients with operable versus locally advanced disease (see SmPC section 5.1). Regarding the tumour stage it is noted that a low percentage of IBC was included. However, baseline demographic and disease characteristics were sufficiently consistent with expectations for such a population. In the NEOSPHERE study, there were too few patients with inflammatory breast cancer to draw any firm conclusions, but the pCR rate was higher in patients who received Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel. In the TRYPHAENA study, there were also too few patients with inflammatory breast cancer to draw any firm conclusions. This has been reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The DFS, PFS and OS data are not mature yet for the TRYPHAENA study. DFS and PFS data were provided for the NEOSPHERE study. The long term outcome data (PSF, DFS, PFS pCR versus non-pCR) in the overall population of the NEOSPHERE study, although not statistically powered and with wide CIs, showed HRs consistent with the observed pCR increase. However, none of the two studies (NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA) were powered to detect a difference. Efficacy data that should permit confirmation of the positive results seen in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies are expected from the much larger phase III study (APHINITY) of adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy plus pertuzumab or placebo in patients with primary operable breast cancer.

The SAG Oncology was consulted and discussed whether the difference in tpCR rate of 17.8% between Arm  A  and  B  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  is  sufficiently  large  enough  to  translate  into  a  significant difference with regard to DFS and OS. Given the existing uncertainty about pCR as a surrogate for DFS and  OS,  the  SAG  concluded  that  a  difference  of  18%  does  not  allow  to  automatically  conclude  a significant difference with regard to long-term benefit. In addition NEOSPHERE design was not optimal to address this question of surrogacy (not all major treatments were given in the neoadjuvant setting, e.g., anthracyclines, and this may lead to overestimating the treatment effect of the experimental drug pertuzumab). However, the SAG agreed that in the context of the totality of the data, in particular, the strong biological rationale for the combination, the compelling efficacy results in the metastatic setting, the  acceptable  toxicity  profile  (see  clinical  safety),  and  the  observed  effect  in  terms  of  pCR,  it  is reasonably likely that neoadjuvant treatment with pertuzumab is associated with a benefit in terms of DFS and OS. A precise estimation of the expected long-term benefit is currently not possible based on the available data. Although based on a small number of events (18% and 16% for the control and pertuzumab group, respectively, cut-off 20 October 2014), exploration of the event-free survival by treatment showed a HR of 0.69 (95% CI [0.34, 1.40]), which is encouraging.

Importantly,  the  trial  in  the  adjuvant  setting  (APHINITY)  has  completed  its  recruitment.  The  final analysis of invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) from the APHINITY study (phase III) should permit confirmation  of  the  clinical  benefit  of  pertuzumab  observed  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  from  the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies (see Annex II).

The MAH has also initiated the BERENICE study, which will enrol a similar patient population to that enrolled  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  studies.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  is  cardiac safety  of  pertuzumab  in  combination  with  two  commonly  used  neoadjuvant  regimens.  Secondary endpoints  include  overall  safety  and  pCR  rate.  The  study  is  planned  to  enrol  approximately  400 patients  (200  patients  in  each  cohort).  Safety  and  efficacy  data  from  the  neoadjuvant  period  are anticipated in 2017. Thus, this study will also provide valuable information with regard to efficacy and safety on the use of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting (see Annex II).

The SAG Oncology also discussed the data in the HR-positive population and noted that the lower pCR rates observed in patients with HR+ tumours adds to the uncertainty with regard to long-term benefit. However, the subgroup analysis is based on very limited data and it is difficult to rule out the play of chance. Although the observed effect was lower in patients with HR+ tumours, in the context of the totality of the data (see above), the effect is still considered to be reasonably likely associated with a benefit in terms of long-term outcomes. Further understanding about the long-term effects in this subgroup of patients is expected on the basis of the ongoing adjuvant trial (APHINITY).

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

In conclusion, in the context of the totality of the data, in particular, the strong biological rationale for the combination, the compelling efficacy results in the metastatic setting, the acceptable toxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

profile, and the observed effect in terms of pCR, the efficacy is considered established. Although not statistically significant, efficacy outcome data (DFS and OS) from the NEOSPHERE study shows a trend in favour of pertuzumab. This should also be seen in light of the survival benefit of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the metastatic setting.

Confirmatory study data in terms of DFS and OS are considered necessary to address long term efficacy of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. Study APHINITY has been included as a condition in the Annex II as post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES). Further efficacy data are also expected from the post-authorisation safety study BERENICE.

| Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to provide long-term efficacy data in terms of DFS and OS, the MAH should submit the results of study BO25126 (APHINITY), a randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab plus placebo versus chemotherapy plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with operable HER2-positive primary breast cancer                              | May 2017   |

The evaluation of clinical safety included safety data from the two neoadjuvant studies, NEOSPHERE (WO20697) and TRYPHAENA (BO22280), and a supporting study, CLEOPATRA (WO20698/TOC4129g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Overall, the two neoadjuvant studies provided safety data for 532 patients treated with pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy (e.g., docetaxel, FEC or TCH) in the neoadjuvant setting. This included safety data from 309 patients in the NEOSPHERE study and 223 patients in the TRYPHAENA study.

The supporting study CLEOPATRA provided safety data from 408 patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were exposed to pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel, i.e., the same regimen used during the neoadjuvant phase in the Ptz+T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study and part of the neoadjuvant regimen used in two of the treatment arms in the TRYPHAENA study (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D and FEC/Ptz+T+D).

As NEOSPHERE, TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA evaluated different combination regimens in different patient populations (LABC/IBC/EBC vs. metastatic breast cancer), safety data from the three trials were presented as stand-alone tables.

In  the  CLEOPATRA  study,  patients  received  placebo+T+D  or  Ptz+T+D  every  three  weeks  until progression of disease, withdrawal or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were exposed to pertuzumab for a much longer time compared with patients in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies. On average, 25.4 cycles of Ptz+T+D have been administrated. Patients received a median of 8 cycles of Ptz+T+D. Because Ptz+T could be given after discontinuation of docetaxel, they also received a median 24 cycles of Ptz+T, including the cycles given with docetaxel. Some patients received up to 42 cycles of all three agents (Ptz+T+D).

## Adverse Events - all grades

## Study NEOSPHERE

During the neoadjuvant period, the most common SOCs affected (i.e., occurring in ≥ 25% of patients across all treatment arms) were Gastrointestinal Disorders (of which diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis were the most common [occurring in &gt; 10% of patients in any arm]) and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (most commonly fatigue, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, pyrexia, and peripheral oedema).

In the Ptz+T+D arm, there was a higher incidence of Cardiac Disorders (11.2%, vs. 4.7%, 5.6%, and 3.2% in the T+D, Ptz+T, and Ptz+D arms, respectively). Between the T+D and Ptz+T+D arms, the incidence of AEs was comparable in most SOCs, with the exception of Gastrointestinal Disorders (more events in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D arm), Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (more events in the T+D arm compared with the Ptz+T+D arm), and Infections and Infestations (more events in the T+D arm compared with the Ptz+T+D arm).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the neoadjuvant period, the most frequently occurring AEs (i.e., reported in ≥ 25% of patients in any arm) were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, rash and mucosal inflammation (see Table below).

In the adjuvant period, the most common AEs reported (i.e., those reported in ≥ 25% of patients in any treatment arm) were similar to those reported for the neoadjuvant period (e.g., nausea, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea and alopecia) with the exception of radiation skin injury, which occurred in similar proportions of patients across treatment arms (20.4% in the T+D arm, 18.6% in the Ptz+T+D arm, 23.4% in the Ptz+T arm, and 27.3% in the Ptz+D arm).

As of the third clinical cutoff date (12 July 2013), of the 378 patients who entered the post-treatment follow-up period, 7 patients (6.5%) in the T+D arm, 9 patients (8.4%) in the Ptz+T+D arm, 7 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(6.5%) in the Ptz+T arm, and 7 patients (7.4%) in the Ptz+D arm experienced AEs. Most of these occurred in the early post-treatment follow-up period (i.e., before the second clinical cutoff, 09 March 2012). LVD was reported in 3 patients (2.8%) in the Ptz+T+D arm and in 2 patients (2.1%) in the Ptz+D arm. Other common events included musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders such as myalgia and arthralgia (experienced by 3 patients in the T+D arm and 2 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm) and gastrointestinal disorders (experienced by 4 patients in total: 1 patient in the T+D arm, 2 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm and 1 patient in the Ptz+T arm). Five AEs were reported between the second (9 March 2012) and third clinical cutoff date (12 July 2013) and all were considered unrelated to study treatment.

## Study TRYPHAENA

In the neoadjuvant period, the most common SOCs affected (i.e., occurring in ≥ 25% across all treatment arms) were: Gastrointestinal Disorders, Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Infections and Infestations, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders, Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders.

The incidence of AEs was highest in the Ptz+TCH arm (&gt; 10% difference compared with both of the other two treatment arms) in the following SOC: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (61% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 65% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 78% in the Ptz+TCH arm); Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (24% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 16% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 34% in the Ptz+TCH arm); Investigations (19% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 13% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 33% in the Ptz+TCH arm).

The incidence of patients with Cardiac Disorders was lowest in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm compared with the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and Ptz+TCH arm (5.3%, vs. 11.1% and 10.5%, respectively).  LVD was the most frequently reported event (4 patients [5.6%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 3 patients [4.0%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 2 patients [2.6%] in the Ptz+TCH arm).

The majority of patients who entered the adjuvant period experienced at least one AE (57/68 [84%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 60/65 [92%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 53/67 [79%] in the Ptz+TCH arm). The most common SOCs affected (i.e., in ≥25% of patients across all 3 treatment arms) were Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (33.8% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 40.0% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 32.8% in the Ptz+TCH arm), and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (26.5% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 36.9% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm vs. 32.8% in the Ptz+TCH arm). Across treatment arms, the most common AE was radiation skin injury (11/68 [16.2%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 14/65 [21.5%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 7/67 [10.4%] in the Ptz+TCH arm).

In general, the most common SOCs affected and most frequently occurring AEs in the overall treatment period were similar to those reported for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant periods. In the overall treatment period, the incidence of patients with Cardiac Disorders was comparable between the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (15.3% vs. 16.0%), with a slightly higher frequency reported in the Ptz+TCH arm (21.1%). The most frequently reported AEs occurring in the SOC, Cardiac Disorders were LVD, palpitations and tachycardia.

In the post-treatment follow-up period, 6 patients (8.3%) in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 9 patients (12.0%) in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 5 patients (6.6%) in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced AEs. During this period, the most common AE (occurring in more than 2% of patients in any treatment arm) was LVD (1.4% of patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 4.0% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, and 2.6% in the Ptz+TCH arm). All other events occurred in single patients.

## Study CLEOPATRA

As of the clinical cutoff date of 14 May 2012, the overall incidence of AEs was balanced between the treatment arms (98.7% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 100% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm), although the total number of AEs reported in the Ptz+T+D arm (6521 AEs) was higher than in the Pla+T+D arm (5535 AEs). The majority of AEs in both treatment arms were Grade 1-2 in severity: 4890 of 5535 AEs (88.3%) in the Pla+T+D arm and 5773 of 6521 AEs (88.5%) in the Ptz+T+D arm.

In both treatment arms, the most common AEs (i.e., occurring in ≥ 25% of patients in either arm) included alopecia, diarrhoea, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, asthenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, peripheral edema and mucosal inflammation.

The incidence of diarrhoea, rash, mucosal inflammation, pruritus, febrile neutropenia and dry skin was higher (≥ 5% difference) in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the Pla+T+D arm, whereas the incidence of  peripheral  edema  and  constipation  was  higher  (≥  5%  difference)  in  the  Pla+T+D  arm  compared with the Ptz+T+D arm.

Overall, 17.4% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm (69 patients) and 15.4% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm (63 patients) experienced Cardiac Disorders. The most frequently reported cardiac-related AE was LVD (8.6% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 5.4% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm).

The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  experienced  at  least  one  AE  considered  by  the Investigator to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to study treatment (96.2% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm and 97.3% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm). The most commonly reported AEs that were considered related to study treatment by the Investigator were alopecia, diarrhoea, nausea, neutropenia,  fatigue,  rash,  asthenia,  mucosal  inflammation,  decreased  appetite,  nail  disorder  and myalgia.

The post-treatment follow-up period in the CLEOPATRA study was defined as starting more than 42 days after discontinuation of study medication. During the post-treatment follow-up period, 12 patients (3.0%) and 10 patients (2.5%) reported a total of 14 and 19 AEs in the Pla+T+D and Ptz+T+D arms, respectively. One event, Prinzmetal angina in a patient in the Pla+T+D arm, was considered serious and related to study treatment. All other AEs reported during this period were non-serious, and no notable difference in incidence of AEs was observed between the treatment arms.

## Adverse events grade ≥ 3

## Study NEOSPHERE

During the neoadjuvant period, the majority of patients (62.6%-72.9%) in the docetaxel-containing treatment arms (i.e., T+D, Ptz+T+D, and Ptz+D arms) experienced at least one AE of Grade ≥ 3 severity compared with 6.5% in the Ptz+T arm. The majority of Grade ≥ 3 AEs were Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (mainly neutropenia and leukopenia), and these were reported by fewer patients in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the T+D or Ptz+D arms.

As expected, during the adjuvant period, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was highest in the Ptz+T arm (67.0%, compared with 35.9% in the T+D arm, 35.3% in the Ptz+T+D arm and 38.6% in the Ptz+D arm, which was likely due to the administration of 3 cycles of docetaxel (in addition to 3 cycles of FEC) during the adjuvant period in this arm (all other arms received docetaxel in the neoadjuvant period only). The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs (i.e., those reported in &gt; 5% of patients in any treatment arm) were haematological toxicities: neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and granulocytopenia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During adjuvant trastuzumab treatment following the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, 8 patients (7.8%) in the T+D arm, 8 patients (7.8%) in Ptz+T+D arm, 10 patients (10.6%) in the Ptz+T arm and 8 patients (9.1%) in the Ptz+D arm experienced Grade ≥  3 AEs.

During the overall treatment period, Grade ≥ 3 AEs were generally balanced across treatment arms during the study, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Ptz+T arm (60.2%, compared with 81.3% in the T+D arm, 72.9% in the Ptz+T+D arm and 78.7% in the Ptz+D arm).

The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs (i.e., those reported in ≥ 5% of patients in any treatment arm) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, irregular menstruation and diarrhea. Of note, in the Ptz+T arm, although the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was lowest (4.6%) compared with the other treatment arms, the incidence of Grade ≥3 granulocytopenia was highest (4.6%).

Three Grade 3 events (no Grade 4 or 5 events) were reported in the post-treatment follow-up period: one event of abdominal distention in a patient in the T+D arm (which was considered unrelated to study treatment and remained unresolved at the time of the clinical cutoff date); one event of myeloproliferative disorder in a patient in the Ptz+D arm; and one event of  'breast prosthesis removal' in a patient in the Ptz+D arm.

## Study TRYPHAENA

During the neoadjuvant period, the proportion of patients experiencing an AE of Grade ≥ 3 severity was 69% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 60% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 74% in the Ptz+TCH arm. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were predominately Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, with neutropenia the most commonly reported event (43% -47% of patients across treatment arms), followed by febrile neutropenia (18.1% of patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 9.0% of patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 17.1% of patients in the Ptz+TCH arm). Grade ≥ 3 Infection and Infestation AEs occurred in 4% -8% of patients across treatment arms, with no single event predominating. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenic infection occurred in 2 patients (1 each in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and the Ptz+TCH arm), and Grade ≥ 3 neutropenic sepsis occurred in one patient (in the Ptz+TCH arm). Grade ≥ 3 anemia was notably higher in the Ptz+TCH arm (17%) than in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D and FEC/Ptz+T+D arms (1% and 3%, respectively). Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia also occurred exclusively in patients in the Ptz+TCH arm (11.8% of patients), which led to dose modification of study treatment in some patients. Grade ≥ 3 LVD occurred in only two patients (2.7%), both in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm.

Of the patients who entered the adjuvant period, a total of 9 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 10 patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 8 patients in the Ptz+TCH arms experienced a Grade ≥ 3 AE in the adjuvant period. One fatal event was reported ('metastatic neoplasm', which appeared to be due to relapse of the patient's underlying breast cancer), and occurred in a patient in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm. All other events were Grade 3 and occurred in single patients, with the exception of erythema (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm), pneumonia (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm) and neutropenia (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 3 in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 1 in the Ptz+TCH arm).

In the overall treatment period, the proportion of patients experiencing an AE of Grade ≥ 3 was similar to that seen during the neoadjuvant period (73.6% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 61.3% in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 73.7% in the Ptz+TCH arm).

Two Grade ≥ 3 events were reported in the post-treatment follow-up period, both in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm: one patient experienced NYHA Class II symptomatic LVSD (NCI-CTCAE Grade 3), which later improved, and one patient (who received docetaxel in the post-treatment follow-up period) experienced a Grade 4 event of neutropenic infection, which resolved without sequelae.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)

## Cardiac dysfunction

Reporting of cardiac safety was similar but not identical in the three studies. Although Investigators were to report left ventricular dysfunction events as asymptomatic or symptomatic LVSD in the TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA studies, these events were both coded to 'left ventricular dysfunction' (LVD), according to MedDRA. Symptomatic LVD is distinguishable from asymptomatic LVD in these studies by NCICTCAE grading (symptomatic events are Grade 3 or greater). In the NEOSPHERE study, symptomatic LVSD was reportable as 'congestive heart failure' (CHF), which coded to the term, 'heart failure, congestive' according to MedDRA. In all three studies, asymptomatic declines in LVEF were only reportable as AEs (using the term, 'left ventricular systolic dysfunction' [LVSD]) if they met certain criteria. However, if an event met any criteria for seriousness (e.g., hospitalization), this was reportable as an SAE.

When analyzing the data, SAEs considered suggestive of CHF were defined as SAEs coded to a preferred term (PT) in the standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) 'Cardiac Failure (wide).' This included symptomatic events reported as SAEs under the term LVSD (MedDRA PT LVD), as well as other events reported as SAEs (such as pulmonary edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, etc).

## Study NEOSPHERE

To  ensure  that  differences  in  cardiac  safety  profile  in  the  four  arms  of  the  study  were  not  due  to imbalances  in  potential  risk  factors  at  baseline,  these  were  compared  and  no  major  imbalances between the treatment arms were apparent.

## Cardiac events

In the Neoadjuvant Period, there were slightly more cardiac disorders in Arm B (Ptz+T+D), but these were  mostly  palpitations  in  relation  with  infusions.  5  patients  (4.7%)  in  the  T+D  arm,  12  patients (11.2%) in the Ptz+T+D arm, 6 patients (5.6%) in the Ptz+T arm and 3 patients (3.2%) in the Ptz+D arms  experienced  at  least  one  AE  in  the  SOC,  Cardiac  Disorders.  Many  of  these  events  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

palpitations  or  tachycardia,  and  some  of  these  occurred  on  the  day  of  a  study  treatment  infusion, suggesting they were infusion-related events. There were 3 cases of left ventricular dysfunction.

In the Adjuvant Period, the proportion of patients with AEs in the SOC, Cardiac Disorders was highest in the Ptz+T+D arm (12.7%) and lowest in the T+D arm (3.9%). The most common cardiac AEs were LVD and palpitations, each reported in 11 patients. Of the 11 patients with LVD in the adjuvant period (1 in the T+D arm, 5 in the Ptz+T+D arm, 0 in the Ptz+T arm and 5 in the Ptz+D arm), all events resolved without sequelae, with the exception of one patient in the Ptz+D arm, for whom palpitations remained unresolved. Overall, there were also more cardiac disorders in Arm B, with 5 cases of left ventricular dysfunction. In contrast to the neoadjuvant period, the risk of LVD seemed to be slightly increased in Arm D (Ptz+D) in the adjuvant setting.

During the overall treatment period, the incidence of LVD was higher in the pertuzumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel-treated group (7.5%) compared to the trastuzumab and docetaxel-treated group (1.9%). There was one case of symptomatic LVD in the Perjeta and trastuzumab-treated group. Only two patients had a Grade ≥3 LVD; one patient in each of Arm B (Ptz+T+D) and Arm C (Ptz+T). Similarly, only two patients experienced a LVD leading to withdrawal from study treatment.

Looking at potential risk factors, several of the patients had a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia/dyslipidemia, and were being treated with antihypertensiva and statins. The majority of the events were asymptomatic.

There were few cases of LVD in the follow-up period. Those few cases that occurred were not serious and resolved without sequelae.

In conclusion, there were more cases of LVD in the Ptz+T+D arm, but these were only Grade 3, asymptomatic and in some cases seen in patients with cardiac risk factors.

## Changes in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction during the NEOSPHERE Study

To enter the study, patients had to have an LVEF of ≥55%. Patients in all four treatment arms had mean and median LVEF values of about 65% at baseline (individual patient values range from 53%81%). The majority of patients (~60%-70%) in all four treatment arms had no change in LVEF over the overall treatment period.

The  greatest  decline  in  LVEF  was  around  7-8%,  and  most  of  the  patients  remained  above  50%  in LVEF. About 20 patients experienced a decline more than 10%. Of these, 9 patients had a decline in LVEF on two consecutive LVEF measurements.  LVEF decline seemed to be small and only a fraction of the patients experience more than 10% on two consecutive measurements.

## Study TRYPHAENA

## Cardiac events

In the neoadjuvant period, 8 patients (11.1%) in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 4 patients (5.3%) in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 8 patients (10.5%) in the Ptz+TCH arm, experienced at least one AE in the SOC, Cardiac Disorders. As seen in the NEOSPHERE study, the most common cardiac AEs were LVD and palpitations, with all other events occurring in two patients or fewer. Overall, there were less AEs in Arm B, but the number of LVD is more or less comparable between the three arms.

In the adjuvant period, a total of 27 patients (5 [7.4%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 10 patients [15.4%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 12 patients [17.9%] in the Ptz+TCH arm) experienced at least one AE in the SOC, Cardiac Disorders. Of these, 4 patients (5.9%) in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 5 patients (7.7%) in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 3 patients (4.5%) in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced LVD,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

including one patient in the Ptz+TCH arm who experienced symptomatic LVSD (assessed by Investigator as being NYHA Class II; NCI-CTCAE Grade 3).

During the overall treatment period, the incidence of LVD (during the overall treatment period) was 8.3% in the group treated with Perjeta plus trastuzumab and FEC (followed by Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel); 9.3% in the group treated with Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC; and 6.6% in the group treated with Perjeta in combination with TCH. The incidence of symptomatic LVD (congestive heart failure) was 1.3% in the group treated with Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC (this excludes a patient who experienced symptomatic LVD during FEC treatment prior to receiving Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel) and also 1.3% in the group treated with Perjeta in combination with TCH. No patients in the group treated with Perjeta plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by Perjeta plus trastuzumab and docetaxel experienced symptomatic LVD (see SmPC section 4.8).

The primary endpoints of study TRYPHAENA were:

-  Incidence  of  symptomatic  cardiac  events  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator  (Grade  3,  4  or  5 symptomatic LVSD)

- Clinically significant LVEF declines over the course of the neoadjuvant period (LVEF decline of ≥10% from baseline and to a value of &lt;50%)

Following exposure to the study treatment, three patients (none in Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D), 2 in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) and 1 in Arm C (Ptz+TCH)) experienced symptomatic LVSD. Only one of these events  occurred  in  the  neoadjuvant  treatment  period  (Arm  B)  during  FEC  treatment  and  prior  to pertuzumab, and a single event presented in the adjuvant period (Arm C) and in the post-treatment follow-up period (Arm B).

The majority of patients who experienced LVEF declines of at least 10%-points from baseline to below 50% were observed on local readings (5 patients in Arm A, 9 patients in Arm B and 7 patients in Arm C). The central LVEF readings identified 4 patients (3 in Arm B and 1 in Arm C) with significant LVEF declines that were not identified on local readings.

Nine patients (2 in Arm A, 5 in Arm B and 2 in Arm C) had declines in LVEF of at least 10%-points from baseline to below 50%, during the post-treatment follow-up period. One of these 9 patients (in Arm B) had experienced an LVEF decline during the adjuvant treatment period, which continued into the  post-treatment  follow-up  period;  3  of  these  9  patients  (2  in  Arm  A  and  1  in  Arm  B)  had experienced a previous LVEF decline with recovery to ≥ 50% during study treatment.

Mean LVEF dropped to below baseline during treatment in all three treatment arms, however, mean decreases were less than 5%-points in all cases, for values based on local readings and no more than 8%-points for values based on central readings. The profile for mean change in LVEF from baseline was similar in the three treatment arms. In general, the decline was greatest at Cycle 6.

Overall, there were only very few cases of symptomatic LVSD, and no sign of any difference between the treatment arms.  There were slightly more patients with LVEF decline in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) and C (Ptz+TCH).

## Study CLEOPATRA

## Cardiac Events

At the time of the clinical cutoff of 14 May 2012, the proportion of patients who had AEs during the study  treatment  period  in  the  SOC,  Cardiac  Disorders  was  comparable  between  treatment  arms (17.4% of patients in the Pla+T+D arm vs. 15.4% of patients in the Ptz+T+D arm), despite longer time on study treatment in the Ptz+T+D arm. LVD was the most common cardiac AE reported, with 34 patients (8.6%) experiencing LVD AEs in the Pla+T+D arm, and 22 patients (5.4%) in the Ptz+T+D arm. As seen in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA studies, palpitations and tachycardia were the most frequently reported cardiac AEs, other than LVD. The proportion of patients experiencing Grade ≥ 3 LVD (13 patients [3.3%] vs. 5 patients [1.2%]) was higher in the Pla+T+D arm vs. the Ptz+T+D arm, although  symptomatic  LVD  and  LVD  reported  as  an  SAE  was  balanced  between  the  two  treatment arms. The proportion of patients who experienced cardiac SAEs overall was also higher in the Pla+T+D arm (3.5% of patients) than in the Ptz+T+D arm (1.7% of patients).

Overall, there were equal numbers of cardiac disorders in the two arms. However, the incidence of LVD during  study  treatment  was  higher  in  the  placebo-treated  group  than  in  the  Perjeta-treated  group (8.6%  and  5.4%,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  symptomatic  LVD  was  also  lower  in  the  Perjeta treated group (1.8% in the placebo-treated group vs. 1.2% in the Perjeta-treated group) (see section 4.8).

## Infusion-related Reactions

Study NEOSPHERE: The overall incidence and pattern of infusion-related reactions were comparable between the pertuzumab containing arms. There were very few Grade 3 or 4 AEs.

Study TRYPHAENA: More AEs were observed in Arm C (Ptz+TCH), but the number of Grade 3 or 4 AEs was comparable between the three arms.

Study CLEOPATRA: The overall incidence was slightly higher in the Ptz+T+D arm, and only 1 Grade 3/4  AE  was  observed  in  each  arm.  However,  the  incidence  of  infusion-related  reactions  was considerable higher in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA compared to the CLEOPATRA study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA trials in the neoadjuvant setting, Perjeta was administered on the same day as the other study treatment drugs in all cycles. Overall, infusion reactions were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA at the cycles when Perjeta was given on the same day as trastuzumab and docetaxel, with a majority of reactions being mild or moderate (see SmPC section 4.8).

## Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity

Study NEOSPHERE: There were few cases of anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity. The majority of the AEs were Grade 1-2. Only three patients experienced a Grade 3 AE (2 AEs were attributed to docetaxel).

Study TRYPHAENA: Only 1 AE was observed in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D). In Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D)  and  C  (Ptz+TCH)  comparable  numbers  were  observed  (7  (9.7%)  vs.  10 (13.2%). Patients  in  Arm  B  received  only  three  doses  of  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab,  which  may explain the incidence rate.

Study CLEOPATRA: The incidence was comparable between the two treatment arms, and the majority of cases were mild.

In NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA trials in the neoadjuvant setting, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA. In NEOSPHERE, two patients in the Perjeta and docetaxel-treated group experienced anaphylaxis. In TRYPHAENA, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis was highest in the Perjeta and TCH treated group (13.2%), of which 2.6% were NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 (see SmPC section 4.8).

## Leukopenia and Leukopenic Infection Events

## Study NEOSPHERE:

The overall incidence rate of blood and lymphatic system disorders was comparable between Arm A (T+D) and D (Ptz+D). The incidence rate was slightly lower in Arm B. There was only one event in Arm C (Ptz+T), which reflects the fact that these AEs are associated with chemotherapy. Only one patient, in  Arm  D,  discontinued  treatment.  Febrile  neutropenia  rates  were  similar  across  Arm  A  (T+D),  B (Ptz+T+  D)  and  D  (Ptz+D).  8.4%  of  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and docetaxel experienced febrile neutropenia compared with 7.5% of patients treated with trastuzumab and docetaxel. There were few events of infections.

As in the CLEOPATRA study, a higher incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia was observed among Asian patients compared with other patients in both neoadjuvant trials. In NEOSPHERE, 8.3% of Asian patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel experienced febrile neutropenia compared with 4.0% of Asian patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel (see SmPC section 4.8).

Study TRYPHAENA: The overall incidence was slightly lower in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D); However, the rate  of  neutropenia  was  comparable  across  the  three  arms.  Febrile  neutropenia  occurred  less frequently  in  Arm  B.  Febrile  neutropenia  occurred  in  17.1%  of  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant Perjeta  +  TCH,  and  9.3%  of  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel following FEC. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in patients who received six cycles of Perjeta compared with patients who received three cycles of Perjeta, independent of the chemotherapy given (see SmPC section 4.8).

## Study CLEOPATRA:

The overall incidence was comparable between the two arms and the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in the Ptz+T+D arm were comparable to the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study. In conclusion, there is no indication of any excess cases of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia by adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

## Diarrhoea

Study NEOSPHERE: In the neoadjuvant period, the incidence of diarrhoea was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm (85 episodes in 49 patients [45.8%]) and the Ptz+D arm (72 episodes in 51 patients [54.3%]) than in the T+D and Ptz+T arms (49 and 48 episodes in 36 patients [33.6%]) and 30 patients [27.8%], respectively. Overall, 51.4% of the patients in Arm B experienced diarrhoea. In Arm A and C the incidences were lower. Most events were mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was low and comparable across treatment arms.

Study TRYPHAENA: Diarrhoea was most common Arm C (Ptz+TCH) and in the neoadjuvant period, and less common in the adjuvant period. Diarrhoea occurred in 72.3% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta+TCH and 61.4% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC. Most events were mild to moderate in severity (see SmPC section 4.8).

Study CLEOPATRA: The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in the experimental (68.1%) arm and was often observed in the first cycle.

In conclusion, the overall incidence rate of diarrhoea was lower in Arm B (Ptz+T+D) in the NEOSPHERE study compared to the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study, which is reassuring.

## Rash

In the NEOSPHERE trial, rash occurred in 40.2% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with 29.0% of patients treated with trastuzumab and docetaxel.

The overall incidence rate of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was low and comparable between the Arms A (T+D), B (Ptz+T+D) and D (Ptz+D), while it was even lower in Arm C (Ptz+T).

In the TRYPHAENA trial, rash occurred in 36.8% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta + TCH and 20.0% of patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC. The incidence of rash was higher in patients who received six cycles of Perjeta compared with patients who received three cycles of Perjeta, independent of the chemotherapy given.

These results were comparable with the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study, which suggested that there is no increased risk of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

## Mucositis

In  NEOSPHERE,  mucositis  was  common  during  the  neoadjuvant  and  adjuvant  treatment  periods (33.6% and 24.3% of patients in the T+D arm, 45.8% and 30.4% in the Ptz+T+D arm, 9.3% and 39.4%  in  the  Ptz+T  arm  and  43.6%  and  25.0%  in  the  Ptz+D  arm  respectively).  Only  2  patients experienced Grade ≥ 3 mucositis (1 in the Ptz+T+D arm and 1 in the Ptz+D arm).

Overall, 46.7% of patients in the T+D arm, 54.2% in the Ptz+T+D arm, 38.9% in the Ptz+T arm and 50.0% in the Ptz+D arm experienced mucositis, but only 4 patients experienced Grade &gt; 3 mucositis at any time (3 in the Ptz+T+D arm and 1 in the Ptz+D arm).

During the neoadjuvant period, 45.8% of patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 41.3% of patients in  the  FEC/Ptz+T+D  arm  and  34.2%  of  patients  in  the  Ptz+TCH  arm  experienced  mucositis (t\\_ae15\\_muc\\_neo). Most of these were Grade 1-2 in severity. Only 1, 2 and 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 mucositis event in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D, FEC/Ptz+T+D and Ptz+TCH arms, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As in the NEOSPHERE study, mucosal inflammation and stomatitis were the most frequently reported events

Mucositis is a common AESI, and most frequently observed in the experimental arm of the CLEOPATRA study, when comparing all three studies. This AE occurred much less frequently in the Ptz+T arm of the NEOSPHERE study, thus indicating that it is closely associated with chemotherapy.

## Interstitial Lung Disease

Very few and sporadic cases were observed. No firm conclusions can be drawn.

## Hepatic Disorders

Very  few  cases  were  observed  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  studies.  One  patient  in  the TRYPHAENA study withdrew from treatment due to Grade 2 ASAT, Grade 3 ALAT and Grade 3 GGT abnormalities. Event rates were low and comparable in the CLEOPATRA study. However, one event of fulminant  hepatitis  had  a  fatal  outcome  (please  see  under  'Deaths').    It  is  difficult  to  draw  any conclusions, but pertuzumab does not seem to have hepatotoxic effects when added to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

## Venous Thromboembolic Events

As of the clinical cutoff date of 12 July 2013 in the NEOSPHERE study, 4 patients (1.0%) experienced VTEs during the study overall: 2 in the Ptz+T+D arm (1.9% of patients) and 2 in the Ptz+D arm (2.1% of patients), one of which was Grade &gt; 3. Two of these events were reported in the neoadjuvant period and 2 in the adjuvant period.

In the TRYPHAENA study, overall, 4 patients (1.8%) experienced VTEs in the TRYPHAENA study; 3 patients in the neoadjuvant period (2 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 1 patient in the Ptz+TCH arm) and 1 patient in the adjuvant period (in the FEC/Ptz+T+D).

VTE occurred more frequently in the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study. However, only very few cases have been observed in the two neoadjuvant studies to draw any conclusions.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

In  the  neoadjuvant  period  one  patient  died  (NEOSPHERE)  of  fulminant  hepatitis.  This  patient  had  a history of obesity, diabetes and hypertension, and was being treated for these conditions. However, the patient was admitted to a local hospital and no liver biopsy nor hepatitis serology were performed. Also,  no  autopsy  was  performed.  Furthermore,  there  are  also  uncertainties  with  regard  to  the treatment received at the local hospital. Hepatic failure was not observed in the experimental arm of the CLEOPATRA study.

The  other  two  deaths  in  the  neoadjuvant  period  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  were  due  to  PD  and metastases.

There were no non-PD deaths in the TRYPHAENA study and 6 non-PD deaths in the NEOSPHERE study. Four cases had 'unknown' reason and two cases were due to primary colorectal cancer.

In the post-treatment follow-up period, 25 (NEOSPHERE) and 12 (TRYPHAENA) deaths occurred. The majority of  deaths  were assessed as unrelated or 'not known' in relation to trial treatment. In the NEOSPHERE follow up treatment period the MAH did not report the cause of death for 4 patients but classified the events as not related to study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse events (SAEs)

## Study NEOSPHERE

During the neoadjuvant period, the incidence of SAEs was broadly comparable in the T+D arm, Ptz+T+D arm and the Ptz+D arm (15-20 SAEs per arm in 10%-17% of patients), and lowest in the Ptz+T arm (4 SAEs, 4% of patients). The most frequently reported SAEs in the T+D arm, Ptz+T+D arm and the Ptz+D arm were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia; however SAEs occurred across multiple body systems, with no marked difference in incidence between any of these arms. One patient in the Ptz+T+D arm experienced an SAE of fulminant hepatitis that was fatal. One patient in the Ptz+T arm experienced an SAE of congestive cardiac failure in the neoadjuvant.

During the adjuvant period, the incidence of SAEs was highest in the Ptz+T arm (18.1%). Most of the SAEs in the Ptz+T arm were events known to be associated with docetaxel (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection); therefore, the higher incidence in the Ptz+T arm was likely due to the administration of docetaxel during the adjuvant period in this arm (all other arms received docetaxel in the neoadjuvant period only). SAEs that occurred in &gt; 1 patient in any treatment arm included febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pyrexia and LVD.

Following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, a total of 10 patients experienced SAEs during adjuvant trastuzumab (4 [3.9%] in the Ptz+T+D arm, 5 [5.3%] in the Ptz+T arm and 1 [1.1%] in the Ptz+D arm), all of which resolved with no sequelae.

During  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period,  1  patient  in  the  Ptz+D  arm  experienced  an  SAE  of myeloproliferative disorder. The event was considered possibly related to study treatment (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide), and remained unresolved at the time of the clinical cutoff date.

## Study TRYPHAENA

The incidence of SAEs during the neoadjuvant period was highest in the Ptz+TCH arm (36%), followed by the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (28%) and then the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (20%). The most common SAE was febrile neutropenia, and this was lower in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (5%) than in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and Ptz+TCH arm (14% and 15%, respectively). Diarrhea SAEs were reported in 1%, 4% and 5% of patients, and neutropenia in 3%, 4% and 1% of patients, in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D, FEC/Ptz+T+D and Ptz+TCH arms, respectively. All other events occurred in only one or two patients in any arm.

A total of 5 patients experienced cardiac disorder SAEs. These included: 3 reports of LVD (1 in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm; 2 in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm) and one report each of cardiovascular disorder and conduction disorder in the Ptz+TCH arm.

In the adjuvant period, 5 patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (7.4%), 4 patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm (6.2%) and 6 patients (9.0%) in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced at least one SAE. Apart from pneumonia, which occurred in two patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, all events occurred in single patients. There was one cardiac disorder: symptomatic LVSD NYHA Class I reported one patient in the Ptz+TCH arm.

Two patients, both in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, experienced SAEs assessed as treatment-related in the post-treatment  follow-up  period  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cutoff  of  22  July  2013.  One  patient experienced  NYHA  Class  II  symptomatic  LVSD  (NCI-CTCAE  Grade  3)  which  later  improved  and  one patient,  who  received  docetaxel  in  the  post-treatment  follow-up  period,  experienced  Grade  4 neutropenia (this event lasted 3 days, and had resolved at the last assessment).

## Study CLEOPATRA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of SAEs was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm (36.3%) than in the Pla+T+D arm (29.0%). Serious adverse events in the SOC, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders were the most frequently reported SAEs in both treatment arms; these occurred more frequently in the Ptz+T+D arm than in the Pla+T+D arm (15.9% vs. 10.6%, respectively). The difference between the two treatment arms was mainly due to a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the Ptz+T+D arm (11.3% of patients) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (5.1% of patients).

The next most frequently reported SOC was Infections and Infestations. Events in this class were also more common in the Ptz+T+D arm (11.8% of patients) than in the Pla+T+D arm (8.6% of patients). However, no single event accounted for the difference in incidence between the two arms.

Although the incidence of Gastrointestinal Disorder SAEs was balanced between the two treatment arms, SAEs of diarrhea were more common in the Ptz+T+D arm (3.2% of patients) than in the Pla+T+D arm (1.3% of patients). General Disorders and Administration Site SAEs were more frequent in the Ptz+T+D arm (3.4% of patients) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (2.3% of patients). Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders were also more frequent in the Ptz+T+D arm (3.2% of patients) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (2.3% of patients). However, the difference between the arms was small (&lt; 2.0%) in both cases, and no clear difference in any individual event was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced Cardiac Disorder SAEs was higher in the Pla+T+D arm (3.5% of patients) than in the Ptz+T+D arm (1.7% of patients).

## Laboratory findings

## Study NEOSPHERE

Overall,  the  most  common  laboratory  abnormalities  were  decreased  neutrophil,  total  WBC  and lymphocytes.  Grade  3-4  neutropenia  was  more  common  in  Arms  A  (T+D)  and  C  (Ptz+T),  while occurring with a slightly lower frequency in Arm B (Ptz+T+D). The incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 74.5% in patients treated with neoadjuvant Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with 84.5% in patients treated with trastuzumab and docetaxel, including 50.9% and 60.2% Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively (see SmPC section 4.8). The addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant period did not lead to an unexpected increase in laboratory abnormalities.

With regard to biochemistry (ASAT, LDH, ALP, ALAT, bilirubin and creatinine) the pattern in shifts was comparable between the arms that included docetaxel. Most of the shifts were Grade 1-2. There were some shifts in calcium levels from Grade 0 to Grade 4 (mostly decreased calcium) and increased uric acid, which are some of the indicators for increased cell turnover. This could cause acute renal failure, but there was no indication of that, when looking at the creatinine levels or the overall AE profile.

There was one patient who fulfilled Hy's law but no firm conclusion can be drawn.

## Study TRYPHAENA

The most common AEs were decreased neutrophil and total WBC counts. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was most frequently observed in Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D). The incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 neutropenia  was  85.3%  in  patients  treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta  +  TCH  and  77.0%  in  patients treated  with  neoadjuvant  Perjeta,  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  following  FEC,  including  66.7%  and 59.5% Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively.

Balanced  shift  were  observed  across  treatment  arms  with  regard  to  the  biochemistry  data.  Also increased uric acid levels were observed, indicating increased cell turnover.

## Vital signs

There were no unexpected findings in the two neoadjuvant trials.

## Safety in special populations

## Intrinsic factors

## Age

The  number  of  patients  over  65  years  in  the  two  neoadjuvant  trials  was  too  small  to  draw  any meaningful conclusion.

## Race

## NEOSPHERE

The  only reasonable  comparison  was  between  white  and  Asian  patients.  Asian  patients  had (independent  of  treatment  arm)  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs,  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  dose interruption/modification, leukopenia, diarrhoea, rash and mucositis.

## TRYPHAENA

Asian patients had also in this study a higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs, leukopenia, diarrhea and rash. The most apparent difference is seen leukopenia; 87.5% (Asian) vs. 54.4% (white).

## Extrinsic factors

## Region

NEOSPHERE:  Since  the  only  reasonable  comparison  was  between  Europe  and  Asia,  the  same  AE pattern as in the assessment of AEs based on 'race' is observed.

TRYPHAENA:  There  were  too  few  non-Europeans  to  make  any  reasonable  comparison  between different regions.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Study NEOSPHERE

During the neoadjuvant period, 7 patients (0 in the T+D arm, 2 [1.9%] in Ptz+T+D arm, 3 [2.8%] in the Ptz+T arm and 2 [2.1%] in the Ptz+D arm) discontinued from any study treatment because of AEs. Two patients discontinued docetaxel due to drug hypersensitivity (one in the Ptz+T+D arm and one in the Ptz+T arm). In the Ptz+T arm, one patient withdrew from all medication due to CHF and one patient withdrew from all medication due to pregnancy. In the Ptz+D arm, one withdrew from pertuzumab and docetaxel due to neutropenia, and one patient who discontinued due to ulcerative colitis, had received all cycles of pertuzumab and all 21 cycles of trastuzumab but had not started any cycles of FEC. All AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were considered possibly related to treatment, with the exception of the ulcerative colitis, which was assessed as unrelated by the investigators.

During the adjuvant period, a total of 10 patients (0 in the T+D arm, 3 in the Ptz+T+D arm, 5 in the Ptz+T arm and 2 in the Ptz+D arm) discontinued from any study treatment because of AEs during the adjuvant period. The AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication included: LVD (2 patients) and abdominal strangulated hernia in the Ptz+T+D arm; asthenia, chest discomfort, drug hypersensitivity (2 patients) and septic shock in the Ptz+T arm; and LVD (2 patients) in the Ptz+T arm. Four patients (2 in the Ptz+T+D arm and 2 in the Ptz+D arm) discontinued from a study treatment during adjuvant trastuzumab treatment after adjuvant chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study TRYPHAENA

Both  in  the  neoadjuvant  and  adjuvant  period  very  few  patients  discontinued  treatment  (4  patients [5.6%],  5  patients  [6.7%]  and  6  patients  [7.9%]  in  the  Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D,  FEC/Ptz+T+D  and Ptz+TCH  arms,  respectively  in  the  neadjuvant  period).  Pertuzumab  seemed  to  be  well-tolerated irrespective of backbone chemotherapy (antracycline vs. non-antracycline).

## Adverse Events That Led to Dose Modification or Interruption

## Study NEOSPHERE

During the neoadjuvant period, the number of patients who experienced an AE that required treatment interruption or modification was highest in the Ptz+D arm (43.6%) and lowest in the Ptz+T arm (14.8%) and was comparable between the T+D arm and Ptz+T+D arm (34.6% and 32.7% respectively). The most frequently reported AEs (in at least 5 patients in each arm) requiring dose modification were: neutropenia (in 9.3%, 5.6%, 0.9% and 16% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively); infusion-associated reaction (in 4.7%, 3.7%, 2.8% and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively); diarrhea (in 0.9%, 7.5%, 0% and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T, and Ptz+D arms, respectively); febrile neutropenia (in 6.5%, 3.7%, 0% and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively); and drug hypersensitivity (in 0.9%, 1.9%, 4.6% and 4.3% of patients in the T+D, Ptz+T+D, Ptz+T and Ptz+D arms, respectively).

Three patients in the Ptz+T+D arm experienced LVD leading to dose modification during the neoadjuvant period. All 3 events were assessed as possibly related to study treatment, and resolved without sequelae.

During the adjuvant period, the incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption or modification of any study treatment was slightly higher in the Ptz+T arm compared with the other treatment arms (32.0% in the T+D arm, 34.3% in the Ptz+T+D arm, 43.6% in the Ptz+T arm and 37.5% in the Ptz+D arm), as would be expected since patients in this treatment arm received 3 cycles of docetaxel (in addition to 3 cycles of FEC) during the adjuvant period (all other arms received docetaxel in the neoadjuvant period only). The most frequently reported AEs leading to dose interruption or modification were similar to those reported in the neoadjuvant period.

## Study TRYPHAENA

During the neoadjuvant period, a total of 36.1% patients in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 29.3% of patients in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, and 50.0% of patients in the Ptz+TCH arm experienced an AE that required treatment modification or interruption in the neoadjuvant period. Dose modifications were common in all treatment arms, and were primarily performed in order  to manage Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders. Neutropenia was the single most reported event leading to dose modification (between 14%-15% of patients). In the Ptz+TCH arm, anemia (21% of patients) and thrombocytopenia (16%) were also common AEs leading to dose modification. Investigations (for laboratory abnormalities) also led to dose modification in 11% of patients in the Ptz+TCH arm.

Compared with the neoadjuvant period, fewer patients experienced AEs leading to dose modification (8 patients [11.8%] in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, 11 patients [16.9%] in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm and 4 patients [6.0%] in the Ptz+TCH arm) in the adjuvant period. This is to be expected since most patients received only adjuvant trastuzumab during this period and dose reductions were not permitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study CLEOPATRA

As of the clinical data cutoff (14 May 2012), the incidence of AEs leading to interruption or dose modification of any of the three study medications was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm (252 patients [61.8%]) compared with the Pla+T+D arm (215 patients [54.3%]). The difference in overall incidence between treatment arms was due to a range of events in different body systems. There were more AEs of febrile neutropenia (20 patients in the Pla+T+D arm [5.1%] vs. 31 patients in the Ptz+T+D arm [7.6%]), hypersensitivity (9 patients Pla+T+D [2.3%] vs. 18 patients Ptz+T+D [4.4%]) and diarrhea (7 patients Pla+T+D [1.8%] vs. 23 patients Ptz+T+D [5.6%]) that led to dose modification in the Ptz+T+D arm compared with the Pla+T+D arm. Conversely, there were more AEs of LVD leading to interruption or dose modification in the Pla+T+D arm (11 patients [2.8%]) compared with the Ptz+T+D arm (5 patients [1.2%]).

## Adverse drug reactions

The integrated safety database has been updated to include data from the TRYPHAENA study and updated data from the NEOSPHERE and CLEOPATRA studies. The integrated safety database now contains data for 1631 patients exposed to pertuzumab in 15 studies. Updated analyses based on these pooled data were provided and results of these analyses were consistent with the previous pooled analyses and with the NEOSPHERE, TRYPHAENA and CLEOPATRA safety data reported in above, with no new or unexpected findings. No new ADRs have been identified from the NEOSPHERE or TRYPHAENA studies. Pooled data from the overall treatment period in CLEOPATRA (data cutoff 11 February 2014; median number of cycles of Perjeta was 24); and from the neoadjuvant treatment period in NEOSPHERE (median number of cycles of Perjeta was 4, across all treatment arms) and TRYPHAENA (median number of cycles of Perjeta was 3 - 6 across treatment arms) have been provided. On this basis, the frequencies of the following ADRs have been revised from very common to common: Peripheral sensory neuropathy, Dizziness, Lacrimation increased, Dyspnoea, Pruritus and Dry skin (see SmPC section 4.8).

## Post marketing experience

Pertuzumab (Perjeta) in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive MBC was first approved in the US on 08 June 2012. Subsequently, it was approved in the EU and many other countries for the treatment of MBC, and in the US, Chile and Peru for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with earlier stages of disease.

This section summarizes the post-marketing experience with pertuzumab on the basis of safety data contained in the second Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), which covers the reporting interval 8 June 2013 to 7 December 2013. The estimated total cumulative exposure to pertuzumab via company-sponsored or development partner-sponsored studies or through commercially available product since the Development International Birth Date (DIBD; 11 September 2001) until the Data Lock Point (DLP) for the second PBRER (7 December 2013) was 17,077 patients worldwide, including approximately 11,346 patients exposed to commercially obtained drug.

## 2.5.4. Discussion on clinical safety

The  safety  of  Perjeta  has  been  evaluated  in  more  than  1,600  patients  in  the  randomized  trials CLEOPATRA  (n=808),  NEOSPHERE  (n=417)  and  TRYPHAENA  (n=225)  and  in  phase  I  and  II  trials conducted in patients with various malignancies and predominantly treated with Perjeta in combination with other antineoplastic agents.

The duration of the exposure of patients in the two neoadjuvant studies is limited, while patients in the CLEOPATRA  study  have  a  much  higher  exposure.  Although  the  patient  population  enrolled  in  the CLEOPATRA  study  had  more  advanced  disease  than  patients  in  the  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA studies,  protocol  entry  criteria  were  otherwise  very  similar  between  the  three  studies.  Importantly, most patients in the CLEOPATRA study received much more treatment with pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel than would be given in the neoadjuvant setting. Thus, the CLEOPATRA study is more likely to have revealed any safety issues with this combination regimen than the two neoadjuvant studies, in which treatment duration was relatively short. With a median time on study (including follow-up) greater than two years for patients in the CLEOPATRA study, there has also been sufficient follow-up for any delayed and/or cumulative toxicity to have emerged.

There  is  no  safety  data  available  on  the  continued  use  of  Perjeta  for  more  than  6  cycles  in  the neoadjuvant setting (see SmPC section 4.8).

Overall, the safety of Perjeta in Phase I and II studies was generally consistent with that observed in the  CLEOPATRA,  NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA  trials,  although  the  incidence  and  most  common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) varied depending on whether perjeta was administered as monotherapy or with concomitant anti-neoplastic agents (see SmPC section 4.8).

In general, in all three studies, the most common adverse events were leukopenia, rash and diarrhoea.

In the NEOSPHERE study, it is observed that AEs are more likely in Arm B (Ptz+T+D). These AEs were mostly related to gastrointestinal,  skin  and  subcutaneous,  blood  and  lymphatic  and  musculoskeletal disorders. The interesting comparison is between Arm A (T+D) and Arm B (Ptz+T+D), and the only major difference was seen in gastrointestinal disorders, 61.7% vs. 79.4%.

The most frequent AEs reported in Study NEOSPHERE were neutropenia, diarrhoea, alopecia and rash. In  Arm  C  (T+Ptz)  there  were  only  two  cases  of  alopecia  and  neutropenia.  When  comparing  Arm  A (T+D) with Arm D (Ptz+D) almost an identical safety profile was observed, except for diarrhoea, which was more common in Arm D. Thus, pertuzumab by itself may lead to a higher risk of diarrhoea, which is manageable in the clinical setting.

Overall, there were no unacceptable additional toxicities by adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. The safety profile was slightly altered in the adjuvant setting compared to the neoadjuvant  setting.  Nausea,  neutropenia,  vomiting,  fatigue  and  diarrhoea  were  the  most  frequent AEs. Alopecia was almost absent in Arm A (T+D), B (Ptz+T+D) and D (Ptz+D), while 59.6% of the patients  in  Arm  C  (T+Ptz)  experienced  it.  The  safety  profile  of  Arm  B  (Ptz+T+D)  is  considered manageable.

The majority of Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurred in the blood and lymphatic system, with more AEs in Arms A and D in the NEOSPHERE study, but the risk of febrile neutropenia seems to be similar in all treatment arms. Neutropenia is a well-known and well-characterised Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) already addressed in the SmPC.

In the TRYPHAENA study, the most frequent AEs in the neoadjuvant setting in Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D) and B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) were similar to the safety profile in adjuvant setting in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the NEOSPHERE study, which is not surprising since FEC was administered to the patients. In Arm C (Ptz+TCH), where patients received the non-anthracycline regimen (docetaxel+carboplatin+trastuzumab +pertuzumab) patients experienced more myelotoxic related AEs (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.), due to the toxic effects of carboplatin and docetaxel on the bone marrow. However, all these AEs are clinically manageable and do not lead to any major concerns.

All patients received trastuzumab up to 1 year in the adjuvant setting. AEs occurred less frequently in the non-anthracycline arm (Arm C). There were slight differences between Arm A (Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D)  and  B  (FEC/Ptz+T+D),  except  for  a  relevant  difference  in  upper  respiratory tract  infections  (2  (2.9%)  vs.  8  (12.3%).  However,  all  events  were  mild  to  moderate  and  they  all resolved.

Overall, there seemed to be fewer Grade ≥ 3 AEs in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) in the TRYPHAENA study, but the incidence of AEs was more or less comparable. The predominant AEs were within the blood and lymphatic system. There were slightly more Grade 4 AEs in Arm C (Ptz+TCH), mostly in the 'blood and lymphatic  system  disorders'  SOC  with  predominantly  neutropenia.  This  is  a  well-known  risk  of chemotherapy and it is clinically manageable. There were no Grade 5 AEs.

In the CLEOPATRA study, the AE profile of Ptz+T+D in the metastatic breast cancer (MBC) resembled the profile of Arm B (Ptz+T+D) in the neoadjuvant setting in early breast cancer. However, patients in the MBC setting received 6 cycles of docetaxel, while patients in the NEOSPHERE study received only 4 cycles, which may explain some of the differences. Patients in the MBC setting were also heavily pretreated  compared  to  the  treatment  naïve  patients  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting.  The  only  major difference was diarrhoea, which occurred more often in the MBC setting. Overall, the safety profile of pertuzumab is comparable between the neoadjuvant and MBC setting.

With regard to AESI, there were slightly more cardiac disorders in Arm B (Ptz+T+D) in the NEOSPHERE study. Overall, the incidence of LVD was higher in the pertuzumab-treated groups than in those who did not receive pertuzumab in the NEOSPHERE study (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Although there were more cases of LVD in the Ptz+T+D arm, these were only Grade 3, asymptomatic and in some cases seen in patients with cardiac risk factors. An increased incidence of LVEF declines was also observed in patients treated with pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. LVEF recovered to ≥50% in all patients (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). LVEF should be assessed prior to initiation of pertuzumab and during treatment with Perjeta (every 3 cycles in the metastatic setting and every 2 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting) to ensure that LVEF is within the institution's normal limits (see SmPC section 4.4).

The primary safety endpoint in the TRYPHAENA study concerned cardiac safety. There were only very few cases of symptomatic LVSD, and there was no sign of any difference between the treatment arms. There were slightly more patients with LVEF decline in Arm B (FEC/Ptz+T+D) and C (Ptz+TCH). One patient had a prior history of myocardial ischemia, which may have contributed to the LVSD during administration  of  pertuzumab  in  the  neoadjuvant  period.  There  were  too  few  events  to  draw  any conclusions. Very few patients discontinued treatment due to cardiac events.

A direct comparison may not be appropriate since the patient populations differ, etc., but nonetheless the frequency of LVSD, Grade ≥ 3 LVSD, LVEF decline and CHF, seemed to be comparable between the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study and the experimental arm Ptz+T+D in the CLEOPATRA study, with only slight differences. Thus, the use of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting did not lead to excess of cardiac toxicity. This is also supported by results from the TRYPHAENA study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Left ventricular dysfunction is a well-known risk that is clearly described in the SmPC for the use of pertuzumab in the metastatic setting, and is clinically manageable. Nevertheless, the long-term cardiac safety of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant phase is considered incompletely characterized at present. The study APHINITY, BERENICE and the final analysis of TRYPHAENA should provide further evidence with regard to this safety concern (see RMP).

With regard to the remaining AESI, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was considerable higher in the NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA compared to the CLEOPATRA study. However, Infusion reactions were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA at the cycles when Perjeta was given on the same day as trastuzumab and docetaxel, with a majority of reactions being mild or moderate (see SmPC section 4.8).

Rash rates  were  higher  in  pertuzumab  containing  arms  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study  and  an  additional effect was noted with Docetaxel. In the TRYPHAENA study, Ptz and TCH had the worst effect on rash rates (see SmPC section 4.8). Regarding leukopenia, a similar rate of leukopenia events was reported in chemotherapy containing regimens with a lower incidence in the Ptz+T+D arm in the NEOSPHERE study. A slightly higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed in the Ptz+T+D arm however very  few  infections  were  reported  indicating  that  the  episodes  were  clinically  manageable.  In  the TRYPHAENA  study  a  lower  rate  of  leukopenic  events  and  in  particular  of  febrile  neutropenia  was reported in the FEC/Ptz+T+D arm when compared with the same regimen given longer or to TCH (see SmPC section 4.8).

Diarrhoea  was  confirmed  as  one  of  the  most  common  AE  reported  in  Ptz  containing  regimens.  In particular the rate was higher in the Ptz+T+D arm of the NEOSPHERE study and in the TCH+Ptz arm of the TRYPHAENA study. However, only a minority of episodes were of severe grade and none lead to treatment discontinuation (see SmPC section 4.8).

Overall,  there  is  no  indication  of  any  excess  cases  of  diarrhoea,  rash,  mucositis,  interstitial  lung disease,  hepatic  disorders,  VTEs,  neutropenia  or  febrile  neutropenia  by  adding  pertuzumab  to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

In  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  most  SAEs  occurred  in  Arm  A  (T+D)  and  D  (Ptz+D)  in  the  neoadjuvant period.  Most  frequent  SAEs  in  all  treatment  arms  were  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia.  The pattern of SAE was comparable to the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study. In the neoadjuvant period the TRYPHAENA study, most SAEs occurred in the non-anthracycline arm (Arm C (Ptz+TCH)). Across all three arms, diarrhoea, neutropenia and gastrointestinal disorders occurred most frequently. All are reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8).  Very few SAEs were observed in the adjuvant and post-treatment follow-up period in the TRYPHAENA study.

Overall,  the  addition  of  pertuzumab  to  trastuzumab  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  did  not  lead  to  any unexpected  safety  findings  in  the  NEOSPHERE  study.  This  is  supported  by  the  results  of  the TRYPHAENA  study  and  the  CLEOPATRA  study.  The  TRYPHAENA  study  also  provided  evidence  with regard to cardiac toxicity. There is currently no indication of any concerning differences in tolerability by adding pertuzumab + trastuzumab to anthracyclines or carboplatin in the neoadjuvant period.

However, cardiac risk should be carefully considered and balanced against the medical need of the individual patient before use of Perjeta with an anthracycline. There are limited safety data available from the TRYPHAENA study concerning sequential or concomitant administration of Perjeta with epirubicin, as part of the FEC regimen (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). There are no safety data available concerning use of Perjeta with doxorubicin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the pharmacological actions of pertuzumab and anthracyclines an increased risk of cardiac toxicity might be expected from concomitant use of these agents compared with sequential, although not seen in the TRYPHAENA study. In this study, only chemotherapy-naive subjects, not receiving additional chemotherapy after surgery, were treated with low cumulative dose of epirubicin, i.e. up to 300 mg/m 2  (see SmPC section 4.4) .

## 2.5.5. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall,  the  observed  adverse  events  are  well-characterised,  clinically  manageable  and  adequately reflected  in  the  SmPC.  However,  long-term  cardiac  toxicity  is  incompletely  characterized  at  present and  requires  follow-up.  Thus,  the  following  post-authorisation  safety  study  has  been  included  as condition in Annex II:

| Post-authorisation safety study (PASS): In order to evaluate cardiac safety and provide further efficacy data in the neoadjuvant setting, the MAH should submit the results of study WO29217 (BERENICE), a multicentre, multinational, Phase II study to evaluate pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and standard neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage breast cancer.   | May 2017   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|

In addition, safety data from the study APHINITY and the final analysis of TRYPHAENA are expected to provide further evidence with regard to this safety concern as reflected in the Risk Management Plan.

## 2.5.6. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

| Missing Information          | • Risk in patients aged 75 years or older • Risk in pregnant women • Risk in lactating women • Risk in fertility in humans • Risk in male breast cancer patients • Risk in patients with cardiovascular impairment • Risk in patients with hepatic impairment • Risk in patients with severe renal impairment • Risk of lack of efficacy due to immunogenicity |

1 Oligohydramnios has not been reported in patients treated with pertuzumab but occurred in cynomolgus monkeys administered pertuzumab and in pregnant women treated with trastuzumab. Due to age, prior adjuvant treatment, concurrent chemotherapy, the advanced stage of disease and poor prognosis in the patient population, the MAH assesses the likelihood of pregnancies to be low.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, changes are proposed to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make a correction in sections 2 and 6.6 of the SmPC regarding the dose contained in 1 ml of solution after dilution. 14 ml  of Perjeta concentrate should be withdrawn from the vial and diluted into a 250 ml PVC or non-PVC polyolefin infusion bag of sodium

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. After dilution, one ml of solution should contain approximately 3.02 mg of pertuzumab (840 mg/278 ml) for the initial dose where two vials are required and approximately 1.59 mg of pertuzumab (420 mg/264 ml) for the maintenance dose where one vial is required.

This change was accepted by the CHMP.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The NEOSPHERE study showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant result with regard to pCR rate. The bpCR rate was 29% versus 45.8% in T+D arm and Ptz+T+D arm respectively. The tpCR (ypT0/is N0) rates showed the same pattern with a 17.8% difference in favour of the Ptz+T+D arm (39.3%) compared to the Ptz+T arm (21.5%).

These results are supported by the findings in the TRYPHAENA study, where pCR was a secondary endpoint. In this study, the reported pCR rates were 61.6%, 57.3%, 66.2% in the Ptz+T+FEC/Ptz+T+D arm, FEC/Ptz+T+F arm and Ptz+TCH arm respectively.

Supportive evidence of efficacy is provided by the CLEOPATRA study in the metastatic setting. In this study, the improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in the pertuzumab arm was statistically significant [HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-0.75; p&lt; 0.0001, log-rank test]. Moreover, a statistically significant improvement in OS of 15.7 months was observed in the pertuzumab+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm versus the placebo+trastuzumab+docetaxel arm with a HR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.56-0.84; p=0.0002).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The magnitude of the effect in terms of DFS/OS cannot be estimated from the observed pCR effect. However, the observed difference in tpCR rate of 17.8% between arm A (T+D) and B (Ptz+T+D) in the NEOSPHERE  study  is  considered  sufficiently  large  to  be  associated  with  a  clinically  meaningful improvement in long-term outcomes in the context of the totality of the data. Although not statistically significant, efficacy outcome data (DFS and OS) from the NEOSPHERE study showed a trend in favour of  pertuzumab.  This  should  also  be  seen  in  light  of  the  survival  benefit  of  adding  pertuzumab  to trastuzumab in the metastatic setting.

In both studies pCR rates and magnitude of improvement with pertuzumab were lower in the subgroup of patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumours compared to patients with hormone receptornegative tumours. In the NEOSPHERE study, patients with hormone receptor-positive disease had lower bpCR rates (5.9% - 26%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]) than patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (27.3% - 63.2%, across treatment arms [highest in Ptz+T+D arm]). This observation is consistent with lower pCR rate observed in HR+ patients in the literature. However, a recently published meta-analyses (Cortazar et al. 2014, Lancet), which included individual patient data from approximately 12,000 patients, showed that there is a statistically significant and clinically relevant advantage in terms of long-term outcomes in patients with HER2+ disease, who achieve a pCR, irrespective of hormone receptor status. In addition, there solid evidence from the CLEOPATRA study for a statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantage of the effect of pertuzumab in HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic setting, regardless of hormone receptor status. In this study, a Hazard Ratio for OS of 0.71 (0.51, 0.96) in patients with HR+ disease, compared with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.61 (0.47, 0.81) in patients with HR-negative disease was observed. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that this will also the case in the neoadjuvant setting.

The APHINITY study will provide confirmatory efficacy data both in the overall population and in the HER2+/HR+ subpopulation (see Annex II conditions). In addition, study BERENICE will also provide valuable efficacy data in the neoadjuvant setting.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In  the  neoadjuvant  trial  NEOSPHERE,  the  most  common  ADRs  ( ≥ 50%)  seen  with  Perjeta  in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were alopecia and neutropenia. The most common NCICTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 ADR ( ≥ 10%) was neutropenia.

In the TRYPHAENA study, when Perjeta was administered in combination with trastuzumab and FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) for 3 cycles followed by 3 cycles of Perjeta, trastuzumab and docetaxel, the most common ADRs (≥50%) were neutropenia, diarrhoea and nausea. The most common  NCI-CTCAE  v.3  Grade  3-4  ADRs  (≥10%)  were  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and leucopenia.  When  Perjeta  was  administered  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  docetaxel  for  3 cycles following 3 cycles of FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), the most common ADRs ( ≥ 50%) were  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  alopecia.  The  most  common  NCI-CTCAE  v.3  Grade  3-4  ADRs ( ≥ 10%) were neutropenia and leucopenia. Similarly, when Perjeta was administered in combination with TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab) for 6 cycles, the most common ADRs ( ≥ 50%) were diarrhoea and alopecia. The most common NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-4 ADRs ( ≥ 10%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anaemia, leucopenia and diarrhoea.

In  general,  there  were  slightly  more  AEs  in  the  Ptz+T+D  arm  of  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  which  is expected.  Comparing  Arm  A  (T+D)  with  Arm  D  (Ptz+D)  almost  an  identical  safety  profile  was observed, except for diarrhoea, which was more common in Arm D. Thus, pertuzumab by itself seems to impose a higher risk of diarrhoea, which is manageable in the clinical setting.

In the NEOSPHERE study, the incidence of LVD was higher in the pertuzumab-treated groups than in those who did not receive pertuzumab. An increased incidence of LVEF declines was also observed in patients treated with pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. LVEF recovered to ≥ 50% in all patients.

In  the  NEOSPHERE  study,  SAEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  Arms  A  (T+D)  and  D  (Ptz+D)  in  the neoadjuvant  period.  Most  frequent  SAEs  in  all  treatment  arms  were  neutropenia  and  febrile neutropenia. The pattern of SAE was comparable to the experimental arm in the CLEOPATRA study.  In the  neoadjuvant  period  in  the  TRYPHAENA  study,  SAEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  nonanthracycline  arm  (Arm  C).  Across  all  three  arms,  diarrhoea,  neutropenia  and  gastrointestinal disorders occurred most frequently. All are reflected in the SmPC. Very few SAEs were observed in the adjuvant and post-treatment follow-up period in the TRYPHAENA study.

Overall,  there  was  no  indication  of  any  unexpected  excess  of  cases  of  diarrhoea,  rash,  mucositis, interstitial  lung  disease,  hepatic  disorders,  VTEs,  neutropenia  or  febrile  neutropenia  by  adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The safety of Perjeta administered for more than 6 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting has not been established (see SmPC section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With  regard  to  LVEF/LVSD,  there  were  too  few  events  to  draw  any  conclusions.  Very  few  patients discontinued  treatment  due  to  cardiac  events.  There  are  limited  safety  data  available  from  the TRYPHAENA  study  concerning  sequential  as  well  as  concomitant  administration  of  Perjeta  with epirubicin,  as  part  of  the  FEC  regimen  and  there  are  no  safety  data  available  to  support  use  of doxorubicin  with  pertuzumab.  Therefore,  cardiac  risk  should  be  carefully  considered  and  balanced against  the  medical  need  of  the  individual  patient  before  use  of  pertuzumab  with  an  anthracycline. Based on the pharmacological actions of pertuzumab and anthracyclines an increased risk of cardiac toxicity might be expected from concomitant compared with sequential use of these agents, although not seen in the TRYPHAENA study (see SmPC section 4.4 and 5.1).

Although the safety database in the claimed indication is considered sufficient for a characterization of the  safety  profile,  longer  follow-up  and  monitor  of  some  AEs,  including  cardiac  toxicity,  is  still considered necessary (see Annex II and RMP).

Patients older than 65 years are scarcely represented (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 and RMP).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Treatment  effect  measured  as  pCR  in  the  overall  patient  population  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  is considered clinically relevant and likely to be associated with a benefit on long-term outcomes (DFS and OS). The final  analysis  from  the  APHINITY  study  (phase  III)  should  permit  confirmation  of  the clinical  benefit  of  pertuzumab  observed  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  from  the  NEOSPHERE  and TRYPHAENA studies.

The safety profile  does  not  differ  significantly  from  that  already  observed  in  the  metastatic  setting, although  an  increase  in  a  number  of  AEs  has  been  observed  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  with  the number of treatment cycles, including neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhoea. Most of AEs are manageable in the clinical setting. Overall, the add-on changes in toxicity are acceptable. Long-term cardiac  toxicity  will  be  further  characterised  in  the  ongoing  APHINITY  and  BERENICE  studies  (see Annex II and RMP).

## Benefit-risk balance

Overall, based on the results from studies NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA and in the context of the totality of data, the robust biological rationale for the combination, compelling efficacy results from the metastatic setting, the acceptable safety profile, the reasonable likelihood that the observed treatment effect with pertuzumab is associated with a benefit in long-term outcome (DFS and OS), the benefitrisk balance  of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence is positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Considering the greater medical need in patients at high risk of recurrence and the available efficacy data from the two neo-adjuvant studies, the CHMP considered the uncertainties with regard to safety can be accepted in patients who are at high risk of recurrence. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the neoadjuvant indication should be restricted to this high risk patient population. Locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers are considered as high-risk irrespective of hormone receptor status in the neoadjuvant setting. In early stage breast cancer, tumour size, grade, hormone receptor status and lymph node metastases should be taken into account in the risk assessment (see SmPC section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All available data make it sufficiently likely that pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab will increase the pCR rate as add-on to chemotherapy regimens. Specifically, an increase in pCR rates has been shown when pertuzumab is added to T+D (39 % versus 22 %; NEOSPHERE Study). Standard practice guidelines recommend pertuzumab as part of treatment regimens including an anthracycline (e.g. epirubicin as in FEC) and a taxane (e.g. docetaxel) (NCCN guideline). When Perjeta was added to T+D+FEC or TCH based regimens in the TRYPHAENA study, pCR was 55-64%. Furthermore, the overall amount of evidence available to date, do not demonstrate a meaningful increase in cardiac toxicity. Acknowledging that a longer follow-up is needed to be further reassured, in this high-risk population, it is in the best interest of patients allowing the possibility to use pertuzumab not only in combination with docetaxel as backbone chemotherapy regimen but also with other chemotherapy regimens and at least with TCH (i.e. docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab, Arm C of TRYPHAENA), which did not raise concerns with regard to cardiac toxicity. As a result the CHMP considers that the indication should not be restricted to combination with docetaxel as chemotherapy backbone only and recommended the use of perjeta in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
