## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Requested Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 23 December 2010 an application for a variation.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary name   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| ILARIS               | CANAKINUMAB                          | See Annex A      |

The following variation was requested:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                         | Type   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a                  | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

The MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC in order to extend the indication of Ilaris for the treatment of gouty arthritis attacks in adult patients who cannot be adequately treated with standard of care anti-inflammatory medicinal products (e.g. NSAIDs, colchicine). Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Package Leaflet were proposed to be updated in accordance.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Scientific advice/Protocol assistance

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 22 October 2009 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/629137/2009), 20 May 2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/287075/2010) and 23 September 2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/569688/2010). The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 1.3. Introduction

Canakinumab (Ilaris) is a recombinant human monoclonal anti-human antibody of the IgG1/kappa isotype subclass. It binds selectively and with high affinity, to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with no cross-reactivity with IL-1α or the IL-1 receptor antagonist. The IL-1β-canakinumab complex cannot bind to the IL-1 receptor, rendering the bound IL-1β functionally ineffective.

Canakinumab (Ilaris) is approved to treat CAPS in over 40 countries and available in more than 10 countries (including the US, EU, Switzerland, Canada and Australia) at the dose of 150 mg s.c. given every 8 weeks.

Gout is a relatively common disorder. Gout is associated with hyperuricemia that may trigger an acute or chronic arthritis, typically in the foot, ankle or knee. The arthritis is characterised by synovitis with high levels  of  neutrophils  in  the  synovial  fluid.  Cytokines,  including  IL-1 ß ,  act  as  mediators  of  the  acute inflammation  in  the  gouty  arthritis.  The  typical  manifestation  is  an  acute  painful  arthritis  of  the  first metatarso-phalangeal  joint.  Other  manifestations  of  gout  are  urate-containing  tophi,  urate-containing kidney  stones  and  even  an  urate  nephropathy.  Hyperuricemia  is  often  associated  with  hypertension, diabetes, obesity and the use of diuretics. 'Metabolic syndrome' is often associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Gouty arthritis is becoming more frequent worldwide. Prevalence of gout in the United States has increased during the previous decades, mostly as a result of dietary factors and population aging.

Uric acid lowering diet and pharmacotherapy (e.g. allopurinol) compose the standard of care. Approximately 10-20% of patients with gout are not adequately managed with the standard urate-lowerin  g therapy and may have flares of acute arthritis.

There are significant variations in the pharmacotherapeutic approach to gouty arthritis. NSAIDs are used widely to relieve pain and inflammation but may not be effective in the most severe cases. Colchicine is used in some regions in spite of its significant toxicity. Local and systemic corticosteroids are frequently used to treat most severe cases. The use of corticosteroids is not always desirable due to the metabolic conditions that are often associated with gout. There is an unmet medical need for medicinal products to treat acute gouty arthritis in patients in whom these therapies are contraindicated, not tolerated, not appropriate, or do not provide an adequate response.

No specific EMA/CHMP guideline is available for the clinical development of products in acute gouty arthritis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH initially  claimed  with  this  submission  the  following  new  indication:  'Ilaris  is  indicated  for  the treatment of gouty arthritis attacks in adult patients who cannot be adequately treated with standard of care anti-inflammatory  medicinal  products  (e.g.  NSAIDd,  colchicine).  Ilaris  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the frequency of subsequent attacks'. The MAH also initially recommended a single 150 mg dose treatment and an  interval  of  at  least  14  days  before  a  new  dose  for  patients  requiring  re-treatment.  Following  the evaluation of the efficacy and safety data supporting this submission, the following restricted indication was considered approvable by the CHMP: 'Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  (at  least  3  attacks  in  the  previous  12  months)  in  whom  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated., or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.'. Furthermore, the re-treatment period was expanded to an interval of at least 12 weeks between two doses of Ilaris.

## 1.4. Non-clinical aspects

## 1.4.1. Introduction

No new non-clinical studies were performed to support the use of canakinumab for the treatment of gouty arthritis. Non-clinical data relevant for this application are reported below.

## 1.4.2. Pharmacology

Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against human IL-1b. It blocks binding of IL-1b to the IL-1 receptor  and  inhibits  IL-1-induced  reactions.  The  antibody  cross-reacts  only  with  marmoset  IL-1b  was demonstrated  by  the  MAH  with  the  initial  MAA.  Here,  reference  is  made  to  one  new  study,  study RD-2009-00108 which confirms that canakinumab has biological activity towards natural (in addition to recombinant) marmoset IL-1b in a cellular assay. The data confirm that marmoset is a relevant species for canakinumab.

The rationale for neutralizing IL-1b in gout is provided below.

On a cellular level, gouty attacks are characterized by infiltration and activation of neutrophils into the joint cavity. It has long been known that monosodium urate (MSU) crystals cause neutrophil influx and activation (Phelps, 1966) and induce production of IL-1b by blood monocytes and synovial mononuclear cells (di Giovine et al., 1987). More recently, it was shown that MSU crystals activate the NALP3 inflammasome which leads to secretion of IL-1b (Martinon et al., 2006). Genetic ablation of IL-1 signalling or neutralisation of  IL-1  in  animal  models  of  MSU  crystal-induced  inflammation  inhibited  neutrophil  migration  and  joint inflammation (Chen et al., 2006; Torres et al., 2009). Taken together, these data reveal a sequence of cellular events which establish a pivotal role of IL-1 in inflammation induced by urate crystals. The final proof of concept for the pathophysiology of gout came from the clinical application of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) in gout patients which led to a rapid relief of symptoms (So et al., 2007).

## 1.4.3. Pharmacokinetics

A comparison of PK parameters in marmoset monkey, rhesus monkey, healthy volunteers and in gout patients was provided by the MAH (see table 1 below). In addition, systemic exposure ratios in marmosets and human gout patients were compared (see table 2 below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Monkey PK data were already provided by the MAH with the initial MAA submission. The human PK and total IL-1b  data  are  described  in  the  population-based  PK-binding  model.  Canakinumab  concentration-time profiles were simulated for a typical gout patient weighing 93 kg, based on a dosing regimen of 150 mg every 12 weeks for 1 year.

n.a. not available or not applicable

Clearance of canakinumab in marmosets is higher because of the lower affinity of human IgG1 to marmoset FcRn than for human FcRn (Boon, 2001).

The studies in marmoset performed so far, provide a sufficiently high exposure multiple to support the proposed treatment in gout patients.

## 1.4.4. Toxicology

The MAH submitted an updated assessment of the carcinogenic potential of canakinumab outlining in detail the carcinogenicity strategy for canakinumab.

A discussion on literature data on the role of IL-1β in tumour biology was provided by the MAH. Overall, the weight  of  evidence  from  the  scientific  literature  suggests  that  IL-1β  has  a  more  likely  role  in  tumour promotion rather than in anti-tumour immunity. Thus, anti-IL-1β treatment is not expected to results in an increased tumour growth promotion or occurrence. Based on the existing toxicity data, canakinumab had no effect on the measured  immune  function  parameters  and  did not promote  the occurrence of lymphoproliferative disease at dose levels of up to 150 mg/kg in the chronic marmoset toxicity study.

Conventional carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary for the following reasons: 1) the IgG1 chemical structures itself does not represent a carcinogenic risk; 2) canakinumab is not pharmacologically active  in  rodents;  3)  carcinogenicity  studies  are  not  pragmatically  or  ethically  feasible  in  marmoset monkeys; 4) based on the weight of evidence in the literature available to date in pre-clinical models, neutralizing IL-1β does not suggest an increased tumour promoting risk; 5) carcinogenicity studies with a surrogate anti-murine IL-1β mAb would not contribute meaningfully beyond the information summarized above.  The  carcinogenic  risk  of  canakinumab  is  addressed  through  the  pharmacovigilance  system (malignancies is included as an important potential risk in the RMP).

## 1.4.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In accordance with the \"Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use\" (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk in the environment. Thus, the absence of an environmental risk assessment is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.4.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical studies were performed to support this variation application as the non-clinical data reviewed in the context of the canakinumab initial MAA is applicable for the present application this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Regarding the pharmacodynamics, the MAH has delineated the rationale for using canakinumab in gouty arthritis based on literature data. The CHMP considers that the available literature support the concept of blocking IL-1 signalling in order to treat the inflammatory reaction in gout patients. Additional non-clinical studies  with  canakinumab  in  marmosets  or  the  surrogate  antibody  01BSUR  in  mice  in  a  model  of monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation are not expected to provide additional information. Thus, the lack of such studies is acceptable.

Regarding pharmacokinetics, the studies in marmoset performed so far, provide a sufficiently high exposure multiple to support the proposed treatment in gout patients.

Potential concerns regarding long-term blockade of IL-1β are a reduced host-immune defence and tumour surveillance.  Thus  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  carcinogenicity  risk  associated  with  canakinumab  was provided. Based on this assessment, it is agreed that conventional carcinogenicity studies are not required and  that  the  potential  risk  of  malignancies  is  adequately  addressed  in  the  RMP  through  routine pharmacovigilance, targeted questionnaire and data collection in a registry.

## 1.4.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicity data which were evaluated during the MAA of canakinumab  are  considered  appropriate  to  support  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication  to  the symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks when other treatment alternatives have failed, are contraindicated or not tolerated.

## 1.5. Clinical aspects

## 1.5.1. Introduction

This  application  is  supported  by  a  dose  ranging,  efficacy  and  safety  phase  II  study  (study  H2225) investigating 5 doses of canakinumab in gouty arthritis and two pivotal 12 week, randomized, double-blind active controlled phase III studies (studies H2356 and H2357 of similar design)and their 24 weeks extension phase.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

During the evaluation the MAH informed the EMA and the CHMP about errors in the CSR for studies H2356 and H2357 and their respective extension phase submitted to support this extension of indication which led to  CSR  amendments/addenda.  According  to  the  MAH,  these  amendments  became  necessary  after  the central laboratory informed the MAH that some of their regional laboratories had used wrong reference or alert range for selected lab parameters which were part of the safety assessment of these studies. Based on this  information,  the  CHMP  requested  an  updated/corrected  dossier  reflecting  the  errors  identified  and asking  the  MAH  to  submit  a  root  cause  analysis  and  CAPA  plan  for  this  issue.  The  MAH  provided  the requested data/information which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

* SD: single dose, MD: multiple dose

In studies with gouty arthritis, canakinumab was given as s.c injection (doses ranging from 10 mg to 300 mg) except in one study (10 mg/kg i.v. infusion) which was discontinued. Only in study H2356 product D was used which is the final commercial product of canakinumab in the proposed gout indication, whereas in other PK trials in gout and all in RA or CAPS earlier formulations (A-C) were used.

## Analytical Methods

The competitive ELISA based method for canakinumab determination and the sandwich-ELISA for IL-1β determination in serum samples were identical to those applied during the studies presented with the initial MAA submission  in  CAPS  but  they  were  successfully  transferred  to  another  analytical  laboratory,  SGS Cephac Europe. Acceptable methods cross validations have been performed by analysing human serum samples previously analysed by the laboratory Novartis Pharma AG. The study of the interference of IL-1β with ELISA assay of canakinumab confirmed that it is capable of determining free canakinumab only.

Study H2356 was an active controlled randomized double-blind Phase III trial in comorbid patients with gouty arthritis form whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine are contradicted, not tolerated or ineffective, designed to  establish  two  co-primary  endpoints  which  are  1)  demonstrating  that  canakinumab  is  superior  to triamcinolone acetonide with respect to patient's visual analog assessment (VAS 0-100mm) of gout pain intensity  in  the  target  joint  at  72-hours  post-dose  and  2)  to  confirm  that  canakinumab  is  superior  to triamcinolone acetonide with respect to the time to the first new gout flare. Secondary endpoints included evaluation  of  the  efficacy  of  canakinumab  compared  to  triamcinolone  acetonide  with  respect  to  the treatment of signs and symptoms of each acute gout flare as well as evaluation of the PK/PD of canakinumab in these patients. 228 patients were randomly assigned to receive either one s.c. injection of canakinumab 150 mg or one i.m. injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg.

Patients were given on-demand doses of the randomly selected study drugs while maintaining at least a 2 week  interval  between  doses.  Serum  canakinumab  levels  were  evaluated  in  113  patients  receiving canakinumab at the following post-dose time points: Day 1 (predose), 2, 4, 8, 57, 85. Additional PK samples were collected on Days 1, 3, 7 of unscheduled new flare visits.

From the study report it is obvious that the majority of the patients received only one dose of study drug (79.4% overall). A total of 20 patients in the canakinumab group and 27 patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group required a second or third dose of study medication.

The majority of patients took concomitant medications that started before or after the start of study drug (89.4% in the canakinumab group and 94.8% in the triamcinolone acetonide group). The most common classes of concomitant medications (i.e., ≥20.0% of patients overall) were preparations inhibiting uric acid production (54.8%; mainly allopurinol), ACE inhibitors32.5%), selective beta-blocking agents (28.9%), and angiotensin II antagonists (21.1%). Allopurinol was the medication taken most often (54.4%) followed by paracetamol (12.7%), amlodipine (10.5%), and acetylsalicylic acid (9.6%).

The concentration-time profiles of canakinumab in 16 individual patients were extracted from the full study report as representative examples:

Concentrations of canakinumab and total IL-1ß from 112 patients were added to a previous database and analyzed using the PK-binding model. The model successfully fitted the concentration data for canakinumab and total IL-1ß.The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. The mean serum clearance (CL) of canakinumab was 0.232 L/d with a mean volume of distribution (Vss= VD+VP) of 8.04 L. The absorption rate constant from the subcutaneous injection site was estimated to be 0.278 day-1. Absolute bioavailability (F) was estimated to be 59.5 %.

Study H2255 was an 8 week Phase II active-controlled study with a primary objective to determine the target dose of canakinumab in the treatment of acute flares in gouty arthritis patients who are refractory or contraindicated to NSAIDS and/or colchicine. The target dose was defined as the dose that leads to the same efficacy as the comparator and was to be identified by assessing the dose response relationship of various doses of canakinumab with regards to the pain intensity (VAS) in the target joint at 72 hours (Day 4) post-dose.

Secondary objectives included evaluation of PK/PD in patients with acute gout flare and also evaluation of the change in pain intensity (VAS) in the target joint following canakinumab administration compared to triamcinolone  acetonide  at  various  post-dose  timepoints.  Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  single canakinumab doses as either 10, 25, 50, 90 or 150 mg subcutaneously (N=28, 29, 29, 29,28) or to receive triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg intramuscularly. Serum Canakinumab was evaluated in patients at post-dose time points Days 1 (predose), 4, 8, 29, 57.

Points represent observed data and lines represent the individual predicted concentration curves for canakinumab treated patients.

The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized by dose group in the table below. The mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of  canakinumab  ranged  from  0.188-0.314  L/d  with  a  mean  volume  of distribution  (Vss)  of  6.91-10.1  L.  The  estimated  mean  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  for  binding  of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) ranged from 0.986-1.16 nM. Absolute bioavailability F was estimated to be 69.4 % for all dose groups.

Efficacy  assessments  showed  a  statistically  significantly  better  response  with  the  highest  dose  of canakinumab (150 mg) than with triamcinolone acetonide.

Study A2212 was a Phase II study to assess the effect of a single intravenous dose of canakinumab in hospitalized patients with gouty arthritis and an acute flare. Secondary objectives included demonstration of non-inferiority  for  a  single  dose  of  10mg/kg  canakinumab  compared  to  the  active  comparator, dexamethasone and also evaluation of the PK/PD of canakinumab. Patients were randomized to receive one of the following two treatments on Day 1 of the study: 10 mg/kg canakinumab as an i.v. infusion over 2 hours plus a placebo control or 12 mg dexamethasone as an i.v. infusion over 30 min plus a matching placebo for canakinumab.

Due to enrollment challenges the study was terminated after 6 patients had been enrolled (target was 44 patients). Three subjects completed the study in each of the dose groups resulting in a total study size of 6 patients. Serum canakinumab, total IL-1β and the primary gout flare pain efficacy measures (assessed on a Likert scale) were evaluated in patients at various post-dose time points to characterize the PK and PD of canakinumab.

The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. For the two subjects whose profile was satisfactorily described by the PK-binding model (5104 and 5105), the canakinumab serum clearance (CL) estimates were 0.163 and 0.224 L/day with total volume of distribution (Vss) of 5.83 and 9.56 L. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β were 1.20 and 1.31 nM.

Study H2251 was a Phase II 24-week active-controlled double-blind study with a primary objective to determine the target dose of canakinumab in the treatment of acute flares in gouty arthritis patients who are initiating allopurinol therapy. The target dose of canakinumab was defined as the minimum single dose that leads to at least the same efficacy as the comparator colchicine over the 16-week efficacy period. Secondary objectives included comparison of single versus repeated dose canakinumab efficacy with regards to the mean number of gout flares up to 16 weeks after randomization and also evaluation of canakinumab PK/PD in patients up to 24 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive either canakinumab 25, 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg s.c. on Day 1; or 50 mg s.c. at Days 1 and 29 followed by 25 mg s.c. on Days 57 and 85; or received the comparator 0.5 mg colchicine capsule orally once daily throughout the 16 week treatment period. Serum canakinumab was evaluated in patients at the post-dose time points week 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25.

The dose-response analysis indicated that all canakinumab treatment arms were numerically better than colchicine in reducing the mean number of gout flares over 16 and 24 weeks. Canakinumab was efficacious in  preventing  the  onset  of  gout  flares  in  gouty  arthritis  patients  initiating  urate  lowering  therapy (allopurinol).

The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized by dose group in the table below. The mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of  canakinumab  ranged  from  0.209-0.262  L/d  with  a  mean  volume  of distribution  (Vss)  of  7.22-8.56  L.  The  estimated  mean  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  for  binding  of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) ranged from 0.959-1.2 nM.

The study extension 5H2251E1 aimed to provide additional long-term safety and tolerability data up to a total of 12 months for patients rolling over from the core study H2251 and to investigate the on-demand use of canakinumab for the treatment of newly occurring acute flares during the extension study. Secondary objectives included ongoing assessment of efficacy and PK/PD. Four groups of patients were selected for this extension. Group A patients received canakinumab in the core study and were treated with canakinumab in the extension study. Group B patients received canakinumab in the core study and did not receive treatment with canakinumab in the extension study. Group C patients received colchicine in the core study and were treated with canakinumab in the extension study. Group D patients received colchicine in the core study and did not receive treatment with canakinumab in the extension study.

The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. The mean serum clearance (CL) of canakinumab was 0.232 L/d with a mean volume of distribution (Vss) of 7.65 L. The estimated mean quilibrium dissociation constant for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) was 1.08 nM. These values agreed with those in the core study.

Study D2306 was a Phase III study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in patients who  participated in the A2102  or  D2304  studies  or  in newly  identified patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary objectives included characterization of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of canakinumab. The total treatment duration was 6 months to 2 years with various dose amounts, titrations  and  dosing  intervals.  New  patients  and  most  patients  continuing  over  from  A2102  or  D2304 received  canakinumab  administered  as  an  injection  subcutaneously  (s.c.)  every  8  weeks.  Serum canakinumab,  total  IL-1β  and  the  primary  gout  flare  pain  efficacy  measures  (VAS)  were  evaluated  in patients at various postdose time points to characterize the PK and PD of canakinumab.

The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below by patient subgroup (adults,  pediatric  patients  &gt;  40  kg,  pediatric  patients  ≤  40  kg).  The  mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of canakinumab in adults was 0.169 L/d with a mean volume of distribution (Vss) of 6.04 L. The estimated mean equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) was 1.72 nM.

## Population PK results

A combined PK-binding model was used to analyze pooled data from 1298 subjects.

The PK parameters of canakinumab were determined from a compartmental modeling approach (described by a population-based PK-binding model). The model is a dynamic drugligand binding and turnover model developed based on the schematic:

canakinumab + IL-1β ↔ canakinumab-IL-1β complex

This model integrates both canakinumab and IL-1β inputs and elimination (turnover), and binding affinity (Kd) of canakinumab to IL-1β. A population analysis was conducted on combined PK (canakinumab) and PD (total IL-1β) serum concentration data from the previous CAPS submission database plus the data from the current trials included in this dossier. The table below summarizes the PK parameter estimates in a 'typical' gouty arthritis patient. The term 'typical' is used to describe a patient with the median or default values for the significant covariates: 93 kg body weight (the median body weight of gout subjects), and 34 years old with 43 g/L of serum albumin. The default values of age and albumin were medians carried forward from the previous model, and may not reflect the slightly older gout population; however, since age does not impact the primary PK parameters (clearance and volume), no adjustment of this value was made in the model. The SEM is the standard error of the population mean and the %CV is the intersubject variability estimate.

The key PK properties of canakinumab relevant to this submission were summarized by the applicant as follows (the estimates from the PK-binding model are presented as mean ± SEM):

Following subcutaneous administration of canakinumab (Product Type D) in adult gouty arthritis patients, canakinumab was absorbed with a rate constant (ka) of 0.319 ± 0.0285 d-1. The estimated absolute bioavailability (F) was 59.5 ± 3.74%.

The estimated serum clearance of canakinumab was 0.229 ± 0.00716 L/day in a typical gouty arthritis patient,  consistent  with  the  clearance  values  for  human  IgG  molecules.  The  corresponding  volume  of distribution at steady state was 7.76 L, which is slightly greater than the serum volume and characteristic for the distribution of large macromolecules.

The half-life (t1/2) of canakinumab in adult gouty arthritis patients was 25.6 days.

Following repeated administration of 150 mg s.c. every 12 weeks in adult gouty arthritis patients, the expected accumulation ratio of canakinumab was 1.1-fold.

For the same regimen and patient, the estimated steady state Cmax and AUCtau were 11.3 μg/mL and 383.8 μg·day/mL, respectively

Canakinumab displayed dose independent PK properties, with clearance remaining unchanged within the dose range studied (i.e. 10 mg to 300 mg s.c.) in gouty arthritis patients. There was no indication of changes in pharmacokinetic properties over time as supported by the PK-binding model.

Serum clearance of canakinumab and its volumes of distribution were dependent on body weight (in an allometric relationship with a power of approximately 0.5-1)

PK parameters were comparable between various patient populations and healthy subjects. No clinically significant differences in canakinumab PK were observed between CAPS and gouty arthritis patients.

No clinically  significant  changes  in  canakinumab  PK  were  observed  due  to  differences  in  gender  (after correction for body weight).

There were no differences in pharmacokinetics of canakinumab between elderly versus non-elderly adult patients with regard to clearance and volume of distribution.

Various covariates (body weight, age, sex, ethnicity, laboratory values, study population, and product type changes),  were  explored  graphically  and  statistically  in  the  previous  PK-binding  modeling  exercise  to determine those characteristics that affect canakinumab PK or its binding affinity to IL-1β. For the current submission, creatinine clearance and body mass index (BMI) were also considered as potential covariates as obesity and renal impairment are common co-morbidities in gouty arthritis patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subpopulations

PK parameters were comparable between various patient populations and healthy subjects, and clearance estimates ranged from 0.148 to 0.214 L/day normalized for a 70kg adult. The population estimate of serum clearance of canakinumab in various patient populations is presented in the table below; all were normalized to the weight of 70 kg, for comparison purposes.

| Rheumatoid Arthritis             | 0.214±0.0095   |
| CAPS                             | 0.168±0.0102   |
| Healthy Volunteers, Non-Japanese | 0.148±0.00733  |
| Asthma                           | 0.172±0.0109   |
| Psoriasis                        | 0.188±0.0132   |
| Healthy Volunteers, Japanese     | 0.175 ±0.00854 |

## Gender

No gender-related difference was observed in any of the PK parameters of canakinumab after correction for body weight. PK and PD data from 777 males and 521 females were included in the PK-binding database.

## Ethnic origin

The PK of canakinumab has been studied in several ethnic groups. The PK parameters are not influenced by ethnicity.  Although  much  of  the  race/ethnic  information  was  missing  or  unknown,  the  database  in  the PK-binding model included at least 1106 Caucasians, 84 Asians (37 were Japanese, 25 Chinese, and 5 Indian), 28 black, and 12 Native Americans/Pacific Islanders; 115 subjects were of Hispanic or Latin origin. As reported previously, after adjustment for body weight in the model, non-Japanese and Japanese healthy volunteers differed in canakinumab clearance only by about 17%, with the non-Japanese subjects having the slower clearance.

## Age

Based on the PK-binding model, age (range 3-91 years) did not impact the key PK parameters (clearance, volumes of distribution) of canakinumab after correction for body weight. In the phase III trials of gout indication, no pediatric subjects were enrolled, thus, no PK information in this patient population is available.

## Body weight

For the CAPS population it has been shown that CL and V increase with body weight. This lead to the dosing regimen using 150 mg s.c. flat dose for adults and a BW-adjusted dose for children &lt; 40 kg (2 mg/kg).

Based on the PK-binding model, the clearance and volumes of canakinumab were shown to correlate with bodyweight in an allometric relationship with a power of approximately 0.5-1. Over the range of body weights observed in the gout population (52.0 to 145.5 kg) the clearance would change from 0.141 to 0.332 L/d (keeping all other covariates constant).

Since a higher BMI is common in gouty arthritis patients, the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and PK parameters were also explored. The results indicated that PK of canakinumab is not BMI-dependent, after body weight is taken into account.

## Impaired renal function

As reported in the CAPS dossier, the apparent clearance values (CL/F) of four patients with moderate to end-stage renal insufficiency in the study A2102 ranged from 0.196 to 0.246 L/day after a 150 mg s.c. dose. These values are similar to the mean adult CL/F value of 0.228 L/day, suggesting lack of any significant effect of renal impairment on canakinumab PK.As renal impairment is a common co-morbidity in gouty arthritis patients, creatinine clearance (CrCL) was explored as a potential factor influencing canakinumab PK. The graphical exploration of creatinine clearance against the normalized random effects for clearance (the difference between an individual's value and the typical value) showed that creatinine clearance did not have any noticeable effect on the clearance of canakinumab. However, based on the PK-binding model, small, but statistically significant changes in canakinumab clearance in gouty arthritis patients due to renal impairment were observed. The mean of the individual estimates of serum clearance in gout patients with normal renal function (CrCL &gt; 80 mL/min), mild (CrCL =50 to 80 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-&lt;50 mL/min) were 0.249, 0.208 and 0.194 L/day respectively (see table below). The clearance values in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment are less than 25% of the mean clearance in patients with normal renal function (16% and 22% respectively). Considering the estimated inter-subject variability  in  clearance  of  36%  across  the  entire  population  of  subjects  in  which  canakinumab  was investigated,  this  difference  is  not  clinically  relevant.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  for patients with renal impairment.

SD: Standard Deviation

## Impaired hepatic function

No formal study has been performed with canakinumab in patients with impaired hepatic function as it is known that the majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor mediated endocytosis.

## Bioavailability

Absolute bioavailability was estimated by population PK modelling for the different product types over all populations studied in the different PK studies. The estimated absolute bioavailability of canakinumab (mean ± SEM) after s.c. administration for Product Types A, B, C, D were 60.9 ± 3.74, 64.8 ± 4.14, 69.4 ± 4.39, and 59.5 ± 3.74%, respectively.

A population-specific estimation of bioavailability has not been done and is not possible due to the limited iv data in the target population.

The overall estimated s.c. bioavailability of canakinumab of approximately 60 - 70% is in line with the bioavailability estimates of other IgG monoclonal antibodies.

## Dose-proportionality

Canakinumab exhibits  dose  proportional  exposure  in  gouty  arthritis  patients,  consistent  with  the  dose proportionality demonstrated in the CAPS submission. Dose independence of canakinumab clearance was demonstrated by graphical analysis, shown below (see figure below), plotting the individual estimates of clearance from the PK-binding model against the administered dose. The slope of CL versus dose based on a linear regression fit is approximately zero. As a consequence, it can be concluded that AUC is proportional to dose.

## Time - invariant PK

The MAH stated that the following observations support the time invariant PK properties of canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients, which are in line with the results reported in the original CAPS submission:

1. Antibodies to canakinumab were rarely detected in clinical samples collected over the duration of the treatment. For each of the five trials in gouty arthritis patients described in this dossier, only 8 of the patients treated with canakinumab showed a positive immunogenicity response that was treatment-related. The presence of anti-canakinumab antibodies had no impact on the PK properties of canakinumab.

2.  There  was  no  indication  of  changes  in  pharmacokinetic  properties  over  time  as  supported  by  the PK-binding model.

## Multiple dose and steady state PK

The MAH stated that long term (ranging from 6 months to 4 years) PK and PD assessments have been performed in CAPS and gout trials, with repeat dosing. Based on the PK-binding model, the time to steady state  was  approximately  130  days  (i.e.  5  half-lives).  The  accumulation  ratio  was  estimated  to  be approximately 1.1-fold for 150 mg dosing every 12 weeks in a 93 kg gouty arthritis patient. For the same regimen and patient, the estimated steady state Cmax and AUCtau were 11.3 μg/mL and 384 μg·day/mL, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Drug-drug interactions

Considering  the  biological  and  macromolecular  nature  of  canakinumab,  no  in  vitro  metabolism/drug interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  It  is  known  that  the  majority  of  IgG  elimination  occurs  via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor mediated endocytosis. No specific in-vivo clinical drug interaction studies have been performed between canakinumab and other medicinal products.

The  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  in  gouty  arthritis  patients  are  allopurinol,  paracetamol, amlodipine and acetylsalicylic acid (in study H2356). These co-medications are not expected to influence the PK of canakinumab. This is mainly because the elimination (metabolic) pathways of monoclonal antibodies and  small  molecules  are  different.  Macromolecules  such  as  canakinumab  are  primarily  eliminated  via intracellular catabolism and not expected to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. The effect of canakinumab on the pharmacokinetics of co-medications is also less likely, even though there is some early research  indicating  inflammatory  disease  states  may  influence  the  synthesis  and  expression  of  CYP enzymes. It was reported that the synthesis of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) during chronic inflammation (Aitken 2007, Sunman 2004, Chaluvadi 2009). Anti-cytokine antibodies such as canakinumab that target and neutralize these proinflammatory cytokines or their receptors are capable of restoration of CYP450 enzymes to normal levels (Ashino 2007).

Therefore, there is a possibility of drug interactions with a biologic that reverses an inflammatory condition, thus upregulating levels of CYP450s to normal levels and resulting in increased clearance of co-administered drug  that  are  CYP450  substrates.  The  product  information  of  canakinumab  for  CAPs  patients  (Ilaris) mentions about the potential pathways of interaction affecting the exposure of concomitant medications by canakinumab.

## 1.5.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Introduction

Canakinumab is intended to bind to and thereby inactivate the free IL-1β in the plasma or tissue fluids, so that there is lack of free IL-1β available to stimulate the IL-1β type I receptor responsible for the various inflammatory responses such as high acute phase serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in gouty arthritis patients. Thus,  PD measurements consisted of assaying total IL-1β, and other soluble biomarkers such as CRP and SAA.

Following  canakinumab  dosing,  the in  vivo binding  of  canakinumab  to  endogenous  IL-1βblocks  the interaction of this cytokine to its receptors, thus functionally neutralizing its bioactivity. The canakinumab-IL-1β complex is eliminated at a much slower rate than the free IL-1β, resulting in elevation of total IL-1β. Therefore, increase in total IL-1β is a biomarker for the capture of IL-1β by the antibody. An increase  in  total  IL-1β  was  observed  in  all  patient  populations  (healthy  subjects,  CAPS,  RA,  asthma, psoriasis) following canakinumab dosing.

The ability of canakinumab to bind to IL-1β is quantified by the apparent in vivo dissociation constant, Kd, estimated at 1.1 ± 0.2 nM in CAPS patients.

Canakinumab treatment was associated with a decrease of IL-1β-induced downstream mediators including IL-1β itself, IL-1β pathway related genes, and acute phase proteins such as serum amyloid (SAA) and C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  signifying  that  canakinumab  neutralizes  the  activity  and  down-regulates  the production of IL-1β in vivo.

## Methods

## Determination of total IL-1ß in serum

The  total  IL-1  beta  determination  was  performed  using  a  commercial  kit  provided  by  R&amp;D  Systems (Quantikine® HS kit, catalog number: HSLB00C, Human IL-1 beta / IL-1F2 Immunoassay). The assay was implemented at SGS Cephac Europe and cross-validated by analyzing samples provided and previously analyzed by Novartis Pharma AG.

This assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. A monoclonal antibody specific for IL-1 beta has been pre-coated onto a microplate. Standards and samples are pipetted into the wells and any IL-1 beta present is bound by the immobilized antibody. After washing away any unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for IL-1 beta is added to the wells. Following a wash to remove any unbound antibody-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution is added to the wells. After an incubation period, an amplifier solution is added to the wells and color develops in proportion to the amount of IL-1 beta bound in the initial step.

The reaction is stopped by addition of sulfuric acid.

The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) amounts to 0.500 pg/mL serum, the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) to 8.00 pg/mL serum.

## PD results in gouty arthritis patients

## Total IL-1ß in serum

After canakinumab dosing, in vivo binding of canakinumab to IL-1β is confirmed in all gouty arthritis patient trials based on the increase in total IL-1β, similar to the results observed in other populations (CAPS, RA, psoriasis, asthma, healthy subjects). The increase in total IL-1β was observed for all the drug forms used including  the  current  market  form  (Product  Type  D).  The  binding  parameters  were  estimated  by  the PK-binding model and reported below as mean ±SEM. The clearance of IL-1β was calculated to be 10.9 ± 0.986 L/day in gouty arthritis patients, with a terminal half-life of 3.7 days. Endogenous IL-1β production rate estimated by the PK-binding model varied with study population; the value was 7.69 ± 0.628 ng/day in gouty arthritis patients, and about 33% higher in CAPS. The ability of canakinumab to bind to IL-1β is captured by the apparent in vivo dissociation constant, Kd, with a population estimate of 1.07 ± 0.0742 nM in gouty arthritis patients.

The  concentration  time  profiles  of  total  IL-1β  following  canakinumab  dosing  from  study  H2255  are representative of the profiles in other gouty arthritis patients, and are shown in the figure below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Points represent observed data and lines represent the individual predicted concentration curves for canakinumab treated patients.

In study H2356 (see above under PK results) samples for determination of IL-1ß were collected from 113 patients receiving canakinumab at the same time points as for the PK measurements: Day 1 (predose), 2, 4, 8, 57, 85. Additional PK and PD samples were collected on Days 1, 3, 7 of unscheduled new flare visits.The estimated mean equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) was 1.05 nM.

Total  IL-1β  concentrations  increased  following  canakinumab  dosing.  The  mean  equilibrium  dissociation constant  for  binding  of  canakinumab  to  IL-1β  (KD)  was  1.05  nM,  signifying  potent  in-vivo  binding  of canakinumab to IL-1β. The mean estimated production rate (RLI) and the clearance (CLL) of free IL-1β were 12.1 ng/d and 13.8 L/day, respectively.

Individual concentration-time profiles of IL-1ß in 16 patients were extracted from the full study report as representative examples.

## Biomarkers of inflammation

In contrast to the studies in CAPS patients, across the RA and gout programs, the biomarker that has been systematically studied is C-reactive protein (CRP). In gout, serum amyloid A protein (SAA) has also been evaluated.

## hsCRP and SAA results

In this program, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein have been evaluated in serum  (for  example,  8  times  between  baseline  and  week  25)  in  order  to  identify  the  presence  of inflammation, to determine its severity, and to monitor response to treatment.

In general, in patients exposed to canakinumab, median C-reactive protein levels dropped initially in all treatment groups and then appeared to increase over the following weeks when the treatment was stopped, or remain lower compared to baseline levels when patient were redosed.

A similar pattern was observed with serum amyloid A (SAA) protein levels that dropped initially and then started to increase after Day 85. For example, in study CACZ885H2251, canakinumab 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and repeated dose groups had numerically lower serum amyloid A protein levels over 16 weeks, compared to the colchicine group.

The CRP concentration profiles in all treatment regimens (canakinumab at different doses and colchicine) from study CACZ885H2251 are shown in the figure below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 6. C-reactive protein level (mg/L) by treatment group (Full analysis set)

<!-- image -->

In study H2255, the recruited population included patients with acute gout flares, and the levels of amyloid A and C-reactive protein were markedly elevated at baseline in all treatment groups. As observed with study H2251, the levels dropped for all treatment groups during the study. The figure below shows the CRP decrease over the study duration.

Figure 7. C-reactive protein level (mg/L) by treatment (Full analysis set)

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the small, gout study with 3 hospitalized gouty arthritis patients (study A2212), CRP showed a similar decrease.

Overall, results for the 2 phase II studies were consistent in these gouty arthritis patients and suggest that canakinumab normalizes laboratory signs of inflammation such as high CRP and SAA levels. As for the 2 randomized, pivotal studies against the active comparator (triamcinolone), the trend was similar. In Study H2356, hsCRP levels were 36% lower and SAA levels 60% lower at 72 hours post-dose with canakinumab relative to triamcinolone (both, p&lt;0.001) while in study CACZ885H2357, hsCRP levels were 40% lower at 72 h post-dose and 47% lower at 7 days post-dose with canakinumab versus triamcinolone (both, p&lt;0.0001).

For SAA protein, levels were 27% lower at 24 hours postdose (p=0.0119), 60% lower at 72 hours post-dose (p&lt;0.0001) and 61% lower at 7 days postdose (p&lt;0.0001) with canakinumab versus triamcinolone.

In  summary,  in  the  gout  studies  presented  here,  the  2  proteins  both  signal  the  presence  of  acute inflammation and are modulated (decrease in concentration) within hours after exposure to canakinumab. Though taken in isolation their specificity is low, their simultaneous decrease indirectly supports the notion that they constitute a sensitive soluble biological marker for the inflammatory flares seen in acute gout.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-canakinumab antibodies were analyzed in serum of healthy subjects and adult patients following single or  multiple  administrations of canakinumab. Assessments were done at specific time points during the treatment phase depending on the study design but always included a baseline pre-dose measurement, and an end of study sample. Collection of additional samples in case of anaphylaxis was implemented in all the clinical study protocols.

A sample for measurement of canakinumab concentration was taken concomitantly with the one for testing immunogenicity to facilitate correct interpretation of the immunogenicity data. Anti-canakinumab antibodies in  serum  were  analyzed  by  surface  plasmon  resonance  spectroscopy  using  a  sensitive  and  validated Biacore®  binding  assay.  Details  on  the  immunogenicity  assay  were  provided  in  the  CAPS  dossier. Immunogenicity data and interpretation of results for each individual clinical study are provided with the reports appended to each study report. The table below is a summary table that lists the immunogenicity results from each of the studies.

Source: [Summary of Clinical Safety-Section 4.3.2, Table 4-4]

In all the blood samples tested for anti-canakinumab antibodies from gouty arthritis studies and RA studies listed  in  the  table  above,  only  8  of  the  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  showed  a  specific  positive immunogenicity. For all 8 of these patients (1 in study H2251, 7 in study H2251E1), none of the 8 patients had any evidence of immunogenicity-related AEs.

In study H2251, the patient H2251-0551-00001 received canakinumab at study entry and tested positive for anti-canakinumab  antibodies  at  the  end  of  the  study.  The  corresponding  sample  exhibited  specific anti-canakinumab antibodies (inhibition signal of 30.1 % for a pre-determined positive/negative threshold of  30%)  but  calculated  titers  (2.343  Arbitrary  Units,  AU)  were  only  slightly  above  the  lower  limit  of quantification of the assay (2.806 Arbitrary Units; to note that because of assay output features, higher AU numbers correspond to lower concentrations). The serum clearance in this subject was 0.173 L/day, which is within ±25 % of the population mean clearance of 0.229 L/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The remaining 7 cases in the extension of the same study are of complex interpretation, and none showed emerging AEs that could be related to ADAs. For these 7 patients in study H2251E1, 4 received canakinumab in the core and no treatment in the extension, 2 took colchicine in the core and received canakinumab in the extension, and 1 received canakinumab in the core and was retreated with canakinumab in the extension. In the patient H2251E1-0058-00002, who was randomized to canakinumab in the core study and was treated with canakinumab in the extension study, specific treatment related anti-canakinumab antibodies were detected (inhibition signal of 55.0% for a positive/negative threshold of 30%) on the confirmatory assay but the calculated titers (2.162 Arbitrary Units) were only slightly above the lower limit of quantification of the assay (2.806 Arbitrary Units). This patient showed no unexpected change in PK data that suggested a change in exposure, and no signs of immunogenicity related AEs were observed [CACZ885H2251E1-Section 12.5.4].  The  6  remaining  patients  were  treated  only  once  with  canakinumab.  For  3  of  these  patients (H2251E1-0088-00008, H2251E1-0521-00007 and H2251E1-0010-00003), treatment related anti-canakinumab antibodies were detected (inhibition signal above the negative cut-off of 30%) but titers remained below the lower limit of quantification (2.806 Arbitrary Units) and therefore not measurable. For the  3  other  patients  (H2251E1-0080-00003,  H2251E1-0088-  00009  and  H2251E1-0121-00003),  titers (respectively 2.144, 1.927 and 2.366 Arbitrary Units) were slightly above the lower limit of quantification (2.806 Arbitrary Units). None of these 6 patients showed unexpected change in PK data and/or had any evidence of immunogenicity-related AEs. The serum clearance values in these 7 patients ranged from 0.113 to 0.333 L/day, which is within ±50 % of the population mean clearance of 0.229 L/day, thereby showing no unexpected PK behavior. It can be concluded that the presence of anti-canakinumab antibodies had no impact on the PK or the clinical efficacy / safety in the patients exposed to canakinumab.

In CAPS patients from D2306 and not listed in the table above, with the analytical method used (i.e. Biacore, with  detection  based  on  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance),  none  of  the  patients  tested  for  anti-ACZ885 antibodies  showed  a  test  positivity.  For  10  out  of  the  166  patients  tested,  the  ability  to  detect immunogenicity may have been compromised due to high drug levels even in the samples taken at study completion. Therefore a weak immune response might not have been detected in 10 out of the 166 patients. This limitation of the assay was not present in the samples form the gouty arthritis program, where exposure was limited to 1 to 3 doses of 150 mg sc.

## 1.5.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

The assays used for determination of canakinumab and total IL-1ß in serum were the same as those used during the studies presented in the former CAPS application.

Using the population PK  model, a steady state value for Cmax and AUCtau of 11.3 μg/mL and 383.8 μg·day/mL, respectively, was estimated for the whole gout population. Since a 12 weeks interval was applied  for  this  calculation,  the  values  should  be  quite  similar  to  a  single  dose  application.  Thus,  the observed single dose exposure in the gout population is markedly lower than derived from adult CAPS patients receiving the same dose (Cmax: 15.9 ± 3.52 (SD) µg/mL, AUCinf 708 µg*d/mL).

Accordingly, population PK model parameter estimates of Vss and CLD (drug clearance) for a typical gouty arthritis patient (93 kg BW) were higher than those estimated for the typical adult CAPS patient (Vss: 7.8 vs. 6 L; CLD: 0.23 vs. 0.17  L/d) with underlying similar assumptions for bioavailability (F: 59.5 and 63.3 %). All other parameter  values (Ka (absorption rate const),  CLL (CL of  uncomplexed  ligand)  PSD (intercompartmental permeability flow) and KD (binding constant to IL-1ß) were in good agreement with those estimated for the CAPS population. Half-life (t1/2) of canakinumab in adult gouty arthritis patients was estimated to be 25.6 days which is also in good agreement with the estimation for the CAPS population (26.1d).

Overall, there is lower exposure (lower Cmax and AUC, higher clearance) in the gout population studied compared to the CAPS population. This is obviously due to the known influence of body weight on the canakinumab clearance: The gouty arthritis patients treated with canakinumab in study H2356 had a mean BW of 96.2 kg (range 62.2 - 140 kg), i.e. much higher than the formerly studied adult CAPS population (range 43-77 kg). Since there is a known marked effect of BW on CL, the observed lower exposure of canakinumab in these patients  compared  to  CAPS  adults  appears  plausible.    This  is  confirmed  by  the population estimate of canakinumab clearance of 0.181 L/d when normalized to the weight of 70 kg, which is in good agreement for the values estimated for the CAPS population with the same body weight (0.17 L/d).

The gout population studied was in a body weight range (&gt; 80 kg) which is at the upper limit where the dose per kg falls below 2 mg/kg.

Multiple dose PK measurements in the target population are limited to 20 patients during the pivotal study H2356. The dosage regimen for the claimed indication is 150 mg s.c. single dose per attack with a minimum interval of twelve weeks between doses.

Linear  pharmacokinetics with dose-proportionality has been demonstrated within and across studies in healthy subjects, RA patients and CAPS patients. This could also be observed in one study in gouty arthritis patients on UALT over a dose range of 25 mg to 300 mg s.c. (H2251). However, in a second dose-finding study H2255 in gouty arthritis patients an indication of nonlinear PK behaviour was observed. CL/F and V/F increased dose-dependently (10 mg s.c. up to 150 mg s.c.). It was clarified by the MAH during the evaluation that there was in study H2255 in the 10 mg group a patient with unusually higher concentrations relate to the other patients (outlier). The dose normalised Cmax values were otherwise consistent across the dose ranges studies in study H2255.

Absolute Bioavailability could not be properly calculated from parallel IV and SC groups in studies in the target  population  due  to  limited  IV  data  in  the  target  population.  It  was  estimated  by  population  PK modelling for the different  product types  over  all  populations  studied  in  the different  PK  studies.    The estimated absolute bioavailability of canakinumab (mean ± SEM) after s.c. administration for Product Types A, B, C, D was 60.9 ± 3.74, 64.8 ± 4.14, 69.4 ± 4.39, and 59.5 ± 3.74%, respectively. The value of about 60% for product type A and D is in line with the estimation of 63 % (for product type A) in the population PK analysis of the CAPS population.

Clearance  of  canakinumab  in  the  gout  population  appeared  to  be  independent  of  age  and  gender  but dependent on body weight which is already known from the CAPS population. Although a small influence of impaired renal function (CrCL) on canakinumab clearance was found, neither renal nor hepatic impairment is considered to be a limiting factor for the elimination of canakinumab.

## Pharmacodynamcis

Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β (not to IL-1α or IL-1ra), and blocks the interaction of this cytokine with its receptors, thereby functionally neutralizing its bioactivity. The resulting complex of canakinumab and IL-1β is supposed to be eliminated at a much slower rate than the free IL-1β, resulting in elevation of total IL-1β  (free  plus  complex)  following  canakinumab  administration.  Thus,  measurement  of  free  plus complexed IL-1β, i.e. total IL-1β, is determined as a biomarker for canakinumab indicative of binding of IL-1β by the antibody.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After canakinumab dosing, in vivo binding of canakinumab to IL-1β is confirmed in all gouty arthritis patient trials based on the increase in total IL-1β, similar to the results observed in other populations (CAPS, RA, psoriasis, asthma, healthy subjects). The increase in total IL-1β was observed for all the drug forms used including the current market form (Product Type D). After a single dose of 150 mg s.c. canakinumab a rise of total IL-1ß levels up to 50 pg/mL were observed. The time course of total IL-1ß appears to reflect the endogenous production rate of Il-1ß and the elimination of the complex built. The binding parameters were estimated  by  the  PK-binding  model  and  reported  below  as  mean  ±SEM.  The  clearance  of  IL-1β  was calculated  to  be  10.9  ±  0.986  L/day  in  gouty  arthritis  patients,  with  a  terminal  half-life  of  3.7  days. Endogenous IL-1β production rate estimated by the PK-binding model varied with study population; the value was 7.69 ± 0.628 ng/day in gouty arthritis patients, and about 33% higher in CAPS. The ability of canakinumab to bind to IL-1β is captured by the apparent in vivo dissociation constant, Kd, with a population estimate of 1.07 ± 0.0742 nM in gouty arthritis patients.

In contrast to the studies in CAPS patients, in the studies with gouty arthritis patients the inflammation biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) have also been evaluated. The two proteins both signal the presence of acute inflammation and are modulated (decrease in concentration) within  hours  after  exposure  to  canakinumab.  Though  taken  in  isolation  their  specificity  is  low,  their simultaneous  decrease  indirectly  supports  the  notion  that  they  constitute  a  sensitive  soluble  biological marker for the inflammatory flares seen in acute gout.

In all the blood samples tested for anti-canakinumab antibodies from gouty arthritis studies and RA studies, only  8  of  the  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  (total  number:  1551)  showed  a  specific  positive immunogenicity. All 8 patients were found in one study (1 in H2251 and 7 in its extension H2251E1, total patient number: 100). Only one patient thereof received two doses of canakinumab. All titers were reported to be very low and none of the 8 patients had any evidence of immunogenicity-related AEs.

## 1.5.5. Conclusions on Clinical Pharmacology

The observed single dose exposure with canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients is lower than derived from adults CAPS patients receiving the same dose. Population PK parameters (Vss and Cl) were higher than in CAPS patients. The mean half-life was similar than observed in CAPS patients. Clearance of canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients was independent of age and gender but dependent on body weight (as in CAPs patients).Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and blocks the interaction of this cytokine with its receptors. After a single dose of 150 mg of canakinumab a rise of total IL-1β levels was observed with a time course reflecting endogenous production rate and elimination. In the studies in gouty arthritis patients, both the CRP and SAA, two inflammation markers were elevated.

## 1.6. Clinical efficacy

## 1.6.1. Dose response studies

Study  H2255  was  a  phase  II,  adaptive  dose-ranging,  multi-center,  single-blind,  double  dummy, active-controlled trial to determine the target dose of canakinumab in the treatment of acute flares in gouty arthritis patients who are refractory or contraindicated to treatment with NSAIDs and/or colchicine.

A total of 200 patients with acute flares of gouty arthritis (meeting the ACR 1977 preliminary criteria) were randomized to one of 5 single doses of canakinumab (10, 25, 50, 90 or 150 mg s.c.) or 1 single dose of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg i.m.). Patients were followed for 8 weeks, for efficacy data in week 1 and safety and supportive efficacy data in weeks 2-8.

The main inclusion criteria were: acute gout flare (≤5 days), pain intensity of ≥50 mm on a pain VAS, refractory or with contraindication to NSAIDs and/or colchicine, and if on urate lowering therapy it had to be stable. The main exclusion criteria were use of specific pain relieving drugs or other anti IL-1 agents within specified times before study entry. The groups were well-balanced, except for a marginally lower baseline pain (VAS) severity in the 150 mg canakinumab group.

The primary efficacy criterion was pain intensity (assessed at baseline and each subsequent visit) on a pain VAS (0 to 100 mm), measured at 72 hours after dosing. Secondary efficacy criteria included time to 50% reduction in pain, time to recurrence of flare, pain intensity at other time points, pain on the 5-point Likert scale, the use of rescue medication, patient's &amp; physician's global assessment of response to treatment and safety variables (AEs, SAEs, injection site reactions).

The stated statistical primary objective was to determine the dose providing the same primary efficacy as triamcinolone  acetonide  40  mg  i.m.,  but  the  broader  clinical  objective  was  to  identify  an  adequately efficacious and well-tolerated dose for use in phase III studies, based on all efficacy and safety variables.

Statistically significant dose response relationships were seen at 72 hours (primary endpoint), with the dose of  150 mg being statistically and clinically superior to triamcinolone acetonide while the differences to triamcinolone acetonide for the 10, 25, 50, and 90 mg s.c. doses were less.

The 150 mg s.c. dose showed a statistically significantly greater effect than triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. over 1-5 days and at 7 days, with a treatment difference in pain VAS of 19.2 mm at 72- hours (primary endpoint) and statistically significant treatment differences relative to triamcinolone acetonide from as early as 24 hours.

During the 8-weeks of observation, fewer patients had a new flare with each canakinumab dose than with triamcinolone acetonide (Kaplan Meier estimates of 4 to 14% with canakinumab, compared to 45% with triamcinolone acetonide), and canakinumab 150 mg showed a &gt;90% reduction in the risk of flare compared to triamcinolone acetonide.

Consistent with these findings, the use of rescue medication was reduced with canakinumab compared to triamcinolone  acetonide  and  better  efficacy  was  reported  for  the  physicians'  assessment  of  erythema, tenderness and swelling and both the patient's and physician's global assessments.

## 1.6.2. Main studies

Two pivotal phase  III  studies,  studies  H2356  and  H2357,  were  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  support  this extension of indication. These two studies employed a 12 week, randomized, double blind, double dummy, controlled study design.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods (for both studies H2356 and H2357)

Studies H2356 and H2357 had a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, active controlled clinical study design (as shown in the figure below) to demonstrate that in patients with frequent flares of gout for whom NSAIDs and/ or colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, canakinumab 150 mg s.c. given upon acute gout flares relieves the signs and symptoms and prevents recurrence of gout flares compared to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m.

The efficacy criteria were superiority in 2 co-primary variables (pain intensity at 72 hours and time to first new gouty arthritis flare), both to be met at the one-sided 2.5% level.

Figure 8. Study design (pivotal studies)

<!-- image -->

Both studies have double blind active controlled extensions to 24 weeks in which patients are treated upon flare with the same treatment they were allocated during the 12 week core study.

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

Patients  eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  study  were  to  meet  the  ACR  1977  preliminary  criteria  for  the classification of acute arthritis of primary gout, have onset of current acute gout flare within 5 days prior to randomization, show a patient's assessment of baseline pain intensity ≥ 50 mm on the 0-100 mm VAS, and a history of ≥ 3 gout flares within the 12 months prior to randomization. Evidence of contraindication (absolute or relative), or intolerance, or lack of efficacy for NSAIDs and/or colchicine was needed. If on urate lowering therapy (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticase, probenecid), they had to be on stable dose and schedule with no changes in therapy for 2 weeks prior to randomization and expected to remain on a stable regimen during study participation

## Exclusion criteria

teh exclusion criteria covered the use of the following therapies:

- a. Corticosteroids:
- A dose of ≥ 10 mg of prednisolone or equivalent within 24 hours before screening for any indication

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment

The MAH supplied canakinumab (labeled as ACZ885) and its placebo dummy in individual 6 mL glass vials each containing nominally 150 mg canakinumab (plus 20% overfill) or placebo powder as a lyophilized cake. Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg was the comparator for these two studies. A lipid emulsion which was similar in appearance to triamcinolone acetonide was used as an i.m. placebo injection.

Patients were assigned to one of the following treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1:

- Canakinumab 150 mg
- Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

## Primary objective

The two co-primary objectives of this study were:

- To confirm that canakinumab 150 mg s.c. was superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. with respect to patient ' s assessment of gout pain intensity in the joint most affected at baseline at 72 hours post-dose (on a 0-100 mm VAS)
- To confirm that canakinumab 150 mg s.c. was superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. with respect to the time to the first new gout flare

## Secondary objectives

The main secondary objectives of this study were:

- To evaluate the time to complete resolution of pain in the joint most affected at baseline (Likert scale)
- To evaluate the time to 50% reduction of baseline pain intensity in the most affected joint
- Proportion of patients taking rescue medication
- To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab as compared to triamcinolone acetonide with regards to the SF-36v2 (acute version) physical function component

## Sample size

Both trials were designed to show superior efficacy for canakinumab 150 mg compared to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg with respect to pain intensity at 72 hours post-dose and time to first new gout flare.

The sample size assumptions were based on interim results from the phase II acute gout study H2255.

A sample size of 110 in each group would have 94% power to detect a difference in mean pain score (VAS) in the most affected joint of 12 mm, assuming that the common standard deviation was 25, using a two group t-test with a 0.025 one-sided significance level.

At the time of the interim analysis for the phase II trial, a proportion of 0.96 of patients in the canakinumab 150  mg  group  (n=27)  did  not  have  a  new  flare  compared  to  a  proportion  of  0.61  of  patients  in  the triamcinolone acetonide arm (n=56) during the 8 week study period.

Assuming that more patients would flare during a 12 week study period, a sample size of 110 in each group would have a 96% power to detect a difference in proportion of 0.25 without new gout flare at week 12, a proportion  of  0.75  in  the  canakinumab  group  and  0.5  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group,  using  a one-sided 0.025 level log-rank test for equality of survival curves.

As both co-primary endpoints need to be met, the sample size of 110 per group would result in an overall power of approximately 90%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

At Visit 1, the investigator confirmed whether the patient fulfilled criteria for entry into the study. If so, then the investigator instructed an independent, unblinded qualified study person to call the IVRS to randomize the patient and obtain the assigned treatment arm. All eligible patients were given a randomization number from IVRS that assigned them to one of the treatment arms.

## Blinding

Patients and data analysts remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock.

## Statistical methods

The Randomized Set consisted of all subjects randomized.

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients as randomized that have at least one post-baseline VAS assessment. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization.

For  the  efficacy  analysis,  as  both  co-primary  objectives  had  to  be  met,  there  was  no  adjustment  for multiplicity. The hypotheses were tested at a one-sided 2.5% level.

For the first set of secondary endpoints, the Bonferroni-Holm method was used to adjust for multiplicity in the  evaluation  of  these  four  efficacy  variables.  In  order  to  do  this,  the  hypotheses  of  superiority  of canakinumab 150 mg for the k=4 variables above were tested and the p-values ordered. If the smallest p-value was less than 0.0125 (0.05/k), then the corresponding hypothesis was rejected. If the next p-value was less than 0.05/k-1, then that hypothesis was also rejected. The remaining hypotheses were tested in the same manner. This continued until the hypothesis with the smallest p-value could not be rejected. At that point, no more hypotheses were evaluated.

The Safety Set consisted of all patients that received study drug and had at least one post baseline safety assessment. Patients were analyzed according to treatment received.

## Results

## Study H2356

## Participant flow

A total of 230 patients were randomized, 115 to each treatment group (see table below). More than 90% of patients  in  either  treatment  group  completed  the  study.  Overall,  more  patients  discontinued  in  the triamcinolone acetonide group compared with the canakinumab group (8.7% vs. 5.2%), and the most relevant difference seen was in the number of patients discontinuing due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (4 patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group vs. no patients in the canakinumab group). There were no other meaningful differences between the treatment groups in the reasons for discontinuation from the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One patient, in the triamcinolone acetonide group, died prior to study completion. There were otherwise no adverse events leading to study discontinuation.

Two patients randomized to canakinumab were not included in the safety or full analysis sets as they did not receive any study medication. Supplies were not available for these patients at the site on the day of randomization and they were discontinued from the study on the same day (with the primary reason listed as administrative problems).

## Conduct of the study

The study protocol was amended twice. The key features of each amendment are given below:

Amendment 1 (11-Sep-2009) was issued (prior to the first patient first visit, 04-Dec-2009) to expand the patient population.

Amendment 2 (09-Feb-2010) was issued to define required washout periods for NSAIDs and other pain medication  at  the  time  of  screening,  as  intake  of  such  medication  could  confound  the  patients  pain assessment at Visit 1. In addition, changes to the analysis plan were made as a result of discussions with the health authorities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These amendments were not considered to have affected the interpretation of study results as they were minor and occurred prior to study unblinding.

## Baseline data

Baseline demographic and background characteristics were generally comparable for the two treatment groups (see tables below). The majority of patients were Caucasian and male, and 54 years of age on average. The mean BMI was approximately 32 kg/m2.

Baseline disease characteristics were generally comparable between the two treatment groups (see tables below).

The canakinumab group had a lower proportion of patients with a &gt; 10 year history of gout compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (24.8% vs. 39.1%, respectively); however, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in gout history overall (p=0.0694).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately 45% of all patients suffered from monoarticular gout. There were some differences between the  treatment  groups  in  the  numbers  of  patients  with  oligoarticular  (32.7%  canakinumab  vs.  43.5% triamcinolone acetonide) or polyarticular (22.1% canakinumab vs. 12.2% triamcinolone acetonide) gout. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in acute gout classification overall (p=0.0809).

The  two  treatment  groups  had  comparable  median  numbers  of  flares  in  the  previous  year  (4  for canakinumab and 5 for triamcinolone acetonide). The proportion of patients with &gt;6 flares in the past year was lower in the canakinumab group (25.7%) compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (33.0%) but  the  overall  number  of  flares  experienced  was  not  significantly  different  between  treatment  groups (p=0.2213).

The physician ' s assessment showed nearly all patients had joint tenderness, which was evidenced as pain (20.2%), pain and wincing (44.3%), or pain, wincing and withdrawal (35.1%). Visible joint swelling was seen for 60.5% of the patients and 30.7% showed bulging beyond the joint margins. Erythema was present for the majority of patients (85.5%). Tophi were present in 39% of the patients.

A total of 23 patients (12 in the canakinumab group and 11 in the triamcinolone acetonide group) had data available  at  baseline.  The  majority  of  these  patients  had  tophi  (91.7%  vs.  63.6%,  respectively), inflammation (58.3% vs. 72.7%, respectively), erosions (83.3% vs. 90.9%, respectively), and suspected urate crystal deposits (75.0% vs. 54.5%) present.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  majority  of  the  patients  had  comorbidities  present  at  baseline  (86.8%)  which  included  stable hypertension  (70.2%),  obesity  (57.5%),  metabolic  syndrome  (36.4%),  hypercholesterolemia  (27.6%), chronic kidney disease (14.5%), on stable cholesterol lowering treatments (13.6%), diabetes (11.4%), stable coronary artery disease (11.0%), and current or prior symptoms of heart failure (5.3%). There were no  relevant  differences  between  the  two  treatment  groups,  with  the  exception  of  metabolic  syndrome (41.6% canakinumab vs. 31.3% triamcinolone acetonide).

The majority of patients (93.9%) had a relevant medical history or continuing medical condition that was active at study start. The most common active medical histories by system organ class (i.e., ≥ 20.0%) were vascular disorders (72.4%), metabolic and nutrition disorders (74.6%), cardiac disorders (29.4%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (20.2%). The most common active medical histories by preferred term (i.e., ≥ 20.0%) were hypertension (57.5%), obesity (52.6%), metabolic syndrome (21.1%), and hypercholesterolemia (20.6%). Generally, the treatment groups were comparable regarding active medical histories. The profile of active medical histories was as expected for this patient population.

## Outcomes and estimations

## Co-primary endpoints

## Pain intensity measured by 0-100 mm VAS at 72 hours post-dose

Pain intensity as measured by the 0-100 mm VAS was statistically significantly lower for the canakinumab treatment  group  compared  with  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  at  72  hours  post-dose  (LS  mean difference of -11.4 mm; p=0.0005) (see table below)

denotesap-value≤0.025.

To  incorporate  the  time-dependent  relationships  between  repeated  assessments  of  VAS,  a  supportive analysis using the repeated measures GEE (Generalized estimating equations) was performed to examine the  VAS  profile  over  the  72  hours  post-baseline.  The  results  confirmed  those  of  the  primary  analysis (estimated mean difference of -8.6 mm; p=0.0003).

Additionally, AUC(0-72) of pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS) showed patients treated with canakinumab had less pain by approximately 10 mm, on average, throughout the first 72 hours, compared to patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide .

## Time to first new gout flare

Over 12 weeks following randomization, the probability of new gout flares was lower for canakinumab compared with triamcinolone acetonide (Kaplan-Meier estimates: 18.9% vs. 36.5%, respectively). This corresponds to a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 55% for time to first new gout flare (hazard ratio of 0.45; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.76; p=0.0014) (see table and figure below).

## Proportion of patients taking rescue medication

The proportion of patients who took rescue medication was lower in the canakinumab group compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (31.0% vs. 52.2%, respectively). Patients in the canakinumab group were less likely to take rescue medication compared with patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group (odds ratio of 0.42; p=0.0022).

## Time to 50% reduction of baseline pain intensity

The time to at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain (0-100 mm VAS) was less with canakinumab than with triamcinolone acetonide (median=48 hours vs. 72 hours, respectively). There was a 47% greater chance for good  pain  reduction  (i.e.,  at  least  a  50%  reduction  in  baseline  pain)  with  canakinumab  relative  to triamcinolone acetonide (hazard ratio of 1.47; p=0.0103).

The figure below presents the Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to at least 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity (VAS). There was little difference between the treatment groups over the first 12 hours post-dose, however, at 24 hours, approximately 40% of the patients in the canakinumab group achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain compared with approximately 30% in the triamcinolone acetonide group. From 24 hours post-dose to the last time point measured (7 days post-dose) the odds ratios ranged from 1.95 to 2.44 indicating that patients in the canakinumab group were more likely to have at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity compared with patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group (all, p&lt;0.05).

## Time to complete resolution of pain

Over  7  days  following  randomization,  the  likelihood  of  complete  resolution  of  pain  was  higher  for canakinumab compared with triamcinolone acetonide but the difference was small (Kaplan-Meier estimates: 34.5% vs. 31.3%, respectively). There was only a negligible difference between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio of 1.09; p=0.7227).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  mean  scores  at  baseline  were  29.98  and  30.88  for  canakinumab  and  triamcinolone  acetonide, respectively. Improvements were seen for both treatment groups at all time points post-dose: 4 weeks (mean  changes  of  14.76  and  13.14,  respectively),  8  weeks  (mean  changes  of  16.35  and  14.60, respectively), and 12 weeks (mean changes of 16.42 and 14.46, respectively).

## Study H2357

## Participant flow

A  total  of  226  patients  were  randomized  to  treatment,  112  to  canakinumab  150  mg  s.c.  and  114  to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. (Table below). Nearly 90% of patients across both treatment groups completed the study. The rate of study discontinuation was similar between the two groups (11.6% for canakinumab vs. 9.6% for triamcinolone acetonide). The most common reasons for study discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (4.4% in total) and lost to follow (3.5%). One patient in each group discontinued due to abnormal laboratory values.

One patient in the canakinumab group died prior to study completion. There were otherwise no AEs leading to study discontinuation.

## Conduct of the study

The study protocol was amended once. The key features of each amendment are given below:

Amendment 1 (23-Feb-2010) was issued before the first patient first visit (05-Mar-2010). The main purpose of the amendment was to revise the source for the supply of comparator drug (triamcinolone acetonide and matching placebo) to allow the sites to obtain the comparator from Novartis or from a third party or to purchase it on their own. Minor editorial changes were also made.

Changes introduced with this amendment were not considered to have affected the interpretation of study results as they were minor and occurred prior to study start.

The  canakinumab group had a slightly  lower  proportion  of  patients  suffering  from  gout  for  &gt;10  years compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (36.6% vs. 44.7%), but overall there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in the duration of gout history (p=0.2343). Both treatment groups had predominantly monoarticular gout (58.9% canakinumab and 62.3% triamcinolone acetonide), followed by oligoarticular gout (20.5% and 24.6%, respectively) and polyarticular gout (20.5% and 13.2%, respectively). Both treatment groups had a median of 5 gout flares in the previous year before study entry. In  the  past  year,  most  patients  in  both  groups  had  3-6  gout  flares  (72.3%  canakinumab  and  78.9% triamcinolone acetonide), similar proportions had &gt;6 gout flares (27.7% and 21.1%, respectively).

The physician's assessment showed nearly all patients had joint tenderness, which was evidenced as pain (13.3%), pain and wincing (34.1%), or pain, wincing and withdrawal (51.8%). Palpable swelling was seen for  13.3% of all patients, visible swelling for 45.1% and bulging beyond the joint margins for 40.3%. Erythema was present for 82.3% of patients, and tophi were present for 19.0%.

## Outcomes and estimations

## Co-primary endpoints

## Pain intensity measured by 0-100 mm VAS

Canakinumab 150 mg provided statistically superior reductions in pain intensity as measured by 0-100 mm VAS  compared  with  triamcinolone  acetonide  40  mg  at  72  hours  post-dose.  The  estimated  treatment difference of -9.8 mm was statistically significant (p=0.0018) (see table below).

To incorporate time-dependent relationships between repeated assessments of VAS, a repeated measures GEE (Generalized estimating equations) analysis was performed to examine the VAS profile over the 72 hours post-baseline. The results confirmed those of the primary analysis (estimated treatment difference of -5.56; 95% CI -10.8 to -0.28; p=0.0195).

Additionally, AUC of pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS) showed that patients treated with canakinumab had 6.2 mm less pain, on average, throughout the first 72 hours post-dose compared with patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide. Over 168 hours post-dose, the difference was 7.4 mm on average in favor of canakinumab.

## Time to first new flare

Over 12 weeks following randomization, the probability of new gout flares was lower for canakinumab compared with triamcinolone acetonide (Kaplan-Meier estimates: 14.2% vs. 38.2%) (see table and figure below). This corresponds to a statistically significant risk reduction of 68% for time to first new gout flare which was statistically significant (hazard ratio of 0.32; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58; p&lt;0.0001).

## Secondary endpoints

The first set of secondary efficacy variables were:

- Time to complete resolution of pain in the most affected joint (pain intensity on Likert scale = none)
- Time  to  50%  reduction  of  baseline  pain  intensity  in  the  most  affected  joint  (as  measured  by 0-100mm VAS)
- Proportion of patients taking rescue medication during the first week
- SF-36 physical function component score at end of study

None  of  the  4  secondary  efficacy  objectives  were  formally  met  (see  table  below)  when  using  the Bonferroni-Holm method to adjust for multiplicity, which requires a two-sided p-value of 0.0125 for efficacy variable with the most statistically significant result.

(2) p-values are sorted in ascending order

The median time to complete resolution of pain (defined as no pain on the Likert scale) was achieved at Day 6 (144 hours) with canakinumab, but could not be estimated with triamcinolone acetonide as less than 50% of patients in the comparator group met this endpoint within the observation period for the acute flare (7 days). The two-sided p-value of 0.0130 was slightly above the statistical significance threshold set at p 0.0125.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  took  rescue  medication  during  the  baseline  gout  flare  was numerically lower with canakinumab (43.8%) than with triamcinolone acetonide (57.0%), with a two-sided p-value of 0.0214.

The median time to 50% reduction in pain as measured VAS was numerically shorter with canakinumab (25 hours) than with triamcinolone acetonide (48 hours) for the baseline flare.

Improvements in the SF-36 physical function scale were seen in both treatment groups at the end of study. No difference between the treatment arms was observed (LS mean score at end of study: 81.5 canakinumab and 78.8 triamcinolone acetonide).

The time to at least a 50% reduction in pain intensity (VAS) for the baseline flare was numerically shorter with canakinumab versus triamcinolone acetonide (median 25.0 hours vs. 48.0 hours). The hazard ratio was 1.29, with a two-sided p-value of 0.0810.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The figure above shows the Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity (VAS). There was little difference between the treatment groups over the first 24 hours post-dose. Thereafter  the  treatment  groups  began  to  differentiate,  with  the  canakinumab  group  having  higher proportions of patients achieving 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group.

At 72 hours post-dose, 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity was observed in 78.4% of patients in the canakinumab group and 60.6% patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group. The estimated odds ratio was 2.32 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.22; p=0.0059), indicating that patients treated with canakinumab were more likely to achieve at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity at 72 hours post-dose than patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide. A similar result was observed at 5 days post-dose: 50% reduction in baseline pain  intensity  was  seen  in  81.1%  of  canakinumab-treated  patients  vs.  66.1%  of  patients  treated  with triamcinolone acetonide, and this difference was statistically significant in favor of canakinumab (odds ratio 2.12;  95%  CI  1.14  to  3.96;  p=0.0180).  Although  significant  differences  were  not  observed  at  other timepoints, the trend was similar with odds ratios ranging from 1.22 to 1.76.

The most common type of rescue medication taken during the baseline flare was acetaminophen (36.6% in the canakinumab group and 50.0% in the triamcinolone acetonide group), followed by codeine (18.8% and 23.7%) and prednisolone/prednisone (12.5% and 20.2%). The mean amounts of all 3 rescue medications (in  mg)  were  lower  in  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  than  in  patients  treated  with  triamcinolone acetonide.

Pooled data are similar to the efficacy results that are already presented separately for studies H2356 and H2357.

## Clinical studies in special populations

There  were  no  differences  in  efficacy  compared  to  the  overall  study  population  among  demographic subgroups (age, sex, race, BMI) and in patients with over or under 6 flares in the past year.

## Subgroup analysis in patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine

The efficacy analyses were re-run for the subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine. Treatment comparisons were performed for patients who were contraindicated/intolerant to/lack of efficacy for NSAIDs and colchicine and patients who were able to use at least one of the 2 treatments. The subgroup by treatment interaction is provided to see if any differences existed in efficacy responses. None of the treatment by subgroup interaction terms was statistically significant which indicates no relevant treatment differences exist among the two subgroups for all six variables. The findings are summarized in the table below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Canakinumab remained statistically significantly better than triamcinolone acetonide for pain intensity, time to 1st new flare, and time to first rescue medication use. The two exceptions were the time to 50% reduction in VAS pain, where there was not a significant treatment difference in the subgroup of patients able to take either NSAIDs or colchicine, and in the time to complete resolution of pain for the baseline flare, where the subgroup unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine did not have a statistically significant difference in favor of canakinumab.

In each case and for all the measured efficacy outcomes, the subgroup by treatment interaction was not statistically significant, suggesting that overall, patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine responded in the same way to canakinumab treatment as those who were able to take either one of these therapies.

The characteristics of patients with little or no response to treatment at the baseline flare who re-flare, failed to show any demographic, or disease features that correlated with this low response. The only predictive factor identified was that in patients who re-flare the response to the baseline flare was closely related to the response to a subsequent flare:

Good (≥50% reduction in VAS pain) response to treatment predicted good response to retreatment (75%), and weak response (&lt;50% reduction in VAS pain) to treatment was a good predictor of weak response to re-treatment (83%), as seen in Table 4-13. Thus, the response to re-treatment appears to be predictable based on the response to the baseline flare.

The data to support this predictability is limited as they include 2 patients with strong baseline responses who supplied no data for the last flare but were classified as non responders (baseline observation was carried forward). The exclusion of these patients raises the good response from 75% to 83% (15/18) and lowers the estimate of patients with a strong initial and poor last response from 25% to 17% (3/18). However, more data are needed as this dataset is small.

The time of treatment after the start of the flare (0-1, 2, 3, ≥4 days after flare start) affected the VAS pain response and the frequency of resolution to no pain on the Likert score. Although mean VAS baseline pain at 73 or 74 mm was very similar in all subgroups, the extent of pain relief and frequency of resolution differed. Greatest pain relief and frequency of complete resolution were seen when treatment was given early after flare started, for both treatment groups.

## Use of urate lowering therapy

There were no significant differences in VAS pain reduction by use of urate lowering drugs. The fall in VAS pain  was  significantly  greater  with  canakinumab  than  triamcinolone  acetonide  with  and  without  urate lowering drugs.

Probability for recurrent flare was consistently low with canakinumab in both subgroups and was statistically below  that  for  triamcinolone  acetonide  without  urate  lowering  drugs.  With  urate  lowering  drugs triamcinolone  acetonide  became  more  effective,  therefore  this  comparison,  although  still  favoring canakinumab, was not statistically significant.

Patients using urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group had a 28% reduction in the risk of the first new flare compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (hazard ratio of 0.72; 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.32; p=0.14), (see table below). While the patients not using urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group had a 76% statistically significant reduction in the risk of the first new flare compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (hazard ratio of 0.24; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.41; p&lt;0.0001).

The  treatment  by  subgroup  interaction  between  usage  of  urate  lowering  therapy  and  treatment  was statistically significant (p=0.0084), indicating a potential difference in effect size of canakinumab, between the two subgroups.

During the evaluation the MAH provided additional subgroup analyses in order to support the benefit/risk balance  of  Ilaris  in  the  restricted  indication  'symptomatic  treatment  of  gouty  arthritis  attacks  in  adult patients in whom NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated or do not provide adequate response and in whom repeated courses of corticoisteroids are not appropriate.

## Patients with appropriate management of uricaemia

A subgroup analysis has been defined patients, who are:

- unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine (as per Section 2.1.1.1.1), and
- who are on ULT, or previously failed on ULT, or are contraindicated to ULT

These patients, unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, who were on ULT, failed ULT or where ULT was contraindicated, included over 100 patients. The findings in this subgroup were consistent with the efficacy and safety results from the overall Phase III population.

## Demographics and disease history

Patient demographics and disease history were comparable between treatment groups.

## Efficacy

Pain intensity (0-100mm VAS) over the first 7 days is presented in the table below. At all timepoints tested there was at least a numerical advantage favoring canakinumab over triamcinolone acetonide reflected by the point estimate. At early timepoints pain is numerically in favor of canakinumab with a 3mm benefit after 6 &amp; 12 hours and 6.7mm after 24 hours. Estimated differences in pain intensity between 48 hours and 7 days range between 10-13 mm, and were statistically significant between 48 hours and 6 days (including 72 hours, the timepoint of the co-primary objective). Summary statistics of pain intensity in first 7 days and all scheduled  visits  over  24  weeks  were  provided  showing  also  a  fast  onset  in  patients  treated  with canakinumab with absolute and relative improvement in pain intensity of 16.7mm, 23.2mm and 31.8mm, or &gt;20%, &gt;30% and &gt;40% compared to baseline (74.6mm) after 6, 12 and 24 hours.

In addition to this acute pain management benefit, the superiority in time to first new flare was maintained over  12  (co-primary  endpoint)  and  24  weeks,  with  a  median  time  to  first  new  flare  of  155  days  for triamcinolone acetonide, while the median time to first new flare for the canakinumab arm could not be estimated (see table below) as only 27% of canakinumab-treated patients flared in first 24 weeks.

Similarly to the overall study population, patients with a good pain response (≥50% pain reduction after treatment of the baseline flare), had fewer flares over 12 and 24 weeks, compared to those with a poor pain response. Again, these results support the postulate that a good pain response appears to correlate with an increased interval between subsequent clinical flares.

There  was  maintained  efficacy  on  re-treatment  as  evidenced  by  the  pain  reductions  over  first  7  days following treatment which were comparable for baseline flare and last post-baseline flare.

In summary efficacy in patients receiving ULT, who have failed ULT, or for whom ULT is contraindicated, and who are unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine was similar to overall study results, showing maintenance of the improved response for both co-primary endpoints; pain and time to next flare over triamcinolone.

## Patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine; ULT (current use, failure, or contraindication)

## Treatment of flares

Data on pain intensity (0-100mm VAS) over the first 7 days is presented in the table below. At all time points reported there was a numerical advantage favoring canakinumab over triamcinolone acetonide reflected by the point estimate. At early time points pain is numerically in favor of canakinumab with a 3mm benefit after 6 &amp; 12 hours and increases to 6.7mm after 24 hours. Estimated differences in pain intensity between 48 hours and 7 days range between 10-13 mm, and were statistically significant between 48 hours and 6 days (including  72  hours,  the  time  point  at  which  the  co-primary  objective  was  assessed).  These  data  also demonstrate a fast onset of action in patients treated with canakinumab with absolute improvement in pain intensity compared to baseline of 16.7mm, 23.2mm and 31.8mm after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. As a relative improvement this corresponds to &gt;20% (slightly improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale), &gt;30% and &gt;40% (much improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale) compared to baseline (74.6mm) after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively.

## Delay of subsequent flares

In addition to the acute pain management benefit, the superiority in 'time to first new flare' was maintained over 12 (co-primary endpoint) and 24 weeks, with fewer canakinumab patients experiencing a new flare. For triamcinolone acetonide, the median time to first new flare was 155 days. However, the median time to 'first new flare' for the canakinumab arm could not be estimated as only 27% of canakinumab-treated patients flared in the first 24 weeks (see table below).

## Patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine; ULT (current users)

## Treatment of flares

Data on pain intensity (0-100mm VAS) over the first 7 days is presented in this narrower ULT subgroup (excluding  patients  failed  or  contraindicated  to  ULT),  in  the  table.  The  effect  on  pain  intensity  was numerically in favor of canakinumab for all time points from 12 hours onwards. From 24 hours onwards estimated differences compared to triamcinolone acetonide were ranging between 3 and 8mm benefit in favor of canakinumab. As expected, confidence interval width in this small group is large due to variance. Since the confidence intervals include the point estimates of the analyses from the larger ULT subgroup below, as well as the overall study population, results from this newly requested narrow ULT subgroup are in line with earlier results.

Further, changes from baseline show a fast onset of action in patients treated with canakinumab with absolute improvement in pain  intensity  compared to  baseline  of  15.3mm,  24.5mm  and  29.9mm,  or a relative improvement of &gt;20% (slightly improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale), &gt;30% and &gt;40% (much improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale) compared to baseline  (72.3mm)  after  6,  12  and  24  hours,  respectively  (Salaffi  et  al,  2004).  Further,  a  ≥20% improvement in pain (after 24 hours) has been suggested recently to define an appropriate response in gouty arthritis attacks (Khanna D, 2011). This onset of action is consistent with the one shown for the subgroup presented later, i.e. 'Patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine; ULT (use/failure/CI)'.

## Delay of subsequent flares

Background: When interpreting data on delay of subsequent flares, it is important to keep in mind that the phase 3 protocols required patients to be on a stable dose of urate lowering therapy (ULT) (Inclusion criterion: 'If on ULT (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticase, probenecid), stable dose and schedule with no changes in therapy for 2 weeks prior to randomization and expected to remain on a stable regimen during study participation'). This requirement was introduced to minimize any bias that might be related to a potential high number of incident flares due to adjustment of ULT.

In the narrower ULT subgroup limited to current users of ULT (i.e. excluding patients who failed or are contraindicated to ULT) , analysis of time to first new flare and corresponding hazard ratios do not suggest a difference of either treatment option, neither at 12 or 24 weeks (see table below).

Based on descriptive results of the Kaplan Meier estimates there was no differentiation over the first 12 weeks, with 21% of canakinumab patients and 20% of triamcinolone acetonide patients having a new flare. However, over 24 weeks there was a slight trend toward reduced incidence of new flares for canakinumab patients (38%), compared to triamcinolone acetonide patients (44%) (see table below).

Additionally, although patient numbers and differences were small, fewer canakinumab patients compared to triamcinolone acetonide patients had maximum number of new flares observed in 12 and 24 weeks (1 vs. 2 patients with a 2nd flare in 12 weeks, and also 1 vs. 2 patients with a 3rd flare in 24 weeks). Moreover, the mean flare rate over 12 and 24 weeks also slightly favored canakinumab (see table below).

## Supportive studies

## Extension studies H2356E1 and H2357E1

Studies H2356E1 and H2357E1 were an active controlled extension phase of the main pivotal studies H2356 and H2357 respectively.

After the pivotal trial, patients were continued in a 12 week double blind, controlled extension, receiving the same, on-demand treatment as in the core study. The primay objective of these two extension studies was to assess safety and tolerability. All efficacy endpoints were secondary objectives.

## Time to new flare (24 weeks)

Time to new flare, which is the co-primary endpoint at 12 weeks, is shown for the 12 week period plus extensions in the table below (24 weeks total) to evaluate the durability of effect. As in the core trials the cumulative flare rates and the risk of a new flare were considerably reduced and statistically significantly lower with canakinumab than with triamcinolone acetonide. The median times to new flare were 119 and 146 days with triamcinolone acetonide in both trials, and &gt;168 days (trial duration) with canakinumab, as evident from the table below.

The 52% and 60% risk reductions over 24 weeks (hazard ratios of 0.48 and 0.40) are clinically significant, as indicated by the lower median time to the first new flare with triamcinolone acetonide (131 days), than with canakinumab (&gt;168 days). Although the median time to new flare is unclear until 50% of patients have flared, it may be several months longer with canakinumab than with triamcinolone acetonide.

## The frequency of new flares (24 weeks)

The rate of new flares, and the mean number of flares per patient, is shown for the pivotal trials plus their extensions in the table below. As in the core 12 week period, more patients were free of new flares with canakinumab than triamcinolone acetonide (68% versus 49% and 75% versus 54%), fewer patients had 2 or more new flares (8% versus 22% and 7% versus 22%) and the mean number of flares per patient was lower (0.4 versus 0.9 and 0.4 versus 0.8). Thus, with canakinumab more patients were free of new flares and, in addition, less patients experienced multiple new flares.

## Efficacy upon re-treatment (24 weeks)

Efficacy upon re-treatment for new flares in the 24 week period was also evaluated. This increases the number of patients who are included to 60 with canakinumab and to 89 with triamcinolone acetonide (&gt;50% more than in the 12 week period), thereby providing more data on the effect of re-treatment on pain relief.

The methodological reasons that hinder direct treatment comparisons in patients with new flares are briefly described. Re-treatment efficacy is then assessed by comparing the first flare with the last flare, to avoid the bias in direct treatment comparisons. For completeness, the use of rescue medication and the subgroup analyses are also presented, despite the limitations regarding treatment comparisons.

## Constraints of treatment comparisons for new flares

Methodological reasons hinder direct treatment comparisons of efficacy in the subgroup of patients with new flares, as re-treatment was not randomly allocated (the initial treatment was repeated), so results are subject to a selection bias from the first treatment. The lack of random allocation after the first treatment is likely to lead to unequal distributions of participation and disease severity across re-treatment groups.

Unequal participation arose from both a lower proportion of patients who had new flares with canakinumab (28%, 64/225) than triamcinolone acetonide (49%, 112/229), (see table above), and a lower proportion of re-treatment data with triamcinolone acetonide than canakinumab (79%, 89/112 versus 94%, 60/64). The latter resulted mainly from the early occurrence of new flares (the protocol prohibited re-treatment within 14 days of the last dose), also from eligible patients not returning for re-treatment and occasionally from missing data.

An imbalance in disease severity of re-treated canakinumab patients is seen in the key disease and flare features in the table below. Patients had more severe disease (less monoarticular and more polyarticular gouty arthritis, greater presence of tophi, history of &gt;6 flares/year and higher disability indices). Their current flare was also more severe (less involvement of ≤2 joints and more involvement of ≥4 joints). The imbalance  is  likely  related  to  the  different  rates  of  new  flare  (72%  on  canakinumab  and  51%  on triamcinolone acetonide had no new flare).

## Patient Assessment (VAS first and last flare)

With canakinumab the mean VAS pain treatment response of the last flare was very similar to that of the first flare in all patients with re-treatment (see figure below). However, for the last flare, in the pooled dataset, baseline VAS pain was less than that for the first flare (66 mm versus 75 mm) with canakinumab but quite similar with triamcinolone acetonide (72 mm versus 75 mm) suggesting that the pain intensity at the start of a new flare had been reduced by prior canakinumab treatment. The data from each study was consistent with the pooled analysis.

## Pain reduction of at least 50% (first and last flare)

The percentage of patients with at least 50% reduction in VAS pain by day 7 with the initial treatment relative to the last treatment, and of those with a less than 50% reduction in VAS pain are shown in the table below.

With canakinumab, a strong response to treatment (≥50% reduction in VAS pain) predicted strong response to re-treatment (84%), and weak response to treatment (&lt;50% reduction in VAS pain) predicted a weak response to re-treatment (77%). Thus, both a weak response after a good one and a good response after a weak one were relatively uncommon (16% and 23%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, with triamcinolone acetonide, although a good response to initial treatment predicted a good response to re-treatment (89%), a weak response to initial treatment did not predict a weak response to re-treatment (44%). A weak response after a strong one was unlikely (11%), but a strong response after a weak one was quite common (56%).

## Pain, global assessment, swelling, tenderness (first and last flare)

The maintenance of efficacy with re-treatment for new flares is also confirmed in the scores for Likert pain, patient and physician global assessments of response, physician assessment of joint tenderness and joint swelling at 72 hours and 7 days. Canakinumab treatment showed similar levels of response during the last flare compared to the baseline flare at both timepoints, demonstrating that efficacy is preserved in new flares.

## Rescue medication use (last flare)

The use of rescue medication was evaluated from the time to first intake, the number of patients using rescue medication, and the amount of rescue medication taken during the last flare. Treatment comparisons can only indicate trends, as the treatment groups are exposed to selection bias from the first treatment.

The proportions of patients using any rescue medication or each type of rescue medication showed no consistent  treatment  difference  during  the  last  flare.  However,  the  amount  of  corticosteroid  rescue medication  taken  (mean  total  in  mg)  was  consistently  less  with  canakinumab  than  with  triamcinolone acetonide,  with  the  amounts  of  acetaminophen/paracetamol  or  codeine  used  showing  no  consistent difference.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thus, in the extension studies, for the last flare in patients using canakinumab, the use of corticosteroids continued to be reduced, suggesting that there was both less pain and less inflammation with canakinumab, which is supported by the finding of reduced pain for the new flare in the canakinumab group.

## Duration of flare (first and last flare)

With canakinumab the mean (median) duration of the new flare compared to the baseline flare seemed to be reduced in Study H2356E1 and possibly in Study H2357E1, whereas with triamcinolone acetonide, mean (median) durations for the new flare showed no signs of being reduced.

## Subgroups of the study population (24 weeks)

Subgroup analyses were used to demonstrate that efficacy persists in common subgroups of the overall population at the 24 week timepoint.

The results of the subgroup analyses at 24 weeks showed no qualitative differences from those at 12 weeks for time to first new flare and VAS pain intensity, and no loss of efficacy over time. There were no differences in efficacy at 24 weeks compared to the overall study population among demographic subgroups (age, sex, race, BMI), except that there were too few Asians to show a treatment difference.

There were also similar trends in efficacy at 24 weeks compared to the overall population in 1) patients documented as unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, 2) patients with ≥6 flares in the previous year, 3) patients  unable  to  use  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  and  with  ≥6  flares  in  the  previous  year,  or  4)  use  of urate-lowering drugs, as shown in the tables below for the analysis of time to first new flare.

Patients with ≥6 flares in the previous year showed smaller treatment effects at 24 weeks than at 12 weeks, narrowly missing statistical significance for time to first new flare (p=0.034). This suggests that beyond 12 weeks from initial treatment, when canakinumab exposure is probably low, frequently-flaring patients start to resume a high flare rate. These patients have a shorter median time to next flare (close to 24 weeks, as almost 50% had flared, see table above) than the overall population (32% had flared at 24 weeks), and are likely to need more frequent treatment.

A further analysis of time to first new flare in the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine and with ≥6 new flares in the previous year showed a statistically significant lower relative risk of a new flare in canakinumab-treated patients compared to triamcinolone acetonide at both 12 weeks (p=0.0116) and 24 weeks (p=0.0242) despite the small sample size (Table 30-9). Median time to first new flare was 96 days in the triamcinolone acetonide group and not estimable in the canakinumab group as &lt;50% of patients had a new flare by 24 weeks.

Patients  on  urate-lowering  drugs,  who  showed  a  27%  relative  risk  reduction  of  a  new  flare  (HR  0.73, p=0.1492) in favor of canakinumab at 12 weeks (see table above), also showed a larger (36%) relative risk reduction at 24 weeks narrowly missing statistical significance (p=0.0337), as shown in the table below. At both timepoints, the lesser benefit than seen in the overall population was due to a decrease in flare rates with triamcinolone acetonide, rather than a rise with canakinumab.

The analysis of VAS pain after the first (baseline) flare in the pooled studies H2356/E1 and H2357/E1 is summarized by the above disease-related subgroups in the table below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients on urate lowering drugs, the reduction in VAS pain after treatment for the first (baseline) flare was statistically greater for canakinumab than triamcinolone acetonide at 24, 48, 72 hours, 4, 5 and 6 days post-dose (p≤0.018), with the difference in least squares means (LSMs) in favor of canakinumab ranging from a maximum of 9.1 mm at 48 hours to 7.5 mm at 6 days post-dose. For patients not on urate lowering drugs, the reduction in VAS pain was also statistically greater for canakinumab than triamcinolone acetonide at  these  timepoints  and  also  at  7  days  post-dose  (p≤0.004),  with  the  difference  in  LSMs  in  favor  of canakinumab ranging from 12.6 mm at 72 hours to 8.4 mm at 7 days post-dose (&gt;10 mm LSM difference at 48h, 72h, 4 and 6 days post-dose).

For patients who were unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, comparison of LSMs of VAS pain after the baseline attack showed a &gt;10 mm difference in favor of canakinumab versus triamcinolone acetonide from 48 hours to 6 days post-dose with statistical significance observed from 24 hours to 7 days post-dose (p≤0.0185).

In the small subgroup of patients who were unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine and had ≥6 flares in the previous year, comparison of LSMs during the baseline attack show a &gt;10 mm VAS pain difference in favor of  canakinumab  versus  triamcinolone  acetonide  from  48  hours  to  7  days  post-dose  with  statistical significance observed from 72 hours to 6 days post-dose (p≤0.0173).

## 1.6.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Two pivotal phase III studies were performed in gouty arthritis patients investigating canakinumab for superiority over the active comparator triamcinolone (studies H2356 &amp; H2357). The dose finding study was conducted in an appropriate way and the results support the use of 150 mg canakinumab in the pivotal studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Use of systemic steroids as the active comparator in this population is generally considered acceptable. The CHMP  noted  that  the  employed  dose  of  the  comparator  triamcinolone  acetonide  (40  mg  i.m.)  -  also compared to standard therapy - is debatable and that triamcinolone acetonide is a slow release product with a delayed clinical efficacy. However, it is acknowledged that there is no sufficient evidence that another comparator would have been more appropriate and the comparator used was considered acceptable by the CHMP for this study program.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the two pivotal trials defined a patient population with a progressed disease level. Patients who had contraindication, intolerance or lack of efficacy for NSAID and/or colchicine were included. The CHMP noted that since both NSAIDs and colchicine are considered standard of care therapy  in  most  European  countries,  65%  of  the  included  patients  had  a  remaining  treatment  option. Furthermore, for the criteria of contraindications also relative contraindications were allowed.

The primary and secondary objectives are deemed adequate to assess the efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment  of  gouty  arthritis  and  the  chosen  efficacy  assessment  instruments  represent  the  currently available and validated portfolio.

Demographic and background characteristics were generally comparable between the treatment groups. The mean BMI was high as well as the mean body weight, as expected in this disease and population. The CHMP  noted  that  there  were  limited  data  in  female  patients  and  patients  &gt;75  years  considering  the prevalence of gout in the general population.

There were some imbalances in study H2356 between the treatment groups. The canakinumab group had a lower proportion of patients with a &gt; 10 year history of gout and with &gt; 6 flares but a higher proportion of polyarticular gout compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group. The MAH provided a subgroup analysis of patients with a &gt; 10 year history of gout and with &gt; 6 flares in the previous year. Results of the two co-primary endpoints were provided by the MAH and there was no statistically significant superiority of canakinumab treatment but in all evaluations a trend for a better response to canakinumab was shown. The MAH attributed this reduced rate of efficacy to the small size of the chose subpopulation (n = 55) which was supported by the CHMP.

Only 42.3% of all assessed patients in the pivotal studies received a causal therapy with urate lowering therapeutics, mostly allopurinol. In study H2357 slightly more patients in the canakinumab group were not on  urate  lowering  therapeutics  during  the  study  compared  to  the  triamcinolone  group  (71.4%  versus 64.9%) potentially favouring the efficacy in the canakinumab group.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary analysis in the overall population (full analysis set) shows that in both phase III studies the two co-primary endpoints were met with statistical significance. The first co-primary endpoint investigating pain reduction at 72 hours post-dose was met with a statistically significant superior treatment effect of ~10mm on the VAS scale for the canakinumab treatment group compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (H2356: -11.4mm, p=0.0005; H2357: -9.8mm, p=0.0018).

The second co-primary endpoint 'time to first new gout flare', presented as the probability of having a new flare, was met with a statistically significant risk reduction for time to first new gout flare (H2356: HR 0.45, p=0.0014; H2357: HR 0.32, p&lt;0.0001).

Looking at the subgroup of patients on urate lowering therapy, relatively lower efficacy was seen for pain relief  and  no  statistical  superior delay of  subsequent  flares  was  demonstrated. The deposition of urate crystals  is  the  primary  cause  of  gout;  therefore,  treatment  with  appropriate  urate  lowering  therapy  is considered the primary and causal therapy. The CHMP noted however that only 42% of study population was on urate lowering therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The four key secondary endpoints in both studies were proportion of patients taking rescue medication during the first week; Time to 50% reduction of baseline pain intensity in the most affected joint (on a 0-100mm VAS); Time to complete resolution of pain in the most affected joint (pain intensity on Likert =none); and SF-36 physical function component score at end of study. In study H2356 only two of these four secondary endpoints adjusted for multiplicity were statistically significant and in study H2357 none of these endpoints showed a statistically significant superiority of canakinumab treatment. For the other secondary endpoints, in  study  H2357  the  other  secondary  endpoints  showed  statistically  significant  superiority  of canakinumab treatment to triamcinolone acetonide except for the physician's assessment of erythema. In study H2356 patient's assessment of pain as well as patient's and physician's global assessment of response and evaluation of rescue medication intake showed benefits in favour of the treatment with canakinumab. From 12 to 24 hours onwards a small difference in better pain reduction was shown. In the canakinumab treatment group pain was reduced a bit earlier and to a slightly higher extent, but this is not leading to an obvious difference in definite pain reduction. In study H2356 median hsCRP and SAA protein levels were lower (and below ULN) in the canakinumab treatment group compared with the triamcinolone treatment group, where they were slightly above or upon the ULN-borderline. Remarkably, this effect was enduring until 84 days post-dose. However, assessment of CRP and SAA levels are possibly biased by a great amount of missing data/values, and are therefore not fully evaluable.

Based on this primary analysis for the overall population, the CHMP raised during the assessment concerns regarding the clinical benefit of canakinumab compared to triamcinolone in the initially claimed population. Taking into account that 65% of the patients could have been also treated with another standard treatment the clinical meaningfulness of the statistically significant results in the population of patients failing standard of care treatment was considered not demonstrated.

In order to address the CHMP's concerns, the MAH proposed to restrict the indication to the symptomatic treatment  of  patients  with  frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  in  whom  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective  and  which  whom  cannot  take  repeated  courses  of corticosteroids. To support the benefit/risk profile of Ilaris in the new restricted indication, the MAH provided during the evaluation a number of subgroup analyses in patients unable to use neither NSAID nor colchicine. Efficacy results in a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on ULT, failed ULT or had a contraindication to ULT (N=101) were consistent with the overall study population with a  statistically  significant  difference  compared  to  triamcinolone  acetonide  in  pain  intensity  at  72 hours (-10.2 mm, p=0.0208) and in reduction of risk of subsequent attacks (Hazard ratio 0.39, p=0.0047 at 24 weeks). Efficacy results for a more stringent subgroup limited to current users of ULT (N=62) suggested a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent attacks, although the observed treatment effect was comparable to triamcinolone acetonide and neither of the two co-primary endpoints achieved statistical significance.  In  the  pooled  data  set  the  pain  reduction  at  72  h  showed  a  mean  difference  versus triamcinolone of - 3.8 (p=0,2798) and the reduction in frequency of new flares a Hazard ration of 0.91 (p=0,4166 at 24 weeks). It needs to be noted though that these post-hoc subgroup analysis are based on a  very  low  number  of  patients  (n=101  and  n=62,  respectively).  The  CHMP,  taking  into  account  the demonstrated efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment of symptomatic pain relief in gouty arthritis as well as the unmet need in a severely ill patient population without available treatment options, considered the evidence base sufficient to conclude on a clinical meaningfulness of the use in these patients.

The MAH initially proposed a single dose of 150 mg of canakinumab with possible re-treatment after a minimum of 14 days. However the CHMP questioned the proposed re-treatment interval on the basis that it was not studied in the clinical  program supporting this extension of indication.  The  MAH consequently proposed as a new re-treatment interval a minimum of 12 weeks and supported this through adequate data, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the 24 week extension studies H2356E1 and H2357E1, in the overall population, canakinumab treatment showed a statistically significant reduced probability of re-flare. Time to re-flare could not be estimated due to the low rate of re-flares. These results are not statistically significant in the small subgroup of patients on urate lowering therapy. The presented data show that the treatment effect of canakinumab is not decreasing for a re-flare over time if the efficacy in new flare is directly compared to baseline flare. Compared to triamcinolone canakinumab showed a trend for a better efficacy in treatment of subsequent flares, but a statistically significant difference between the two treatments was not shown.

## 1.6.4. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

In the two pivotal studies H2356 and H2357, the first co-primary endpoint was met with a statistically significant pain reduction at 72 hours post-dose for the canakinumab treatment group compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group. The second co-primary endpoint 'time to first new gout flare', presented as the probability of having a new flare, was met with a significant risk reduction for time to first new gout flare. Both co-primary endpoints were met in favour of the canakinumab overall treatment group. However, since in  the  subgroup  of  patients  on  urate  lowering  therapy,  the  difference  between  the  canakinumab  and triamcinolone treatment was no longer statistically significant  for both co-primary endpoints the CHMP questioned the clinical  meaningfulness  in  a  population  that  could  have  been  also  treated  with  another standard treatment. The restriction of the indication to a last line treatment options was therefore deemed necessary.  Considering  that  canakinumab  demonstrated  its  efficacy  in  symptomatic  pain  relief  and considering that there is a very small population of severe gouty arthritis patients with a long standing disease, multiple co-morbidities and a lack of available treatment options, treatment with canakinumab is seen as an option for the symptomatic treatment of a subpopulation of adults patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are  contraindicated,  are  not  tolerated,  or  do  not  provide  an  adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.

## 1.7. Clinical safety

The safety data comes from 3 main sources, active controlled studies from patients with gouty arthritis, and placebo-controlled and uncontrolled trials from a discontinued indication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The clinical safety data (cut-off date 22-Sep-2010) presented consist of patient experience in over 3450 patients in 39 clinical studies, approximately 2500 of whom received canakinumab. In the pooled gouty arthritis dataset, 1085 patients were treated, with 691 (171.9 patient years of observation) exposed to canakinumab, mostly using on-demand dosing. In the pooled RA datasets, 478 patients were treated (465 in placebo-controlled RA dataset plus 13 from study A2206), and 441 (461.2 patient years) were exposed to canakinumab, given at fixed dosing intervals

Safety in the previously-approved orphan indication of CAPS is not presented here, as these small, mainly uncontrolled studies have been a part of a prior submission and are considered not relevant for the gouty arthritis population given the differences in disease characteristics and demographics of the two populations.

## Patient exposure

The safety population in each clinical study was defined as all randomized patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug with ≥1 post-baseline safety assessment. Studies similar in design, duration or indication were pooled to maximize the information for assessing safety.

There were 3 main pooled datasets, 1 in gouty arthritis and 2 in RA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  gouty  arthritis  safety  population  contains  4  double  or  single-blind,  active-controlled  studies.  The demographics of the dataset show the known prevalence of male, middle-aged patients.

The placebo-controlled RA dataset contains 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and the all RA dataset contains 8 controlled and uncontrolled studies. Patient demographics demonstrate the known prevalence of female, middle aged, slightly overweight patients.

Exposure in gouty arthritis is shown in the table below. The full dataset included 1085 patients, 691 on canakinumab, with most patients exposed for ≥6 weeks and many for ≥12 weeks. The greatest exposure was to ≤100 mg canakinumab (278, 66.3 patient years), 150 mg canakinumab (253, 56.9 patient years), and triamcinolone acetonide (286, 61.0 patient years).

Exposure in the placebo-controlled RA dataset comprised 465 patients, 344 on canakinumab, with most patients exposed for ≥12 weeks. The greatest exposure was to 150 mg canakinumab (69, 15.8 patient years), &gt;150 mg canakinumab (263, 96.5 patient years) and placebo (121, 40.6 patient years).

Exposure in the all RA dataset comprised 441 patients (461.2 patient years) with 255 patients exposed for &gt;48 weeks, all patients taking canakinumab.

## Adverse events

All AEs regardless of relationship to study drug were collected by the investigators and recorded on the AE CRF with their severity, suspected relationship to study drug according to the investigator, and action taken. AEs were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 13.0), which specifies the primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each event.

Standard summaries of common AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug are provided below for the 3 pooled datasets, as well as summaries of special subsets of AEs used to assess potential risks relevant to canakinumab.

The most frequently affected primary SOCs in the gouty arthritis and RA datasets were infections and infestations and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the canakinumab 150 mg group of the gouty arthritis dataset, all types of AEs affected ≤4.0% of patients; the most frequent AEs (≥3.0% of patients) were headache (4.0%, 10 patients), hypertension (4.0%, 10 patients) and back pain (3.6%, 9 patients)-Preferred terms.

## Common AEs and affected SOCs in gouty arthritis dataset

The frequencies of patients with treatment emergent AEs by primary SOC and common AEs by preferred term in the gouty arthritis dataset of active-controlled studies are shown in the two tables below.

## Common AEs and affected SOCs in placebo-controlled RA dataset

Due to the small sample size of the canakinumab &lt;150 mg group (N = 12), this treatment group does not provide  meaningful  data  in  comparison  with  the  other  groups  in  the  placebo  controlled  RA  dataset. Therefore, in the text tables summarizing the incidence of AEs for the placebo-controlled RA dataset, the canakinumab (ACZ885) &lt;150 mg group is not displayed, but it is shown in the source post-text tables.

Frequencies of patients with treatment emergent AEs by primary SOC and incidence of common AEs by preferred term with a cut-off (≥3% of patients in canakinumab 150 mg, &gt;150 mg or placebo groups) in the placebo-controlled RA dataset of double-blind, placebo controlled studies are shown in the two tables below.

## Common AEs and affected SOCs in all RA dataset

The doses of canakinumab in the ACZ885 overall group varied widely which lists the canakinumab groups in the 8 studies included in the all RA dataset.

Frequencies of patients with treatment emergent AEs by primary SOC and incidence of common AEs by preferred term with a cut-off (≥3% of patients in ACZ885 overall group) in the all RA dataset are shown by 24 or 48 week time periods in Table 2-5 and Table 2-6, respectively.

Primary SOCs in which more than 20% of patients in the ACZ885 overall group had AEs included infections and infestations  (primarily  nasopharyngitis,  URTI,  UTI  and  bronchitis),  musculoskeletal  and  connective tissue disorders (primarily (worsening of) RA, arthralgia and back pain), gastrointestinal disorders (primarily nausea  and  diarrhea),  nervous  system  disorders  (primarily  headache)  and  general  disorders  and administration site conditions (primarily fatigue, cough and peripheral edema). Vascular disorders (primarily hypertension) occurred in 10.7% of patients in the ACZ885 overall group.

## AEs suspected to be study drug-related in gouty arthritis dataset

The frequencies of patients with common AEs suspected to be related to study drug (≥1.0% of patients in any group, investigator's assessment) in the gouty arthritis dataset of active controlled studies are shown in the table below.

Overall, 10.1 to 13.1% of patients in the canakinumab groups (excluding the small ACZ885 split 150 mg group) had AEs suspected by the investigators to be study drug-related compared to 8.0% on triamcinolone acetonide and 10.2% on colchicine. Each type of these AEs occurred at a rate of &lt;2.0% of patients in each treatment group, except diarrhea in 2.8% of patients in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group.

## AEs suspected to be study drug-related in placebo-controlled RA dataset

The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug  was  comparable  between  the canakinumab &gt;150 mg (26.6%) and placebo (27.3%) groups, with a lower rate in the canakinumab 150 mg group (15.9%). In the canakinumab &lt;150 mg group, 9/12 patients were reported to have suspected study drug-related AEs.

Suspected study drug-related AEs of headache, dizziness and vertigo were slightly more common in the canakinumab &gt;150 mg group than in the canakinumab 150 mg and placebo groups.

## Severity of AEs in gouty arthritis dataset

Common AEs (≥5.0% of patients in any group, regardless  of  severity)  are  summarized  by  maximum severity in the gouty arthritis dataset of active-controlled studies in the table below.

The distribution of AEs by maximum severity was similar across the canakinumab and comparator treatment groups with the majority of patients having their most severe AE graded as mild (24.5 to 30.8% of patients, discounting the small ACZ885 split 150 mg group), or moderate (15.0 to 20.5%), and approximately 3.5% to 5.6% of patients had severe AEs. The common AEs were mainly mild or moderate in severity with only isolated cases of severe headache and upper respiratory tract infection in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group and  one  case  of  severe  hypertension  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group.  Most  types  of  severe  AEs occurred in only one patient, with the exception of severe back pain in 2 patients (1 canakinumab ≤100 mg and 1 colchicine), severe nephrolithiasis in 2 patients (1 in each of the canakinumab ≤100 mg and 150 mg groups), and severe gout in 3 patients (1 canakinumab ≤100 mg and 2 triamcinolone acetonide).

## Subgroup evaluation of AEs in gouty arthritis dataset

Adverse events were evaluated in subgroups by age, sex, race and BMI in the gouty arthritis dataset.

Within the limitations of the imbalance in sample size between males and females, there was a trend towards a higher incidence of any AE in females than males in canakinumab (except ≥200 mg) and comparator groups. Other consistent trends in the incidence of common AEs by sex or age and treatment were not apparent,  treatment  comparisons  being  limited  by  the  low  proportions  of  females  and  patients  aged ≥65-&lt;75 years or ≥75 years.

The majority of patients were Caucasian, therefore the incidence of AEs in Black, Asian, or other races was inconclusive due to the imbalance in sample size by race and treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The rates of SAEs with 150 mg canakinumab were within the range of the placebo control groups but there were slightly more infections.

In gouty arthritis none of the SAEs occurring in the pivotal trials in the target population at the intended 150 mg canakinumab dose were suspected to be related to study drug, many were associated with previously existing conditions and only 1 involved an infection (lower jaw abscess, not thought study drug related)

Infections were the predominately affected SOC in the 0-24 week period and declined in later periods.

Clinically significant AEs are those that were serious, led to discontinuations, are viewed as clinically relevant for the drug class or are considered as potential risk for the drug. AEs viewed as clinically relevant were infections and potential opportunistic infections, leukopenia, vertigo/dizziness, allergy or hypersensitivity, severe injection site reactions, malignancy (drug class effects) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (as clinical trials were conducted in older patients with frequent co-morbidities). Frequencies of some events (e.g.  AE  of  infections  and  infections  reported  as  SAEs  or  leading  to  discontinuation,  or  AEs  of vertigo/dizziness)  were  higher  with  doses  above  150  mg  canakinumab  in  both  gouty  arthritis  and  RA patients, but events with the intended 150 mg dose were few. Rates of SAEs, safety discontinuations and clinically relevant AEs in gouty arthritis are seen in the table below.

Overall,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  SAEs  was  similar  in  the  canakinumab  150  mg,  ≥200  mg  and colchicine groups at 5.1 - 5.6%, lower in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group (4.0%) and lowest in the triamcinolone acetonide group (2.4%) apart from the small canakinumab split 150 mg group in which only one patient (1.9%) had an SAE. Less than 2.0% of patients experienced an SAE in each of the primary system organ classes and treatment groups. Infections and infestations were the most frequent SAEs across the canakinumab groups affecting 0.8 - 1.9% of patients. Cardiac disorders were more frequent SAEs in the colchicine (1.9%) and canakinumab 150 mg (1.2%) groups compared with the lower dose and triamcinolone acetonide groups in which no patient had a cardiac SAE; 1 patient (0.9%) in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group had a cardiac SAE. Nervous system SAEs affected 3 patients in each of the canakinumab 150 mg (1.2%) and triamcinolone acetonide groups (1.0%) compared with 2 patients (0.7%) in the canakinumab ≤100  mg  group  and  none  in  the  other  treatment  groups.  In  each  treatment  group,  single  patients experienced each type of SAE, except for the 2 patients with appendicitis in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group.

## Potential opportunistic infections in gouty arthritis dataset

The incidence rates of potential opportunistic infections in the gouty arthritis dataset are summarized by HLGT and preferred term in the table below.

The incidence of any potential opportunistic infection was low in all the treatment groups, although slightly higher in the canakinumab groups than in the triamcinolone acetonide and colchicine groups, with the exception of the small canakinumab split 150 mg group in which there were no such infections. These infections were mostly viral infections (predominantly influenza and viral respiratory tract infections) and none were serious nor led to discontinuation of study drug. None of these individual cases of potential opportunistic infections were identified as confirmed opportunistic infections on clinical evaluation of the data available for each patient.

One patient (H2255-0123-00901, 55 year old male, Caucasian) in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group had latent tuberculosis reported on day 4. He had a positive tuberculosis skin test, his chest X-ray was normal, and he was treated with isoniazid for tuberculosis prophylaxis. Two patients, 1 (H2356-0139-00002, 60 year old male, Caucasian) in the canakinumab 150 mg group and 1 (H2357-0571-00010, 70 year old male, Black)  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group,  had  a  positive  tuberculosis  test  on  day  1  and  day  7, respectively.

Both these patients had normal chest X-rays and no treatment was given.

SAEs and discontinuations for SAE and AE reports and relevant AEs in the all RA dataset over successive, equal time periods are shown in the table below (all groups). The rates of SAEs (all) or for infections did not increase over time. Similarly, discontinuations overall, or for infections showed no evidence of increase over time. Of the especially relevant AEs, all, including infections, but excluding extended MACE, decreased over time. Thus, regular dosing with canakinumab showed no trend for a rise in serious or clinically relevant AEs over time.

Primary SOCs in which more than 1% of patients in the ACZ885 overall group had SAEs included infections and  infestations,  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  injury, poisoning and procedural complications and vascular disorders. RA (worsening of RA in 5 patients) and OA (4 patients) were the most frequent SAEs, erysipelas SAEs affected 3 patients, and 2 patients each had SAEs of  diarrhea,  radiusfracture,  depression,  anemia,  transient  ischemic  attack,  hypertension  and  lung adenocarcinoma.

Over time, the proportions of canakinumab-treated patients with any SAE varied from 6.6% in the first 24 week period to 3.1% in the last period, &gt;96 to 144 weeks. Infections tended to occur slightly more often in the first 24 weeks of treatment: 2.5% of patients compared to 0.8- 2.3% of patients in longer periods, whereas there was a small increase over time in the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders (primarily (worsening of) RA and osteoarthritis): 0.7% of patients in the first 24 week period versus 1.4-2.9% in the subsequent 3 periods (but none in the last 48 week period). Otherwise, the frequencies of SAEs over time were unremarkable given the low incidence and decreasing numbers of patients contributing to the longer time periods.

## Immunological events

Overall 8 patients out of 691 patients treated with canakinumab and for whom antibody were investigated have developed antibodies against canakinumab. No effect was observed on PK or safety and efficacy.

Treatment upon demand in the gouty arthritis population does not seem to represent an increased risk of developing antibodies with only one patient out of 99 patients retreated developing an antibody against canakinumab. Overall the incidence of antibodies against canakinumab is slightly higher than 1%. It should be noted that a new antibody assay is being developed by the MAH to further improve sensitivity.

## Malignancies

## Malignancies in gouty arthritis dataset

The incidence of malignancies in the gouty arthritis dataset is summarized by SMQ Malignant or unspecified tumors (narrow search) and preferred term.

Only 2 patients had a malignancy, 1 (0.9%) with prostate cancer in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group [H2251-0010-00002] and 1 (0.9%) with renal cancer in the colchicine group [H2251- 0520-00001]; both were reported as SAEs, and the renal cancer was suspected to be related to study drug. The causality was adjudicated as 'Not related' for the prostate cancer case and 'Possible B: Weight of the evidence suggests another cause, but the time frame is compatible with a drug relationship.' for the renal cancer case.

## Malignancies in placebo-controlled RA dataset

The SMQ narrow search for malignant or unspecified tumors in the placebo-controlled RA dataset found only one patient. Patient A2101-0001-00007 in the canakinumab &gt;150 mg group had a non-malignant skin neoplasm reported as a non-serious tumor of the left elbow of moderate severity and not suspected to be related to study drug.

## Malignancies in all RA dataset

The SMQ narrow search for malignant or unspecified tumors in the all RA dataset found a further 7 patients in addition to the one patient with a skin neoplasm in the placebo-controlled RA data set.

For 3 patients, the malignancy was reported as an SAE. For patient [A2201E1-0074-00008] who died due to progression of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (not suspected to be related to study drug, adjudicated causality:  Possible  A);  patient  [A2201E1-0002-00029]  with  non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma/squamous  cell carcinoma of the skin (suspected to be study drug-related, adjudicated causality: Possible B), and patient [A2201E1-0526-00005]  with  lung  adenocarcinoma  (suspected  to  be  study  drug-related,  adjudicated causality: Possible A).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  2  patients  who  had  basal  cell  carcinoma,  [A2201E1-0051-00005]  and  [A2201E1-0053-  00013], discontinued study drug due to these events which were reported as mild and not suspected to be related to study drug by the investigator; adjudicated causality for both cases was Possible B. These 2 cases were reported as non-serious AEs by the investigators and are recorded as non-serious in the clinical database, however they were upgraded to serious by Novartis DS&amp;E.

The  other  2  malignancy-related  events  were  reported  as  worsening  of  thyroid  nodules  (patient A2201E1-0052-00001) and monoclonal gammopathy (patient A2201E1-0054-00017), mild to moderate in severity, not serious, not suspected to be study drug-related and not adjudicated.

## Vertigo

Safety considerations that arose from prior experience with canakinumab indicate that vertigo is a potential risk for patients treated with canakinumab, therefore these events were identified by searching the pooled datasets  for  the  MedDRA  high  level  term  (HLT)  'vertigos  NEC'  and  the  preferred  terms  'vertigo'  and 'dizziness'.

## Vertigo in gouty arthritis dataset

The frequency of patients with either vertigo or dizziness AEs was similar in the canakinumab ≤100 mg (1.8%, 5 patients), split 150 mg (1.9%, 1 patient) and 150 mg (2.0%, 5 patients) groups and slightly higher in the canakinumab ≥200 mg (3.7%, 4 patients) group versus 0.7% (2 patients) for triamcinolone acetonide and 0% for colchicine. Dizziness was more frequent than vertigo. Vertigo AEs were experienced by only 2 (0.7%) patients in the ≤100 mg group, 1 (0.9%) patient in the ≥200 mg group and 1 (0.3%) patient on triamcinolone acetonide versus none in the other treatment groups.

None of the vertigo or dizziness AEs were reported as severe or serious, or led to discontinuation of study drug.

Five patients had dizziness AEs that were suspected by the investigators to be related to study drug, 1 in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group, 2 in the 150 mg group, 1 in the ≥200 mg group, and 1 in the triamcinolone acetonide group.

## Vertigo in placebo-controlled RA dataset

The frequency of patients with either vertigo or dizziness AEs was highest in the placebo group (10.7%, 13 patients) compared to 2.9% (2 patients) for canakinumab 150 mg and 7.2% (19 patients) for canakinumab &gt;150 mg, and 1 of the 12 patients in the canakinumab &lt;150 mg group had dizziness. Dizziness was more frequent than vertigo in the placebo group (8.3% vs. 2.5%, 10 vs. 3 patients), whereas the frequencies of dizziness and vertigo were similar in the canakinumab 150 mg (1.4%, 1 patient each) and &gt;150 mg (4.2%, 11 patients and 3.0%, 8 patients, respectively) groups. None of the vertigo or dizziness AEs were reported as severe or serious. One patient in the canakinumab &gt;150 mg group [A2204-0501-05629] discontinued study drug due to dizziness after suffering 3 episodes between days 1 and 21, each lasting for 2-3 days.

One patient (1.4%) in the canakinumab 150 mg group, 14 patients (5.3%) in the &gt;150 mg group and 2 placebo patients (1.7%) had dizziness or vertigo AEs that were suspected to be related to study drug by the investigators.

## Vertigo in all RA dataset

Overall, 30 patients (6.8%) treated with canakinumab in the all RA dataset experienced either dizziness or vertigo with similar frequencies, 3.2% (14 patients) with dizziness and 3.6% (16 patients) with vertigo, mostly in the first 24 weeks of treatment (dizziness: 3.2%, vertigo 2.9%). In subsequent periods of &gt;24-48 weeks and &gt;48-72 weeks of treatment, frequencies of patients with these AEs were low (0 - 0.7%, 0 - 2 patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

None of the vertigo or dizziness AEs were reported as severe or serious, and, as described above in the placebo-controlled RA dataset, only patient [A2204-0501-05629] discontinued study drug due to dizziness on day 21. For 18 of the patients with these AEs, 9 (2.0%) for dizziness and 9 (2.0%) for vertigo, the event was suspected to be related to study drug by the investigators.

## Deaths

In completed studies, there were 8 deaths.

In gouty arthritis, there were 5 deaths (3 in core studies, 2 in extensions studies), none of which was reported as study drug related.

In the placebo-controlled RA dataset there were no deaths.

In the all RA dataset, there were 3 deaths (1 after the study observation period), none of which was reported as study drug related. No deaths were the direct result of infection or newly-occurring malignancy.

In ongoing studies, there were 4 deaths (cut-off date 22-Sept-2010).

In systemic idiopathic juvenile arthritis (SJIA) there were 2 deaths, one suspected as related to study drug. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) there were 2 deaths, both not thought study drug related. There were 2 deaths from infections, neither thought study drug related, and there were no malignancies. Another 3 deaths, not in clinical studies, are also summarized.

## Laboratory findings

## Clinical chemistry

Notable changes were infrequent with 150 mg canakinumab, and if they arose, were in the range of the controls, except for small excesses in the rates of raised bilirubin, potassium or creatinine and in the rates of decreased calcium, potassium or GFR, all of which were minor.

Raised ALT or AST ≥5 x ULN was not seen with 150 mg canakinumab and there were few cases ≥3 x ULN, but some cases of raised bilirubin (one accompanying a mild rise in liver enzymes). Raised creatinine or decreased GFR was somewhat more common with 150 mg canakinumab than controls but differences were small. Raised lipids (small cholesterol rise, larger triglyceride rise), were not clinically relevant.

The frequencies of patients with newly occurring, post-baseline clinically notable values did not show a consistent  relationship  to  dose  of  canakinumab  for  any  of  the  clinical  chemistry  parameters.  These abnormalities  affected  less  than  10%  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  for  all  parameters  except creatinine clearance &lt;75-50% of LLN. Parameters for which there was a 5-10% incidence in at least one of the canakinumab groups and the triamcinolone acetonide or colchicine group included bilirubin &gt;ULN, GGT &gt;3 x ULN and GFR &lt;50% of normal. Parameters for which there was a &gt;5% incidence in at least one of the canakinumab groups and &lt;5% incidence for both active comparators included calcium &lt;LLN and sodium ≥150 mmol/L.

## Changes in Urate levels during treatment

In the overall population (in patients with values at both, baseline and end of study), the baseline urate values were above the upper limit of normal for both canakinumab 150 mg (N=253) and triamcinolone acetonide (N=286) with mean (SD) of 485 (122) μmol/L and 488 (122) μmol/L, respectively (approximately 8.2 mg/dL (1 mg/dL equals 59.48 μmol/L)). At the recommended canakinumab 150mg dose, at end of study there  was  a  mean  (SD)  increase  of  42  (123)  μmol/L  (corresponding  to  approximately  0.7  mg/dL)  as compared  to  an  increase  of  7  (110)  μmol/L  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  (corresponding  to approximately 0.1mg/dL) at the end of the study.

This effect observed over 12 weeks was not amplified and somewhat self-limited at 24 weeks with mean (SD) increase over baseline in the canakinumab group of 24(127) μmol/L and a decrease of 11(118) μmol/L in the triamcinolone group.

The MAH argues that inflammation has been considered to have a uricosuric effect. During flares urate levels decrease  and  a  negative  correlation  between  urate  and  CRP  is  observed  (Urano  et  al  2002).  As  a consequence, one hypothesis to explain the difference observed between canakinumab and triamcinolone acetonide  is  that  the  increase  in  urate  levels  observed  with  canakinumab  is  due  to  its  superior anti-inflammatory effect compared to triamcinolone acetonide. As inflammation is completely suppressed with  canakinumab,  the  uricosuric  effect  is  abated  and  therefore,  uric  acid  levels  increase.  Indeed triamcinolone acetonide also seems to have such an anti-uricosuric effect but it is not as potent as that observed with canakinumab due to the less potent anti-inflammatory effect.

The MAH further outlined that it should be noted that in patients starting urate lowering therapy, who are not treated for an acute inflammatory event and have less chronic disease with a lower inflammatory burden, canakinumab at the same total dose (150 mg) and at doses higher than the recommended one (≥ 200mg) showed a decrease in urate levels from baseline to study end comparable to that observed in the colchicine group (150 mg canakinumab split group: -105 μmol/L, canakinumab ≥ 200 mg: -135μmol/L, colchicine: -137 μmol/L, corresponding to -1.8 to -2.3 mg/dL) This supports the concept that canakinumab has no direct pharmacodynamic effect on urate levels and that urate lowering therapy can be used effectively with canakinumab.

The effect on urate level was also studied in the subpopulation on urate lowering therapy as compared to those patients not on urate lowering therapy, in the pooled analysis from the 2 pivotal studies. Baseline urate levels were lower in users of urate lowering therapy with mean (SD) levels of 453 (139) μmol/L (7.6 mg/dL) in canakinumab (N=89) and 443 (121) μmol/L (7.4 mg/dL) in the triamcinolone acetonide group (N=103). In those subjects not using urate lowering therapy the mean (SD) urate level was 509 (113) μmol/L (8.6 mg/dL) in canakinumab (N=136) and 539 (106) μmol/L (9.1 mg/dL) in the triamcinolone acetonide group (N=126).

In the patients in the canakinumab treatment group taking urate lowering therapy, urate levels gradually increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) increase of 50 (154) μmol/L, equal to approximately 0.8mg/dL). In the triamcinolone acetonide group taking urate lowering therapy, urate levels remained stable from baseline to end of study (-0.4 (108) μmol/L.

In patients not taking urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group, urate levels also increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) 27 (108) μmol/L equal to approximately 0.4 mg/dL), while in the triamcinolone acetonide group not taking urate lowering therapy, mean (SD) urate again decreased slightly from baseline to end of study (-9 (111) μmol/L) equal to approximately 0.1mg/dL).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The uricosuric effect of inflammation is indirectly confirmed by a stabilization of urate levels due to the potent anti-inflammatory effect of canakinumab during the baseline flare in patients on urate lowering therapy (mean change (SD) 6 (67) μmol/L (0.1 mg/dL) at day 4 and 1 (102) μmol/L (0.0 mg/dL) at day 8) or a slight increase in patients not on ULT (mean change (SD) 29 (57) μmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) at day 4 and 38 (80)  μmol/L  (0.6  mg/dL)  at  day  8).  On  the  contrary  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  where  the inflammation is less inhibited there is a decrease regardless of urate lowering therapy (mean change (SD) -15 (65) μmol/L (-0.3 mg/dL) at day 4 and -11 (91) μmol/L (-0.2 mg/dL) at day 8 in patients on urate lowering therapy, and -18 (70) μmol/L (-0.3 mg/dL) at day 4 and -10 (90) μmol/L (0.2 mg/dL) at day 8 in patients not on urate lowering therapy). It should be noted that all these differences until days 4 and 8 are in the range of 0.0 to 0.3 mg/dL except for the increase observed in the canakinumab group in patients not on ULT where the increase is slightly higher and approximately 0.5-0.6mg/dL.

In summary urate levels should be monitored as per current medical practice as they tend to increase during canakinumab treatment probably due to the potent anti-inflammatory effect that counteracts the natural uricosuric effect of inflammation. However, canakinumab does not affect the efficacy of urate lowering therapy as shown by the positive effect on urate levels in patients starting urate lowering therapy.

## Clinical chemistry evaluations in the placebo-controlled RA dataset:

Notable changes were infrequent with 150 mg canakinumab, and, if they arose, were below the rates with placebo, except for some cases of low albumin and elevated ALP.

Raised ALT or AST ≥3 or ≥5 x ULN did not occur with 150 mg canakinumab. Increased creatinine or decreased GFR was no more frequent with canakinumab 150 mg than placebo. Increased lipids in some groups (a small rise in cholesterol or triglycerides) could not be assessed with 150 mg canakinumab, due to missing values.

Clinical chemistry evaluations in the all RA dataset over successive, equal time periods:

Notable values were generally stable over time up to the &gt;72-96 week period. Exceptions were seen at &gt;48-72 weeks, when low albumin and liver enzymes and high or low potassium arose more often, but these were not clinically relevant.

GFR showed increasing low values over time, but the increases in frequency were small. However, creatinine did tend to rise over time and, accordingly, GFR tended to fall over time. Increased lipids (seen as a small rise in cholesterol or triglycerides over time), were not clinically relevant

## Hematology

Hematology evaluations in gouty arthritis

Mean decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were seen with 150 mg canakinumab to  a  greater  extent  than  with  the  controls.  Correspondingly,  notable  decreases  in  white  cell,  absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were more frequent in this group, as seen in the table below. Low platelet counts were very rarely below 100x109 and only one patient reported an artifactual isolated value of 10x109 (with normal values a few days before and after without any AE). AEs of leukopenia were rare with 150 mg canakinumab (3, 1.2%) and equally common with the controls. An association of lowered white cell counts with AEs of infections was not found for the 150 mg dose. There were 3 patients with thrombocytopenia AEs, 1 in each of the canakinumab split 150 mg, 150 mg and colchicine groups, and 4 patients with platelet count decreased reported as an AE, 3 in the canakinumab 150 mg group and 1 in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group, but these had no clinical consequences. Thus, these changes, which have already been observed with canakinumab across patient populations, were not associated with clinical events at the 150 mg dose.

## Neutropenia AEs in gouty arthritis dataset

The potential risk of neutropenia with canakinumab treatment was assessed by using SMQ broad searches for 'Leukopenia'.

One (0.4%) patient in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group, 3 (1.2%) patients in the canakinumab 150 mg group,  1  (0.9%)  patient  in  the  canakinumab  ≥200  mg  group,  1  (0.3%)  patient  in  the  triamcinolone acetonide  group  and  3  (2.8%)  patients  in  the  colchicine  group  experienced  at  least  one  of  the  AEs: leucopenia, neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased or WBC count abnormal. For the 5 canakinumab-treated patients, the 8 events were either mild or asymptomatic, and suspected to be related to  study  drug.  For  the  single  triamcinolone  acetonide-treated  patient,  the  2  events  were  mild  and  not suspected to be related to study drug.

For the 3 colchicine-treated patients, the 5 events were mild to moderate in severity, suspected to be related to study drug for 2 patients and not suspected for the third patient. No action was taken for any of these events. Infections in the patients with the above AEs included:

- a mild respiratory tract infection on day 131-135 in patient H2251-0075-00002 (canakinumab ≥200 mg) who had asymptomatic leucopenia starting on day 85 and continuing,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· 2 episodes of mild acute cystitis on day 14-57 and day 146-167 in patient H2251-0074- 00008 (colchicine) who had moderate leucopenia on day 85 - 113.

Only 1 of the 9 canakinumab-treated patients with serious infections had notably low WBCs (≤0.8 x LLN) or absolute neutrophils (≤0.9 x LLN). Patient [H2356-0121-00001] (canakinumab 150 mg, 52 year old male Caucasian) had jaw abscess reported as an SAE from day 29-58; absolute neutrophils on day 28 were normal (3.13 x109/L) but were notably low on day 58 (1.5 x109/L) returning to normal by day 86 (2.57 x109/L).

## Thrombocytopenia AEs in gouty arthritis dataset

There were 3 patients with thrombocytopenia AEs, 1 in each of the canakinumab split 150 mg, 150 mg and colchicine groups, and 4 patients with platelet count decreased reported as an AE, 3 in the canakinumab 150 mg group and 1 in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group. These events in the canakinumab-treated patients were suspected to be related to study drug by the investigators.

None of these AEs was reported as an SAE or led to discontinuation of study drug.

None of the patients with serious bleeding disorders had notably low platelets (&lt;LLN).

Hematology evaluations in the placebo-controlled RA dataset

Mean decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were seen with 150 mg canakinumab to  a  greater  extent  than  with  placeb.  Correspondingly,  notable  decreases  in  white  cell,  and  absolute neutrophil counts were more frequent in this group, but notable decreases in platelet counts were absent, as seen in the table below.

AEs of leukopenia were rare with 150 mg canakinumab (1, 1.4%) and not seen with placebo. A potential association of lowered white cell counts with an infection was only seen in one patient with an SAE of jaw abscess during a concurrent transient notable decrease in absolute neutrophils. An association of lowered platelet counts with AEs of bleeding was not found.

Hematology evaluations in the all RA dataset over successive, equal time periods:

The mean decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts seen with canakinumab seemed stable over time. Thus, notable decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were more frequent in this dataset as seen in the table below.

## Urinalysis

The results of the urinalysis were unremarkable.

## ECG assessments

A standard 12-lead ECG was performed at baseline and as specified in the visit schedule of each study to assess cardiovascular status and/or history at study start and study end. Canakinumab had no cardiac effects in pre-clinical studies.

In  gouty  arthritis,  there  were  few  abnormal  ECGs  and  most  relevant  findings  were  already  present  at baseline. New changes were similar across treatments.

In RA, few relevant ECG changes were detected, most findings were already present at baseline or single occurrences that were clinically insignificant.

## Vital signs and physical examinations

The results of the vital signs and physical examinations were also unremarkable.

## Safety in special populations

Special  patient  populations  were  only  examined  in  the  target  indication  of  gouty  arthritis.  AEs  were evaluated in demographic subgroups (age, sex, race, BMI), baseline comorbidity subgroups, and in the subgroup of patients for whom NSAIDs and colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective.

For demographic subgroups, there were no consistent or important differences, but women and some racial groups were under-represented. In patients with or without contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine there were no differences in the rate or distribution of AEs.

For  patients  with  baseline  co-morbidities,  there  were  greater  improvements  in  blood  pressure  (BP)  in hypertensive patients, in lipids and systolic BP in those with metabolic syndrome, in lipids in those with hypercholesterolemia, and in BP and microalbuminuria in those with kidney disease after treatment with canakinumab compared to triamcinolone acetonide.

## AEs in retreated compared to non-retreated patients

## Pooled gouty arthritis studies H2356 and H2357

In the pooled gouty arthritis studies H2356 and H2357, 32/225 (14.2%) patients received at least one additional dose of canakinumab 150 mg versus 64/229 (27.9%) triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients who received at least one additional dose when a new flare occurred. Of the 32 canakinumab retreated patients, 28 received 1 additional dose for the first new flare (after the initial flare at study entry), 3 received a second additional dose when a second new flare occurred, and 1 received a third additional dose upon third new flare. Of the 64 triamcinolone acetonide retreated patients, 53 received 1 additional dose for the first new flare, and 11 received a second additional dose when a second new flare occurred, none received a third additional dose (see table below).

## Patients with appropriate management of uricaemia

These patients, unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, who were on ULT, failed ULT or where ULT was contraindicated, included over 100 patients; this provides a reasonable assessment of efficacy and safety in this target population. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 66% of canakinumab-treated patients and 47% of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients who were unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on ULT, failed ULT or in whom ULT was contraindicated. These results were similar to the findings of the overall population treated. The observations are consistent with the known increased risk of infections for canakinumab  where  20%  (10  patients)  of  canakinumab-treated  patients  and  10%  (5  patients)  of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients reported infection AEs. The incidence of SAEs was low with 2 patients reported in each treatment group; which may be a chance finding as there was an imbalance in SAEs in the overall population. Available safety data from the larger population, suggests that the subgroup results were comparable, again suggesting that safety data can also be extrapolated to this subgroup.

## Post-hoc safety analyses in Phase III patients with very frequent flares requiring treatment with corticosteroids

In patients with very frequent flares requiring treatment with corticosteroids, another analysis compared potential differences in the safety profile for triamcinolone acetonide as observed in the 24-week controlled part of our Phase III program. The rationale is that these patients may benefit from a steroid-sparing alternative.

Safety data are presented for all triamcinolone acetonide patients, and these are further subdivided as follows to investigate a potential (cumulative) 'dose-response' for corticosteroid safety as observed based on our triamcinolone acetonide experience:

- single dose (i.e. not re-treated and only treatment for baseline flare)
- re-treated only once (i.e. total of 2 corticosteroid courses in 24 weeks)
- re-treated  ≥2  times  ('multiple  injections',  i.e.  total  of  ≥3  corticosteroid  courses  in  24  weeks [equivalent to ≥6 corticosteroid courses per year])

Acknowledging the limitations of this post-hoc analysis, there appears to be the possibility that multiple corticosteroid courses (≥3 in 6 months) may demonstrate a different (worse) safety profile emerging from triamcinolone acetonide treatment. This appears to show increased overall frequency of adverse events (71%), compared to patients with only 1 or 2 injections (50 and 49%, respectively). This could explain the seemingly benign safety profile observed for the corticosteroid control arm in our Phase III studies. This observation appears to be consistent across several system organ classes, including infections, where 21% of patients with multiple corticosteroid courses had infections, compared to only 11% of patients with only 1 or 2 corticosteroid courses (see table below).

For serious adverse events (SAEs), the assessment is more difficult, as there were only 8 triamcinolone acetonide patients with SAEs, and this generally precludes further treatment with study drug, possibly resulting in underestimation of a safety dose response upon retreatment.

Contrasting with the inferior safety data upon multiple courses of corticosteroids, long-term and particularly re-treatment canakinumab safety data now provided (including now 69 patients with multiple treatments with canakinumab, i.e. ≥3 injections in ongoing Phase III studies), do not suggest that the canakinumab safety profile would worsen after multiple treatments. This results in a beneficial shift toward canakinumab for the indirect comparison between the relative safety of canakinumab and corticosteroids.

## Updated SCE and SCS pooled analyses including 24 week gouty arthritis studies H2356E1 and H2357E1

The MAH presents pooled safety data. Double-blind, active-controlled data up to 24 weeks of observation from the 12 week core studies H2356 and H2357 and their 12 week extensions H2356E1 and H2357E1 in the planned  indication  gout.  At  least  2  injections  were  administered  to  60/253  (23.7%)  patients  in  the canakinumab 150 mg group versus 89/286 (31.1%) in the triamcinolone acetonide group, and a higher proportion of triamcinolone acetonide patients had 3 injections or more: 34/286 (11.9%) versus 13/253 (5.1%) for canakinumab 150 mg.

The highest and similar discontinuation rates were seen in the colchicine (12.0%), triamcinolone acetonide (11.5%) and canakinumab 150 mg (10.7%) groups, with slightly lower rates in the canakinumab ≤100 mg (8.3%) and ≥200 mg (7.5%) groups. A higher proportion of patients in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group discontinued for safety reasons (4.7%) compared to the other groups (0-2.8%).

In  the  canakinumab  150  mg  group,  all  types  of  AEs  affected  ≤5.1%  of  patients;  back  pain  (5.1%), hypertension (4.7%), headache (4.7%), arthralgia (4.0%), hypertriglyceridemia (3.6%) and GGT increased (3.2%) were the most frequent (&gt;3% of patients). In the comparator groups, AEs in &gt;3% of triamcinolone acetonide  patients  were  hypertension  (4.5%),  headache  (4.2%),  arthralgia  (3.8%),  pain  in  extremity (3.8%) and (worsening of) gout (3.1%); AEs in &gt;3% of colchicine patients were headache (5.6%), back pain (3.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (3.7%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of patients with any AE is highest in the ACZ885 150mg group compared to all other treatment groups with 62,5% (ACZ885 &lt;100mg:49,3%; ACZ885split 150mg:58,5%; ACZ885&gt;200mg:53,3%; Triamcinolone acetonide:50,7%; Colchicine 53,7%). As already assessed with the first set of data, infections and infestations are the major group of AEs followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, headache, and gastrointestinal disorders. These observations also hold true for AEs suspected to be study drug related and for serious AEs. There is a trend for an increased number of SAEs of cardiac disorders in the ACZ885 150mg group (1,6%) compared to triamcinolone acetonide (0,3) but not compared to colchicine (1,9%).

The overall incidence of SAEs was lower in the extension periods compared to the first 12 weeks of the study.

No further trends  for  increased  numbers  of  AEs  of  special  interest  like  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation, immunogenicity AEs, malignancies, vertigo, severe injection site reaction or neutropenia can be seen so far. However for the SMQ narrow search of 'Dyslipidaemia' data showing a highest incidence of these events in the ACZ885 150mg group was presented.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No specific drug interaction studies were performed with canakinumab.

## Use in pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancies  during  canakinumab  treatment  received  by  Novartis  DS&amp;E  up  to  the  cut-off  date  of 22-Sep-2010 and not reported in the previous CAPS submission included 5 reports:

- 3  patients  in  CAPS  study  D2306  (2  elective  terminations  for  non-medical  reasons    D23060041-00009],  [D2306-0041-00014]  and  1  spontaneous  abortion  in  the  wife  of  a  male  patient [D2306-0012-00003])
- 2 spontaneous reports of exposure to canakinumab during pregnancy, outcome unreported (Argus case numbers PHHY2009GB14156 and PHHY2010US08288)

As data on pregnancy and its outcome are very limited, patients are recommended not to become pregnant while taking canakinumab.

## Overdose

No overdose of canakinumab has been reported in any of the clinical studies performed. Doses of up to 300 mg s.c. in gouty arthritis and 600 mg i.v. q4weeks in RA were found to be well tolerated.

## Drug abuse

There is no reason to suspect any pharmacological action that could result in drug abuse and no such reports were received.

## Withdrawal and rebound

No withdrawal or rebound effects have been evident in any of the gouty arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis studies.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug in the gouty arthritis dataset are summarized in the table below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Few patients in any of the treatment groups discontinued study drug because of AEs. The highest rate occurred  in  the  high  dose  canakinumab  ≥200  mg  group,  6.5%  versus  0-1.4%  in  the  lower  dose canakinumab groups, 0.3% for triamcinolone acetonide and 2.8% for colchicine.

The single patient in the canakinumab 150 mg group who discontinued due to an intracranial hemorrhage is one of the 3 patients in the gouty arthritis dataset who died.

## Post marketing experience

Canakinumab is marketed for use in CAPS in 40 countries. AEs in these countries are collected by standard pharmacovigilance methods and spontaneous reports and published safety findings are also collected and evaluated. Integrated findings are provided in regular safety updates (PSUR) and in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The post marketing exposure in CAPS amounts to a total patient exposure of 131 patient years, as calculated from the amount of substance sold and/or distributed and the recommended dose.

The post-marketing data are consistent with the safety profile reported from clinical trials in gouty arthritis and RA, with no new risks identified in the Gouty Arthritis RMP despite differences in demographic, disease and co-morbidity characteristics.

An  overview  of  the  total  numbers  of  adverse  reaction  reports  received  between  17-Jun-2009  and 30-Jun-2010  is  given  in  Table  6-3.  Detailed  presentations  of  the  individual  case  safety  reports  and cumulative analyses are provided in the respective PSURs.

## 1.7.1. Discussion on clinical safety

In the target indication gout, with the proposed dose, 253 patients were exposed. 73.9% of these were studied for longer than 12 weeks although none longer than 24 weeks. 28 patients received two injections of canakinumab, three patients received three injections, and one patient received four injections.

In all gout dosing groups of canakinumab, 55 (8.6%) female patients were treated compared to 636 male patients. Total male patients in the canakinumab group with AEs were 319/636 (50.2%) whereas total female patients in the canakinumab group with AEs were 39/55 (71%). Due to the small number of treated female patients, the MAH was requested to justify the possibility of conclusive assessment of any gender difference regarding the adverse event profile. The MAH argued that most studied in gouty arthritis show an overall male/female ratio of approximately 3-4:1. Therefore the MAH concluded that the male/female ration in the Ilaris development program is expected from the epidemiology of the disease and is in line with other clinical programs of approved drugs in the disease area. The MAH's justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The most frequently affected primary SOCs in the gouty arthritis and RA datasets were infections and infestations and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. In the canakinumab 150 mg group of the gouty arthritis dataset, all types of AEs shown by preferred terms affected ≤4.0% of patients; the most frequent AEs (≥3.0% of patients) were headache (4.0%, 10 patients), hypertension (4.0%, 10 patients) and back pain (3.6%, 9 patients). There is a trend for higher adverse event rates in the higher canakinumab dosing  groups.  Furthermore  safety  results  showed  an  increased  incidence  of  adverse  events  for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone acetonide, with 66% versus 53% of patients reporting any adverse event and 20% versus 10% of patients reporting an infection adverse event over 24 weeks

The MAH initially applied for the use of canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients not adequately treated with standard of care and with the possibility of re-treatment after 14 days. During the assessment against this background the CHMP initially raised safety concerns regarding the higher incidence of related adverse events for the canakinumab treatment group compared to the triamcinolone treatment group, insufficient data for retreatment, the short minimum retreatment interval of 14 days and the rise of urate levels in the canakinumab treatment group. The population was therefore restricted to a group of severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment options. Safety results from the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, with current use of ULT, or previous failure to ULT, or contraindication for ULT, were compared to the overall population studied in Phase III as requested by the CHMP. In this subgroup,  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  in  66%  of  canakinumab-treated  patients  and  47%  of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients which is comparable  to the overall population treated, canakinumab 66.2% versus triamcinolone acetonide 52.8%. Furthermore, the MAH proposed to change the re-treatment interval from 14 days to a minimum of 12 weeks and provided additional data on re-treatment with canakinumab, which did not raise any concern regarding safety.

In the patients in the canakinumab treatment group taking urate lowering therapy, urate levels gradually increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) increase of 50 (154) μmol/L, equal to approximately 0.8mg/dL). In the triamcinolone acetonide group taking urate lowering therapy, urate levels remained stable from baseline to end of study (-0.4 (108) μmol/L. In patients not taking urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group, urate levels also increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) 27 (108) μmol/L equal to approximately 0.4 mg/dL), while in the triamcinolone acetonide group not taking urate lowering therapy, mean (SD) urate again decreased slightly from baseline to end of study (-9 (111) μmol/L) equal to approximately 0.1mg/dL). Blood urate levels increase under treatment of canakinumab and the increase became greater over time and appears to be even more pronounced with the numbers of flares treated (as far as it could be deduced based on low treatment numbers). This increase was even slightly higher in patients taking urate lowering therapy. The MAH submitted during the evaluation a literature review on blood urate levels and an overview of serum urate changes in the pooled studies H2356 and H2357 and their respective extension as well as data on urate level development from RA studies with canakinumab and data from patients with diabetes mellitus. There is an increase of serum uric acid in patients treated for acute gouty attacks, although the mechanism behind the influence of canakinumab on blood urate levels is not fully understood. A cumulative effect of urate level increase after multiple canakinumab treatments was not observed. Information on the occurrence of urate level increase under canakinumab treatment is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore, increased uric acid levels are indicated as an important potential risk in the RMP and the post-authorisation registry will further elucidate this potential risk through a dedicated assessment as defined in the RMP.

Decrease in platelet counts and thrombocytopenia was more common in the canakinumab treatment groups than in the control arms. The event of thrombocytopenia was included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP.

An increase in the eosinopilis count was observed in a greater degree in the canakinumab higher dose groups compared to triamcinolone or colchicine (~5.5% of treated patients) together with a decrease in neutrophil count and lymphocytopenia this could lead to an increased susceptibility for infections. The risk of infections is included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP.

The frequency of vertigo and dizziness in the canakinumab treatment groups with a dose &gt;150mg appears to be higher than in the lower dose treatment groups. Overall the incidence of dizziness and vertigo is lower than in the placebo group but higher than in the triamcinolone and colchicine comparator arms in the gouty arthritis indication. Vertigo and dizziness is included in sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC and as an important potential risk in the RMP.

In general a low rate of anti-canakinumab antibodies across all studies was found. The MAH clarified that in study H2356 and its extension phase H2356E1, post-treatment samples were collected at 4 and 12 weeks and that in all their canakinumab clinical trial protocols it is recommended to collect two additional samples for  immunogenicity  at  the  time  of  the  event  and  8  weeks  later  if  anaphylactoid  reactions  occur  after injection. An integrated immunogenicity report summarizing data on canakinumab across indications is being developed by the MAH and should be updated at least once a year. This report has been included in the RMP as a new Pharmacovigilance activity for the potential risk 'immunogenicity/allerginicity'. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

A higher incidence of any AE was seen in the retreated canakinumab patients versus the non-retreated canakinumab patients (75.0% vs. 51.8%). The retreated triamcinolone acetonide patients also had a higher incidence  of  any  AE  compared  with  the  non-retreated  triamcinolone  acetonide  patients  (51.6%  versus 41.8%), but the increase in AE incidence is much lower (23.2% versus 9.8%). The MAH argued in this case that this is due to the different baseline characteristics in the retreated canakinumab versus triamcinolone group with more severe gouty arthritis in the canakinumab group. This trend was also observed in the extension studies H2356E1 and H2251E1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety data of long term treatment in a rheumatoid condition are only available from the RA population. In this population the incidence of adverse events decreased over time except the cardiac events. The rate of infections is decreasing with 31.7% clinically relevant infections in the first 24 weeks treatment interval going down to 6.2% for patients treated longer than 96 and up to 144 weeks. Regular dosing (like in the RA groups )with canakinumab showed no clear trend for a rise in clinical chemistry values over time, but mean changes from baseline suggest a progression of declines in GFR and increases in lipids and creatinine with higher doses. However, it has to be considered that there is a difference in gender distribution between gout and  RA  (RA  patients  -more  female)  and  gouty  arthritis  patients  tend  to  have  more  comorbidity  (e.g. metabolic syndrome). Also in the overall gout population the mean age is higher than in the RA population. Therefore,  although  these  available  long-term  data  do  not  suggest  a  particular  concern  in  rheumatoid conditions and are hence re-assuring, the long-term adverse event profile in gouty arthritis needs to be further explored. A post-authorisation registry was requested that will capture long-term safety data as well as the long-term effect on kidney function as documented in the risk management plan.

## 1.7.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Clinical safety data in gouty arthritis patients is available from two phase III studies over up to 24 weeks duration. Around 250 patients were exposed to canakinumab in the recommended dose in phase II and III studies.  Neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  have  been  observed  with  a  possible  dose  relationship. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of infections. The events have been included as important identified risks in the risk management plan and are adequately reflected in the SmPC. Overall it was noted that treatment  with  canakinumab  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  adverse  events  than  treatment  with triamcinolone.

There is an increase of serum uric acid in patients treated with canakinumab for acute gouty attacks. The risk of  urate  level  increase  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  and  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  risk management plan. The SmPC also advices prescribers that management of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or optimised.

During the evaluation the intended population was therefore restricted to a group of severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment options.  This  was supported by a number of sub-group analyses  of  the  safety  in  this  restricted  population.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  proposed  to  change  the re-treatment interval from 14 days to a minimum of 12 weeks and provided additional data on re-treatment with canakinumab. Taken together, based on the available data analysis the safety profile in the last-line patient population and the re-treatment period are considered acceptable by the CHMP.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. A post-marketing registry (CACZ885H2401) is defined in the risk management plan to generate additional Pharmacovigilance data addressing the important identified risks infections, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, as well as identified potential risks and missing information (including long-terms safety data). The measures as defined in the risk management plan are deemed appropriate.

## 1.8. Risk management plan

The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a risk minimisation plan. The key principles of the existing education material have been updated to include the new gouty arthritis indication.

## 1.9. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed (new text shown as underlined, deleted text as strikethrough):

## Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications of the SmPC

## Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes

Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older with body weight of 7.5 kg or above, including:

- -Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS),
- -Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) / Chronic Infantile Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA),
- -Severe forms of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) / Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash.

## Gouty arthritis

Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adults patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1).

## Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC

## CAPS: Adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a specialist physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of CAPS.

## Gouty arthritis

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of gouty arthritis and in the use of biologics. Ilaris should be administered by a healthcare professional.

Management of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or optimised. Ilaris should be used as an on-demand therapy to treat gouty arthritis attacks.

The recommended dose of Ilaris for adult patients with gouty arthritis is 150 mg administered subcutaneously as a single dose during an attack. For maximum effect, Ilaris should be administered as soon as possible after the onset of a gouty arthritis attack.

Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should not be re-treated with Ilaris. In patients who respond and require re-treatment, there should be an interval of at least 12 weeks before a new dose of Ilaris may be administered (see section 5.2).

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

Ilaris is not recommended for use in children with CAPS below 2 years of age due to a lack of clinical data.

There is no relevant use of Ilaris for gouty arthritis in the paediatric population.

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required. Clinical experience in patients above 65 years is limited, therefore caution is recommended.

## Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC

## Infections

Ilaris is associated with an increased incidence of serious infections. Therefore patients should be monitored carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after treatment with Ilaris. Physicians should exercise caution when administering Ilaris to patients with infections, a history of recurring infections, or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. Treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated or continued in patients with severe infections requiring medicinal interventions.

## Treatment of CAPS

Ilaris should not be initiated or continued in patients during an active infection requiring medical intervention.

## Treatment of gouty arthritis

Ilaris should not be administered during an active infection.

Concomitant use of Ilaris with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections (see section 4.5).

Isolated cases of unusual or opportunistic infections have been reported during Ilaris treatment. However, the causal relationship of Ilaris to these events is unknown.

Concomitant use of Ilaris with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections (see section 4.5).

## Neutropenia

Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1.5 x 10 9 /l) has been observed with medicinal products that inhibit IL-1, including Ilaris. Treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia. It is recommended that neutrophil counts be assessed prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to 2 months,. For chronic therapy in CAPS patients or repeated therapy in gouty arthritis patients, it is also recommended to assess neutrophil counts and periodically during treatment thereafter while receiving Ilaris. If a patient becomes neutropenic the ANC should be monitored closely and treatment discontinuation should be considered.

## Mutation in NLRP3 gene in CAPS patients

Clinical experience in CAPS patients without a confirmed mutation in the NLRP3 gene is limited.

## Section 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines of the SmPC

The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some symptoms associated with CAPS. Patients who experience dizziness/vertigo during Ilaris treatment should wait for this to resolve completely before driving or operating machines.

## Section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the SmPC

Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## CAPS

A total of 194 adult and paediatric CAPS patients (including FCAS/FCU, MWS, and NOMID/CINCA) have received Ilaris in clinical trials. The safety of Ilaris compared with placebo was investigated in a pivotal phase III trial that consisted of an 8-week, open-label period (Part I), a 24-week, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled withdrawal period (Part II), and a 16-week open label period on Ilaris (Part III). All patients were treated with Ilaris 150 mg subcutaneous or 2 mg/kg if body weight was ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg.

Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During clinical trials with Ilaris in CAPS patients mean values for haemoglobin increased and those for white blood cell, neutrophils and platelets decreased.

## Gouty arthritis

More than 700 patients with gouty arthritis have been treated with Ilaris at doses from 10 mg to 300 mg in randomised, double-blind and active-controlled clinical trials of up to 24 weeks' duration. More than 250 patients have been treated with the recommended dose of 150 mg in Phase II and III trials (see section5.1).

## Table 2 Tabulated summary of adverse drug reactions in gouty arthritis studies

## Infections and infestations

Very common

Infections (e.g. nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, (viral) upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, ear infection, cellulitis, gastroenteritis, influenza, pharyngitis, pneumonia)

## Nervous system disorders

Common

Dizziness/vertigo

## Gastrointestinal disorders

Uncommon

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease

## Musculoskeletal disorders

Common

Back pain

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Common

Fatigue/asthenia

## Injection site reactions

Injection site reactions were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with Ilaris in clinical studies.

## Laboratory abnormalities in gouty arthritis patients

## Haematology

Decreased white blood cell counts (WBC) ≤ 0.8 x lower limit of normal (LLN) were reported in 6.7% of patients treated with Ilaris compared to 1.4% treated with triamcinolone acetonide. Decreases in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) to less than 1x10 9 /l were reported in 2% of patients in the comparative trials. Isolated cases of ANC counts &lt; 0.5x10 9 /l were also observed (see section 4.4).

Mild (&lt; LLN and &gt; 75x10 9 /l) and transient decreases in platelet counts were observed at a higher incidence (12.7%) with Ilaris in the active-controlled clinical studies versus the comparator (7.7%) in gouty arthritis patients.

## Uric acid

Increases in uric acid level (0.7 mg/dl at 12 weeks and 0.5 mg/dl at 24 weeks) were observed after Ilaris treatment in comparative trials in gouty arthritis. In another study, among patients who were starting on ULT, increases in uric acid were not observed. Uric acid increases were not observed in clinical trials in non-gouty arthritis populations (see section 5.1).

## ALT/AST

Mean and median increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) of 3.0 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, and in aspartate transaminase (AST) of 2.7 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, from baseline to end of study were seen in the Ilaris-treated groups versus the triamcinolone acetonide-treated group(s), however the incidence of clinically significant changes (≥ 3x the upper limit of normal) was greater for patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide (2.5% for both AST and ALT) compared with Ilaris-treated patients (1.6% for ALT and 0.8% for AST).

## Triglycerides

In active-controlled gouty arthritis trials, there was a mean increase in triglycerides of 33.5 mg/dl in Ilaris-treated patients compared with a modest decrease of -3.1 mg/dl with triamcinolone acetonide. The incidence of patients with triglyceride elevations &gt; 5x upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2.4% with Ilaris and 0.7% with triamcinolone acetonide. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.

[…]

## Elderly population

There is no significant difference in safety profile observed in patients ≥ 65 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## CAPS

In clinical studies, CAPS patients who have uncontrolled over-production of IL-1 beta show a rapid response to therapy with canakinumab, i.e. laboratory parameters such as high C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), high neutrophil and platelet counts, and leukocytosis rapidly returned to normal.

## Gouty arthritis

A gouty arthritis attack is caused by urate (monosodium urate monohydrate) crystals in the joint and surrounding tissue, which trigger resident macrophages to produce IL-1 beta via the 'NALP3 inflammasome' complex. Activation of macrophages and concomitant over-production of IL-1 beta results in an acute painful inflammatory response. Other activators of the innate immune system, such as endogenous agonists of toll-like receptors, may contribute to the transcriptional activation of the IL-1 beta gene, initiating a gouty arthritis attack. Following canakinumab treatment, the inflammatory markers CRP or SAA and signs of acute inflammation (e.g. pain, swelling, redness) in the affected joint subside rapidly.

## Clinical efficacy and safety data

<!-- image -->

## Gouty arthritis

The efficacy of Ilaris for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis attacks was demonstrated in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with frequent gouty arthritis (≥ 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) unable to use NSAIDs or colchicine (due to contraindication, intolerance or lack of efficacy). The studies were 12 weeks followed by 12-week double-blind extension. A total of 225 patients were treated with subcutaneous Ilaris 150 mg and 229 patients were treated with intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide (TA) 40 mg at study entry, and when experiencing a new attack thereafter. The mean number of gouty arthritis attacks in the previous 12 months was 6.5. Over 85% of patients had comorbidity, including hypertension (60%), diabetes (15%), ischaemic heart disease (12%), and stage ≥ 3 chronic kidney disease (25%). Approximately one-third of the patients enrolled (76 [33.8%] in the Ilaris group and 84 [36.7%] in the triamcinolone acetonide group) had documented inability (intolerance, contraindication or lack of response) to use both NSAIDs and colchicine. Concomitant treatment with ULTs was reported by 42% of patients at entry.

The co-primary endpoints were: (i) gouty arthritis pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) at 72 hours post-dose, and (ii) time to first new gouty arthritis attack.

For the overall study population, pain intensity was statistically significantly lower for Ilaris 150 mg compared with triamcinolone acetonide at 72 hours. Ilaris also reduced the risk of subsequent attacks (see Table 4).

Efficacy results in a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on ULT, failed ULT or had a contraindication to ULT (N=101) were consistent with the overall study population with a statistically significant difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide in pain intensity at 72 hours (-10.2 mm, p=0.0208) and in reduction of risk of subsequent attacks (Hazard ratio 0.39, p=0.0047 at 24 weeks).

Efficacy results for a more stringent subgroup limited to current users of ULT (N=62) are presented in Table 4. Treatment with Ilaris induced a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent attacks in patients using ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine, although the observed treatment difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide was less pronounced than with the overall study population.

Safety results showed an increased incidence of adverse events for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone acetonide, with 66% vs 53% of patients reporting any adverse event and 20% vs 10% of patients reporting an infection adverse event over 24 weeks.

## Elderly population

Overall, the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of Ilaris in elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age was comparable to patients &lt; 65 years of age.

## Patients on urate lowering therapy (ULT)

In clinical studies, Ilaris has been safely administered with ULT. In the overall study population, patients on ULT had a less pronounced treatment difference in both pain reduction and reduction in the risk of subsequent gouty arthritis attacks compared to patients not on ULT.

## Immunogenicity

No anaphylactic reactions were observed in patients treated with Ilaris.

Antibodies against Ilaris were observed in approximately 1.5% and 2% of the patients treated with Ilaris for CAPS and gouty arthritis, respectively.

This medicinal product has been authorised for CAPS under 'Exceptional Circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ilaris in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ilaris in all subsets of the paediatric population in gouty arthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the SmPC

## CAPS

The peak serum canakinumab concentration (Cmax) occurred approximately 7 days following single subcutaneous administration of 150 mg in adult CAPS patients. The mean terminal half-life was 26 days. . Mean values for Cmax und AUCinf after a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg in a typical adult CAPS patient (70 kg) were 15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in the CAPS population, including children from 2 years of age, t The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered canakinumab was estimated to be 66%. The apparent clearance (CL/F) and distribution volume (Vss) of canakinumab increases with varied accordingly body weight. CL and distribution volume (Vss) were estimated to be 0.17 l/day and 6.2 litres, respectively, in a typical CAPS patient of body weight 70 kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The expected accumulation ratio was 1.3-fold and 1.1-fold following 6 months of subcutaneous administration of 150 mg canakinumab every 8 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively (see section 4.2). Exposure parameters (such as AUC and Cmax) increased in proportion to dose over the dose range of 0.30 to 10.0 mg/kg given as intravenous infusion or from 150 to 600 mg as subcutaneous injection. Predicted steady-state exposure values were slightly higher in the weight category 40-70 kg compared to the weight categories &lt; 40 kg and &gt; 70 kg.

## Gouty arthritis population

Bioavailability in gouty arthritis patients has not been determined independently. Apparent clearance per kg body weight (CL/F per kg) was comparable between the gouty arthritis and CAPS population (0.004 l/d/kg). Mean exposure in a typical gouty arthritis patient (93 kg) after a single subcutaneous 150 mg dose (Cmax: 10.8 µg/ml and AUCinf: 495 µg*d/ml) was lower than in a typical 70 kg CAPS patient (15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml). This is consistent with the observed increase in CL/F with body weight.

## Elderly population

No change in pharmacokinetic parameters based on clearance or volume of distribution were observed between elderly patients and adult patients &lt; 65 years of age.

## Section D. Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product of Annex II

## · Additional risk minimisation measures

The physician information should contain the following key messages:

- The risk of serious infections, including opportunistic bacterial, viral and fungal infections in patients treated with Ilaris;
- The risk of acute injection-related reactions;
- For CAPS patients: tThe need to instruct patients on proper techniques for self-administration when the patient is willing and capable to do so, and guidance for Health Care Professionals on how to report administration errors;
- The identified or potential risk of immunogenicity that might lead to immune-mediated symptoms. For gouty arthritis patients: highlighting that intermittent therapy or re-exposure after a long treatment-free interval may be associated with an enhanced immune response (or loss of immune tolerance) to Ilaris and thus re-treated patients must be considered at risk of hypersensitivity reactions;
- For chronic therapy in CAPS: the need for Health Care Professionals to perform an annual clinical assessment of patients regarding a potential increased risk for the development of malignancies;
- As treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia, tThe need to measure neutrophil counts prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to 2 months. For chronic therapy in CAPS patients or repeated therapy in gouty arthritis patients, it is recommended to assess neutrophil counts and periodically during treatment thereafter while receiving Ilaris as treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia;

## Section 1. What Ilaris is used for of the PL

## What Ilaris is

Ilaris is intended for treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and gouty arthritis. It belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin inhibitors. The active substance in Ilaris is canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody. It blocks the activity of a substance called interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the body, which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such as CAPS and gouty arthritis.

## What Ilaris is used for

## Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes

Ilaris is used in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older with body weight of 7.5 kg or above to treat the following auto-inflammatory diseases, which are collectively known as Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS):

- -Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS),
- -Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), also called Chronic Infantile Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA),
- -Severe forms of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) / Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with CAPS, the body produces excessive amounts of IL-1 beta. This may lead to symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, canakinumab leads to an improvement in these symptoms.

## Gouty arthritis

Ilaris is used in adults to treat the symptoms of frequent gouty arthritis attacks if other treatments have not worked well enough.

Gouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of a chemical called urate crystals in the body. These crystals cause excessive production of IL-1 beta, which in turn can lead to sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gouty arthritis attack). By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, canakinumab leads to an improvement in these symptoms.

## Section 2. What you need to know before you take Ilaris of the PL

## Warning and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using Ilaris if any of the following applies to you:

- -if you currently have an infection or if you have had repeated infections or a condition such as a known low level of white blood cells which makes you more likely to get infections.
- -if you have or have ever had tuberculosis or direct contact with a person with an active tuberculosis infection. Your doctor may also check whether you have tuberculosis using a specific test.

## Children and adolescents

- -CAPS: Ilaris is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age.
- -Gouty arthritis: Ilaris is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years of age.

## Driving and using machines

Ilaris treatment may give you Some symptoms associated with CAPS or with Ilaris treatment, such as a spinning sensation (dizziness/known as vertigo),. This may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel a spinning sensation, do not drive or operate use any tools or machines until you are feeling normal again.

## Section 3. How to use Ilaris of the PL

If you have CAPS, yYou may inject yourself with Ilaris after proper training.

If you have gouty arthritis, your treatment will be overseen by a doctor with specialist training. Ilaris should be injected by a healthcare professional only.

## How much Ilaris to use

## Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes

The recommended starting dose of Ilaris is:

## Gouty arthritis

Your doctor will discuss with you the need to start or adjust a urate lowering therapy to lower the uric acid level in your blood.

The recommended dose of Ilaris for adult gouty arthritis patients is 150 mg given as a single dose at the time of a gouty arthritis attack.

If you need another treatment with Ilaris, and got relief from the last dose, you must wait at least 12 weeks before the next dose.

## Injecting Ilaris yourself

If you have CAPS, you may inject yourself with Ilaris aAfter proper training in the correct injection technique, you may inject Ilaris yourself.

## How long to use Ilaris

- -If you have CAPS, yYou should continue using Ilaris for as long as your doctor tells you.
- -If you have a gouty arthritis attack, you will be given a single dose of Ilaris. If you experience a new attack, your doctor may consider giving you a new dose of Ilaris but not earlier than 12 weeks from the previous dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you use more Ilaris than you should

- -If you accidentally inject more Ilaris than the recommended dose, it is unlikely to be serious, but you should inform your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.
- -In CAPS, yYou should not inject Ilaris earlier than 8 weeks after the last dose, unless your doctor tells you to. If you accidentally inject Ilaris sooner than you should, you should tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.

## If you forget to use Ilaris

If you have CAPS and have forgotten to inject a dose of Ilaris, inject the next dose as soon as you remember. Then talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. You should then continue with injections at 8-week intervals as before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Canakinumab  was  tested  in  two  pivotal  phase  III  trials  for  superiority  against  the  active  comparator triamcinolone. Benefit was demonstrated through a reduction of pain intensity as well as reduction of time to new flare. In the overall study population, a statistically significant superior pain relief of canakinumab compared to triamcinolone was observed: the VAS pain reduction at 72 hours mean difference versus the active  comparator  triamcinolone  was  -  10.7  (p=0.0001).  Also  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in frequency of new flares for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone was observed (HR 0.38, p=0.0001).

In sub-groups representing patients with limited treatment options compared to this overall population a less pronounced benefit was demonstrated. In patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, and who were on ULT, or failed ULT or were contraindicated to ULT (n=101), the VAS pain reduction at 72 hours mean difference versus triamcinolone was - 10.2 (p=0.0208) and the reduction in frequency of new flares was statistically superior (HR 0.39, p=0.0151 at 24 weeks). Looking only at current users of urate lowering therapy  of  this  group  (n=62),  the  treatment  effect  of  canakinumab  was  comparable  to  the  effect  of triamcinolone but was not statistically superior neither for the first co-primary endpoint VAS pain reduction at  72  hours  (mean  difference  versus  triamcinolone:  -  3.8,  p=0,2798),  nor  for  the  second  co-primary endpoint 'reduction in frequency of new flares for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone' (HR 0.91, p=04166 (at 24 weeks)).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The demonstration of efficacy in the restricted population of severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment options is limited to a subgroup analyses of only 101 patients (unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine; ULT (current use, failure, or contraindication)). Also the subpopulation 'for whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate' was not specifically defined in the inclusion criteria. However, it is accepted that the efficacy demonstration generated in the overall population is sufficiently robust to be extrapolated to the patient population with no remaining treatment options.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In the canakinumab 150 mg group of the gouty arthritis dataset, most frequent AEs (≥3.0% of patients) were headache (4.0%, 10 patients), hypertension (4.0%, 10 patients) and back pain (3.6%, 9 patients). There is a trend for higher adverse event rates in the higher canakinumab dosing groups. Furthermore safety results showed an increased incidence of adverse events for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone acetonide, with 66% versus 53% of patients reporting any adverse event (infections, vertigo, dizziness, gastro-intestinal AEs, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) and 20% versus 10% of patients reporting an infection adverse event over 24 weeks. This was also demonstrated for the subgroup unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, ULT (use/failure/CI) and for the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, and current users of ULT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is an increase of serum uric acid in patients treated with canakinumab for acute gouty attacks. The risk of  urate  level  increase  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  and  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  risk management plan with a post-marketing registry adequately addressing the need for additional data. The SmPC also advices prescribers that management of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or optimised.

Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been observed with a possible dose relationship. These events are identified in the risk management plan as identified risks together with the risk for infections - and additional safety data will be generated in a post-marketing registry (CACZ885H2401).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavorable effects

During the evaluation the intended population was restricted to a group of severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment options. This was supported by a number of sub-group analyses in this restricted population. Furthermore, the MAH proposed to change the re-treatment interval from 14 days to a minimum of 12 weeks and provided additional data on re-treatment with canakinumab. Taken together, based  on  the  available  data  analysis  the  safety  profile  in  the  last-line  patient  population  and  the re-treatment period are considered acceptable by the CHMP.

There is limited long term safety data for the use of canakinumab in in rheumatoid conditions available. The post-marketing registry (CACZ885H2401) as defined in the risk management plan will generate additional Pharmacovigilance data.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Canakinumab is a symptomatic treatment of gouty arthritis flares with the aim of reducing pain and local inflammation. The underlying pathophysiology of increased blood urate levels and aggregation of urate crystals in the joints is not a target of treatment. A favourable effect was demonstrated through a reduction of pain intensity as well as reduction of time to new flare in the overall population where superiority over the active comparator was shown. The effect in the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine was less pronounced.

The safety profile for the treatment of gouty arthritis with canakinumab includes the risks of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, as well as infections. Furthermore, an increase of serum uric acid was observed. Given that the safety profile appeared inferior to the active comparator triamcinolone, this seems not acceptable in a population that can be treated with available standard of care as well as glucocorticoids. However, in patients in whom such treatment options do no longer exist and who suffer from severe gouty arthritis with frequent attacks, the safety profile is considered acceptable if appropriate guidance for its management is provided to prescribers and patients.

## Benefit-risk balance

Acknowledging that canakinumab demonstrated its efficacy in symptomatic pain relief and considering in the overall gouty arthritis population, where however other treatment options with a better safety profile exist, there  is  a  sub-population  of  severely  ill  gouty  arthritis  patients  with  a  long  standing  disease,  multiple co-morbidities and a lack of available treatment options, in whom treatment with canakinumab can be a clinically meaningful treatment option. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance in the last line treatment of gouty arthritis patients defined as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1).'

is positive.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

Gout is a disease with increasing incidence in the industrial world population with increasing numbers of patients having severe forms, recurrent flares and arthritic joint deformities. There is an unmet medical need for an improvement of causal as well as symptomatic therapy for patients who have exhausted the treatment options under standard of care considering that long term treatment with corticosteroids has a problematic long term safety profile.

Symptomatic  treatment  with  canakinumab  is  efficacious  in  pain  relief  and  statistically  superior  to triamcinolone acetonide in the overall patient population. However, only 42% of study population was on urate lowering therapy and for this subgroup relatively lower efficacy was suggested, and around 65% of the studies patients could have been able to benefit from available treatment options. Furthermore, a higher incidence of related adverse events under canakinumab compared to triamcinolone treatment was noted. Therefore, during the evaluation the indication was restricted to the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks in whom NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated., or  do  not  provide  an  adequate  response,  and  in  whom  repeated  courses  of  corticosteroids  are  not appropriate. A number of subgroup analyses to support the efficacy and safety profile of canakinumab in this restricted indication were provided.

The CHMP concludes that canakinumab in severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment  options,  i.e.  contraindication  for  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  and  for  whom  repeated  courses  of corticosteroids are not appropriate, offers a new treatment option addressing an unmet need. An adequate risk management program, including a post-marketing registry, has been defined to manage and further explore the safety profile of canakinumab in this population.

## 3. Recommendations

| Clinical SO 1 | The MAH is requested to provide reports on the ß-Confident registry (CACZ885D2401), which was designed to provide data on long-term safety and effectiveness of Ilaris treatment in paediatric and adult patients in routine clinical practice. In these reports the MAH is requested to specifically assess cases for whom there is a loss of efficacy (patients reported to have discontinued Ilaris for lack-of-therapeutic response) to determine whether this is due to changes over time in PK/PD or antibody development (where data is available) or in whom a dose adjustment has led to improved therapeutic response (patients with a dose up titration without discontinuation for lack-of-therapeutic response). The MAH is required to provide updates on the recruitment rates and any intermediary results annually within the annual re-assessment. The patients should be included in the Registry until both following conditions are met: 5 years recruitment period and 200 patients included. | Annually within the annual re-assessment |

## Additional data exclusivity /market protection

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

## Introduction

Canakinumab  (ACZ885)  is  a  high-affinity  human  monoclonal  antibody  against  interleukin-1β  (IL-1β) developed to bind and neutralize the excess IL-1β produced in some inflammatory diseases. It belongs to the class of drugs known as immune modulators. IL-1β is released by mononuclear phagocytes upon injury or infection and plays a dominant role in the pathobiology of autoinflammatory conditions.

Canakinumab, registered under the tradename Ilaris, has been granted a marketing authorisation in the EEA for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) in adults, adolescents and children aged  4  years  and  older  with  body  weight  above  15  kg,  including  Muckle-Wells  Syndrome  (MWS), Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID),  and  severe  forms of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond coldinduced urticarial skin rash. The dose is 150 mg for CAPS patients with body weight &gt; 40 kg and 2 mg/kg for CAPS patients with body weight ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg. Ilaris is administered every eight weeks as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.

The  present  type  II  variation  concerns  the  application  for  a  new  indication  to  cover  the  symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks in a clinically relevant subgroup who are not successfully treated with current standard of care. The proposed population are gouty arthritis suffers with frequent flares (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.

With the submission of this application for a new indication in gouty arthritis, the MAH requested for an additional year of marketing protection in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Furthermore, reference is made to the European Commission 'Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period' dating November 2007.

## Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by the applicant

The  applicant  provided  with  the  request  a  justification  for  the  significant  clinical  benefit  of  the  new therapeutic  indication  compared  to  existing  therapies.  The  key  elements  of  this  justification  can  be summarised as follows.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Proposed new indication as compared to already authorised indication

The  currently  authorised  condition  Cryopyrin-Associated  Periodic  Syndrome  (CAPS)  is  a  spectrum  of disorders  associated  with  mutations  in  the  NLRP3/CIAS1  gene  on  chromosome  1q44  that  encodes  the protein known as NLRP3 (formerly NALP3) or cryopyrin. The individual disorders are known as Familial Cold Autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), also known as Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), also known as Chronic, Infantile, Neurologic, Cutaneous, Articular (CINCA) syndrome. These conditions may occur singly or as overlapping syndromes (i.e. MWS/FCAS or MWS/NOMID). The world-wide incidence is unknown but only a few hundred cases are currently diagnosed. In clinical studies, treatment with Ilaris had a rapid onset of action, with disappearance or clinically significant improvement of symptoms within one day after dosing. Laboratory parameters such as high C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), high neutrophils and platelet counts normalised rapidly within days of Ilaris injection.

The new therapeutic indication concerns the symptomatic treatment of gouty arthritis. Gout is an arthritic condition characterized by the deposition of urate crystals primarily in joints. Urate crystals may then trigger an acute inflammatory response in the affected joint which is characterized by extreme pain and edema. The cellular pathophysiological mechanism of joint inflammation in gout has been connected to the hyperproduction of IL-1β by selective activation of the NRLP3 inflammasome by urate crystals (Di Giovine et al 1987; Martinon et al 2008). Preclinical experiments in vivo or ex vivo revealed a sequence of cellular events which establish a role of IL-1 in inflammation induced by urate crystals. Final proof of this hypothesis for the pathophysiology of gout came from the clinical application of recombinant IL-1ra, anakinra, in gout patients which led to a rapid relief of symptoms (So et al 2007). Canakinumab interrupts the signaling pathway of crystal-induced inflammation in gouty arthritis by blocking IL-1β, and thus is a therapy to treat and prevent flares in gouty arthritis refractory to, or unable to take, standard of care medications.

Gouty arthritis is becoming more frequent worldwide, mostly as a result of dietary factors and population aging. Although uric acid lowering therapy is standard of care and known to lower serum uric acid levels, of the approximately 11 million gouty arthritis sufferers in the US and EU, approximately 3 million (10-20%) are not adequately managed (Fels and Sundy 2008), as prophylaxis has failed, flares continue, and the patients have become  refractory to, or cannot tolerate standard-of-care.

Refractory, or difficult-to-treat, gouty arthritis is increasing (Terkeltaub et al 2003). Patients have recurrent flares, often lasting up to 2 weeks, take longer to resolve (Masseoud et al 2005), and generally have chronic arthritis with destructive tophi. Other medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, renal impairment or coronary artery diseases (Terkeltaub et al 2003) limit the use of many traditional therapies.

Gouty arthritis that is insufficiently treated tends to worsen over time. Attacks become more frequent, more severe, involve more joints, and lead to chronic active gouty arthritis, with tophi, chronic granulomatous synovitis and bone erosion (Dalbeth et al 2009). Urate lowering therapy, even when started relatively early, does not always prevent progression to chronic gouty arthritis (Sundy et al. 2008).

Chronic, poorly controlled gouty arthritis predicts deteriorating joint function and chronic tophaceous gouty arthritis severely impairs functional capacity (Becker et al 2009, Dalbeth et al 2007). As patients with gouty arthritis are increasingly of working age, there is a substantial burden of work-related and health-related costs (Brook et al 2006, Kleinman el al 2007), and a diminished quality of life (Dalbeth et al 2007) associated with progressive, severe chronic gouty arthritis.

## Existing therapies

Existing therapies were summarised by the applicant as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Urate lowering therapy is the standard of care for the treatment of chronic gout as this therapy has been shown  to  lower  serum  urate  and  therefore  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  gout  attacks.  However,  urate lowering-therapy often fails to lower uric acid to the target levels at which flares are less common (&lt;6 mg/dL).  E.g. in patients treated with allopurinol only about half of the treatment-compliant patients reach target levels (Halpern et al 2009). In addition, poor renal function, poor tolerability or hypersensitivity often prevents more rigorous use of urate lowering therapy gout prophylaxis. Hence, urate lowering therapy, even though it is a mainstay of gout therapy, is not able to eliminate the occurrence of acute gouty arthritis attacks in some patients which take it, and obviously not in those patients which don't take urate lowering therapies for the reasons mentioned above.

Full-dose NSAIDs, such as diclofenac or indomethacin, are widely viewed as first-line therapy for acute gouty arthritis attacks. However, their wide-spread utility is limited in some patients by gastrointestinal or CNS tolerability. Furthermore, these medications may impair renal function and are contraindicated in cases of prior  peptic  ulcer  disease,  bleeding  or  perforation,  heart  failure,  or  in  those  using  platelet  aggregation inhibitors.

Colchicine is effective for the treatment of gout attacks but has a narrow therapeutic margin, which limits its use for treating acute attacks. Orally, gastrointestinal tolerability is poor, often causing diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and cramps. Colchicine use has also resulted in renal or hepatic impairment, myelosuppression, neuropathy and myopathy and mortablity has been reported with the i.v. formulation. Due to the mortality rate when given i.v., this route is no longer used. In addition, there are a number of potential drug-drug interactions with colchicine which limits its use (e.g. erythromycin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, verapamil, diltiazem and various HIV protease inhibitors).

Corticosteroid therapy for acute gouty arthritis attacks is equally effective as treatment with NSAIDs but requires relatively high doses to treat acute flares (Janssens 2008). However, repeated use presents risks in patients with multiple flares each year, as it has the potential for pituitary axis suppression, osteoporosis, increased  infections,  hypertension  and  glucose  intolerance  is  present,  and  co-morbidities  typical  for middleaged patients such as heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes may be worsened. Local injection of steroids minimizing system side-effects is not feasible in refractory patients which flare in many joints. Hence,  frequently  flaring  gouty  arthritis  patients  which  are  dependent  on  disease  management  with corticosteroids are especially vulnerable to suffer from typical corticosteroid side-effects and efforts should be  made  to  limit  their  exposure  to  the  required  minimum.  As  such,  corticosteroid  therapy  of  acutely symptomatic gout is considered last resort in patients who are frequently flaring, who present with some of the above mentioned comorbidities, and who do not respond to NSAIDs or colchicine. For lack of a different choice the benefit harm balance of corticosteroid therapy in these patients currently has to be accepted unless a different treatment option becomes available which would enable to weigh the corticosteroid vs the alternatives' benefit harm balances in the context of the individual refractory patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Significant clinical benefit

According to the applicant, the significant clinical benefit of Ilaris in comparison to existing therapies is based on its mechanism of action which makes it a targeted treatment, on its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties and on the efficacy and safety data in the target indication and population i.e. patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate. The data are coming mainly from two Phase III trials (H2356 &amp; H2357) and their blinded extension  studies,  which  demonstrated  superiority  of  canakinumab  150  mg  s.c.  versus  triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. on pain relief in patients with frequent flares of gout and for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine are contraindicated (absolute or relative), not tolerated or ineffective. Canakinumab 150 mg s.c. or triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m was given upon acute gout flares (at entry and upon any new flare).

## Efficacy and safety data

The  2  pivotal  trials  (core  studies)  had  a  12  week,  randomized,  double  blind,  double  dummy,  active controlled, superiority study design. As placebo-controlled trials raise ethical concerns, an active control, 40 mg i.m.  triamcinolone  acetonide,  was  used.  Although  not  widely  studied,  corticosteroids  have  proven efficacy in acute gouty arthritis, and the i.m. route ensures full compliance and avoids complex dosing and tapering regimens . No corticosteroid regimen is proven to be more effective than any other and higher triamcinolone acetonide doses are not known to be more effective.

The efficacy criteria were superiority in 2 co-primary variables (pain intensity at 72 hours and time to first new gouty arthritis flare), both to be met at the one-sided 2.5% level. Both studies have double blind active controlled extensions to 24 weeks in which patients are treated upon flare with the same treatment they were allocated during the 12 week core study.

## Efficacy

As a targeted therapy, canakinumab directly neutralizes one of the key inflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of gouty arthritis. Canakinumab at 150 mg s.c. on demand, showed efficacy benefits in the symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not  tolerated,  or  do  not  provide  an  adequate  response  and  which  receive  appropriate  management  of hyperuricaemia  which  includes  patients  currently  using  urate-lowering  therapy  (ULT),  or  patients  who previously failed ULT or patients in whom ULT is contraindicated.Canakinumab was significantly better than triamcinolone acetonide at treating the signs and symptoms of acute flares, inducing pain relief, improving the physician's assessments of global response, tenderness, swelling and erythema, inflammatory markers and in reducing the use of corticosteroid rescue medication.

It was also effective in reducing the frequency of subsequent flares as shown by reducing the probability of new flare, increasing the number of patients free of new flares and reducing the average number of flares per patient. New flares tended to be less severe (less initial pain) and of shorter duration, and efficacy upon re-treatment was just as effective as it had been for the baseline flare.

Canakinumab at 150 mg s.c. on demand, has also been shown to maintain these benefits, as summarized for the 24 week period[Canakinumab continued to show a strong effect on reducing the frequency and severity of new flares, as shown by the probability of new flare, the patients free of new flares and the average number of flares per patient, a trend towards a reduced severity of new flares (less pain and shorter duration), and reduced use of corticosteroids as rescue medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following table shows key efficacy parameters of the overall study population and the subpopulation representing a group of patients which currently only have corticosteroids as a treatment option. The fact that this subgroup is not limited to only patients on ULT but also includes patients which failed ULT or in whom ULT is contraindicated, reflects the current clinical reality that what is desirable, i.e. optimization of ULT, is not achieved in every gout patient (Doherty et al 2012).

The results suggest that in the subpopulation of patients which are strictly on ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine (N=62), treatment with Ilaris induced a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent attacks. However, the observed treatment difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide was less pronounced than with the overall study population on pain intensity at 72 hours ( -3.8 mm, p=0.2798) and on the risk  reduction  of  subsequent  attacks  (Hazard  ratio  0.71,  p=0.2337).  In  the  subpopulation (N=101) representing patient candidates for the proposed indication, changes from baseline show a fast and clinically relevant onset of action in patients treated with canakinumab with absolute improvement in pain intensity compared to baseline of 16.7mm, 23.2mm and 31.8mm after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. As a relative improvement this corresponds to &gt;20% (slightly improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale), &gt;30% and &gt;40% (much improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale) compared to baseline (74.6mm) after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively (Salaffi et al, 2004). Further, a  ≥20% improvement in  pain  (after  24  hours)  has  been  suggested  recently  to  define  an  appropriate response in gouty arthritis attacks (Khanna D, 2011).

## Safety

Safety results from the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, and with appropriate management of ULT (i.e. current use of ULT, or previous failure to ULT, or contraindication for ULT), which resembles most closely the proposed indication population, are now provided . However, it is of note that this studied population was by study design able to frequently use corticosteroids, as the study had with triamcinolone acetonide a corticosteroid as comparator, while the full description of the proposed indicated population is further limited to patients ' in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate' .

In this subgroup, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 66% of canakinumab-treated patients and 47% of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients which is similar to the overall population treated, canakinumab 66.2% vs triamcinolone acetonide 52.8%.

Results in this subgroup are also very consistent for the known increased risk of infections for canakinumab, with 20% of canakinumab-treated patients and only 10% of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients as compared to the overall population, with canakinumab 20.4% vs triamcinolone acetonide 12.2%.

The ultimate revised label indication will require that patients additionally be unsuitable for repeat courses of corticosteroids.  Comparative  information  regarding  safety  of  corticosteroids  in  the  ultimate  proposed population  from patients who receive corticosteroids for lack of alternative, is lacking. Such corticosteroids safety data may be difficult to generate in a new, prospective trial, given that such restricted patients, once identified, should avoid corticosteroids at the time of inclusion. Proxy data drawn from the literature and label  highlights  numerous  risks  for  corticosteroids  patients,  and  a  full  discussion  was  presented  and  a post-hoc safety analysis for very frequently flaring patients treated with 3 or more courses of corticosteroids within the 24 weeks of the blinded core and extension 1 studies was presented.

## Limitations of available safety data

An intrinsic limitation of the available data for the intended target population of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate, is the fact that for the canakinumab program only a proxy population could be studied. Here, patients could still take at least 1 of the standard of care anti-inflammatory drugs, as all patients enrolled were to be able to take a corticosteroid, the active comparator triamcinolone acetonide used in the studies.

On  the  other  hand,  studying  canakinumab  in  a  placebo-controlled  design  for  the  proposed  indicated population (symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous  12  months)  in  whom  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate), would (i) raise ethical concerns in a severely painful condition like acute gouty arthritis, and (ii) safety comparisons against placebo would be of limited informative value for the purpose of assessing potential significant clinical benefits in comparison with existing therapies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  post-hoc  safety  analysis  for  very  frequently  flaring  patients  treated  with  3  or  more  courses  of corticosteroids within the 24 weeks of the blinded core and extension 1 studies mentioned in the previous section is presented. Having received three or more injections of triamcinolone acetate is clearly associated with an increased risk to experience AEs in several SOCs vs having received only one injection (i.e. not re-treated). As an example, the risk of infection is indeed rising with increasing triamcinolone acetate use from 10.7% in patients with single use of the drug to 20.6% in patients with at least 3 injections over the course of 24 weeks.

## Important safety benefits

The potential for steroid-sparing benefits in co-morbid patients is very relevant clinically, especially in older patients  with  frequent,  multiple  comorbidities.  Corticosteroids  carry  the  risks  of  pituitary  suppression, osteoporosis, of exacerbating heart failure, infection, hypertension and diabetes, and demand complex dosing and tapering regimens.

Canakinumab should allow many patients to reduce the use of corticosteroids as a treatment for flare and also as a concomitant rescue medication.

## Unmet medical need

As described above the unmet medical need in difficult-to-treat patients with frequent flares is to optimally treat the existing flare. Treatment with canakinumab should be useful in patients unable to take NSAIDs and colchicine and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate. This population, although small in number, is clearly not able to be treated with standard of care. Whereas most patients can be successfully  managed  with  current  treatments,  a  minority  remain  inadequately  treated.  These  are  the patients with frequent attacks, with tolerability issues, with co-morbidities and contraindications, which limit or prohibit the use of existing treatments NSAIDs and colchicine.

In patients who are refractory, because they have failed or cannot take first-line therapies, there is an urgent need for effective management of signs and symptoms of an acute flare.

The potential for steroid-sparing benefits in co-morbid patients was identifiable, even in the relatively short trials (12 weeks). Corticosteroids carry the risks of pituitary suppression, osteoporosis, of exacerbating heart failure, hypertension and diabetes, and demand complex dosing and tapering regimens.

## MAH´s conclusion supporting significant clinical benefit

Treatment options  are  limited  for  gouty  arthritis  patients  with  frequent  attacks,  in  whom  NSAIDs  and colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and repeated courses of  corticosteroids  are  not  appropriate.  Although  corticosteroids  are  effective  anti-inflammatory  and immunosuppressant drugs, their frequent use is associated with adverse outcomes, including osteoporosis, peptic ulcer disease, cataract development, avascular necrosis, new onset or worsening of existing diabetes or hypertension. Although the literature examining frequent corticosteroid use in gouty arthritis is limited, corticosteroid  reduction  and  elimination  are  frequent  endpoints  in  trials  in  rheumatology  and  other therapeutic areas. Hence, for the small subgroup of gouty arthritis patients there is a clear unmet medical need  for  alternative  treatment  options,  and  canakinumab  has  demonstrated  significant  benefit  in  the treatment of gouty arthritis attacks. The treatment benefit on both coprimary endpoints in the refractory population is consistent with the benefit seen in the overall study population. The risks are also comparable with those seen in the broader population studied in the Phase III studies.

Novartis fully supports use of uric acid lowering therapy for patients with frequent attacks of gouty arthritis. Appropriate management of hyperuricaemia is standard of care and should be required in all medically appropriate patients. Nevertheless, the clinical reality is that not all do nor can be adequately managed, e.g. ULT  failures  or  having  contraindications  for  ULT  use.  Canakinumab  is  hence  not  indicated  for  the management  of  hyperuricaemia  but  can  serve  as  an  adjunct  therapy  to  appropriate  management  of hyperuricaemia in the proposed refractory population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the 'Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period' a medicinal product acting through a different principal mechanism of action and thus providing a treatment alternative, or producing a response different from other treatments in a substantial part of the target population can be considered of significant clinical benefit. Although the target population for canakinumab treatment in gouty arthritis is very small, canakinumab provides a clinically meaningful treatment benefit in a substantial part of this proposed refractory population and as such should be considered a significant clinical benefit for this population with very limited treatment options.

## Assessment of the applicant´s justification of significant clinical benefit

## Proposed new indication

The CHMP agrees that the newly proposed therapeutic indication 'symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.' is different from the already authorised indication for the treatment of CAPS since the two underlying clinical conditions are different as outlined by the applicant.

## Existing therapies

The CHMP agrees that due to limitations of existing therapies there is an unmet medical need for the 'symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous  12  months)  in  whom  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate'. Urate lowering therapy is the basic causual therapy of gouty arthritis whereas canakinumab is intended to be symptomatic 'add-on-treatment' in dfifficult to treat patients. NSAID  and  colchicine  could  be  considered  available  therapies  with  equivalent  efficacy  compared  to canakinumab; as the indication is however restricted to patients, 'in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are  contraindicated,  are  not  tolerated,  or  do  not  provide  an  adequate response' there is a clinical  relevance  for  canakinumab  as  last  resort.  In  terms  of  corticosteroids,  the available  pivotal  randomized  clinical  trials  showed  statistical  significance  in  terms  of  superiority  over triamcinolone, whereas the safety profile of canakinumab is considered inferior compared to triamcinolone for the enrolled study population in the pivotal studies. The restricted indication requires that patients be unsuitable  for  repeat  use  of  corticosteroids  ('and  in  whom  repeated  courses  of  corticosteroids  are  not appropriate') so an unmet need will be addressed.

In addition to the existing therapies discussed by the applicant, pegloticase has been approved in January 2013 for the treatment of severe debilitating chronic tophaceous gout in adult patients who may also have erosive joint involvement and who have failed to normalize serum uric acid with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at  the  maximum  medically  appropriate  dose  or  for  whom  these  medicines  are  contraindicated.  This recombinant uricase acts by catalyzing the oxidation of uric acid into allantoin hence the mechanism of action of pegloticase is different from the one of canakinumab and the use of the two products in the therapeutic armentarium differs.

## Significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies based on major contribution to patient care

Acknowledging that canakinumab demonstrated its efficacy in symptomatic pain relief in the overall gouty arthritis population, where however other treatment options with a better safety profile exist, there is a sub-population of severely ill gouty arthritis patients with a long standing disease, multiple co-morbidities and  a  lack  of  available  treatment  options,  in  whom  treatment  with  canakinumab  can  be  a  clinically meaningful treatment option. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance in the last line treatment of gouty arthritis patients defined as follows:

'Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1).'

is positive.

Canakinumab acts through a different principal mechanism of action and provides a treatment alternative for those patients for whom other standard therapies are no options, that means canakinumab can be used as a last line therapy, if all other existing symptomatic therapies are not indicated any more.

In the 'Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing protection period (November 2007)' it is outlined that 'even without showing greater efficacy or greater safety, a medicinal product having shown a benefit risk balance at least similar to existing therapies could be considered of significant clinical benefit if it acts through a different principal mechanism of action and thus provides a treatment alternative, or it produces a response different from other treatments in a substantial part of the targeted population.'

Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  provided,  the  final  restricted  indication  in  a sub-population with no other therapeutic options and its new mechanism of action the CHMP agrees that the significant clinical benefit based on contribution to patient care has been demonstrated for canakinumab.

## CHMP Conclusion

The CHMP concludes that canakinumab in severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment  options,  i.e.  contraindication  for  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  and  for  whom  repeated  courses  of corticosteroids are not appropriate, offers a new treatment option addressing an unmet need. An adequate risk management program, including a post-marketing registry, has been defined to manage and further explore the safety profile of canakinumab in this population. Therefore the CHMP supports the applicant's justification for an additional year of marketing protection based on the new therapeutic indication for Ilaris in the symptomatic treatment of gouty arthritis attacks.

## Outcome

The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, and taking into account the provisions of the 'Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period (November 2007)', and considered that the extension of the marketing protection to 11 years is justified.
