## 1. Introduction

Influenza  is  characterised  by  the  occurrence  of  frequent,  unpredictable  epidemics,  and  much  less frequent,  worldwide  pandemics.  Influenza  pandemic  occurs  when  a  novel  influenza  virus  emerges against  which  the  vast  majority  of  the  world's  population  has  no  immunity.  If  such  a  virus demonstrates the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person, the result is a global outbreak of disease that affects a high percentage of individuals in a short period of time and is likely to cause substantially increased morbidity and mortality in all countries of the world.

From an epidemiological point of view it is very unlikely that influenza strain A/Vietnam /1194/2004 would be the next pandemic strain, since the virus will either undergo further antigenic drift or the pandemic will be caused by another subtype of influenza vaccines (antigenic shift). Antigenic shift and drift are natural phenomena related to all influenza viruses. For example, additional mutations will be  required  to  enable  the  virus  to  transmit  effectively  from  human  to  human.  It  is  highly  unlikely, therefore,  that  Focetria  containing  the  antigens  from  the  strain  derived  from  A/Vietnam /1194/2004 will  provide  adequate  protection  when  using  during  a  pandemic.  In  line  with  the  developed  core dossier concept as described in the guideline (CPMP/VEG/4986/03), a variation would therefore have to  be  submitted  to  introduce  the  WHO/EU  recommended  strain,  prepared  from  the  influenza  virus causing  the  pandemic,  prior  to  use  of  Focetria  in  a  pandemic  situation.  This  will  assure  that  the pandemic  vaccine  will  induce  a  satisfactory  immune  response  to  the  influenza  virus  causing  the pandemic.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Experience  with  previous  known  influenza  pandemics  (1918,  1957  and  1968),  has  shown  that  a pandemic spreads in 2-3 waves (the first being less intense than the second one) over a total period of 13 to 23 months. There is evidence that as the volume and speed of international travel has increased during the 20th century that successive pandemics have disseminated worldwide in ever decreasing amounts of time. Although the great majority of deaths in current influenza epidemics occur among the elderly, a large proportion of influenza-related deaths in the 20 th century pandemics were among those under 65 years of age. EMEA/CHMP have established a fast track assessment procedure for pandemic influenza vaccines, as described  in  the Guideline  on  Submission  of  Marketing  Authorisation  Applications  for  Pandemic Influenza Vaccines through the Centralised  Procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03).  The  procedure involves the submission and evaluation of a core pandemic dossier during the interpandemic period, followed by a fast track assessment of the data for the recommended pandemic strain as a variation to the  MAA. The dossier requirements for the core dossier are laid down in the Guideline on Dossier Structure  and  Content  for  Pandemic  Influenza  Vaccine  Marketing  Authorisations  Application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03). Focetria is a pandemic influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted with MF59C.1. It is an egg-derived, monovalent vaccine, manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used  for  a  nationally  authorised  seasonal  Influenza  vaccine  'Fluad',  a  trivalent  influenza  vaccine licensed in 12 countries through a Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP). The applicant had submitted a data package for Focetria, based on the requirements laid down in the guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. In the initial MAA, the applicant referred to the influenza strains H5N3 and H9N2. With the response document, the applicant has submitted a new application for changing the main reference strain from the  H9N2 to the  Reverse Genetic (RG) strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), which now has to be regarded as the mock-up strain of this dossier.

As further expanded in section 3.6 of this report, Focetria has not been developed for prophylactic use during the pre-pandemic period (interpandemic and pandemic alert period).

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad, a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine nationally authorised through a MRP for several years in 12 EU countries and currently on the market. The MF59C.1 adjuvant contained in Focetria and Fluad is an oil-in-water emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene  that  is  an  intermediate  metabolite  in  the  synthesis  of cholesterol.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  formulation  proposed  for  Focetria,  selected  based  on  the  Clinical  Trials  performed  using pandemic strains, contains 7.5 µg HA of antigen/dose.  It is 6-times lower than the total amount of HA present in a conventional trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, that is 15 µg HA per strain (or 45µg HA/dose). The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe (single dose) or in vials, single dose or multi-dose. The vaccine in multi-dose vials is formulated with Thiomersal. Active Substance The Drug Substance is the Monovalent Pooled Harvest (MPH) of Pandemic Influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated. It is a buffered suspension containing predominantly the purified outer membrane proteins,  Haemagglutinin  (HA)  and  Neuraminidase  (NA),  of  a  pandemic  influenza  virus  strain recommended by the WHO-EU for the Pandemic. · Manufacture The  manufacturing  process  of  Monovalent  Pool  Harvest  (MPH)  involves  the  cultivation  of  the pandemic  influenza virus strain in embryonated  chicken eggs, harvesting of allantoic fluid, concentration by ultrafiltration and formaldehyde inactivation, followed by whole virus purification using sucrose gradient centrifugation and diafiltration. The HA and NA antigens from the surface of the purified whole virus are solubilised by treatment with  a  detergent  cetyltrimethylammonium  bromide  (CTAB).  The  solubilised  antigens  are  then separated from  the non-solubilised components  of  the  virus by  centrifugation. The  resultant supernatants  are  treated  with  polystyrene  based  resin  to  remove  CTAB.  The  polystyrene  resin  is removed by filtration and the resulting MPH is filter sterilised. Preparation and control of Virus Seeds The reference virus (H5N1 NIBRG-14) was manufactured by Reverse Genetics (RG) technology and provided by NIBSC, UK, an authorized WHO reference laboratory. According to Ph.Eur. the Working Seed (WS) is obtained after no more than 15 passages  from the approved reference virus. Aliquots of Master Seed (MS) are aseptically filled into sterile sealed vials, and stored in a freezer at a temperature lower than -60 o C.

The WS is obtained after only one passage from the MS using SPF eggs. WS is QC tested and the vials are stored at a temperature lower than -60 o C. WS is tested for HA and NA identity, absence of mycoplasma, sterility, infectivity, HA titre and egg infectivity to assure identity and microbial quality.

## Virus cultivation

The virus is grown in pre-incubated, candled, fertile hens eggs. The virus inoculum is prepared from the WS at a dilution calculated to ensure total egg infection and maximum virus yield and it is injected into  the  allantoic  cavity  of  each  production  egg.  After  inoculation,  the  eggs  are  incubated  at  an optimum temperature and time for maximum virus yield. After incubation, the eggs are cooled to 28°C and thereafter fed directly into the Harvesting room.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The allantoic fluid (AF) is collected into the harvesting vessel. The resultant fluid is then clarified by centrifugation, collected in a refrigerated tank, which is then connected to an ultrafiltration system to concentrate the allantoic fluid.

## Inactivation

An aqueous solution of formaldehyde is added to the clarified concentrated allantoic fluid. The content of the tank is then transferred to a sanitised and temperature controlled inactivation vessel and stirred throughout the inactivation period. The inactivation cycle depends upon the characteristics of specific virus strains. The inactivation temperature is selected in order not to compromise antigenicity.

## Purification

Medicinal product no longer authorised The virus is removed from the inactivated allantoic fluid using continuous flow ultracentrifuges. The virus is collected using a sucrose density gradient, which concentrates and purifies the virus through isopycnic centrifugation. The purified virus Pool is diluted with PBS and then diafiltered. A clarifying filtration takes place with pre-filters  and  filters  of  different  pore  sizes.  The  filtered  product  represents  the  Whole  Virus Concentrate,  and  it  is  sampled  for  testing.  A  Polysorbate  80  solution  is  added  to  the  Whole  Virus Concentrate and the product is stored waiting for the Split test results. Haemagglutinin and Neuraminidase solubilisation Following the split test results, CTAB Solution is added to the Whole Virus Concentrate to solubilise the HA and NA antigens. The product is then centrifuged under continuous flow and the supernatant collected. A polystyrene resin, is added to the Subunit Supernatant Pool to absorb the CTAB. Afterwards, the product undergoes a clarifying filtration to remove the resin, and a stabilizer solution is added and the product is then filtered into a stainless steel tank. Filling, storage and transportation After the filtration described above, the monovalent pool is transferred to Rosia, where it is sampled for Bioburden, and sterile filtered into a sterile container. The Monovalent Pooled Harvest is sterile filtered.  The  filtered  Monovalent  Pooled  Harvest  (i.e.  the  active  substance)  is  sampled  for  release testing and stored at 2-8°C in a stainless steel tank. Process Validation and/or Evaluation Consistency of production was demonstrated by data provided on three H5N1 full-scale batches and further  supported  by  batch  analysis  results  of  the  inter-pandemic  vaccine  production  campaigns  of previous years. MPHs  are  manufactured  in  compliance  with  GMP  and  according  to  requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur. Studies  have  been  carried  out  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  antigen  production  process  to inactivate potential viral, bacterial and mycoplasma contamination in addition to influenza viruses. The formaldehyde inactivation step has been evaluated for three consecutive production egg harvests. The  optimum  quantities  of  polysorbate  80  and  of  CTAB  to  allow  complete  splitting  of  the  virus vaccine strain is determined in the QC laboratory, prior to application to production lots. The optimal conditions  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  electrophoresis  patterns,  the  haemagglutinin  and  the neuraminidase activity identified in the lots. Tests are performed to determine the levels of potential impurities, which may arise in Monovalent Pooled Harvest. Limits are applied to these impurities. Transportation between Novartis Siena and Rosia sites is carried out using validated procedures.

## Characterisation

The  active  substance  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  monograph  for  Influenza  Vaccine,  Surface  Antigen, Inactivated. It is a sterile suspension containing predominantly the purified outer membranes proteins: HA and NA of the influenza virus strain. The crystal structure of HA has been determined to atomic resolution  for  the  native  HA,  for  the  HA  bound  to  a  number  of  different  receptor  analogues,  for proteolytic  fragments  of  HA  which  have  gone  through  the  conformational  changes  required  for mediating membrane fusion, and for HA complexed with neutralizing antibody.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Influenza  virus  NA  structure  has  been  determined  with  structural  studies  of  NA  in  complex  with specific monoclonal antibodies, by electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography amino acid sequencing and gene sequencing.

The  concentrations  of  potentially  contaminant  substances  (formaldehyde,  citrates  and  CTAB)  are controlled  during  the  process  or  in  the  MPH.  Limits  are  applied.  Polysorbate  80  is  also  used  as  an excipient of MF59C.1 adjuvant and is not considered as a residual of production but is nevertheless tested  on  the  MPH.  It  is  concluded  that  the  impurities  in  Focetria  active  substance  are  sufficiently controlled.

## · Specifications

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  MPH  complies  with  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  01/2006:0869  on  Influenza  Vaccine  (Surface Antigen, Inactivated). The  MPH  is  tested  for  release  for  Haemagglutinin  Identity  and  Content  (SRID),  Neuraminidase Identity (ELISA), Viral inactivation, Purity (SDS-PAGE), Sterility, CTAB, Polysorbate 80, Barium, Citrates, Endotoxin, Formaldehyde, Ovalbumin Content and Appearance. Specifications have been selected to be as much as possible in accordance to the Ph.Eur. monograph for the influenza vaccine (surface antigen inactivated). Specification  for  Haemagglutinin  identity  and  content,  Neuraminidase  Identity,  Viral  Inactivation, Purity, Sterility comply with Ph.Eur. for the Monovalent Bulk. A limit for Endotoxin and Ovalbumin is  set  up  on  the  Active  Substance  to  ensure  that  the  Ph.Eur.  specification  for  the  Final  Lot  (i.e. monovalent at 7.5 µg HA/dose) is met. Due to the presence of the adjuvant in the finished product, the test for formaldehyde is performed on the Monovalent Pooled Harvest. Ovalbumin is also controlled on the active substance. The acceptance limits have been set to ensure that the Ph.Eur. limits for the finished product (i.e. monovalent at 7.5 µg HA/dose) are not exceeded. The concentrations of the other substances used during manufacture of the vaccine (i.e. CTAB, citrates, Polysorbate 80) are controlled in the active substance. The limit for the citrates  is  calculated  considering  the  content  of  HA  on  the  Final  Lot.  It  has  to  be  noted  that Polysorbate 80 is also used as an excipient of MF59C.1 adjuvant All  the  relevant  analytical  methods  have  been  validated  or  qualified  for  the  active  substance.  It  is acceptable that some analytical validations have been performed on the inter-pandemic strains, as the methods are not strain specific. · Stability The  applicant  has  provided  stability  data  up  to  9  months  for  three  full-scale  batches  of  H5N1 Monovalent Pooled harvest  as  well  as  data  collected  with  the  inter-pandemic  antigens  produced  in previous years. The data are consistent with shelf-life of 1 year for the active substance when stored at 2-8°C. The applicant committed to complete the stability study for H5N1 MPH. At least one batch of the MPH in its container will be stability tested. A stability protocol up to 24 months at 2-8°C was provided. The key stability-indicating parameter are the HA content and purity, measured with the same methods and acceptance limits used at release.

## Finished Product

The  finished  product  is  a  combination  of  MPH,  MF59C.1  adjuvant  bulk  and  buffer  solutions.  The Mock-up  vaccine  application  is  based  on  the  H5N1  Reverse  Genetics  Strain  NIBRG  14,  which  is derived from the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004. It should be noted that this mock-up vaccine will have to be varied to introduce the actual pandemic strain, as designated by WHO/EU, when the pandemic is declared.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MF59C.1  adjuvant  is  an  oil-in-water  emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene  that  is  an intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of cholesterol. Squalene is a commercially available natural product distilled  from  shark  liver  oil.  It  is  then  redistilled  and  supplied  by  qualified  manufacturers. MF59C.1

The  process  for  the  Final  Bulk  preparation  consists  is  a  simple  mixing  operation.  In  case  of formulation with preservative a Thiomersal solution is added. The formulated suspension is filled into syringes or vials. The potency of the vaccine is expressed as the concentration of the HA protein.

The vaccine is presented as a suspension for injection in an emulsion in a pre-filled syringe (single dose) or in vials, single dose or multi-dose. Vaccine in multi-dose vials is formulated with Thiomersal.

The  finished  product  is  a  combination  of  MPH,  MF59C.1  adjuvant  bulk  and  buffer  solutions.  The present core pandemic dossier describes the H5N1 mock-up vaccine.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Description and Composition of the finished product: Each 0.5 ml dose of vaccine has the following composition: Active Ingredient: HA and NA antigens from the influenza virus strain recommended by WHO/EU for the Pandemic ≥ 7.5 µ g HA Adjuvant MF59C.1: Squalene 9.75 mg Polysorbate 80 1.175 mg Sorbitan trioleate 1.175 mg Other Ingredients: Sodium chloride Potassium chloride Potassium dihydrogen phosphate Disodium phosphate dihydrate Magnesium chloride hexahydrate Calcium chloride dihydrate Thiomersal (included only in multi-dose vials) Sodium citrate Citric acid Water for injections · Pharmaceutical Development Focetria contains the same adjuvant and is manufactured with the same process used for Fluad. Fluad a surface antigen, trivalent inactivated, inter-pandemic influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1, is currently the only influenza vaccine with an adjuvant on the market, and has been approved in 2000 through a Mutual Recognition Procedure in 12 EU countries. Fluad is also licensed and marketed in other European countries and outside Europe. Formulation Development

The MF59 adjuvant has been used in pre-clinical and clinical studies for a range of different vaccines.

From the 1999 Fluad has been formulated using adjuvant containing citrate buffer to improve adjuvant stability, designated as MF59C.1. This formulation has been the one used for Focetria.

Both the aqueous and citrate formulations of MF59 were used in preclinical and clinical studies. A clinical  study  has  been  successfully  completed  which  demonstrates  equivalence  between  the  citrate and water formulations of Fluad.

## Manufacturing Process Development

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first production of Focetria with the H5N3 strain was in 1999. The manufacturing process was the same of the seasonal influenza vaccine Fluad. Successively, Focetria was produced with the H9N2 strain in 2004 and with the H5N1 strain in 2005, with the same manufacturing process approved for Fluad in 2005.

From 2000, some changes in formulation and manufacturing process were introduced for Fluad and approved through the relevant MRP variations. However these differences, as already demonstrated for the variations submitted for Fluad, do not affect the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.

Thiomersal  was  previously  used  in  the  production  of  the  active  substance  (as  reagent  during  the process and as preservative at the final stage) and of the finished product (as preservative). Thiomersal was  removed  in  two  steps:  in  the  first  one  it  was  removed  from  the  active  substance  and  finished product as preservative (remaining as traces); in the second one it was removed completely (in 2003). Clinical  trials  performed  to  compare  Fluad  formulations  (with  and  without  preservative)  and  of  the stability studies confirmed that the presence of Thiomersal, as a preservative in Fluad, does not have any  impact  on  the  quality,  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the  product.  For  that  reason,  the  current licensed Fluad in pre-filled syringe is a thiomersal-free product.

The Buffer A, Solution B and Thiomersal solution are prepared in Rosia. The Monovalent Pools are prepared at the Siena facility and transported to Rosia where they are sterilised by filtration to produce the MPH. The MF59C.1 Adjuvant Bulk is received from the manufacturing site and is sterilised by filtration.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Focetria with H5N3 strain was produced before 2003 with the preservative, while Focetria with H9N2 and H5N1 strains were produced in 2004 and 2005 without any preservative. · Adventitious Agents In addition to inactivation of influenza virus, the Ph.Eur., requires that the formaldehyde inactivation process be shown to be capable of inactivating avian leucosis viruses and mycoplasma. Studies have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the antigen production process to inactivate potential viral, bacterial and mycoplasma contamination in addition to influenza viruses. CTAB, as detergent, could contribute to virus inactivation. Its capacity to inactivate mycoplasma has been validated. Sucrose gradient centrifugation could contribute to virus removal as well as the centrifugation steps, which follow the Polysorbate 80/CTAB treatment. With respect to the transmission of TSE, the only animal derived starting materials are eggs (used in production  of  the  active  substance)  and  squalene  (used  in  the  MF59C.  1  adjuvant).  There  is  no scientific  evidence  to  suggest  that  eggs  are  likely  to  present  any  risk  of  contamination  from  TSEagents. Copy of the Declaration of compliance with the annex to Directive 75/ 318/ EEC, as amended by directive 1999/ 82/ EEC relating to TSE was submitted. Regarding squalene, derived from shark liver, it does not present any risk of potential contamination from TSE agents as well. With  regards  to  the  use  of  reverse  genetics  strains,  which  may  be  prepared  using  materials  from ruminant origin (foetal calf serum, bovine trypsin, Vero Cells), the TSE compliance was performed by NIBSC. · Manufacture of the Product Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls Final Bulk Vaccine Process

The  components  are  added  to  the  Final  Bulk  container  (buffer  solution,  water  for  injection,  MPH, stabilizer solution and MF59). The required quantity of Thiomersal solution is only added in case of formulation with preservative. After the addition is completed, the bulk is stirred to allow adequate mixing.  The  pH  of  the  Final  Bulk  is  checked  and  samples  are  taken  for  Final  Bulk  release  control testing  [i.e.  HA  identity  and  content,  Endotoxin,  Total  protein  (other  than  HA),  Osmolality, Ovalbumin Content, Thiomersal (if appropriate)]. The Final Bulk is then aliquoted by aseptic transfer into sterile containers (each container is subsequently sampled and tested for sterility), and stored at 2-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8 o C. The in-process controls are appropriate for the preparation of the Final bulk and of the Final Lot in its final container.

The adjuvant MF59C.1 is produced in Germany and transported to Italy, where it is filtered and used to formulate the Final Bulk. Bioburden is controlled before the sterilizing filtration, while sterility and other in-process parameters are monitored after filtration and before the addition into the Final Bulk mixing tank.

## Filling and packaging Process (Final lot syringes and Final lot vials)

Filling operations are carried out at the Rosia manufacturing site. Syringes and vials are filled by a validated, aseptically procedure which is also registered for Fluad. The packed product is stored at 28 o C until released.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Product Specification The  Final  Lot  is  tested  for  release  for  Haemagglutinin  Identity  and  Content  (SRID),  Sterility, Endotoxin,  Appearance,  Abnormal  toxicity,  Squalene  identity  and  content  (HPLC),  Particle  size distribution, pH, Thiomersal (only for multi-dose vials) and Extractable volume. The  release  tests  are  the  same  approved  for  the  inter-pandemic  Fluad  vaccine  (except  for  the haemagglutinin content - 7.5 µ g/dose vs. 15 µ g for each strain/dose) and fulfil the Ph.Eur. requirements for surface antigen influenza vaccine. The specifications might differ from the Ph.Eur. monograph for the influenza vaccine (surface antigen inactivated) due to the presence of the MF59C.1 that could interfere with some analytical methods. The specification  for  Haemagglutinin  identity  and  content  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  for  the  Final  Lot. This test is also performed in the Final Bulk. In case the quantity of relevant materials to carry out the assay is insufficient (a real possibility in a Pandemic emergency), this test will be performed only on the Final Bulk and will not be repeated in the final lot. The specifications for squalene content and identity and for particle size distribution are specific to control the MF59C.1 adjuvant into the vaccine. Thiomersal is controlled when it is used as a preservative in the Final Bulk formulation. The Test for free formaldehyde is performed earlier in the process, on the Monovalent Pooled Harvest, rather than on the Final Bulk vaccine or the Final Lot, as required by Ph.Eur.  The MF59C.1 adjuvant in the finished product interferes with the performance of this test. All the relevant analytical procedures have been validated or qualified for the finished product. All  excipients  used  during  production  and  in  the  formulation  of  Monovalent  Pooled  Harvest, MF59C.1  adjuvant  and  Final  bulk  Vaccine  comply  with  Ph.Eur.,  except  for  squalene  (in-house specifications). Batch analysis Batch  analysis  results  of  three  H5N1  full  production  scale  lots  show  consistent  production  and  are consistent with results obtained for the seasonal Fluad vaccine.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  data  for  the  pre-filled  syringes  of  Focetria  H5N1  are  provided  (3  full-scale  batches  for  9 months)  and  are  consistent  with  stability  results  of  the  seasonal  MRP  approved  Fluad  vaccine justifying the proposed shelf life of 1 year when stored at 2-8°C. The applicant committed to complete the stability study for pre-filled syringes as well as for mono-dose and multi-dose vials.

The proposed shelf  life  for  the  adjuvant  MF59C.1  of  3  years  when  stored  at  2-8  °C  is  sufficiently supported by data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Focetria  is  an  inactivated  monovalent  influenza  vaccine,  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1.  The  vaccine  is based upon virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase), propagated in eggs, of strain: H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1).

Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad, a trivalent seasonal  influenza  vaccine,  nationally  approved via MRP.  The  MF59C.1  adjuvant  contained  in Focetria  and  Fluad  is  an  oil-  in-  water  emulsion,  composed  mainly  of  squalene.  Taking  this  into consideration  the  applicant submitted  a  reduced  non-clinical  package  for  Focetria;  this  is in accordance  with  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

- ¾ Body temperature elevations were lowest in the animals that were given the 15µg vaccine (as determined from the temperatures measured in the afternoon).

Medicinal product no longer authorised For the non-clinical part of the dossier, the applicant has compiled data emerging from non-clinical studies with the adjuvant alone and in combination with different antigens, performed over the last 15 years. The non-clinical data supporting the approval of Fluad and the MF59 non-clinical data package represent the principal support to this application. GLP The relevant studies were carried out in compliance with GLP. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Ferret challenge study A ferret challenge study was performed to determine the protective efficacy of the pandemic mock up vaccine against challenge with homologous live avian influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus strain and to evaluate its immunogenicity. In order to perform the study, the ferrets were primed with an H3N2 Influenza virus, vaccinated twice with  the  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  (H5N1)  containing  mock-up  vaccine  and  then  challenged  with  the reassortant avian influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus. Two different doses of the mock up vaccine, 7.5  and  15  µg  HA/dose  were  tested;  MF59  adjuvant  served  as  control.  The  use  of  a  heterologous priming infection in ferrets mimics the human condition where individuals are not naïve to influenza virus per se, but are naïve to pandemic virus strains. The following observations were made: ¾ Both the 7.5µg and 15µg vaccine formulations reduced viral shedding in nasal washes and induced seroconversion against Influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus antigen, when compared to the negative control article. ¾ No seroconversion was observed in the negative control animals. ¾ The 15µg vaccine formulation was associated with greater reductions in viral shedding and higher titres of Influenza A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) virus HA antibodies, compared to the 7.5µg vaccine formulation.

- ¾ There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  treated  and  control  animals  in symptom scores, weight loss or leukocyte counts.

## Mouse immunogenicity assay

The applicant has performed immunogenicity and influenza challenge studies in mice. The results of a recent  study,  which    confirmed  the  ability  of  MF59  to  enhance  the  antibody  response  (ELISA  and haemagglutination inhibition [HI]) in young adult (8 weeks-old) and in old BALB/c mice (18 monthsold) is summarised below. The study evaluated the dose-response when various amounts of influenza trivalent subunit vaccine were combined with fixed amounts of MF59 (1:1 volume-to-volume ratio),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiovascular and neurological evaluations during repeat-dose studies with MF59 in dogs

Medicinal product no longer authorised * Evaluated pre-test, and prior to necropsy. Animals were necropsied 1week post-last dose. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions Such studies are not required according to CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic or classic absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies with Focetria or Fluad or MF59C.1 have not been performed. In accordance with the relevant guidelines (guideline on non-clinical testing vaccine CPMP/SWP/465/95 and guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004), it is considered acceptable that a complete ADME study has not been conducted because they are considered not relevant for a vaccine. The main component of MF59C.1 is squalene. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is a constituent in dietary product (vegetable and fish oil). Clearance study performed in rabbits injected intramuscularly with labeled squalene (125I) demonstrated that it is rapidly cleared and only 5% remains at the injection site for approximately 5 days after injection. From data available and considering the route of administration, the low volume and the frequency of human administration, the use of squalene does not constitute a risk factor in clinical use. Toxicology · Single dose toxicity / Repeat dose toxicity Focetria an inactivated monovalent influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1., manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad thus no single dose toxicity/ repeat dose toxicity studies are required according CPMP/VEG/4717/03. Nevertheless the applicant submitted a repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits, with seasonal trivalent vaccine + MF59W.1 (Fluad). The human dose of Fluad was administered as two intramuscular injections 14 days apart. There were no systemic adverse effects and the vaccine was tolerated locally, although transient local effects have been shown.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

No  reproduction  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  Focetria,  this  is  in  line  with  the  relevant guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

- Local tolerance

Focetria development is based on the manufacturing process of Fluad, a Novartis' trivalent, seasonal influenza  vaccine  (surface  antigen,  inactivated,  adjuvanted  with  MF59C.1)  currently  on  the  market. No local tolerance studies with Focetria are required according CPMP/VEG/4717/03. However, the repeat-dose toxicity study with Fluad in rabbits included an evaluation of local tolerability. There were no clinical signs of any injection site reactions (including Draize score).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Macroscopic examination of injection site muscle from animals treated two days previously indicated an  increased  frequency  of  slight  focal  haemorrhage  in  the  Fluad  group,  compared  with  each component  administered  separately.  Complete  recovery  was  observed  in  animals  treated  16  days previously. Histological examination of the injection site 2 days post-injection revealed interstitial inflammation), interstitial  haemorrhage, and/or muscle fiber degeneration in almost all animals. These observations were  more  notable  in  the  Fluad  group.  However  at  16  and  30  days  after  injections  degenerative changes and inflammatory were still present but to a lower degree and without relevant differences between control and treated groups. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Focetria is an inactivated viral vaccine, and only a surface antigen. Squalene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is a constituent in dietary product (vegetable and fish oil). There is no environmental risk for the product itself. 4. Clinical aspects Introduction Clinical  trials  on  protective  efficacy  for  the  mock-up  vaccine  cannot  be  performed.  Therefore  a detailed  characterisation  of  the  immunological  response  to  the  mock-up  vaccines  is  required.  The vaccine  virus  strains  chosen  for  these  studies  should  allow  simulating  a  situation  where  the  target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. The criteria for these studies are laid down the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. With no other criteria to suggest at present, mock-up vaccine should be able to elicit sufficient immunological response to meet all  three  of  the  current  standards  set  for  existing  vaccines  in  adults  or  older  adults  laid  down  in CPMP/BWP/214/96. In adults aged 18-60 years: · Number  of  seroconversions  or  significant  increase  in  anti-haemagglutinin  antibody  titre  &gt; 40% · Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.5; · Proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre &gt; 40 or SRH titre &gt; 25 mm 2 &gt; 70%.

In adults &gt; 60 years:

- Number of seroconversions or significant increase in antihaemagglutinin antibody titre &gt; 30%
- Proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre &gt; 40 or SRH titre &gt; 25 mm 2 &gt; 60%.
- Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.0;

In addition neutralising antibodies should be present. The development program for Focetria is based on this guideline.

Early investigations were performed with H5N3 and H9N2 strains.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since  the  avian  influenza  strain  H5N1  strain  considered  as  a  possible  candidate  to  cause  the  next influenza  pandemic,  the  applicant  decided  to  base  the  mock-up  dossier  on  studies  performed (immunogenicity and safety) with A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) strain containing vaccine.

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## Pharmacokinetics

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  the  note  for  guidance  on  clinical evaluation of new vaccines (CPMP/EWP/463/97) and the Guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. Pharmacodynamics In  relation  to  vaccines,  pharmacodynamic  studies  are  essentially  comprised  of  the  immunogenicity studies  that  characterise  the  immune  response  to  vaccines.  The  detailed  characterisation  of  the immunological response to the mock-up vaccines is the surrogate parameter for efficacy (CPMP/VEG/4717/03) and these data are discussed below. Clinical efficacy Two dose ranging studies evaluating safety and immunogenicity in young adults have been performed with adjuvanted candidate vaccines. In these trials two different mock-up strains, H5N3 and H9N2, have been used. A total of 161 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated in these studies. Eighty subjects received at least one dose of different formulations of the adjuvanted vaccine and 81 subjects received at least one dose of a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine. The pivotal study V87P1 was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years and subjects &gt; 61 with an adjuvanted candidate vaccine containing the mock-up strain H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Dose response studies Study V7P37 Study  V7P37 was  an  observer  blind,  randomised  comparative  dose  ranging  study  to  evaluate safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine containing the mock-up strain H5N3 as compared to a non-adjuvanted split influenza vaccine containing H5N3. Fifty-five  healthy  adults,  between  18-40  years  old  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  Subjects  were randomised to receive adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine (7.5 µ g, 15 µ g or 30 µ g HA per dose) or the same dose of a non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine according to a 2-dose schedule (day 0, day 21). Immunogenicity was assessed by microneutralisation assay (MN), haemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), and single radial haemolysis (SRH). Blood samples were drawn at day 0, 21, and 42. Antibody cross-reactivity was assessed against heterovariant H5N1 influenza strains.

Results : Before immunization all participants had serum HI titres of less than 1:10. After the first and after the second vaccine dose, GMTs of antibody to MF59C.1-adjuvanted vaccine were significantly higher than to non-adjuvanted vaccine. There was no dose response relationship, in particular, within the adjuvanted mock-up strain groups. The highest response was achieved in the two groups with the lowest antigen concentration. At 7·5 µ g the MF59C.1- adjuvanted influenza vaccine gave the highest GMT on day 42.

Immunisation with candidate vaccine (adjuvanted influenza vaccine) seroconversion rates between 1860%, were achieved. Interestingly higher seroconversion rates were achieved with the lower antigen content. Seroconversion rate was significantly higher in the adjuvanted groups compared to the nonadjuvanted group, but the dose response was not significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Seroprotection  rates  were  between  18  and  60%  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups,  where  higher seroprotection rates were achieved with the lower antigen content. Seroprotection rate was significantly  higher  in  the  adjuvanted  groups  compared  to  the  non-adjuvanted  group,  but  the  dose response was not significant.

Results: At  baseline  none of the subjects had detectable antibodies as tested by HI and/or MN. By SRH,  subjects  immunised  with  any  dose  of  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  still  had  detectable antibodies  against  both  A/H5N3  and  A/H5N1.  Non-adjuvanted  vaccine  recipients  had  detectable antibodies  only  in  the  group  immunised  with  the  15  µg  dose,  and  against  A/H5N3  only.  At  revaccination with adjuvanted candidate vaccine H5N3 GMTs increased significantly when compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine. MF59C.1-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine induced antibodies that cross-protected against  not  only  the  H5N1  strains  from  1997-1998,  but  also  against  the  more  recent  and  virulent strains isolated in 2003 and 2004 in Vietnam and Hong Kong, which exhibit some antigenic drift as compared to the original strains.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Study V7P37E1 In  the  extension  study V7P37E1 ,  28  subjects  who  completed  study  V7P37  were  revaccinated approximately  17  months  after  primary  vaccination  in  order  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  an additional vaccine dose as previously formulated, with and without MF59C.1 adjuvant. Of the 28 subjects, 26 were included in the immunogenicity analyses; 15 of these individuals were previously  vaccinated  with  the  adjuvanted  formulations,  while  the  remaining  11  had  received  the comparator  vaccine.  Immunogenicity  was  assessed  by  MN,  HI  and  SRH.  Serum  samples  were collected before and 3 weeks after revaccination.

Young  healthy  adults,  18  to  34  years  old  were included in the study. Four dose levels of adjuvanted candidate vaccine (3.75 µg, 7.5µg, 15 µg and 30 µg  HA/dose)  were  compared  to  the  related  non-adjuvanted  formulations.  A  total  of  48  subjects received 4-dose levels of adjuvanted candidate vaccine (3.75 µg, 7.5µg, 15 µg and 30 µg HA/dose) and 48 subjects received the comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine. Twelve individuals were included in each vaccine group. Two vaccine doses were administered, four weeks apart.  Immunogenicity was assessed by HI test, and,  in  a  subset  of  subject  by  using  microneutralization  (MN)  test;  blood  samples  were  drawn  at baseline, and 28 days after each vaccination (day 28, and 56). Results: Immunogenicity results after two doses with candidate vaccine ± MF59C.1 (mock-up strain H9N2) Parameter GMT (95% CI) % SC (95% CI) % SP (95% CI)

A  better  antibody  response  against  the  vaccine  antigen  (A/Chick/G9  strain)  was  seen  with  the adjuvanted candidate vaccine at all dosages than the respective nonadjuvanted vaccines. GMTs after vaccination  with  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  were  consistently  higher  when  compared  to  nonadjuvanted vaccine and reached seroprotective levels for all dosages. The seroconversion rate (4-fold increase) and seroprotection rate (&gt; 40) after 2 doses of adjuvanted candidate vaccine ranged between 91% and 100% depending on the dosage. The non-adjuvanted vaccine was poorly immunogenic even at the highest dose of 30 µg.

- Main study

## Study V87P1

Study V87P1 is a partially-blind randomised multicentre study designed to evaluate the reactogenicity and  immunogenicity  of  two  doses  of  pandemic  monovalent  (surface  antigen  adjuvanted  with MF59C.1) influenza vaccines (Focetria)  administered  at  different  doses  (7.5  µg,  15  µg  of  A/H5N1 antigen) in non-elderly and elderly subjects.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Medicinal product no longer authorised A total of 486 subjects were enrolled, 313 aged 18-60 years (adults) and 173 aged 61 years and over (elderly). Among the adults 157 and 156 subjects received Focetria containing 7.5 µg and 15 µg of A/H5N1  influenza  antigen,  respectively.  Among  the  elderly  87  and  86  subjects  received  Focetria containing 7.5 µg and 15 µg of A/H5N1 influenza antigen (HA), respectively. Treatments Subjects were randomised to receive vaccination Focetria at different doses (7.5 µg and 15 µg HA) adjuvanted  with  MF59.C1.  The  subjects  were  vaccinated  at  day  0  and  day  21.  A  subset  of  the population will receive a booster dose at day 202. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate the immune response (in term of anti-haemagglutinin antibody) of two doses of pandemic adjuvanted mock-up vaccine (H5N1), 3 weeks after the second dose. The secondary objectives were ¾ To demonstrate non-inferiority of the antibody response elicited, as determined by using HI test,  by  doses  of  Focetria  containing  7.5  µg  of  A/H5N1  HA  vs.  two  doses  of  Focetria containing  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  HA,  in  terms  of  post-immunisation  GMT,  3  weeks  after  the second immunization. ¾ To  evaluate  immunogenicity  of  one  dose  of  Focetria  containing  either  7.5  µg  or  15  µg  of A/H5N1 HA, as measured by HI, in compliance with CPMP/VEG/4717/03, and by MN (in a subset of subjects). ¾ To evaluate the safety of the administration of two doses of Focetria containing either 7.5 µg or  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  HA  according  to  the  safety  parameters  routinely  used  for  seasonal influenza vaccines (see below). Outcomes/endpoints The co-primary endpoints were defined as follows: Non-elderly adult subjects 18-60 years (i.e., ≥ 18 and &lt; 61) ¾ Number of seroconversions 1  or significant increase in antibody titre 2  &gt; 40% ¾ Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.5 ¾ The proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre ≥ 40 should be &gt; 70%· Elderly subject 61 years and over (i.e., ≥ 61) ¾ Number of seroconversions 1  or significant increase in antibody titre 2  &gt; 30%

- ¾ Mean geometric increase &gt; 2.0
- ¾ The proportion of subjects achieving an HI titre ≥ 40 should be &gt; 60%
- 1 Seroconversion is defined as negative pre-vaccination serum (&lt; 10) / post-vaccination titre ≥ 40.

2 Significant increase in antibody titre is defined as at least a fourfold increase from non-negative pre-vaccination serum ( ≥ 10)

## Statistical methods / Sample size

There was no statistical null hypothesis associated with the primary immunogenicity objective, which was analyzed descriptively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The null hypothesis for the secondary immunogenicity objective stated that a regimen consisting of two  doses  of  Focetria  influenza  vaccine  containing  7.5  µg  each  does  not  comply  with  the  noninferiority  assumption  that  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  postimmunization (day 43) GMT ratio is &gt; 0.5, by using HI test, when compared to two doses of FluadH5N1 influenza vaccine containing 15 µg.

- ¾ H0: GMT7.5 / GMT  15 ≤ 0.5
- ¾ H1: GMT7.5/ GMT 15 &gt; 0.5

The target sample size was at least 520 subjects overall (at least 260 aged 18-60 years and260 aged 61 and over). The planned sample size accounted for a 10% dropout rate, in order to achieve a minimum of 460 evaluable subjects (230 in each vaccine group).

An analysis of sera by SRH at day 43 has (adults: 297 subjects; elderly: 161 subjects) been performed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The sample-size calculation was based on the secondary immunogenicity objective of non-inferiority between two doses of Fluad-H5N1 influenza vaccine containing 7.5 µg vs. two doses of Fluad-H5N1 influenza vaccine containing 15 µg, as measured by HI test. A  0.025  one-sided  alpha  level,  a  clinically  relevant  value  of  0.5  in  terms  of  the  ratio  of  postimmunization GMTs (day 43, visit 3) between the two vaccines (i.e., a difference of 0.301 in terms of log10 [GMTs] between vaccines) and a power of 80% were chosen. RESULTS Numbers analysed A total of 486 subjects were enrolled, 313 aged 18-60 years (adults) and 173 aged 61 years and over (elderly). Among the adults 157 and 156 subjects received Focetria influenza vaccine containing 7.5 µg  and  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  influenza  antigen,  respectively.  Among  the  elderly  87  and  86  subjects received  Focetria  influenza  vaccine  containing  7.5  µg  and  15  µg  of  A/H5N1  influenza  antigen, respectively. Out  of  the  486  enrolled  subjects,  464  subjects  were  included  in  the  Per-Protocol  population  (PP) analyses. For the Focetria 7.5µg and the Focetria 15µg groups, 151 and 150 adult subjects and 84 and 79 elderly subjects,  all  respectively,  were  included  in  the  immunogenicity  analyses.  Within  each  age  stratum demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Number of subjects: planned (actually enrolled) Outcomes and estimation Vaccine immunogenicity was assessed on all subjects using the SHR, HI, and MN assays.

In the baseline seronegative subset (261 adults; 117 elderly) of the total immunogenicity population, there was a tendency for slightly higher GMRs and higher percentages demonstrating seroconversion than in the total immunogenicity population. At day 43 all CHMP immunogenicity criteria were met. The results show that in subjects without detectable antibody titres at baseline the immunes response after  two  Focetria  vaccinations  with  7.5  µg  or  15  µg  doses  met  all  three  CHMP  immunogenicity criteria as requested by the EMEA/CPMP/VEG/4717/03. An analysis  of  sera  samples  assayed  by  MN  has  performed  on  the  full  immunogenicity  population (301 adults; 163 elderly) for all time points (day 1, day 22, day 43). The immune responses at day 43 were high with 83% and 58% of adult and elderly recipients of 7.5 µg Focetria demonstrating at least 4-fold  increases  above  baseline.  At  this  time  point  GMTs  respectively  increased  11  and  4.53-fold above baseline. The immune responses to 7.5 µg and 15 µg Focetria were similar. In the baseline seronegative subset (280 adults; 120 elderly) of the total immunogenicity population, there was a tendency at day 43 for slightly higher GMRs and higher percentages demonstrating at least 4-fold  increases  than  in  the  total  immunogenicity  population,  especially  in  the  elderly.  However, slightly  fewer  elderly  subjects  attained  postvaccination  titres  of  at  least  1:20,  1:40,  and  1:80  with similar percentages attaining these titres after the second vaccination in adults regardless of baseline seronegativity.  The  immune  responses  to  7.5  µg  and  15  µg  Focetria  were  similar  in  baseline seronegative subjects.

- Clinical studies in special populations

## Elderly

In study V87P1 seventy-three subjects aged 61 years and over (elderly) were enrolled.

For the elderly population, there was no difference between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups in the  attainment  of  the  three  CHMP  criteria  (CPMP/BWP/214/96)  for  the  A/Vietnam/1194/2004-like (H5N1)  influenza  antigen  both  using  the  SRH.  Three  out  of  the  three  CHMP  criteria  were  met  in subjects receiving two doses of either the 7.5 µg or the 15 µg Focetria using the SRH assay.

## Paediatric population

Medicinal product no longer authorised Neonates and infants are not included in the population studied during the clinical development and such  a  situation  is  expected  to  be  common  for  the  pandemic  vaccines.  Therefore  this  does  not represent  an  obstacle  to  the  current  authorisation.  However  this  situation  is  reflected  in  the  SPC, recommendation  for  injection  in  infants  is  left  to  national  official  recommendations  during  the pandemic period. · Discussion on clinical efficacy The  development  of  Focetria  benefits  is  based  on  the  experience  with  Fluad,  Novartis'  seasonal trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine. The MF59C.1 adjuvant contained in the vaccine is an oil- inwater emulsion, composed mainly of squalene. Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad. Initial dose finding studies with an adjuvanted candidate vaccine containing mock-up strains H5N3 or H9N2 showed that a dose as low as 3.75 µg HA elicits adequate seroprotection in healthy adults. All three immunogenicity criteria defined by CHMP (CPMP/BWP/214/96) were fulfilled. However these results are based on a very small number of individuals (10-12 individuals per vaccine group). The studies also confirmed that adjuvant MF59C.1 significantly enhances specific immune response to influenza vaccines. In fact, this result is consistent across studies and tests used (HI, MN, SRH). It is also evident that two doses of candidate vaccine are necessary to induce a proper immune response. Subsequently, the dossier was shifted to a H5N1 mock-up file and further data were provided for this vaccine in order to establish efficacy Focetria. For 7.5 µg and 15 µg HA group, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor in the adult and the elderly population were in compliance with CHMP requirements (CPMP/BWP/214/96). In both age groups,  the  GMTs induced by Focetria (7.5 µg HA) was non-inferior to the GMTs induced by the vaccine containing 15 µg HA. Seroprotection  rates  in  adults  and  elderly  calculated  using  the  SRH  assay  met  the  set  CHMP requirements. These results were sustained also by the microneutralisation assay. A subset of patients will be followed up for long-term immunogenicity data; samples will be tested after 6 and 12 month. The applicant commits to submit these results with the final study report. Paediatric  studies  were  not  included  in  the  clinical  development  program.  These  studies  are  not required according CPMP/VEG/4717/03 at this time point. Recommendations for immunisation of the paediatric population are left to national official recommendations during the pandemic period.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

## Study V87P1

Overall 485 subjects of the 486 enrolled were exposed to the investigational vaccines and included in the  safety  analyses.  Among the adults, one subject did not receive any dose and 7 subjects did not receive the second dose. Among the elderly, 7 subjects did not receive the second dose.

The percentages of adults experiencing each local reaction, systemic reaction and other indicators of reactogenicity (i.e., staying home due to a reaction and using analgesics or antipyretics medication) were generally similar between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups and overall.

The most frequently experienced local reaction was pain.

The most frequently experienced systemic reactions were myalgia and headache, followed by chills, malaise, arthralgia and fatigue.

Twenty-one adults, 7 % of the overall adult population, experienced symptoms consistent with oculorespiratory-symptoms (ORS). All reactions were mild except for one adult who reported moderate red

The  percentages  of  elderly  subjects  experiencing  each  local  reaction,  systemic  reaction  and  other indicators of reactogenicity were generally similar between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups and overall.

The most frequently experienced local reaction was pain.

The  most  frequently  experienced  systemic  reactions  in  the  elderly  were  myalgia,  headache  and arthralgia followed by chills, malaise, and fatigue.

Overall, 6 elderly subjects, 3.5% of the overall elderly population, experienced symptoms consistent with ORS. All reactions were mild except for one elderly who reported severe coughing at 6 hours and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on day 2 after the first dose. This is in the same range as other reports on ORS in clinical studies with influenza vaccines.

Local and systemic reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No  data  on  co-administration  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  with  other  vaccines  are  available.  This  is reflected in the SPC under section 4.5.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

## None

Medicinal product no longer authorised Supportive studies The  dose  finding  studies  V7P37  (and  extension  study  V7P37E1)  and  DMID  04-019  include  161 subjects of which 80 subjects received at least one dose of different formulations of the adjuvanted candidate vaccine and 81 subjects received at least one dose of a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine. The  total  number  of  176  doses  of  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  and  172  doses  of  non-adjuvanted control vaccine were administered. In study V7P37 and extension study V7P37E1, pain was the most frequently reported local reaction in the adjuvanted group. At each dose level the frequency is higher compared to the control group, in addition there appeared to be a dose response relationship. The most frequently reported systemic reaction is headache, followed by myalgia and fatigue. No dose response relationship or marked difference with the control group can be observed. In study DMID 04-019 tenderness was most frequently reported, and pain and tenderness were both more  frequently  reported  as  in  the  non-adjuvanted  group  after  each  dose.  After  the  second  dose, erythema and induration are also more frequently reported in the adjuvanted group. Headache  was  the  most  common  systemic  reaction.  There  was  no  obvious  difference  between  the groups or dose levels. A limited number of subjects reported one or more unsolicited events, 4 subjects in study V7P37, 2 in the  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine  (H5N3)  15 µ g  group,  one  in  the  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccine (H5N3)  7.5 µ g  group  and  one  after  the  second  dose  of  the  non-adjuvanted  7.5 µ g  dose  group.  In extension study V7P37E1 a total of two subjects, both in the adjuvanted candidate vaccine (H5N3)  30 µ g group, reported 3 non-serious adverse events (fever and headache, injection site pain), which were considered to be probably related to the vaccine. In study DMID 04-019 in total 160 AEs were reported, 105 of which onset after the first vaccination and 55 after the second vaccination. The most frequently reported systemic reaction after vaccination with the adjuvanted candidate vaccine was headache (up to 50% of subjects in group containing 30 µg non-adjuvanted vaccine. Reports  of  severe  common  reactions  were  limited  to  one  subject  receiving  15  µg  non-adjuvanted vaccine who experienced severe malaise and nausea. · Discussion on clinical safety The dose finding studies were too small to evaluate common adverse events. Thus, the safety analysis is based on the pivotal study with H1N5 candidate vaccine.

The observed rate of adverse events was lower than expected. Reactogenicity was generally higher for adults  compared  to  elderly,  and  after  the  first  than  the  second  dose.  No  major  differences  were observed between the Focetria 7.5 µg and 15 µg groups.

The MF59C.1 adjuvant is also included in the currently licensed Fluad seasonal influenza vaccine. Additional  available  information  on  adjuvant  safety  from  clinical  studies  and  Post-Marketing surveillance have been provided and support the favourable safety profile of Focetria.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Since Focetria is indicated for use in an officially declared pandemic situation, the Pharmacovigilance Plan  will  additionally  be  updated  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  CHMP  recommendations  for  the Pharmacovigilance Plan for Pandemic Influenza Vaccines. Table Summary of the risk management plan 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  present  application  is  for  a  core  pandemic  dossier,  based  on  data  generated  with  3  mock-up strains:  H5N1,  H9N2  and  H5N3.  The  data  with  the  two  latter  strains  is  supportive  to  the  data generated with the RG H5N1 strain, derived from A/Viet Nam/1194/2004.

Due to the possible constrains in a pandemic situation, the applicant provided additional information with regard to the optimisation of the manufacturing process, alternative testing for extraneous agents, alternative  testing  to  assay  the  potency  (e.g.  HA  content)  of  the  vaccine,  the  supply  of  SPF  and production eggs and production of MF59. This additional information was regarded as satisfactory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During  the  evaluation  of  Focetria,  no  major  objections  were  identified.  Minor  concerns  have  been adequately addressed, however several commitments are made by the applicant, and several follow-up measures are defined to provide further information post-approval. In conclusion all quality issues are resolved.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The non-clinical package for Focetria, this is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, namely the guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03), the note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological testing and toxicological  testing  of  vaccines  guidelines  pertaining  to  the  non-clinical  testing  requirements  for vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (CPMPVEG/17/03/2004).

Medicinal product no longer authorised The challenge testing in the ferret shows that the formulation of vaccine containing either 7.5 µg or 15 µg of A/NIBRG-14 (H5N1) antigen per dose is both immunogenic and efficacious in reducing the viral  load  and  viral  shedding.  The  various  disease  markers  indicate  the  protective  effects  of vaccination with the formulation of the vaccine used. Immunogenicity  studies  in  young  and  old  mice  showed  that  immunisation  with  both  adjuvanted candidate  vaccine  and  non-adjuvanted  vaccine,  elicited  a  dose-related  antigen-specific  antibody response, even in mice seropositive at baseline. The presence of MF59 adjuvant resulted in a more immunogenic and therefore more efficacious product, in both young and old mice. Efficacy The  development  of  Focetria  is  based  on  the  experience  with  Fluad,  Novartis'  seasonal,  trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine. The MF59C.1 adjuvant is an oil- in- water emulsion, composed mainly of squalene. Focetria is manufactured with the same process and has the same adjuvant used for Fluad. Initial dose finding studies with an adjuvanted candidate vaccine containing mock-up strains H5N3 or H9N2 showed that a dose as low as 3.75 µg HA elicits adequate seroprotection in healthy adults. All three immunogenicity criteria defined by CHMP (CPMP/BWP/214/96) were fulfilled. However these results are based on a very small number of individuals (10-12 individuals per vaccine group). The  studies  confirm  that  adjuvant  MF59C.1  significantly  enhances  specific  immune  response  to influenza vaccines. In fact, this result is consistent across studies and tests used (HI, MN, SRH). It is also evident that two doses of candidate vaccine are necessary to induce a proper immune response. Subsequently, the dossier was shifted to a H5N1 mock-up file and further data were provided for this vaccine in order to establish efficacy Focetria. Immunogenicity of the mock-up strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) was determined in 458 subjects (297 adults; 161 elderly) by using by single radial haemolysis (SRH) and haemagglutination inhibition assay. In addition to SRH, an analysis of serum samples assayed by microneutralisation assay (MN) has been repeated on the full immunogenicity population (301 adults; 163 elderly). Subjects received 2 doses of Focetria containing 7.5 µg or 15 µg influenza antigen (HA).

For 7.5 µg and 15 µg HA group, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor in the adult and the elderly population were in compliance with CHMP requirements (CPMP/BWP/214/96). In both age groups, the GMTs induced by Focetria (7.5 µg HA) were non-inferior to the GMTs induced by the vaccine  containing  15  µg  HA.  Seroprotection  rates  in  adults  and  elderly  calculated  using  the  SRH assay met the set CHMP requirements. These results were sustained also by the microneutralisation assay.

Paediatric  studies  were  not  included  in  the  clinical  development  program.  These  studies  are  not required according CPMP/VEG/4717/03 at this time point. Recommendations for immunisation of the paediatric population are left to national official recommendations during the pandemic period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From an epidemiological point of view it is very unlikely that influenza strain A/Vietnam /1194/2004 would be the next pandemic strain, since the virus will either undergo further antigenic drift or the pandemic will be caused by another subtype of influenza vaccines (antigenic shift). Antigenic shift and drift are natural phenomena related to all influenza viruses. For example, additional mutations will be  required  to  enable  the  virus  to  transmit  effectively  from  human  to  human.  It  is  highly  unlikely, therefore,  that  Focetria  containing  the  strain  derived  from  A/Vietnam  /1194/2004  will  provide protection when using during a pandemic. In line with the developed core dossier concept, a variation would  have  to  be  submitted  to  introduce  the  WHO/EU  recommended  strain  prepared  from  the influenza virus causing the pandemic, prior to use of Focetria in a pandemic. This will assure that the vaccine will induce a satisfactory immune response to the pandemic influenza virus.

Medicinal product no longer authorised For the same scientific reasons, and in absence of any studies demonstrating that antibodies elicited by Focetria  containing  the  strain  derived  from  A/Vietnam  /1194/2004  will  react  with  other  H5N1 subtypes (in the neutralising antibody assay), this vaccine has not been demonstrated to have a role in use in the prepandemic period. No predictions can be made of the immunogenicity of Focetria against strains other than A/Viet Nam/1194/2004. Safety The observed rate of adverse events was lower than expected. The most frequently experienced local reaction in adults as well as in elderly was pain. The most frequently experienced systemic reactions in adults were myalgia and headache, followed by chills, malaise, arthralgia and fatigue. In elderly the most frequently experienced systemic reactions were myalgia, headache and arthralgia followed by chills, malaise, and fatigue. Local and systemic reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. The safety profile of the vaccine, as it is revealed by the clinical studies performed, is satisfactory, especially in a pandemic situation. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. · User consultation The applicant  performed  readability  testing  ('user  consultation')  and  a  satisfactory  report  has  been provided. The applicant performed a readability testing on the English version of the package leaflet (PL) by a structured  questionnaire.  The  sample  was  composed  of  20  subjects  (19/20  were  female):  ten  adults were recruited in round 1 and ten in round 2. The composition of the target group was acceptable. They were asked 14 questions on the content of PL and 3 questions to obtain their feedback on the general layout and appearance of the PL. The PL was up-dated with recommended changes after round 1. The questionnaire was sufficient with regards to the number of questions and the different aspect of the PL and the evaluation and question rating system was acceptable. In general, there were no difficulties for the respondents to find and understand different parts of the PL.

After  2  rounds  the  PL  was  considered  to  meet  the  criteria  for  readability  testing  as  set  out  in  the MHRA's Guidance on the User Testing of Patient Information Leaflets (June 2005).

In conclusion, the main objectives of the user consultation have been achieved, namely to assess the readability  of  the  PL,  to  identify  problems  regarding  comprehensibility  and  usefulness  of  the information and to describe possible changes to the PL to improve readability.

## Risk-benefit assessment

An  influenza  pandemic  is  a  global  outbreak  of  influenza  disease  that  occurs  when  a  new  type  A influenza strain emerges in the human population, causes serious illness, and then spreads easily from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

person  to  person  worldwide.  Though  there  may  be  no  vaccines  available  yet  at  the  beginning  of  a pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines are regarded as an important tool to counteract this severe threat  to  public  health,  allowing  protection  from  (severe)  disease  or  death.  The  formulation  of  a pandemic vaccine has to take into account that, in contrast to seasonal influenza, all people will be immunologically naïve for the circulating pandemic strain. This naivety is expected to make it more difficult to elicit a protecting immune response in vaccinees. However, it may deserve some further discussions, what serological status and background immunity against new haemagglutinins may be characteristic for a naïve population.

With  this  background  the  applicant  developed  Focetria,  a  monovalent,  inactivated  and  adjuvanted vaccine,  containing  7.5µg  haemagglutinin  (HA)  (virus  surface  antigen)  from  the  influenza  strain A/Vietnam /1194/2004 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose. The evaluation of the clinical efficacy was mainly based on the quantification of SRH and HI titres in vaccinees and subsequent analysis of the derived parameters seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate and factor, what generally is accepted as surrogate markers for efficacy of influenza vaccines.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Two dose ranging studies evaluating safety and immunogenicity in young adults have been performed with  adjuvanted  candidate  vaccines  with  influenza  pandemic  reference  virus  strains  (H5N3  and H9N2). Subsequently, the dossier was shifted to a H5N1 mock-up file and further data were provided for this vaccine in order to establish efficacy of the mock-up vaccine. Clinical  trials  on  protective  efficacy  for  the  mock-up  vaccine  cannot  be  performed.  Therefore  a detailed  characterisation  of  the  immunological  response  to  the  mock-up  vaccines  is  required.  The vaccine  virus  strains  chosen  for  these  studies  should  allow  simulating  a  situation  where  the  target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. The criteria for these studies are laid down the Guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. All three CHMP criteria are fulfilled by vaccines containing 7.5 µg haemagglutinin (HA) from the influenza strain A/Vietnam /1194/2004 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose. The safety profile of the mock-up vaccine is acceptable. In the submitted core pandemic dossier, the applicant reported as required according CPMP/VEG/4717/03, the findings from non-clinical tests and clinical trials using the mock-up strain derived from the avian influenza strain A/Vietnam /1194/2004 (H5N1). From an epidemiological point of view it is very unlikely that influenza strain A/Vietnam /1194/2004 would be the next pandemic strain, since will either undergo further antigenic drift or the pandemic will  be  caused  by  another  subtype  of  influenza  vaccines  (antigenic  shift).  Thus  in  the  event  of  a pandemic,  the  applicant  would  have  to  file  a  variation  to  the  existing  marketing  authorisation  to introduce the exact matching pandemic vaccine strain. During the pandemic, the applicant will collect safety and effectiveness data of the pandemic vaccine and submit this information to the CHMP for evaluation (specific obligation). A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. During  the  pandemic,  the  applicant  will  conduct  a  prospective  cohort  study  as  identified  in  the pharmacovigilance plan (specific obligation). Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Focetria  for  the  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially declared pandemic situation was favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

The  CHMP  recommends  granting  this  marketing  authorisation  for  Focetria  under  exceptional circumstances,  because  in  the  present  stage  of  knowledge  comprehensive  scientific  information required for the vaccine containing the actual pandemic strain cannot be gathered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  missing  scientific  information  relates  to  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  the  pandemic  vaccine. These data can only be obtained once the actual strain causing the pandemic is included in the vaccine and  during  actual  use  of  the  vaccine.  Therefore,  the  company  has  agreed  the  following  specific obligations:

- -To collect,  during  the  pandemic,  clinical  safety  and  effectiveness  data  of  the  pandemic vaccine and submit this information to the CHMP for evaluation.
- -To  conduct,  during  the  pandemic,  a  prospective  cohort  study  as  identified  in  the Pharmacovigilance plan.
