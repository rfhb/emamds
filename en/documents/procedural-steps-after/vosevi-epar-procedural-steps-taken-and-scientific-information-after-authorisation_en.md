The safety of sofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or velpatasvir has been studied in 154 patients with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. The CHMP considered that safety data on the use of the sofosbuvir-based products in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < |

The data available for interactions with carbamazepine indicated that sofosbuvir levels were reduced by 48%, but the confidence interval included the 50% value. Therefore, the CHMP considered that a cautionary approach should be taken and contraindication concerning co-administration of carbamazepine should be retained.

The median time to re-treatment was 414 days. Of the 31 patients enrolled, 74% were male, 81% were white, 71% had a baseline body mass index < 30 kg/m2, 48% had compensated cirrhosis, 58% had previously received sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, and 42% had previously received sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Most subjects had genotype 1 (61%), 1a (48%), 1b 13% or genotype 3 (26%) HCV infection. The overall sustained virologic response rate at 12 weeks was 100%. |
