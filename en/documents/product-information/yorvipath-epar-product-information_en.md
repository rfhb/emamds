## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection (injection)

Clear and colourless with a pH of 3.7 - 4.3.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Yorvipath is a parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and monitored by physicians or qualified healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with hypoparathyroidism.

## Posology

Dose recommendations of Yorvipath refer to micrograms of PTH(1-34). The dose should be individualised based on serum calcium. The optimal dose after titration is the minimum dose required to prevent hypocalcaemia. This is the dose that maintains serum calcium within the normal range without the need for active forms of vitamin D or calcium supplementation beyond recommended nutritional supplementation for the general population (generally less than 600 mg per day). Doses of active forms of vitamin D and calcium supplements will need to be adjusted prior to initiating and during treatment with Yorvipath based on serum calcium value (see section 4.4).

Patients receiving the maximum Yorvipath dose of 60 mcg per day who experience ongoing hypocalcaemia may require co-administration of therapeutic calcium and/or active forms of vitamin D.

## Before initiation of Yorvipath

Serum 25(OH) vitamin D should be within the normal range and serum calcium should be stable within or slightly below the normal range (1.95 - 2.64 mmol/L [7.8 - 10.6 mg/dL]) on at least 1 laboratory value within two weeks prior to first dose of treatment.

## Initiation of Yorvipath

The recommended starting dose is 18 mcg once daily with dose adjustments in 3 mcg increments thereafter every 7 days (see figure 1). The dose range is 6 to 60 mcg per day.

When initiating treatment with Yorvipath, the dose of active vitamin D or calcium supplements should be adjusted:

- If taking active vitamin D:
- o If serum calcium is ≥ 2.07 mmol/L [≥ 8.3 mg/dL], active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) should be discontinued on the same day as the first dose of Yorvipath. Doses of calcium supplements should be maintained.
- o If serum calcium is &lt; 2.07 mmol/L [&lt; 8.3 mg/dL], active vitamin D should be reduced by ≥ 50% on the same day as the first dose of Yorvipath. Doses of calcium supplements should be maintained.
- If not taking active vitamin D:
- o Calcium supplements should be decreased by at least 1 500 mg on the same day as the first dose of Yorvipath. If taking elemental calcium doses ≤ 1 500 mg per day, calcium supplements should be discontinued entirely.
- If calcium supplements are indicated to meet dietary requirements, continuing dietary calcium supplements at doses ≤ 600 mg per day may be considered instead of discontinuing entirely.

## Dose adjustment and maintenance of Yorvipath

Serum calcium concentration must be monitored during titration (see section 4.4). Yorvipath dose may be increased in increments of 3 mcg if at least 7 days have elapsed since a prior dose change (see figure 1). The dose must not be increased more often than every 7 days. Yorvipath may be reduced in increments of 3 mcg no more often than every 3 days in response to hypercalcaemia (see figure 1).

Serum calcium should be measured 7 days after the first dose and figure 1 should be followed for appropriate Yorvipath, active vitamin D, and calcium supplement dosing. After any subsequent dose change in Yorvipath, active vitamin D, or calcium supplements, serum calcium should be measured

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

within 7 to 14 days and patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Yorvipath, active vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements should be adjusted as per figure 1. Dose adjustments of Yorvipath, active vitamin D, and calcium supplements should be made on the same day.

The maintenance dose should be the dose that achieves serum calcium within the normal range, without the need for active vitamin D or therapeutic doses of calcium. Optionally, calcium supplementation sufficient to meet dietary requirements (≤ 600 mg per day) may be continued. Serum calcium and 25(OH) vitamin D should be measured as per standard of care when a maintenance dose is achieved. 25(OH) vitamin D (non-active vitamin D) supplementation may be needed to reach normal serum levels.

## Serum calcium low (&lt; 2.07 mmol/L [&lt; 8.3 mg/dL]):

<!-- image -->

## Serum calcium normal (≥ 2.07 to ≤ 2.64 mmol/L [≥ 8.3 to ≤ 10.6 mg/dL]):

<!-- image -->

## Serum calcium high (≥ 2.65 to &lt; 3.00 mmol/L [≥ 10.7 to &lt; 12.0 mg/dL]):

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serum calcium very high (≥ 3.00 mmol/L [≥ 12 mg/dL]):

Treatment should be withheld for 2 to 3 days and then serum calcium should be rechecked. If subsequent serum calcium is &lt; 3.00 mmol/L [&lt; 12 mg/dL], titration of Yorvipath, active vitamin D, and calcium supplements should be resumed as per the applicable section of figure 1 using the most recent serum calcium value obtained. If serum calcium remains ≥ 3.00 mmol/L [≥ 12 mg/dL], Yorvipath should be withheld for an additional 2 to 3 days and then serum calcium should be rechecked. See section 4.4 for more information on hypercalcaemia.

## Missed dose

If a dose is missed by less than 12 hours, it should be administered as soon as possible. If a dose is missed by more than 12 hours, it should be skipped and the next dose should be administered as scheduled.

## Interruption or discontinuation of Yorvipath

Interruption of daily administration should be avoided to minimise serum PTH fluctuations. Interruption or discontinuation of treatment can result in hypocalcaemia. When interrupting or discontinuing treatment for 3 or more consecutive doses, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia and consider to measure serum calcium. If indicated, treatment with calcium supplements and active vitamin D should be resumed. Treatment at the prescribed dose should be resumed as soon as possible after an interruption. When resuming treatment after an interruption, serum calcium should be measured and doses of Yorvipath, active vitamin D, and calcium supplements should be adjusted as per figure 1.

## Special populations

## Elderly

Dose adjustment is not required based on age (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Yorvipath has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

Dose adjustment is not required in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min. Serum calcium levels should be measured more frequently when used in patients with eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min (see section 4.4). Yorvipath has not been studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism and severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min) (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Yorvipath in children less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Yorvipath must be administered as a subcutaneous injection to the abdomen or front of the thigh. The injection site should be rotated daily between four possible sites; abdomen (left or right) and front of the thigh (left or right).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Doses &gt; 30 mcg per day (sequential injections)

All doses &gt; 30 mcg per day should be administered as two single doses injected sequentially at different injection sites (table 1). It is recommended to use a different Yorvipath pen for the second daily injection, even if the two pens have the same-coloured push button (same strength).

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- -Patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypercalcaemia

Serious events of hypercalcaemia have been reported with Yorvipath (see section 4.8). The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose. During treatment, serum calcium should be measured (see section 4.2) and patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia. If severe hypercalcaemia occurs, treatment should be as per clinical guidelines and dose adjustment of Yorvipath should be considered (see section 4.2).

## Hypocalcaemia

Serious events of hypocalcaemia have been reported with Yorvipath (see section 4.8). The risk is highest when treatment is abruptly discontinued but may occur at any time. During treatment, serum calcium should be measured and patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia. If severe hypocalcaemia occurs, treatment should be as per clinical guidelines, dose adjustment of Yorvipath should be considered, and dose adjustment of standing or as needed doses of active vitamin D and/or calcium supplements should be considered (see section 4.2).

## Concomitant use with cardiac glycosides

Hypercalcaemia of any cause may predispose to digitalis toxicity. In patients using Yorvipath concomitantly with cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin), serum calcium and cardiac glycoside levels should be monitored and patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Severe renal or hepatic disease

No studies have been performed in patients with severe renal impairment and severe hepatic impairment. Use with caution in these patient populations. Patients with eGFR of &lt; 45 mL/min may be more susceptible for hypercalcaemic reactions and transient eGFR decrease, particularly when initiating treatment. If treatment is initiated in these patients, it is recommended to closely monitor serum calcium levels.

## Use in patients at increased risk of osteosarcoma

Yorvipath has not been studied in and should be used with caution in patients;

- -with skeletal malignancies and bone metastases
- -who are receiving or who have received radiation therapy to the skeleton
- -with unexplained elevations of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
- -with metabolic bone diseases who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma (e.g., Paget's disease of the bone)

## Use in patients with osteoporosis

Screening for and monitoring of osteoporosis should be consistent with local clinical practice for any patient at increased risk of fragility fractures (see section 4.8).

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin) have a narrow therapeutic index and are affected by calcium. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when taking Yorvipath and cardiac glycosides.

Other medicinal products can exert effects on serum calcium and may alter the therapeutic response to Yorvipath, including but not limited to bisphosphonates, denosumab, romosozumab, thiazide and loop diuretics, systemic corticosteroids, and lithium. Patients should be monitored for changes in serum calcium when treated concomitantly with these medicinal products.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of Yorvipath in pregnant females. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). However, a risk to the pregnant female or developing foetus cannot be excluded. A decision to initiate or discontinue treatment with Yorvipath during pregnancy should take into account the possible risks versus the benefits for the pregnant female. It is recommended to closely monitor maternal serum calcium levels in pregnant females with hypoparathyroidism, including if treated with Yorvipath.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether palopegteriparatide is excreted in human milk. As palopegteriparatide is not orally absorbed, it is unlikely to adversely affect the breast-fed child. A decision to discontinue breast-feeding or Yorvipath therapy should take into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and the benefit of therapy for the female. It is recommended to closely monitor maternal serum calcium levels if breast-feeding with hypoparathyroidism, including if treated with Yorvipath.

## Fertility

No studies have been performed on the effects of palopegteriparatide on human fertility. Data from animal studies do not indicate that administration of palopegteriparatide impairs fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Yorvipath has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness, presyncope, syncope and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in some patients. These patients should refrain from driving or the use of machines until symptoms have subsided.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials with palopegteriparatide were injection site reactions (21.6%), headache (18.7%), and paraesthesia (13.7%). The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials was hypercalcaemia (1.40%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 2 presents the adverse reactions for palopegteriparatide-treated patients identified in all phase 2 and phase 3 placebo-controlled studies within the MedDRA system organ class. The adverse reactions listed in the table below are presented by system organ class and frequency categories, defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), and frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

a For these adverse reactions, the first occurrence was almost exclusively within the first 3 months of treatment (titration period).

b Injection site reactions include injection site reaction, injection site erythema, injection site bruising, injection site pain, injection site haemorrhage, injection site rash, and injection site swelling.

c Dizziness includes dizziness and dizziness postural.

d  Vasodilatory symptoms include dizziness postural, headache, palpitations, Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, orthostatic hypotension, Blood pressure orthostatic decreased and syncope. Vasodilatory symptoms (as identified in clinical trials) occurred more frequently in the first 3 months of treatment and constituted a subset of total events reported as adverse reactions. A total of 3 events (in 2 patients) considered related to palopegteriparatide occurred within the first 3 months in TCP-304: dizziness postural (n=1), and headache and palpitations (n=1).

e These signs and symptoms are potentially associated with hypercalcaemia, as observed in clinical trials.

f These signs and symptoms are potentially associated with hypocalcaemia, as observed in clinical trials.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hypercalcaemia

Serious events of hypercalcaemia have been reported with Yorvipath. The incidence of hypercalcemia was greater in patients treated with Yorvipath compared to placebo. During the blinded period, symptomatic hypercalcemia was reported in 8.6% of patients treated with Yorvipath, and all occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of Yorvipath.

## Immunogenicity

Patients may develop antibodies to palopegteriparatide. The proportion of patients testing positive for binding antibodies at any time during treatment was low, with 0.7% having low titre, non-neutralising antibodies towards PTH and 5% having low titre treatment-emergent antibodies against PEG. In 2.2% of the palopegteriparatide-treated patients with pre-existing PEG antibodies, a transient impact on PK (increased clearance of total PTH, mPEG and decreased PTH concentrations) with decreasing serum calcium was observed. However, therapeutic effectiveness was maintained by appropriate dose adjustment of palopegteriparatide according to the trial titration algorithm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Injection site reactions

Injection site reactions were the most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (median onset was 2.5 days; incidence of 21.6%). The most common injection site reactions were localised erythema (all &lt; 5 cm with the majority 0 to &lt; 2 cm) and were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in severity with median duration of 72 hours. All injection site reactions resolved without treatment; none were serious or led to discontinuation.

## Vasodilatory symptoms

Vasodilatory symptoms have been reported with Yorvipath. These symptoms are usually transient and resolved without treatment; none were serious or led to discontinuation. If symptoms occur, dosing at bedtime while reclining is recommended.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, the patient should be carefully monitored by a medical professional.

Overdose can cause hypercalcaemia, the manifestations of which may include dehydration, heart palpitations, ECG changes, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle weakness, and confusion. Severe hypercalcaemia may require medical care and careful monitoring (see section 4.4).

One instance of accidental overdose of approximately 3-fold the prescribed dose lasting more than 7 consecutive days resulted in serum calcium as high as 16.1 mg/dL, the patient was symptomatic and required medical intervention. After withholding palopegteriparatide, calcium, and active vitamin D, the patient recovered and restarted on the correct dose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: H05AA05

## Mechanism of action

Endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the parathyroid glands as a polypeptide of 84 amino acids. PTH exerts its action via cell-surface parathyroid hormone receptors, for example, expressed in bone, kidney and nerve tissue. Activation of PTH1R stimulates bone turnover, increases renal calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion and facilitates synthesis of active vitamin D.

Palopegteriparatide is a prodrug, consisting of PTH(1-34) conjugated to a methoxypolyethylene glycol carrier (mPEG) via a proprietary TransCon Linker. PTH(1-34) and its main metabolite, PTH(1-33), have similar affinity to and activation of PTH1R as endogenous PTH. At physiological conditions, PTH is cleaved from palopegteriparatide in a controlled manner to provide a continuous systemic exposure of active PTH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Study in patients with established hypoparathyroidism

The pivotal phase 3 PaTHway clinical trial (TCP-304) assessed the efficacy and safety of Yorvipath as PTH replacement therapy for adults with hypoparathyroidism. The 26-week double -blind, placebo-controlled period of the clinical trial included patients randomised (3:1) to Yorvipath at a starting dose of 18 micrograms/day or placebo, co-administered with conventional therapy (calcium supplement and active vitamin D). Randomisation was stratified by aetiology of hypoparathyroidism (i.e., postsurgical vs. all other causes). Study treatment (palopegteriparatide or placebo) and conventional therapy were subsequently titrated according to a dosing algorithm guided by albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels.

Patients' mean age at recruitment was 49 years (19 to 78 years of age; 12% were ≥ 65 years old), and the majority of patients were female (78%) and Caucasian (93%). Eighty-five percent (85%) of patients had hypoparathyroidism acquired from neck surgery. Of the patients with other aetiologies of hypoparathyroidism, 7 (8.5%) patients had idiopathic disease, 2 had autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1), 1 had autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia type 1 (ADH1, CaSR mutation), 1 had DiGeorge Syndrome, and 1 had hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome (GATA3 mutation).

Prior to randomisation, all patients underwent an approximate 4-week screening period in which calcium and active vitamin D supplements were adjusted to achieve an albumin-adjusted serum calcium concentration between 1.95 to 2.64 mmol/L (7.8 to 10.6 mg/dL), a magnesium concentration ≥ 0.53 mmol/L (≥ 1.3 mg/dL) and below the upper reference range of normal, and a 25(OH) vitamin D concentration between 50 to 200 nmol/L (20 to 80 ng/mL). For conventional therapy, patients were treated with mean baseline doses of calcium (elemental) of 1 839 mg/day. Mean baseline doses of active vitamin D were 0.75 micrograms/day in calcitriol-treated patients (n=70), and 2.3 micrograms/day in alfacalcidol-treated patients (n=12). Baseline mean albumin-adjusted serum calcium and mean 24-hour urine calcium were similar in both treatment groups: mean serum calcium was 2.2 mmol/L (8.8 mg/dL) and 2.15 mmol/L (8.6 mg/dL) and mean 24-hour urine calcium was 392 mg/day and 329 mg/day, for Yorvipath and placebo, respectively.

## Primary endpoint

The composite primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients at week 26 who achieved: serum calcium levels in the normal range (2.07 to 2.64 mmol/L [8.3 to 10.6 mg/dL]), independence from conventional therapy defined as requiring no active vitamin D and ≤ 600 mg/day of calcium supplementation, and no increase in prescribed study treatment within 4 weeks prior to week 26. Key secondary endpoints included a subset of Hypoparathyroidism Patient Experience Scale (HPES) domain scores and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) subscale scores.

The number of patients meeting the composite primary endpoint compared with the placebo group and each component of the primary endpoint at week 26 is presented in table 3.

## Secondary endpoints

## Conventional therapy intake: calcium and active vitamin D doses

In the phase 3 PaTHway trial, at week 26, 93% (57/61) of patients in the Yorvipath group were able to discontinue conventional therapy (i.e., discontinue active vitamin D and therapeutic doses of calcium). All patients in the Yorvipath group discontinued active vitamin D by week 8 and had sustained reduction in therapeutic doses of calcium. There was a significant reduction in conventional therapy intake in the Yorvipath group from baseline to week 26 compared with placebo: active vitamin D (nominal p-value &lt; 0.0001), calcium dose (nominal p-value = 0.0003), and daily pill burden (nominal p-value &lt; 0.0001) (table 4).

## Serum biochemistries

Mean serum calcium initially increased and stayed within the normal range in palopegteriparatidetreated patients (figure 2). In placebo patients, serum calcium levels decreased slightly, falling below normal range at week 2 (mean observed value: 2.06 mmol/L) and at week 26 (mean observed value: 2.06 mmol/L). The LS mean treatment difference between Yorvipath and placebo was 0.17 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.100, 0.247; nominal p &lt; 0.0001) at week 26.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 2 : Serum calcium (mean ± SE) by visit - blinded period (ITT population)

<!-- image -->

Mean serum phosphate levels for palopegteriparatide-treated patients were in the normal range at baseline and fell within the normal range through week 26 (Mean change from baseline to week 26 was -0.13 mmol/L). Mean serum calcium x phosphate product decreased in patients treated with Yorvipath and remained stable within the normal range through week 26.

## 24-hour urine calcium excretion

Yorvipath therapy normalised mean 24-hour urine calcium excretion and showed greater reduction in 24-hour urine calcium versus placebo.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Yorvipath in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypoparathyroidism, as per paediatric investigation plan (PIP) decision, for the indication of treatment of hypoparathyroidism.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following daily subcutaneous administration, palopegteriparatide releases PTH via autocleavage of the TransCon Linker with first-order kinetics, resulting in continuous exposure over 24 hours within the estimated normal range (figure 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 3: Mean released PTH* following subcutaneous administration of palopegteriparatide at steady state in patients with hypoparathyroidism

<!-- image -->

The estimated normal range for PTH(1-34) is approximately 4 to 26 pg/mL. This is calculated based on PTH(1-34) constituting 40% of the molecular weight of PTH(1-84)** and the normal range (10 to 65 pg/mL) for PTH(1-84).

* Mean palopegteriparatide dose (range): 22.3 (12-33) mcg PTH(1-34)/day, n=7, released PTH: sum of PTH(1-34) and PTH(1-33).
- ** PTH(1-84) = endogenous parathyroid hormone.

In patients with hypoparathyroidism administered palopegteriparatide corresponding to 18 mcg of PTH(1-34)/day, the predicted maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (CV%) of palopegteriparatide was 5.18 ng/mL (36%) and the predicted Cmax (CV%) for released PTH was 6.9 pg/mL (22%) with a median time to reach maximum concentrations (Tmax) of 4 hours. The predicted exposure over the 24-hour dosing interval (area under the curve, AUC) (CV%) for released PTH was 150 pg*h/mL (22%).

Following multiple subcutaneous doses of palopegteriparatide in the range of 12 to 24 mcg PTH(1-34)/day, the palopegteriparatide and released PTH concentrations increased in a dose-proportional manner reaching steady-state within approximately 10 and 7 days, respectively. The peak-to-trough ratio was low, approximately 1.1 and 1.5 over 24 hours at steady state for palopegteriparatide and released PTH, respectively. Palopegteriparatide accumulated after multiple dosing by up to 18-fold for AUC.

## Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution (CV%) of palopegteriparatide is estimated to 4.8 L (50%) and to 8.7 L (18%) for released PTH.

## Biotransformation

PTH released from palopegteriparatide is composed of PTH(1-34) and the metabolite PTH(1-33). PTH is renally metabolised and cleared.

## Elimination

In healthy adults, the clearance (CV%) of palopegteriparatide at steady state is estimated to be 0.58 L/day (52%) with a predicted half-life of 70 hours. The apparent half-life of PTH released from palopegteriparatide is approximately 60 hours. In the liver, most of the PTH is cleaved by cathepsins. In the kidney, a small amount of PTH binds to PTH1R, but most is excreted by glomerular filtration.

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship

In a pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic sub-study in hypoparathyroid patients, daily subcutaneous administration of palopegteriparatide (mean dose (range): 22.3 (12-33) mcg PTH(1-34)/day) increased serum calcium levels to within the normal range (see figure 4). The increase in serum calcium levels

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occurred in a dose-related manner, supporting the ability to titrate palopegteriparatide according to measured serum calcium values in the individual patient.

Figure 4: Mean albumin-adjusted serum calcium concentrations following subcutaneous administration of palopegteriparatide at steady state in patients with hypoparathyroidism

<!-- image -->

The normal range for albumin-adjusted serum calcium is 2.07 to 2.64 mmol/L (8.3 to 10.6 mg/dL) as denoted by the grey shading. Mean palopegteriparatide dose (range): 22.3 (12-33) mcg PTH(1-34)/day, n=7.

## Special populations

The pharmacokinetics of released PTH was not influenced by sex or body weight. The data for race and ethnicity did not show any trends indicating differences, but the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions.

Elderly

The pharmacokinetics of released PTH was not influenced by age (19 to 76 years old).

## Renal impairment

Yorvipath has been administered to patients with hypoparathyroidism with an eGFR of ≥ 30 mL/min in long-term clinical trials without the need for dose adjustment beyond the trial titration algorithm. No clinical trials were conducted in patients with hypoparathyroidism with severe renal impairment (&lt; 30 mL/min) or on dialysis. In a trial where Yorvipath was administered as a single dose to non-hypoparathyroid subjects with renal impairment, palopegteriparatide exposure and resulting serum calcium levels were similar in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment as compared to subjects without renal impairment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No special hazard for humans were revealed in the conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, and local tolerance conducted with palopegteriparatide.

At the highest dose levels in all animal species employed, repeated dosing resulted in adverse persistent hypercalcemia, which in some studies led to premature death/euthanasia, clinical signs, body weight loss and/or soft tissue mineralisation observed mainly in the kidneys. These findings are considered results of persistent exaggerated PTH pharmacology and of no relevance in a clinical setting where dose adjustments are performed to ensure normalised serum calcium.

In accordance with the expected pharmacological effects, repeated daily administration of palopegteriparatide increased bone turnover in rats. At low dose levels (2-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on exposure to released PTH by AUC) in rats, the increased bone turnover induced overall net catabolic bone effects. At high dose levels (5-fold the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by AUC) in rats, the increased bone turnover resulted in a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

net anabolic bone effect. Physeal dysplasia was observed at the highest dose level (9-fold the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by AUC) in rats. These effects are of no relevance in a clinical setting where Yorvipath doses are individually adjusted.

There were no cardiovascular findings in monkeys up to and including the highest dose tested in single- (3-fold the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by Cmax) or repeat-dose studies (0.98fold the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by Cmax).

Increased occurrence of osteosarcomas has been observed in carcinogenicity studies with short-lived PTH analogues in rats, but there is no evidence of increased risk of osteosarcoma in patients treated with short-lived PTH analogues. No carcinogenicity study has been conducted with palopegteriparatide.

In animal reproduction studies, administration of palopegteriparatide to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in no evidence of embryo-lethality, foetotoxicity or dysmorphogenesis up to and including the highest doses tested (8- and 7-fold, respectively, the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by AUC). Exaggerated PTH pharmacological effects were observed at the highest doses tested in the pregnant rats and rabbits (increased serum calcium levels, decreased body weight, decreased food consumption and/or clinical signs). The exposures at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity were 2- and 3- fold the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by AUC in pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively.

Palopegteriparatide did not adversely affect pre- and post-natal development in offspring from pregnant and lactating rats up to and including the highest dose tested (4-fold the MRHD, based on exposure to released PTH by Cmax).

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Yorvipath is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Yorvipath
3. How to use Yorvipath
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Yorvipath
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Yorvipath is and what it is used for

Yorvipath contains the active substance palopegteriparatide. Palopegteriparatide is changed into teriparatide, also called parathyroid hormone (PTH), in the body. PTH naturally occurs in the body and is needed to keep the amount of calcium and phosphate in your body within the normal range.

Yorvipath is used to treat chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults. In people with hypoparathyroidism, the body produces no or too little PTH. Because of this, they cannot keep the levels of calcium and phosphate within a normal range, and this leads to the symptoms of the condition, such as muscle spasms, twitching, and tingling in your fingertips, toes and lips. Yorvipath replaces the missing PTH to help control the levels of calcium and phosphate.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Yorvipath

## Do not use Yorvipath

- if you are allergic to palopegteriparatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- if you have pseudohypoparathyroidism, a condition in which the body does not adequately respond to the parathyroid hormone produced by the body

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Yorvipath.

If you are treated with Yorvipath, you may have side effects related to low or high levels of calcium in your blood (see section 4 for more information). These effects are more likely to occur when starting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment or when changing the dose. Your doctor will check your calcium levels (see 'Tests and checks' in section 3). You may be given medicines to treat or help prevent these side effects, or your doctor may change your dose.

High levels of calcium in your blood can cause problems if you take medicines that contain cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin) (see 'Other medicines and Yorvipath'). Your doctor will check your calcium (see 'Tests and checks' in section 3) and glycoside levels and monitor you for signs and symptoms.

If you take Yorvipath and have severe kidney or liver impairment, your doctor will check your calcium more often (see 'Tests and checks' in section 3).

Tell your doctor if you are at higher risk of a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma. This is especially important:

- if you are having or have had radiation therapy to the skeleton
- if you have cancer of the bones or other cancer that has spread to your bones
- if you have a bone disease that increases your risk of developing osteosarcoma (for instance, if you have Paget's disease)
- if a blood test shows that you have unexplained increases in bone alkaline phosphatase

If you are at risk for bone fractures, your doctor will check you for osteoporosis.

## Children and adolescents

Yorvipath should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years old because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Yorvipath

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any of the following:

- Heart medicines that contain cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin)
- Medicines used to treat osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, or romosozumab
- Medicines that can affect calcium levels in your blood, such as diuretics ('water tablets', such as hydrochloride thiazide or furosemide), systemic corticosteroids (medicines used to treat inflammation), and lithium (medicine used to treat mood disorders)

Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of Yorvipath.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

## Pregnancy

If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor. If you become pregnant during treatment, talk to your doctor immediately.

There is limited information on the safety of Yorvipath in pregnant women. Your doctor will decide whether you should be treated with Yorvipath during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant your doctor may check your calcium levels.

## Breast-feeding

If you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before using Yorvipath. Your doctor will decide whether you should be treated with Yorvipath during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, your doctor may check your calcium levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

It is not known if Yorvipath has effects on fertility.

## Driving and using machines

Yorvipath has no or very minor effects on your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you experience dizziness, fainting or light-headedness when standing up, do not drive or use machines until you feel better.

## Yorvipath contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use Yorvipath

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

Yorvipath is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). This means that it is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin. The medicine should be injected into the belly (abdomen) or front of the thigh, and it is important to inject into a different area every day to help avoid damaging your skin. You can change between the left and right side of the belly and between the left and right front of the thigh.

Before you use the pen for the first time, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will show you how to inject Yorvipath. Additional help with using Yorvipath is provided in the instructions for use at the end of this leaflet.

You should always use the pen as described in the instructions for use.

## Starting, changing dose, and maintenance of Yorvipath

Your doctor will do a blood test to check your calcium and vitamin D levels before you start treatment with Yorvipath.

The recommended starting dose of Yorvipath is 18 micrograms once daily. Your doctor may advise you to gradually change your dose based on your response to the medicine, until you are using a dose that keeps the amount of calcium in your body within the normal range without the need for active vitamin D or therapeutic doses of calcium. Your doctor may tell you to keep taking daily calcium supplementation to meet dietary requirements. Your dose may be increased if at least 7 days have passed since your last change in dose. Your dose may be decreased no more often than every 3 days when the level of calcium in your body is too high.

## Tests and checks

Your doctor will check how you respond to the treatment:

- 7 days after starting treatment and
- 7 to 14 days after your dose is changed

This will be done using tests to measure the level of calcium in your blood or urine. Your doctor may tell you to change the amount of calcium or vitamin D you take (in any form, including foods rich in calcium).

## Directions for use

If your dose is above 30 micrograms per day:

- Administer two injections, one after the other, in separate injection sites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- It is recommended to use a different Yorvipath pen for the second daily injection, even if the two pens have the same-coloured push button (same strength).
- The table below explains how to administer your dose. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

## Recommended scheme for Yorvipath dosing above 30 micrograms/day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you forget to use Yorvipath

If you forget to inject a dose of Yorvipath, you can use the medicine as soon as you remember if less than 12 hours have passed. For example, if you normally inject the medicine at 8 o'clock in the morning, you can inject the missed dose before 8 o'clock in the evening.

If you only remember to use your dose within 12 hours of your next planned dose, skip the missed dose and continue injecting your next dose as you normally would. For example, if you remember at 10 o'clock in the evening that you forgot to inject Yorvipath, and your next dose is planned at 8 o'clock in the morning, you should not inject the missed dose.

Never take a second dose to make up for a missed dose.

## If you stop using Yorvipath

Do not stop using Yorvipath without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Yorvipath the levels of calcium in your blood may decrease and you may develop the symptoms described below (see section 4).

If you have any further questions on the use of Yorvipath, ask your doctor or nurse.

## Yorvipath 168 micrograms/0.56 mL palopegteriparatide For subcutaneous use

This instructions for use contains information on how to inject Yorvipath

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Important information you need to know before using your Yorvipath pen

Read and follow the package leaflet and these instructions for use carefully so that you inject Yorvipath the right way.

Make sure you have received training from your doctor or nurse before injecting. This is important to make sure that you get the correct treatment.

## For correct use

- By failing to follow these instructions, you may not get the right dose, and may therefore not get the full effect of your medicine.
- If you are blind or visually impaired or if you have lack of concentration, do not use your pen without help. Instead get help from a person who is trained to use the Yorvipath pen.
- Keep out of the sight and reach of children.
- The pen and needles are for single-patient use only.
- Do not share your pen or needles with other people. It might lead to infection (cross-contamination).
- Always throw away your pen after 14 days of use , even if it still has medicine left inside. This is important to make sure that you get the right effect of your medicine.
- Always use the needles that come with the Yorvipath pen for your injections.
- Remove the needle after every use. Do not store the pen with the needle on.
- Avoid bending or breaking off the pen needle.
- Do not change the injection angle after the needle has been inserted into the skin. Changing the angle can cause the needle to bend or break off. A bent or broken needle can remain stuck in the body or remain completely under the skin. If a broken needle remains stuck in the body or remains under the skin, seek medical help right away.
- Do not use needles if the needle cover or needle foil are damaged.

## Caring for your pen

- Handle your pen with care.
- Keep your pen dry.
- Use a moist cloth to clean your pen.
- Do not drop or knock your pen against hard surfaces. If you do, test the pen flow again (section 2, steps A - C) before next use.
- Do not apply extra force to your pen. It might be empty, damaged and no longer work properly.
- Do not attempt to repair a damaged pen yourself.
- Never use a damaged pen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Troubleshooting

## 1. How often must I test the pen flow?

You should only test the pen flow (section 2) the first time you use a new pen (or if you think it might be damaged) to not waste medicine. The test checks to make sure the medicine flows through the pen so that you get the right doses of medicine.

## 2. I do not see drops appear after I have tested the pen flow 5 times. What should I do?

If you see no drop on the needle tip after 5 attempts , it might be because there is no flow through the pen and needle.

Change the needle (see section 5, step 13) and test the pen flow again (see section 2, steps A - C). You can be sure the flow works correctly when you see the drop of medicine. If it still does not work discard the pen and contact your health care provider.

## 3. How do I know I have completed the injection?

Your injection is only completed after you have pressed the push button all the way in and the dose selector has rotated back to the '●' and you have kept the needle in the skin for

## 5 seconds .

## 4. Why do I have to keep holding the pen in the skin for 5 seconds?

Some medicine might flow back into the pen or flow backward from the injection site and be left on the skin. Holding the pen in the skin for 5 seconds helps to make sure that all the medicine has been injected.

## 5. I cannot dial the dose selector to the required dose. What should I do?

The pen does not allow a larger dose to be set than what is left in the pen. If your dose is larger than the amount of medicine left in the pen you will not be able to dial a full dose. You must throw away your pen and take the full dose of medicine with a new pen.

## 6. The red lock covers the needle before I start injection. What should I do?

Unscrew and throw away the needle in use (see section 5, step 13). Take a new needle from the box and start again from step 1. Every box contains an extra needle.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

Yorvipath 420 micrograms/1.4 mL For doses of 24, 27 or 30 micrograms only Solution for injection in pre-filled pen palopegteriparatide For subcutaneous use

This instructions for use contains information on how to inject Yorvipath

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Important information you need to know before using your Yorvipath pen

Read and follow the package leaflet and these instructions for use carefully so that you inject Yorvipath the right way.

Make sure you have received training from your doctor or nurse before injecting. This is important to make sure that you get the correct treatment.

## For correct use

- By failing to follow these instructions, you may not get the right dose, and may therefore not get the full effect of your medicine.
- If you are blind or visually impaired or if you have lack of concentration, do not use your pen without help. Instead get help from a person who is trained to use the Yorvipath pen.
- Keep out of the sight and reach of children.
- The pen and needles are for single-patient use only.
- Do not share your pen or needles with other people. It might lead to infection (cross-contamination).
- Always throw away your pen after 14 days of use , even if it still has medicine left inside. This is important to make sure that you get the right effect of your medicine.
- Always use the needles that come with the Yorvipath pen for your injections.
- Remove the needle after every use. Do not store the pen with the needle on.
- Avoid bending or breaking off the pen needle.
- Do not change the injection angle after the needle has been inserted into the skin. Changing the angle can cause the needle to bend or break off. A bent or broken needle can remain stuck in the body or remain completely under the skin. If a broken needle remains stuck in the body or remains under the skin, seek medical help right away.
- Do not use needles if the needle cover or needle foil are damaged.

## Special instructions for doses larger than 30 micrograms/day

If your dose is above 30 micrograms/day:

- Administer two injections, one after the other, in separate injection sites (see table with recommended scheme in section 3 of Package leaflet).
- It is recommended to use a different Yorvipath pen for the second daily injection, even if the two pens have the same-coloured push button (same strength).
- Follow the steps in the instructions for use for each injection.

## Caring for your pen

- Handle your pen with care.
- Keep your pen dry.
- Use a moist cloth to clean your pen.
- Do not drop or knock your pen against hard surfaces. If you do, test the pen flow again (section 2, steps A - C) before next use.
- Do not apply extra force to your pen. It might be empty, damaged and no longer work properly.
- Do not attempt to repair a damaged pen yourself.
- Never use a damaged pen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Troubleshooting

## 1. How often must I test the pen flow?

You should only test the pen flow (section 2) the first time you use a new pen (or if you think it might be damaged) to not waste medicine. The test checks to make sure the medicine flows through the pen so that you get the right doses of medicine.

## 2. I do not see drops appear after I have tested the pen flow 5 times. What should I do?

If you see no drop on the needle tip after 5 attempts , it might be because there is no flow through the pen and needle.

Change the needle (see section 5, step 13) and test the pen flow again (see section 2, steps A - C). You can be sure the flow works correctly when you see the drop of medicine. If it still does not work discard the pen and contact your health care provider.

## 3. How do I know I have completed the injection?

Your injection is only completed after you have pressed the push button all the way in and the dose selector has rotated back to the '●' and you have kept the needle in the skin for

## 5 seconds .

## 4. Why do I have to keep holding the pen in the skin for 5 seconds?

Some medicine might flow back into the pen or flow backward from the injection site and be left on the skin. Holding the pen in the skin for 5 seconds helps to make sure that all the medicine has been injected.

## 5. I cannot dial the dose selector to the required dose. What should I do?

The pen does not allow a larger dose to be set than what is left in the pen. If your dose is larger than the amount of medicine left in the pen you will not be able to dial a full dose. You must throw away your pen and take the full dose of medicine with a new pen.

## 6. The red lock covers the needle before I start injection. What should I do?

Unscrew and throw away the needle in use (see section 5, step 13). Take a new needle from the box and start again from step 1. Every box contains an extra needle.

- It is recommended to use a different Yorvipath pen for the second daily injection, even if the two pens have the same-coloured push button (same strength).
- Follow the steps in the instructions for use for each injection.

## Caring for your pen

- Handle your pen with care.
- Keep your pen dry.
- Use a moist cloth to clean your pen.
- Do not drop or knock your pen against hard surfaces. If you do, test the pen flow again (section 2, steps A - C) before next use.
- Do not apply extra force to your pen. It might be empty, damaged and no longer work properly.
- Do not attempt to repair a damaged pen yourself.
- Never use a damaged pen.

## Troubleshooting

## 1. How often must I test the pen flow?

You should only test the pen flow (section 2) the first time you use a new pen (or if you think it might be damaged) to not waste medicine. The test checks to make sure the medicine flows through the pen so that you get the right doses of medicine.

## 2. I do not see drops appear after I have tested the pen flow 5 times. What should I do?

If you see no drop on the needle tip after 5 attempts , it might be because there is no flow through the pen and needle.

Change the needle (see section 5, step 12) and test the pen flow again (see section 2, steps A - C). You can be sure the flow works correctly when you see the drop of medicine. If it still does not work discard the pen and contact your health care provider.

## 3. How do I know I have completed the injection?

Your injection is only completed after you have pressed the push button all the way in and the dose selector has rotated back to the '●' and you have kept the needle in the skin for

## 5 seconds .

## 4. Why do I have to keep holding the pen in the skin for 5 seconds?

Some medicine might flow back into the pen or flow backward from the injection site and be left on the skin. Holding the pen in the skin for 5 seconds helps to make sure that all the medicine has been injected.

## 5. I cannot dial the dose selector to the required dose. What should I do?

The pen does not allow a larger dose to be set than what is left in the pen. If your dose is larger than the amount of medicine left in the pen you will not be able to dial a full dose. You must throw away your pen and take the full dose of medicine with a new pen.

| 1 Prepare pen and needle                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 1 Prepare pen and needle   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Step 1 Take your Yorvipath pen. Make sure it is the correct strength and check the expiry date . Take a needle and check the expiry date on the needle (figure C). Note: Take your pen out of the refrigerator 20 minutes before first use. | Figure C Expiry date OK?   |
| Step 2 Pull off the pen cap and check the inspection window to make sure the medicine inside the pen is clear and colourless (figure D). Important: If the medicine has visible particles in it do not use the pen. Use a new pen.          | Figure D Medicine OK?      |
| Step 3 Pull the foil off the needle (figure E). This needle can only be used 1 time . Always use a new needle for each injection.                                                                                                           | Figure E                   |
| Step 4 Attach the needle straight onto your pen, then screw the needle onto the pen until secure (figure F).                                                                                                                                | Figure F                   |
| Step 5 Pull off the needle cover and the inner needle shield (figure G). Throw away the inner needle shield and keep the needle cover for later.                                                                                            | FigureG                    |

## 2 If new pen, test pen flow

ATTENTION

## Step A

Turn the dose selector clockwise (to the right) 2 clicks until you see the droplet symbol '    ' in the dose window (figure H).

Note: You can always correct the selection by turning the dose selector.

## Step B

Make any air bubbles rise to the top of the pen by tapping the inspection window (figure I). Keep the pen with the needle tip pointed up.

Note:

Tiny air bubbles are ok.

## Step C

Press the push button and watch drops of medicine come out of the needle tip. When you press, make sure that the dose selector rotates back to the symbol '●' (figure J).

Important: If you do not see drops of medicine, repeat this test (steps A - C) up to 5 times . If drops are still not seen, change the needle and repeat the test.

## 3 Prepare injection and select dose

## Step 6

Choose injection site. There are two regions of your body you can inject into (figure K).

Avoid injecting where skin is red, swollen or scarred.

Choose a different injection site each time you inject.

<!-- image -->

Only test pen flow (steps A - C) the first time you use a new pen. If your pen is already in use, go to section \"3 Prepare injection and select dose\".
