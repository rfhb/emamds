## 1. Introduction

On 22-12-2022, the MAH submitted interim results of a paediatric study submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The interim study report corresponds to study No. LIN-MD-66 (Long-term safety study or oral linaclotide administered to paediatric participants with function constipation (FC) or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C)).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided with this submission.

## 2. Summary of data submitted

The MAH states that Study LIN-MD-66 is part of the Linaclotide PIP 000927-PIP01-10-M06 (pending M07 EC decision for PIP modification). The applicant also states that there are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH with this study.

There are no new data that change or result in a new benefit/risk evaluation. The applicant confirms that there are no regulatory consequences identified with this study and that there is no new data that changes or results in a new benefit/risk evaluation. Consequently, no changes are proposed to the Constella PI.

## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Linaclotide, a 14-amino acid peptide that acts on the apical surface of epithelial cells in the intestinal lumen to stimulate the receptor guanylate cyclase subtype C (GC-C), is currently approved in a wide variety of countries across the world with approval in the EU dated 26/12/2012. The product is currently licensed in the EU for the indication:

'Constella is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults'.

The compound is also licensed for the indication chronic idiopathic constipation in the US, Canada, Japan; Australia; New Zealand; Saudi Arabia; and Mexico (with doses of 72 µg and 145 µg daily), and the MAH intends to modify the currently approved indication in the US to include functional constipation (FC) in children and adolescents 6-17 years of age.

Since the FC indication is not licensed in the EU, there is no intention to include the extension of the patient population into the European license.

Study LIN-MD-66 is a Phase 3, long-term safety study of oral linaclotide administered to paediatric subjects, ages 6 to 17 years, with FC or IBS-C, who completed study intervention in Studies LIN-MD62, LIN-MD-63, or LIN-MD-64 based on the individual study criteria. The current submission focuses on the interim results for paediatric FC subjects only (from the lead-in Studies LIN-MD-62 and LIN-MD64) as of the data cut-off date of 15 July 2022. Results for paediatric IBS-C subjects (from the lead-in Studies LIN-MD-63 and LIN-MD-64) will be reported in separate subsequent CSRs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.2. Clinical study LIN-MD-66

The study with the title 'A Long-term Safety Study of Oral Linaclotide Administered to Paediatric Participants with Functional Constipation (FC) or Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)' was conducted in 55 sites in 4 countries (USA, Canada, Israel and the Netherlands).

The submitted interim clinical study report (CSR) focuses on paediatric functional constipation (PFC) subjects only. Results from the IBS-C subjects will be reported in a separate subsequent CSR. The submitted interim analysis had a data cut-off date of 15 July 2022.

## Methods

## Study participants

The study was to enrol paediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with FC or IBS-C who completed study intervention in Studies LIN-MD-62, LIN-MD-63, or LIN MD-64 based on the individual study criteria.

## Treatments

Eligible subjects 6 to 11 years of age received linaclotide 72 μg once daily , and subjects 12 to 17 years of age were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to linaclotide 72 μg or 145 μg once daily for 24 weeks based on their age at the time of enrolment into Study LIN-MD-66.

Subjects who turned 18 years of age during or after completing the lead-in study, were eligible if they enrolled within 28 days (inclusive) of the last day of study intervention in the lead-in study. Such subjects were dosed as 17-year-old subjects.

## Objective(s)

The objective of the trial was stated as 'to assess the long-term safety of linaclotide in paediatric subjects with FC (total exposure with linaclotide for 24 weeks) who have completed Studies LIN-MD-62 or LIN-MD-64' according to the submitted interim CSR.

The study protocol defines the objectives more extensively as: 'The objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety of linaclotide in paediatric participants with FC (total exposure with linaclotide for 24 weeks) or IBS-C (total exposure with linaclotide for 52 weeks) who have completed Study LIN-MD62, LIN-MD-63, or LIN-MD- 64.

## Study design:

For the reported subjects with PFC, the study was to consist of 7 visits, including a 0- to 14-day Screening Period and 24 weeks of study intervention. The Screening Visit may have been the same as the End-of-Treatment Visit or End-of-Study Visit of the subject's lead-in study. The overall design/study plan is shown in the following figure:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Figure 1: Study design schematic.

<!-- image -->

For subjects who enrolled in Study LIN-MD-66 on the same day as their End-of Treatment (EOT) visit in Study LIN-MD-64, the EOT visit may have been combined with the Screening (Visit 1). For subjects who enroll within ≤ 28 days (inclusive) from last study intervention (Visit 7) in the Study LIN-MD-64, the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and Day 1 (Visit 2) procedures may have been combined, with the exception of subjects who are positive for fecal impaction assessment at the Screening Visit.

## Outcomes/endpoints

According to the protocol, no endpoints are specified for this long-term safety study. The safety assessments, however, were to include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments (clinical chemistry, complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis), vital sign measurements (including postural vital signs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, height, and weight.

The following efficacy evaluation/endpoint was collected during the study: Rome III criteria were assessed by the investigator at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and at the end of the study intervention period during the EOT Visit (Visit 7) as an additional efficacy assessment. This endpoint was introduced with the Protocol Amendment 1, dated June 2020. This protocol amendment also included that patients with IBS-C could be enrolled into the study (from the lead-in study LIN-MD-64).

The following safety evaluations were performed during the study: monitoring of AEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), clinical laboratory assessments (clinical chemistry, complete blood count, urinalysis), vital sign measurements (including postural vital signs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, height, and weight.

AESIs were defined as significant volume depletion and/or significant electrolyte abnormalities and/or ECG abnormalities that are considered by the investigator or sponsor to be related to diarrhoea.

## Assessor's comment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since this is an interim CSR only, not all deviations of the CSR in relation to the protocol will be reported in the following. The deviations are based on the fact that for this submission, only the FC population with the previous studies LIN-MD-62 and LIN-MD-64 are included.

## Sample size/Statistical Methods

At least 120 subjects with PFC or IBS-C were planned to be enrolled to receive linaclotide study intervention; however, the actual number of subjects in this study was determined to depend on the number of subjects who complete study intervention in the lead-in study (LIN-MD-62, LIN-MD-64, or LIN-MD-63) and enrol into this open-label extension study after fulfilling the eligibility criteria.

No sample size calculation or statistical methods other than descriptive statistics were specified.

## Changes in the conduct of the study:

The original protocol (15 July 2019, 97 subjects) had 2 global amendments, 2 regional amendments, and no administrative changes. The amendments and number of subjects enrolled under each amendment were as follows:

- -Global Amendment 1 (10 June 2020, 175 subjects)
- -Regional Amendment 1, EU-1 (13 February 2020, 0 subjects)
- -Regional Amendment 2, EU-2 (07 August 2020, 2 subjects)
- -Global Amendment 2 (30 April 2021, 9 subjects)

## Assessor's comment:

As reported above, the global amendment No. 1 related to the inclusion of the IBS-C subjects rolling over from study LIN-MD-64. These subjects are not included in the submitted CSR.

## Results

## Participant flow

The study was conducted at 55 sites, in 4 countries (US, Canada, Israel, and the Netherlands). Overall, 285 subjects with PFC were screened, and 283 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the subjects who entered the Treatment Period, a total of 282 subjects received either 72 μg or 145 μg linaclotide and 83.7% completed the study drug (administration). The most frequent reasons for discontinuation from study drug were lost to follow-up (9 subjects, 3.2%) and withdrawal by subject (6 subjects, 2.1%). The disposition of subjects is given in the following table:

## Assessor's comment:

The enrolment into the study from the two feeder studies was almost complete. Of note is also the fact that the number of subjects discontinuing the study due to identified reasons relating to the study drug appears to be very small, with 2 patients with 'lack of efficacy', and 2 with 'adverse events'.

The influence of the Covid pandemic on the study was rather minor: Overall, 1 (0.4%) subject had a visit impacted by coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19), and 1 (0.4%) subject had a COVID-19related treatment interruption. Both were in the 72 μg group.

There were overall 7 patients with protocol deviations (2.5%), of which 4 did not meet the inclusion criteria, and one each did not sign the ICF, was dosed with the wrong study treatment, or was withdrawn due to a protocol deviation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

Overall, the mean age of the study participants reported was 11.5 years and 55.0% of the subjects were female. White and Black/African American subjects accounted for 68.4% and 27.0% of subjects, respectively, and a little less than half of all subjects were Hispanic or Latino. The main baseline demographic characteristics are shown in the following table:

Note: This table includes only subjects with complete data sets for this endpoint. Collection of Rome IlI criteria data was added in Protocol Amendment 1 after approximately 97 subjects had already been enrolled in the study and for which Rome IlI criteria data were not collected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of note are the facts that data from 97 patients are missing in this analysis, since for these patients, which were enrolled before the implementation of protocol amandment 1, no baseline data were available. For the table above, no missing data were imputed, and data were summarized as observed.

## Assessor's comment:

The rate of patients suffering from FC was 82.8% (total) at the start of the study, which was decreased to 38.4% at the end of the study, which indicates a relevant change. However, since this is an openlabel study, it remains unclear whether this reflects natural history/fluctuation of the disease, or a true treatment effect. Since this is primarily a safety study, the question, however, appears less relevant. There were obviously no relevant differences between the two treatment groups. A percentage of more than 80% having FC (after they had undergone treatment in the preceding studies LIN-MD-63 and LIN-MD-64) could be regarded to be rather high. However, previous randomisation and doses are not known.

## Safety results

## -Adverse events:

Overall, a total of 52/282 subjects (18.4%) experienced at least 1 TEAE, including 37/210 (17.6%) subjects in the 72 μg group and 15/72 (20.8%) subjects in the 145 μg group. Most AEs were mild in severity, and 13/210 (6.2%) subjects and 6/72 (8.3%) had treatmentrelated AEs in the 72 μg and 145 μg groups, respectively. There were no deaths or AESIs, and few serious adverse events (SAEs) or AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. An overview of TEAEs by exposure-adjusted incidence rate per 100 patient-years is also presented in the following table:

## Assessor's comment:

The overall character of events, and especially those assessed as being treatment-related refer to local gastrointestinal effects, and therefore fully reflect the known safety profile for adults.

Most TEAEs were mild in severity. Two of 210 (1.0%) subjects in the 72 μg group and 1/72 (1.4%) subject in the 145 μg group ex perienced severe TEAEs. Severe TEAEs included the following MedDRA PTs: constipation and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (both reported by the same subject) and pyelonephritis in the 72 μg group and flatulence in the 145 μg group. All 3 events in th e 72 μg group were SAEs and considered not related to study drug, while flatulence in the 145 μg group was non -serious and considered related. All severe events were resolved.

Overall, 2 (0.7%) subjects (1 subject in each dose group) had moderate events of diarrhoea and no subjects had severe events of diarrhoea

## -Deaths and SAEs

There were no deaths during the study.

Overall, 2/282 (0.7%) subjects (both in the 72 μg group) experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. One subject had 2 SAEs, severe constipation and severe disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and 1 subject had severe pyelonephritis. There were no SAEs reported in the 145 μg group. All SAEs resolved, and none were considered related to study drug or led to discontinuation of study drug. No SAE of diarrhoea was reported.

Overall, 2/282 (0.7%) subjects experienced at least 1 AE that led to discontinuation of study drug. One (0.5%) subject in the 72 μg group had mild events of diarrhoea and dehydration that led to discontinuation of study drug. One (1.4%) subject in the 145 μg group had moderate events of abdominal pain and diarrhoea that led to discontinuation of study drug. None of the events were serious, and all were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No AESIs (significant volume depletion and/or significant electrolyte abnormalities and/or ECG abnormalities that are considered by the investigator or sponsor to be related to diarrhoea) were reported.

## -Laboratory Evaluations

All comparisons were done and presented according to the two age groups 6-11 and 12-18. There were no noticeable differences in laboratory findings between the age subgroups other than the potentially clinically significant (PCS) albumin values as presented below.

There were no unexpected changes of clinical relevance for haematology, chemistry as well as urine analyses. Similarly, the evaluation of shifts from baseline to the end of treatment did not reveal unexpected changes of clinical relevance.

The individual cases of PCS post-baseline abnormalities are presented in the following table.

The most frequently reported ( ≥ 2% subjects overall) PCS values were observed for magnesium (&gt; 1.1 × upper limit of normal [ULN]), albumin (&gt; 1.1 × ULN), and monocytes absolute cell count (&lt; 0.5 × lower limit of normal). Regarding magnesium, it should be noted that, among those subjects with postbaseline PCS magnesium findings (&gt; 1.1 × ULN), most of these subjects (13/16) had magnesium levels at baseline that, while not reaching PCS levels, were above the ULN.

Min = minimum; PCS =potentially clinically significant

N (percentage denominator) = Subjects with non-missing non-PCS baseline and 21 postbaseline parameter assessment. For specific age-dependent criteria, subjects in that specific age group of interest with non-missing non-PCS baseline and 2l postbaseline parameter assessment were included for the denominator.

With regard to ECG evaluations, no subject had an abnormal, clinically significant overall ECG interpretation at baseline or at the End of Study, and there were no unexpected changes of clinical relevance. No subject experienced PCS post-baseline ECG parameters of QRS interval, PR interval and QT corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF).

## -Other events:

As of the data cut-off date for this report, 1 pregnancy has been reported in a 16-yearold in the 72 μg group. The subject had been exposed to study drug at conception and continued taking study drug inconsistently for approximately 3 months, at which point she discontinued from treatment. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subject gave birth with no issues or complications at 38 weeks of pregnancy, and the foetal outcome was normal.

The applicant concludes that linaclotide was well tolerated in paediatric subjects aged 6 to 17 years with FC. The safety profile was consistent with previous linaclotide studies in adults with CIC and IBSC. Long-term safety evaluation of linaclotide in subjects with PFC indicated no new safety signals.

## Assessor's comment:

The overall conclusions of the MAH are agreed with.

## 3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant has submitted an interim analysis of the long-term open-label safety study LIN-MD-66, which analysed the study population included after the finalisation of the preceding studies LIN-MD-62 and LIN-MD-64, which themselves included patients with functional constipation.

The included patient population was a population aged 6-17 years at the time of inclusion, and the reported observation time was for 24 weeks. Patients were treated in two dose groups, with the patients aged 6-11 receiving a 72 µg dose, and those aged 12-17 receiving either 72 µg or 145 µg daily dose.

The primary objective of the trial was to collect safety information in the paediatric population, and a single efficacy evaluation (endpoint) was only introduced by protocol amendment, when the trial was already ongoing.

While the trial is adequate to collect relevant safety data for the compound in the FC population, the reporting of efficacy is restricted to an endpoint which is difficult to assess and - due to the open label design - does not allow a conclusion on efficacy to be made. No differences between the dose-groups could be found for this single efficacy parameter, and there was not reporting of the different dosegroups in the 11-17 year-old population and the two randomised dose-groups at this age. Since the conclusions on efficacy are limited anyway, a concern about the missing reporting is not raised.

The safety evaluation was overall rather unremarkable, and there were no unexpected adverse events that were assessed as being related to the intake of study medication. Overall, the rate of adverse events was low, and mainly mild in intensity, and fully reflected the safety profile in the adult population, which had already revealed that the mainstay of adverse events is related to effects on the gastrointestinal tract.

No new safety concerns emerged from the overall evaluation of safety from this study.

## 4. Overall conclusion

The applicant has submitted the results of an interim evaluation of study LIN-MD-66 which is a longterm safety study in a mixed population of patients with IBS-C and FC. For the purpose of this interim evaluation, the results of the FC population only were submitted. A limited evaluation of efficacy was included in the submission, which did not allow any further conclusion on efficacy due to the design of the study, but which also does not stand in contrast to results previously reported for this population. The safety evaluation in this study was rather unremarkable and confirmed an acceptable safety profile in the paediatric population for a treatment duration of at least 6 months. The safety profile appears to be overall very similar to the known safety profile of the compound in adults.

The indication functional constipation is not licensed in the EU, and the applicant does obviously not pursue this indication in the EU neither for adults, nor for the paediatric population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The submission is therefore correctly presented as having no consequences for the existing license in the EU.

The overall benefit-risk ratio remains unchanged.
