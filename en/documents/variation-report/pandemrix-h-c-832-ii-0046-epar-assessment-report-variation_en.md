3. Scientific discussion 3.1. Introduction Pandemrix is an adjuvanted vaccine against influenza caused by A (H1N1)v 2009 virus. It is supplied in two separate vials as a suspension (antigen) and emulsion (adjuvant) for emulsion for injection. The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The vaccine contains the marketing authorisation holder's (MAH's) proprietary adjuvant AS03, which is composed of squalene, DLα -tocopherol and polysorbate 80. Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) due to lack of data outside of this age range. The granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation was based on a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14). The scientific development was based on the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03) and the guideline on submission of marketing authorisation applications for pandemic influenza vaccines through the centralised procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03). Following the onset of the (H1N1)v pandemic and the declaration of WHO Phase 6 in June 2009, the MAH applied for a variation (PU/0017) to change the pandemic vaccine strain composition from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14) to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) strain used NYMC X-179A. The recommendation for the approval of the PU/0017 Pandemic Update was adopted by the CHMP on 24 September 2009. The marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for the current (H1N1)v vaccine was granted by the European Commission on 29 September 20. In April 2010 the MAH applied to lift the Specific Obligations and to convert the MA granted under 'exceptional circumstances' into a full MA (SW/041). On 24 June 2010 the CHMP recommended to change the status of the marketing authorisation outside the scope of Art. 14(8) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Within this variation procedure (II/43), the MAH provided data from studies D-Pan H1N1-007 and 008 in this variation constitute documentation of safety and immunogenicity (Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Cell mediated immune response (CMI) only) up to Month 6 in healthy adults aged from 18 to &gt; 60 years.

The post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 data from each study were already assessed and added to the SmPC during the following preceding variations:

II/019 and II/032 - study D-Pan H1N1-007

II/023 and II/038 - study D-Pan H1N1-008

This variation has been submitted to fulfil the following follow-up measures (FUMs):

Clinical aspects D-PAN H1N1-007 This is an ongoing study in 130 Belgian adults aged 18-60 years who have been randomised (1:1) with stratification by age (18-40, 41 to 50 and 51 to 60 years; 2:1:1) to receive: Group A: (N=64) two doses 21 days apart of HA (3.75µg) adjuvanted with AS03A = Pandemrix H1N1v as approved Group B: (N=66) two doses 21 days apart of HA 15 µg (derived from the same H1N1v strain) without adjuvant. The vaccines administered were of the following content: Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Study Design

The primary objective was to demonstrate that two doses of vaccine containing 3.75 μ g HA derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain with AS03A results in an HI immune response to vaccinehomologous virus that meets or exceeds the CHMP criteria applied to seasonal influenza vaccines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study is observer-blinded i.e. vaccine recipients and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint are unaware of which vaccine was administered.

Blood samples for evaluation of HI antibody immune response were to be obtained prior to (Day 0) vaccination and at Days 21, 42, 182 and 364 after the first vaccination.

The HI data from days 0, 21 and 42 previously reported came from testing all sera in parallel. The month 6 (M6) samples were tested separately. The CMI data were generated using previously described methods.

Subsequent analyses will be performed after all data will become available for month 12. Results up to month 6 The data lock point for the current report was 24 June 2010. Please see previous reports for the baseline demographics of the 130 subjects initially enrolled into this study. All except one subject, who was lost to follow up, completed the study up to M6 (day 182). Four subjects were excluded from the ATP immunogenicity cohort because of non-compliance with the vaccination (1) or blood sampling (2) schedules or because of missing serological data. The HI data are summarised below. Please note the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates as commented on in the prior assessment reports.

At D182 all subjects were seropositive but the GMTs were lower in the subgroups that had been seronegative at D0.

All subjects in the adjuvanted vaccine group were seroprotected at D182. The SPR for subjects who were seronegative at D0 and received plain HA was 74.3% and those not seroprotected at D182 were all in the 41-60 years age group. There was an advantage for adjuvanted vaccine in each group regardless of baseline serostatus. All CHMP criteria were met in the adjuvanted group at D182. In the plain HA group the SPR and SCR criteria were not met in the 51-60 years age stratum. At D182, a persistent CD4 T-cell response was observed in both groups with a median CD4 T-cell expressing any pair of measured cytokine expression of 1306.5 per million T cells in the H1N1+AS03 group and 653.5 in the H1N1 group. The tables below show the results of stimulation with split peptide and HA peptide pool and subjects have been subdivided according to whether or not they had received a seasonal influenza vaccination in the 3 years preceding the study. Stimulation with split antigen suggested slightly higher responses in the groups that had not received prior seasonal influenza vaccination but there was no marked effect or consistent pattern noted when cells were stimulated with the peptide pool.

This is a phase II, randomised, open-label, single centre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1 following administration of one or two doses to healthy adults aged from the age of 18 years onwards.

The analyses are also shown for the total vaccinated cohort and the overall findings were comparable with those for the ATP cohort. D-PAN H1N1-008 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study was initiated in September 2009 and is ongoing. Currently the data obtained up to D182 are reported with a data lock of 27 May 2010.

## The primary objective was:

To demonstrate that vaccination with one dose of the H1N1 vaccine (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain) containing 3.75 μ g of HA adjuvanted with AS03A results in an HI immune response to the vaccine-homologous virus that meets or exceeds the EMEA (CHMP) guidance targets for

seroconversion rate (SCR), seroprotection rate (SPR) and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) at 21 days after vaccination in adults within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata.

## The secondary objectives were/ are:

To evaluate the HI immune response to the vaccine-homologous virus in terms of the EMEA (CHMP) guidance targets for pandemic vaccine at 21 days after the first dose of vaccine, as a function of the pre-vaccination serostatus, in each age stratum.

To assess whether vaccination with two doses of the H1N1 vaccine (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain) containing 3.75 μ g of HA adjuvanted with AS03A results in an HI immune response to the vaccine-homologous virus that meets or exceeds the EMEA (CHMP) guidance targets for pandemic vaccine seroconversion rate (SCR), seroprotection rate (SPR), and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) at 21 days after the second dose of H1N1 vaccine in adults within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata.

To describe (based on point estimates and 95% CIs) the persistence of the HI vaccine-homologous response against A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like antigen at Days 42, 182 and 364 after one dose of H1N1 vaccine and at Days 182 and 364 after two doses of H1N1 vaccine in adults within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata. To describe (based on point estimates and 95% CIs) the immunogenicity to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like antigen at Day 0, 21, 42, 182 and 364 in terms of neutralising antibodies in adults in a subset of subjects within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata. To describe the safety of the vaccine regimens in terms of solicited adverse events (AEs), 7 days postvaccination; unsolicited AEs, 21 or 84 days post-dose 1 and 63 days post-dose 2; AEs of specific interest (AESIs) for the entire study period, serious adverse events (SAEs) for the entire study period and biochemical parameters at Day 0, 21, 42, 182 and 364. The vaccine comprised lot n° for H1N1 = DFLSA013A and lot n° for the adjuvant = AA03A209C. The original design of this study was amended when the first results of study H1N1-021 became available. Thus, Groups 1 and 2 were defined as shown below. Both groups are to be followed up serologically to M12 to determine whether there is any advantage for two doses over a single dose in the longer term. The study planned to enrol 240 subjects aged at least 18 years with allocation to two parallel vaccine groups (one or two doses) with a ratio of 1:1 as follows. Group 1 , referred to as Group A in the protocol: subjects received a single dose of the AS03Aadjuvanted H1N1 candidate vaccine on Day 0 (but no second vaccination on Day 21). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Group 2 , referred to as Group B in the protocol: subjects received two doses of the AS03A-adjuvanted H1N1 candidate vaccine, administered on Days 0 and 21 (21-day interval).

Subjects were stratified according to age (18-40, 41-60, 61-75 and &gt; 75 years) with a ratio of 1:1:1:1.

## Results

As planned, the study enrolled 240 subjects (120 aged 18-60 years and 120 aged &gt; 60 years), of which 238 completed the D182 visit and 236 subjects were included in the ATP immunogenicity cohort. Please see the previous assessment report for details of baseline demographics and prior seasonal influenza vaccination history.

The HI data collected over time are summarised below. It should be remembered that in this study the D0 and D21 samples were tested in a separate run from the D42 samples and it should be noted that the D182 samples were tested in isolation. Note the pre-vaccination HI seropositivity rates, as commented on previously.

HI against vaccine-homologous virus up to D182 (ATP) At M6 all subjects aged 18-60 years were seropositive but the SPR, SCR and SCF (as well as the GMT) were all numerically higher in the 2-dose group. All CHMP criteria were met in both dose groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In subjects aged &gt; 60 years there was a much more clear advantage for 2 doses at Month 6. The SPR at M6 after a single dose was &lt; 60% (i.e. was lower than the CHMP criterion).

The supplementary tables to the report also show the D182 data according to baseline HI serostatus.

As shown above, the four subjects seronegative at D182 were aged 60 and seronegative at baseline and had received a single dose.

| product   |
|-----------|

The SPRs at D182 were lower for subjects within each age group who were seronegative at baseline compared to those of the same age who were seropositive at baseline. This observation applied in both dose groups but SPRs were much lower at D182 in the single dose group vs. the 2-dose group. In particular, only 9/28 (32%) subjects aged &gt; 60 who were seronegative at baseline were still seroprotected at D182 after a single dose compared to 33/39 (85%) after two doses. There was a much smaller difference between one and two doses for those who were seropositive at baseline in this age group (97% vs. 86%). Even among the younger subjects there was a perceptible advantage in terms of SPRs for two doses in those who were seronegative at baseline (95% vs. 78%) while all those seropositive at baseline were seroprotected at d182 after one or two doses. The SCRs and SCFs at D182 still met the CHMP criteria by age at D182 regardless of baseline serostatus but differed by age and dose as shown below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Further analysis by age sub-groups (also from supplementary tables) suggested that differences between those aged 18-40 and 41-60 years were not very marked within each dose group except for the GMTs, which showed an approximate 2-fold difference. The sub-groups aged 61-70 and &gt;70 years also showed no marked difference within each dose group but each showed the effect of number of doses as described above. When putting baseline serostatus and age into the same table (but noting small denominators) notable differences between one or two doses administered by age sub-group occurred among those who were seronegative at baseline.

On D182 the median frequency of CD4 T-cells was 1277.0 and 746.5 in subjects aged 18-60 years and subjects aged &gt;60 years respectively in Group 1. In Group 2 these frequencies were 660.0 and 563.0. Similar results were obtained after stimulation by a pool of peptides spanning the whole HA sequence.

No effect of vaccination on the frequency of cytokine-positive CD8 T-cells was apparent in the two age strata in Groups 1 and 2.

Clinical Safety Data to M6 from both studies The safety and reactogenicity analysis for studies D-Pan-H1N1-007 and D-Pan-H1N1-008 was performed on the TVC and includes: Unsolicited AEs reported up to D84 SAEs reported up to Day 182. No deaths have been reported from either study up to D182 (Month 6). In D-Pan-H1N1-007, one SAE (migraine reported by a 41 year old male in the non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine group) was reported which was considered as not related to vaccination by the investigator. In study D-Pan-H1N1-008 11 subjects reported 12 SAEs up to Day 182. None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator as related to vaccination. No AESIs or potential Immune-Mediated-Diseases (pIMDs) were reported during the study period up to D182 in either study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were no AEs leading to premature discontinuation from study D-Pan-H1N1-007. In study D-PanH1N1-008, one subject was withdrawn due to an SAE (diagnosed with breast cancer 116 days after Dose 2).

Across both studies, the overall incidence of AEs up to D84 was comparable between adjuvanted- and non-adjuvanted vaccines in study 007 (60.9% and 57.6%, respectively) and between 1-dose and 2dose schedules in subjects aged 18-60 years in study 008 (75.0% and 66.2%, respectively). Subjects

aged &gt;60 years displayed comparable rates of AEs in study 008 (60.0% and 65.7% in the 1-dose and 2-dose schedules, respectively).

There was no particular signal or clinical pattern of unsolicited AEs observed. Most seem very likely to reflect intercurrent illnesses.

Among adjuvanted vaccine recipients there were two cases of lymphadenopathy in study 007 and one in study 008 (2-dose schedule) plus one case in a plain HA recipient in study 007.

Incidences of grade 3 reports were generally comparable across groups.

- An advantage in terms of HI data for two doses of adjuvanted vaccine over one dose. The effect was detectable throughout the datasets (if only for selected parameters) but it was especially notable for those who were seronegative at baseline and aged &gt; 60 years. However, the CMI data did not consistently suggest an advantage for two doses.

Related events were reported at frequencies of 18.8% and 10.6% in adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups from study 007, and in 17.3% and 22.1% of subjects aged 18-60 from study 008. In the latter study, related AEs were reported by 14.0% of elderly subjects from the 1-dose schedule group and by 14.3% of elderly subjects from the 2-dose schedule group. 3.3 Changes to the Product Information The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/ PL attached to this report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH: SmPC section 4.2: A statement in the sub-section on adults 18 years and older was included to refer to section 5.1 regarding immune responses to one and two doses of Pandemrix (H1N1)v, including antibody levels after 6 months, as the persistence data showed a different pattern in elderly than in adults. SmPC section 5.1 This section was updated to also mention the baseline seronegative subsets for the 6-month persistence results and to present the data in tabulated format. 3.4 Results and Discussion The CHMP agreed that the above data up to M6 from these studies show: · An advantage in terms of HI and CMI data for Pandemrix over plain HA in subjects aged 18-60 years when each was given for 2 doses 21 days apart. However, the most notable advantages for the adjuvanted vaccine in terms of HI were for those seronegative at baseline and over 40 years of age. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There are no SNA data available and no effectiveness estimates for one vs. two doses. It is not currently possible to discern whether the observed differences in HI response at M6 have implications for protection.

On this basis, the CHMP agreed that the findings should be reflected in section 5.1 but has no grounds to request any change to the dose recommendations in Section 4.2, besides a reference to section 5.1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the sub-section on adults. Nevertheless, since public health decisions regarding dose regimens would likely take into account those least likely to respond and since routine baseline serostatus determination is not feasible it is recommended that the HI data should be mentioned for those who were seronegative at baseline as well as overall.

Overall there was no new safety concern raised by the additional safety data collected.

## 4. Conclusion

On 16 December 2010 the CHMP considered the following variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. Medicinal product no longer authorised
