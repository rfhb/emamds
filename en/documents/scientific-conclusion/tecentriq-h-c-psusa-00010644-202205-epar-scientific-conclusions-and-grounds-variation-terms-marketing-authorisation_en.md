## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for atezolizumab, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In  view  of  available  data  on  haemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  from  clinical  trials,  the  literature, spontaneous  reports  and  in  view  of  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal relationship  between  atezolizumab  and  haemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  is  at  least  a  reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing atezolizumab should be amended accordingly.

Although  in  view  of  the  available  data  on  gastrointestinal  perforation  a  definitive  causal  relationship between atezolizumab and gastrointestinal perforation could not be established, colitis is reported as a common  ADR  for  atezolizumab  and  immune  checkpoint  inhibitor -associated  colitis  may  result  in perforation. Gastrointestinal perforation is reported as an ADR in the Product Information of ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Even though gastrointestinal perforation is a rare complication of colitis, the  PRAC concluded that the existing warning regarding immune-related colitis should be updated to include gastrointestinal perforation.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for atezolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product containing atezolizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
