The most frequent are osteoarthritis, gout, bursitis, infectious diseases, injury, osteomyelitis, and autoimmune diseases. However, it is also considered that hypersensitivity/allergic reactions sometimes manifest with systemic involvement including arthralgia. Joint swelling is also very commonly associated with the above mentioned joint disorders, or could be linked to peripheral oedema or to systemic manifestation of hypersensitivity reactions. This review focused on arthralgia and joint swelling cases where underlying hypersensitivity reactions likely played |

Conducted review of all cases of SCARs and of arthralgia did not demonstrate an evidence of a clear causal relationship between these events and aliskiren treatment. However, the analysis revealed a possible relationship between these events and hypersensitivity. Subsequently MAH has performed a detailed analysis of available data. The evidence presented is considered to support the inclusion of post-marketing events of \"hypersensitivity\" into the SmPC section 4.8 (undesirable effects) for aliskiren. authorised |

Overall the results of this clinical study support the conclusion of a positive benefit/risk ratio in the use of the aliskiren+HCTZ as antihypertensive treatment of elderly and very elderly patients. However, the review of available data also suggests different response to the treatment of elderly and very elderly.

| WS/0073 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SPC in view of the results of study CSPP100A2112 investigating the potential interaction between aliskiren and grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/02/2011                          | 24/03/2011 no                               | SPC longer                       | This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.5 of the SPC in view of the results of study CSPP100A2112 investigating the potential interaction between aliskiren and grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co- administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with aliskiren.

DAP-PEDS- 07-02: A study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin after a single 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg dose of Cubicin as either a 1 or 2 hour infusion in paediatric subjects aged 2 to 6 years, inclusive, with proven or suspected Gram-positive infections who were receiving standard antibiotic therapy. The mean exposure (AUC0-8) was approximately 429 and 550 µg*hr/ml after the administration of 8 and 10 mg/kg single doses, respectively, similar to the exposure seen in adults at the 4 mg/kg dose at steady state (495 µg*hr/ml).

The half life, clearance and volume of distribution were similar at both dose levels. Risk minimisation Activities: The additional risk minimisation activities mentioned in the Risk Management Plan in the form of dosage card and laboratory susceptibility testing leaflet were in place for Cubicin because of concerns over medication errors, severe skeletal muscle toxicity and interference with coagulation tests results. It was recognised that these measures are very important for the safe and effective use of the product, hence, the CHMP recommended that this was made a condition of the Marketing Authorisation. authorised                                                                                                                                                      |

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. A study in healthy volunteers showed that itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and the potent P-gp inhibitor itraconazole is contraindicated. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the annexes in line with the latest QRD template (version 7.3).

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The application was submitted for a Type IB variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Peripheral oedema has been reported with aliskiren use in the post-marketing setting. The detailed analysis of spontaneous reports showed that many cases were confounded by patient medical history or suspect concomitant medication. Nevertheless, a number of cases showed a positive de-challenge such that a causal relationship to treatment could not be excluded. Therefore, based on this analysis, and in accordance with CHMP's requests following assessment of PSUR 3 and PSUR 4 for aliskiren, the MAH applied for a variation to update the 'Undesirable effects' section of the SPC to add the text: \"Post marketing experience: peripheral oedema (frequency unknown)\". The Package Leaflet has also been updated accordingly. |

Following evaluation of the available postmarketing data, the CHMP concluded to add a warning to SPC section 4.4 that caution should be exercised when aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolemia (eg. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience.. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly discontinued. Furthermore, SPC section 4.8 was also amended. longer authorised |

In addition, a warning of angioedema-type reactions as for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system has been added to SPC section 4.4 recommending that patients without a previous history who suffer angioedema with aliskiren should discontinue treatment and contact their doctor. Furthermore,the term \"angioedema\" has been added as a rare adverse drug reaction to SPC section 4.8.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

As with other agents acting on the renin - angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti- hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients.

Also cyclosporine markedly increased aliskiren t1/2. Hence, there is concern that the increase in AUC would be substantially higher with the approved aliskiren dosage, even exceeding the highest dose tested in humans. An additional concern is that aliskiren might distribute to tissues from which the medicinal product is normally absent in presence of a P-gp inhibitor, or preset at low levels because of the activity of P-gp. Non clinical and clinical data converge to show that P-gp is a major |

In addition, literature data show that P-gp mediates tissue uptake of a variety of P-gp substrates and that P-gp inhibitors can markedly increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Given the very limited safety data at increased exposure, and the risk for very large increase in tissue exposure, the CHMP concluded that the co-administration of cyclosporine and aliskiren poses serious safety concerns. Therefore, a contraindication for the concomitant administration with cyclosporine, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, as well as with other potent P g inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine) is considered essential. Moreover, due to the risk for higher increase in tissue exposure than in plasma, caution should be advised during co administration with moderate P-gp inhibitors (ketoconazol, itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). authorised |

The addition of 300mg aliskiren achieved an average reduction in the urinary albumin to creatinine (UACR) ratio of 12 mg/mmol (from 58 to 46 mg/mmol) compared to placebo. Aliskiren did not induce any significant effect on blood pressure or affect estimated GFR under these conditions. The clinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood pressure. Furthermore, aliskiren was associated with an increased frequency (4.2% vs. 1.9% for placebo) in serum potassium concentration (? 6 mmol/l). longer authorised |
