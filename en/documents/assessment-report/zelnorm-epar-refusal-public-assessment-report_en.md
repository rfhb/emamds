## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Irritable Bowel  Syndrome  (IBS)  is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) characterized by abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and altered bowel function. IBS is common and may have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Psychological symptoms are common. The prevalence of IBS is up to 20%; 14-25% of women and 5%-19% men (N. J Talley et al; 1992). The female to male ratio varies 1.1-2.6 depending on the predominant symptom; constipation is commoner in women whereas men may have a tendency to diarrhoea (N. J Talley et al; 1995).

Tegaserod,  an  aminoguanidine  indole  compound  is  a  potent,  orally  active  5HT4 agonist  with  high affinity, which  acts on enteric nerves in the gastrointestinal tract to trigger the release of neurotransmitters, resulting in increased gastrointestinal contractility and stimulation of the peristaltic reflex. Because of its pharmacological action at 5HT4 receptors in the gut, tegaserod was expected to improve the characteristic symptoms of abdominal discomfort and pain, bloating and constipation that occur intermittently but recurrently in IBS-Constipation (IBS-C).

The  applicant  Novartis  Europharm  Limited  submitted  a  complete  and  independent  application  for Zelnorm (tegaserod) according to article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

The  indication  proposed  by  the  applicant  for  Zelnorm  was: 'repeated  symptomatic  short-term treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in women whose predominant bowel habit is constipation (IBSC).'

The recommended dose of Zelnorm was one 6 mg tablet twice daily.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Each tablet of Zelnorm contains 6 mg tegaserod, as the hydrogen maleate. The tablet formulation may be described as standard, and modified-release was not considered necessary. The proposed packaging was PVC/PE/PVDC blister packs.

## Active Substance

The solubility of tegaserod hydrogen maleate was found to be low in all tested solvents, especially so in  water  and  all  aqueous  buffer  solutions,  where  the  solubility  is  very  low  and  the  addition  of surfactants only slightly increased the solubility. Tegaserod hydrogen maleate is not optically active and was present as a thermodynamically stable physical form in the tablet formulation.

- Manufacture

Tegaserod is a chemically-synthesised substance.

- Specification

The specifications for the active substance were set in line with the batch data and ICH requirements. The  batch  results  show  good  consistency  and  all  methods  have  been  acceptably  described  and validated.

- Stability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The active substance was found to be stable and all results remained within specifications under long term storage conditions and up to 6 months under accelerated storage conditions. An acceptable and valid re-test period was defined.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Because of the very low water solubility of the drug substance, the particle size distribution has been determined  routinely  as  it  may  influence  the  dissolution  behavior.  Because  the  drug  substance  is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and due to its physico-chemical properties, oral formulations were preferred. Initially a capsule formulation was developed and later 2mg and 6 mg tablet formulations were developed.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The results from the validation of the manufacturing method together with the results of the in process controls  and  of  the  release  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  of  Zelnorm  6  mg tablets was robust and consistently yields a product which meets all agreed quality characteristics.

## · Product Specification

The  test  methods  have  been  acceptably  described  and  have  been  validated  according  to  the  ICH guidelines.  The  proposed  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  have  been  justified  and  batch  results complied with the specifications and agreed quality criteria.

## · Stability of the Product

Based on the stability data provided, and the current EU/ICH guidelines an acceptable and validated shelf-life was defined, together with recommended storage conditions.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product have been evaluated and judged to be satisfactory for a product of this type.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The pivotal toxicity studies, including toxicokinetics were conducted in accordance with GLP.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

Tegaserod has high affinity for the human 5-HT4 receptor (pKd: 7.7). In guinea-pig ileum preparations, it acted as a partial agonist. One main human metabolite, M29 had no appreciable 5 HT4 binding. Data for metabolite 52.8 indicated that it was more potent than tegaserod. However this metabolite is not detected  in  human  plasma,  and  present  in  rodents  at  low  levels  only.  Therefore  as  argued  by  the Applicant,  it  was  agreed  that  even  if  this  metabolite  has  similar  or  higher  pharmacological  activity than  tegaserod,  it  is  of  no  clinical  relevance.  Other  human  metabolites  include  three  isomeric metabolites M43.2, M43.8 and M45.3, which are N-glucuronidates of tegaserod. Further pharmacological testing of these metabolites has not been undertaken.

In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that tegaserod increased motility and tone in the GIT. The dose-response  curve  appeared  bell-shaped,  which  makes  dose-response  interpretations  difficult. Published data on in vitro preparations of GI tissues showed that tegaserod led to the release of various transmitters e.g. calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).  It  also  increased  intracellular  concentrations  of  cyclic  AMP.  In  various in  vivo models, tegaserod accelerated the gastric emptying of solids in both rats and dogs, but had no effect on the inhibition of gastric emptying of solids induced by light colonic distension. There was an indication of antinociceptive activity during colorectal distension in rats. In dogs, tegaserod normalised morphineinduced constipation.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Experiments on the general human receptor profile of tegaserod showed that it has high affinity for 5HT1A,  5-HT1B  and  5-HT2B  receptors  (pKi:  7.2-8.1)  -  comparable  to  its  5-HT4  affinity.  Functional experiments  revealed  tegaserod  as  being  a  partial  5-HT1A  agonist  and  a  competitive  5-HT1B  and  5HT2B antagonist. It had weak or no relevant affinity (pKi &lt;6.5) for all other binding sites tested.

## · Safety pharmacology

Safety  pharmacology  testing  addressing  cardiovascular  safety  ( in  vitro hERG  channel,  papillary muscle cells, isolated rabbit heart; in  vivo studies  in  rats  and  dogs),  gastric  acid  secretion  and  renal function revealed no cause for concern. In a new set of studies it was shown that overall, tegaserod appeared  to  have  no  vasoconstrictive  potential.  Tegaserod  showed  some  reduction  in  prolactin secretion  in  rats.  The  applicant  claims  that  tegaserod  is  devoid  of  CNS  effects  at  therapeutically relevant doses, but findings in mice safety pharmacology studies suggest certain CNS related effects such as increased activity, abnormal gait, hypothermia at 10 to 100-fold higher doses.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No non-clinical studies have been undertaken.

## Pharmacokinetics

A comprehensive set of pharmacokinetic studies has been undertaken with tegaserod, in the species used for toxicity testing. The methods used for the analyses of tegaserod and metabolites in plasma, tissues and excreta were validated and adequate overall.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

In all species, the degree of absorption was &lt;35 %, and the absolute bioavailability between 8-27%. The oral absorption rate was moderate to fast, with a Tmax of 0.5-5 h in animals. The plasma clearance of tegaserod was higher in rodents than in dog and human, which resulted in lower dose-normalised AUCs in rodents (1-18) than in  dog (60-200) and human (40-80). Terminal half-lives of tegaserod

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(i.v.) were 2.1 h in rodents, 8.6 h in dogs, while half-lives of plasma radioactivity were substantially longer (30- 75 h).

## · Distribution

The  plasma  protein  binding  of  tegaserod  was  high  in  all  species  (95-98%).  Studies  in  albino  and pigmented rats showed widespread distribution of radioactivity. A high degree of labelling was seen in GIT, liver, kidney, adrenal, brown fat and thyroid. In pigmented rats, significant uptake and retention in melanin containing tissues were observed.

In specific studies on CNS distribution, low brain uptake was seen in normal rodents (brain/plasma ratios 0.075-0.36). The role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-dependent efflux transporter was also investigated.  It  was  found  that  tegaserod  increased  4-10  fold  in  knock-out  mice  lacking  brain  P-gp These  data  confirm  that  tegaserod  is  transported  by  the  P-gp  efflux  pump.  This  finding  may  be important in terms of drug interactions, which is further addressed in the Clinical section.

Studies of placental transfer in rats and rabbits showed that radiolabeled product crossed the placenta. The amnion:maternal blood ratio was &gt;5, while the fetal:maternal blood ratio was low (&lt;0.2). In rats, foetal  clearance  was  slower  than  from  maternal  tissues,  and  foetuses  were  exposed  mainly  to metabolites. In rats, AUC0-24 h for radioactivity and tegaserod was 3 times and 20 times higher in milk than in plasma respectively.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

The metabolism of labelled tegaserod was investigated in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and humans. In all species, tegaserod was only a minor part of the AUC radioactivity in plasma after oral dosing. Four main metabolic (or degradation) pathways were characterized. The first involved hydrolytic cleavage in the stomach to pentylaminoguanidine (PAG) and an aldehyde, which further underwent oxidation to M38.0 and subsequent conjugation to  M7.0  or  M29.0.  They  were  the  major  metabolites  in  plasma after oral administration in all species. The second pathway consisted of direct N-glucuronidation of tegaserod, to three isomeric metabolites (M43.2, M43.8 and M45.3). They were detected in all species except  the  dog.  The third pathway  involved  O-demethylation  of  tegaserod  (to  M52.8),  followed mainly  by  glucuronidation  (M40.6).  This  pathway  was  important  in  rodents,  minor  in  dogs  and undetectable  in  humans in  vivo ,  but  human  liver  microsomes  formed  M52.8.  A fourth pathway, consisted of oxidations in the indole substructure and subsequent conjugations, and was seen mainly in the rat.

The  fate  of  PAG  was  studied  specifically  in  mice.  The  possibility  that  nitroso  derivatives  of  PAG could  be  formed,  posing  a  genotoxic  risk,  was  discussed.  It  is  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  a genotoxic risk due to reaction of PAG with nitrite in the stomach is judged as negligible.

## · Excretion

Excretion of radioactivity was mainly via feces, while urine contained 8-25% of the dose (almost no unchanged tegaserod) in rodents and dogs.

## Toxicology

Rat, mouse, dog and rabbit were the main species used for toxicity testing. Exposure to all identified human  metabolites  appears  to  have  been  achieved  in  at  least  one  species  used  in  the  respective toxicology studies, and these species are therefore considered relevant models for safety testing.

## · Single dose toxicity

Single gavage dosing in mice was lethal at low doses (100 mg/kg), and therefore dietary dosing was used for repeat dose studies in rodents.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The repeat dose toxicity of tegaserod was carried out in mice, rats and dogs (capsule).

In mice, tegaserod mortalities occurred at 900 mg/kg/d for 13 weeks. Mucosal hyperplasia was seen in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the small intestine after 2 weeks (400 mg/kg/d).

In rats (26 weeks), and dogs (52 weeks), no organ toxicity was observed. Reduced body weight (BW) gain and food intake, and some clinical signs were seen in both species at the high doses tested (240 and 60/70 mg/kg/d, respectively). The NOEL (no observed effect level) was 60 mg/kg/d in rats and 15 mg/kg/d  in  dogs,  with  systemic  exposures  being  7-11  times  or  100  times  higher  than  the  clinical exposure.  There  were  certain  indications  of  hepatic  effects  (altered  enzyme  activities  with  no histopathological  correlates  in  mice  and  dogs;  slight  histopathological  alterations  with  no  enzyme changes in rats). However, overall there was no clear indication of hepatotoxicity.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)

The genotoxic potential of tegaserod was studied in vitro , in assays on bacterial mutations (Ames test), and  clastogencity  (HGPRT  locus  and  chromosome  aberration  tests  in  V79  cells)  and ex  vivo (unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes). Two in vivo studies in mice were undertaken at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); a bone marrow micronucleus test and a Comet assay, with tissues from the jejunum and liver (doses as in carcinogenicity study). Overall, there was no indication of genotoxic effects.

## · Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

Carcinogenicity  was  tested  in  CD-1  mice  dosed  for  104  weeks  and  Wistar  rats  dosed  for  110-124 weeks, via the diet. The MTD was reached in both species. The validity of both studies, as well as a 13-week mechanistic study in mice (971076), was seriously questioned due to the presence of small amount of drug in the plasma of a few control animals. After further clarification, it was concluded that the rat study was valid.

The applicant  was  also  asked  to  address  findings  of  haemangioma/sarcoma  in  the  rat  study.  It  was concluded that there was no indication of carcinogenicity in rats dosed for 2 years with tegaserod, at exposure levels 130 times above clinical exposure.

In mice, no convincing explanation for the presence of small amount of drug in the plasma of a few control animals was found. Nevertheless, the CPMP 1 advised that repetition of the 2-year mouse study may not be needed, if adequate mechanistic data were provided. As outlined below, the applicant has submitted new mechanistic studies.

In the mouse carcinogenicity study, adenocarcinomas were found in the small intestine of 8 animals (7 in  jejunum,  1  in  ileum)  from  the  high  dose  group  (600  mg/kg/d),  as  well  as  mucosal  hyperplasia. Mucosal  hyperplasia  of  intestinal  tissues  was  also  found  in  other  studies  of  shorter  duration  (see section on Repeat dose toxicity).

It  had  been  hypothesized  initially  that  inhibition  of  diamine  oxidase  (DAO)  could  be  involved  in mechanisms  triggering  intestinal  hyperplasia  and  neoplasia  in  mice.  However,  although  tegaserod appeared  to  inhibit  DAO  activity  both  after  acute  and  repeated  administration,  no  alteration  of polyamine levels in plasma, urine or intestinal tissues was identified after a single dose or up to 13 weeks dosing. Therefore the data provided did not support this proposed mechanism as solely being responsible for the observed tumours in mice.

The possibility that the interaction of tegaserod with 5-HT receptors was involved in the hyperplastic response was raised. The applicant undertook a set of studies, which showed that stimulation of 5-HT4 or 5-HT1A receptors was not involved in the intestinal hyperplasia induced by tegaserod.

Another  series  of  studies  provide  a  reasonable  mechanistic  explanation  for  the  intestinal  tumours observed in the mouse carcinogenicity study. It appears that high doses of tegaserod cause cellular stress, and that the sensitivity of human and mouse tissues was comparable in this respect. Such stress

1 The CHMP (Committee for Human Medicinal Products) was previously known as the CPMP (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products) prior to June 2004.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

may trigger  a  proliferative  response  in  the  intestinal  mucosa,  resulting  in  mucosal  hyperplasia  and upon  lifetime  treatment  this  hyperplasia  is  sustained  in  some  mice,  resulting  in  subsequent  tumour formation.  It  is  apparent  that  a  tumour  risk  does  not  exist  at  doses  that  do  not  induce  hyperplasia. These  additional  data  also  better  support  that  the  hyperplastic  response  was  due  to  local  tegaserod exposure. At the NOEL (150 mg/kg in mice); the margins are 18-fold for systemic exposure (AUC) and several 100-fold for local exposure (dose comparisons). These margins are considered sufficiently large  to  conclude  that  the  finding  of  intestinal  tumours  in  mice  is  not  of  concern  for  the  intended clinical use of tegaserod.

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

A standard series of reproduction and developmental toxicity studies were conducted by oral gavage in  rats  and  rabbits  (segment  II  only).  Marked  toxicity,  and  high  mortality  due  to  the  gavage administration,  limited  the  value  of  the  rat  studies.  Therefore,  in  total  four  diet  studies  were undertaken, where tegaserod was considerably better tolerated, despite that higher systemic exposures were achieved.

Female fertility and general reproductive performance (dosing 14 days before mating to gestation day 20 or lactation day 21) were studied in one gavage and one diet study, and two mechanistic gavage studies. These studies showed evidence for impaired implantation and early embryonic development, as  well  as  reduced  pup  survival.  Possible  NOELs  are  75  mg/kg/d  (diet)  or  6  mg/kg/d  (gavage). However, exposure margins are uncertain due to the presence of small amounts of drug in the plasma of a few control animals in the diet study and since tegaserod was not detected in plasma at 6 mg/kg/d (gavage). Hence the use of tegaserod in women attempting to conceive should be restricted.

No effects on male fertility were identified after gavage or diet dosing 9 weeks before and throughout mating, despite severe toxicity in the gavage study.

Peri-post natal development was studied in four diet studies of various designs. One also included a juvenile development part. In all studies, decreased F1 pup weights, and increased pup mortality were noted during weaning, possibly due to exposure during pregnancy, via milk and /or the diet. Based on the  totality  of  data,  the  NOEL  for  the  F 1 generation  is  25  mg/kg/d;  a  dose  for  which  no  systemic exposure  to  tegaserod  was  demonstrated  in  either  dams  or  offspring.  At  the  LOEL  (lowest observable/observed effect level) for pup mortality, the systemic exposure of dams was less than 2 times  the  clinical  exposure.  Delayed  sexual  development,  effects  on  various  other  developmental endpoints  and  reduced  body  weight  were  also  seen.  Thus,  women  who  breast  feed  should  not  be treated.

Concerns  were  raised  whether  tegaserod  altered  endocrine  function,  due  to  the  effects  on  early embryonic development /implantation parameters in rats, delayed sexual development in F1 offspring (testis  descent,  vaginal  opening),  findings  of  ovarian  cysts  in  tegaserod  treated  females  in  the  rat carcinogenicity study, and effects on hormones. Decreased prolactin (Gestation Day 3), and reduced estradiol  (Gestation  Day  21)  were  observed,  which may both be toxicologically relevant. However, data  from  another  study  revealed  no  hormonal  effects.  Thus,  the  overall  effect  of  tegaserod  on hormones  remains  unclear.  Additional  argumentation  by  the  applicant  has  not  provided  further clarification. However, the data are not clear-cut, and anti-androgenic effects were not evident in all studies. Thus, the anti-androgenic potential of tegaserod, if any, is weak although such a risk cannot be excluded  completely.  Nevertheless,  it  supports  the  conclusion  that  the  use  of  tegaserod  during pregnancy should be avoided.

In  juvenile  rats,  additional  noteworthy  findings  included  some  effects  on  organ  weights  and microscopic thyroid changes at high dose. The NOEL for juvenile animals was 75 mg/kg/d (AUC0-24 h of 250 ng*h/ml).

Segment II gavage studies were undertaken in rats and rabbits. In rats, maternal toxicity and mortality occurred, while no clear maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits. Embryotoxicity (retarded embryo/foetal development)  was  observed  in  both  species,  without  teratogenic  effects.  In  rats,  the  maternal  and developmental NOELs resulted in exposure margins of 8 or 30 times the clinical exposure. In rabbits,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

embryotoxicity was observed in all treated groups, with systemic exposure at the lowest dose 6 times higher  than  the  anticipated  clinical  exposure.  It  was  concluded  that  the  use  of  tegaserod  during pregnancy should be avoided.

## · Local tolerance

Repeat dose toxicity studies with i.v. infusion indicate that tegaserod has an irritant potential via the i.v. route. Data from sensitization models suggest that it has a low skin sensitization potential.

## · Other toxicity studies

Data from distribution studies indicate that tegaserod does bind to melanin. Tegaserod absorbs light in the UVA/B range and in the infrared region, within the wave-length range indicated in the Note for Guidance on Phototoxicity Testing CPMP/SWP/398/01. The applicant has undertaken a new study the 3T3  NRU PT assay,  which  shows  that  tegaserod  is  devoid  of  phototoxic  potential.  In  addition  the recently submitted data from the in vitro Comet assay addressing photogenotoxicity does not raise any concern.

Relevant impurities have been adequately qualified by their presence in pivotal toxicity studies.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Acute  studies  had  already  been  performed  according  to  the  regulatory  requirements  at  the  time  of submission, no chronic studies were performed for animal welfare reasons and because PEC/PNEC ratios based on acute studies using assessment factors up to 100,000 indicated no relevant risk.

All Phase II Tier A studies using unlabelled material have been performed, including an OECD 121 study. No chronic studies have been performed, since risk ratios based on already acquired acute data indicate  no  concern,  even  when  using  assessment  factors  up  to  100,000  and  references  (in  Kiefer 1999).  In  addition,  data  on  dissociation  constant  in  water  (OECD  112),  spectral  analysis  UV-VIS (OECD 101) and melting temperature (OECD 102) are available.

The adsorption - desorption study in soil (OECD 106) was ongoing during the procedure.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

According to the applicant, all clinical studies were conducted in full compliance with the principles of  Good  Clinical  Practice.  All  studies  were  closely  monitored  by  Novartis  personnel  or  a  contract organization for compliance to the protocol and the procedures described in it.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Absorption

After  oral  administration,  tegaserod  is  rapidly  absorbed  with  a  median  Tmax  of  1  h.  The  absolute bioavailability  is  about  10 %  under  fasting  conditions.  The  absorption  is  potentially  P-glycoprotein and pH-dependent.

A total of 5 oral formulations (2 capsules and 3 tablets) were used during the clinical development of Zelnorm. All phase III efficacy trials were performed with the same tablet formulation, the so-called final market image (FMI tablet), which was not the formulation eventually intended for marketing.

A new tablet formulation of Zelnorm (new FMI tablet) has been developed with a different qualitative and quantitative composition and similar in  vitro dissolution  profiles  that  is  manufactured  by  direct compression  (DC),  instead  of  wet  granulation  (WG).  A  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  to compare the new FMI tablet to the former FMI tablet used in phase III studies. The formulations were found to be bioequivalent with respect to AUC. For Cmax, the mean ratio and 90% confidence interval were 0.87 (0.79-0.97). The difference in Cmax between the new FMI tablet and the 'initial' FMI tablet is considered to lack clinical relevance, based on the relatively flat dose response relationship between 2 mg bid and 12 mg bid.

Cmax and AUC were reduced by 69 and 67%, respectively when the new FMI tablet was administered with food. A significant food effect has been observed, also with other formulations (the DSF capsule and the FMF tablet), with a reduction in the rate and extent of tegaserod absorption by 40-55 % for AUC0-∝ and 20-40 % for Cmax. The effect of food on the 'initial' FMI tablet was not studied. It was recommended  to  take  tegaserod  orally  before  a  meal.  Phase  III  efficacy  trials  were  performed according to this dosing recommendation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Distribution

Tegaserod  has  a  relatively  high  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  of  368  ±  223L  (after  i.v. administration). The 20-fold decrease in plasma concentration within 1 h after termination of the i.v. infusion suggests that distribution is rapid. In human plasma, the fraction bound was approximately 98 %,  mainly  to α 1-acid  glycoprotein.  In  concentrations  exceeding  those  of  the  parent  drug, metabolite M 29.0 does not displace tegaserod from its binding sites.

The potential role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in CNS penetration of tegaserod was further investigated. As P-gp is an ATP-dependent efflux transporter expressed in the blood-brain barrier, the transport may limit CNS distribution of tegaserod. This was also supported by the findings in mdr-1-knockout mice. The quantitative  role  of  P-gp  is  at  present  unknown.  It  cannot  therefore  be  excluded  that  the  CNS distribution of tegaserod increases in the presence of an inhibitor of P-gp in man.

## · Elimination

The  plasma  clearance  of  tegaserod  is  77 ±15 L/h,  with  an  estimated  terminal  half-life  (t1/2)  of approximately  11 hours following i.v administration. The  variability in exposure  during oral administration (Cmax and AUC) appears to be about ±50%.

The metabolism of tegaserod is somewhat unclear. Tegaserod is metabolised via two pathways. The first is a presystemic acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach followed by oxidation and conjugation, which  produces  the  main  metabolite  of  tegaserod,  5-methoxy-indole-3-carboxylic  acid  glucuronide (M29.0). In man, systemic exposure to tegaserod was not statistically significantly altered at neutral gastric pH values. The second metabolic pathway of tegaserod degradation is direct glucuronidation, which  leads  to  generation  of  three  isomeric  N-glucuronides.  The  metabolite  to  parent  drug  plasma concentration (Cmax) ratio is approximately 19 and 10 for M29.0 and M7.0, respectively. It may not be excluded that tegaserod also is partly eliminated by biliary secretion.

Unchanged tegaserod accounts for only few percent of total radioactivity in plasma. The predominant compound in plasma is the metabolite M29.0. The majority of the radioactively labelled compounds are  excreted  in  the  faeces  (58 %,  mainly  as  unchanged  tegaserod)  and  27  %  in  urine  (mainly  as metabolite M29.0, no unchanged tegaserod). Total recovery of the dose is 85 % within 168 h.

The main metabolite, as expected, has negligible affinity for 5-HT4 receptors.

## · Dose and time-dependencies

The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  tegaserod  is  dose  proportional  for  AUC0-∝ and  Cmax  after  single administration and for Cmax,ss  at  steady state in the range 2 to12 mg given twice daily for five days. There is no accumulation at multiple-dose conditions.

## · Special populations

The PK parameters are similar in healthy volunteers and IBS patients.

To assess the effect of demographic variables on the PK of Zelnorm, exploratory model building was applied  to  pooled  single  oral  dose  data  (n=134)  from  several  studies  in  healthy  subjects.  Based  on exploratory model building, body weight was considered the most important covariate in the analyses, since  systemic  concentrations  of  tegaserod  were  significantly  lower  in  patients  with  higher  body weight. A pooled statistical analysis predicted that the AUC for a patient weighing 100 kg would be 50%  lower  than  for  a  patient  weighing  50kg. A  smaller  analysis  in  patients  did  not  confirm  the relationship. There appears to be no relationship between weight and response. Given the variability in tegaserod PK, as well as the shallow dose-response relationship, dose adjustment based on individual body weight is not considered to be necessary . Allowing  for  body  weight  as  the  first  covariate,  no other demographic covariates such as gender, age and ethnic origin, were shown to be of significant influence on any PK parameter of tegaserod in healthy subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An  additional  special  age/gender  PK  study  in  healthy  volunteers  showed  a  difference  in  PK parameters between elderly and young females, with higher exposure of tegaserod in elderly females (AUC and Cmax are 40 and 22% higher, respectively). This finding remains within the variability in Zelnorm PK in healthy subjects, and, is therefore not expected to have clinical relevance. There was no difference between elderly and young males.

The  study  performed  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment  showed  a  significantly increased  bioavailability  of  tegaserod  (AUC0-∝ increased  by  52 %,  AUC0-t  by  46%  and  Cmax  by 26 %).  These  findings  reveal  a  clear  trend  towards  increased  exposure  of  Zelnorm  in  patients  with impaired hepatic function. Caution would be recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Zelnorm is not recommended to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

A  study  performed  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  showed  that  the  PK  parameters  of tegaserod did not change significantly, with the exception of a prolonged mean elimination half-life from 8.5h to 14.1h, which could lead to accumulation of tegaserod in a multiple dose regimen. The tegaserod half-life of 14.1 h would give rise to only a small accumulation at steady state (ca. 25%) and is considered to be of little concern. In addition, systemic exposure (AUC) and peak concentration of the metabolite M29.0 increased 11- and 2.5-fold respectively, in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy controls. However, there are no indications of pharmacological activity of this glucuronide.  No  dose  adjustment  would  be  recommended  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  renal impairment,  but  the  use  of  Zelnorm  would  not  be  recommended  in  patients  with  severe  renal impairment.

## · Pharmacokinetic interactions

Tegaserod appears to be transported by P-glycoprotein. The P-gp inhibitor quinidine was observed to increase the systemic exposure of tegaserod by 74%. In addition, the distribution to CNS and other 'Pgp-protected'  tissues  may  be  increased.  Other  P-gp  inhibitors  are  also  likely  to  affect  tegaserod exposure and distribution. Inducers of P-gp may reduce the bioavailability of Zelnorm.

Coadministration of Zelnorm with digoxin resulted in a decreased bioavailability of digoxin (AUC0-∝ decrease by 14 % and Cmax decrease by 16 %). The predicted concentrations in steady state of digoxin concomitantly administered with tegaserod was 85% of that after administration of digoxin alone, and therefore,  plasma  concentration  monitoring  would  be  recommended  when  Zelnorm  is  administered concomitantly.

In  one  study  omeprazole  (+bicarbonate)  reduced  the  bioavailability  of  concomitantly  administered tegaserod,  possibly  as  a  result  of  an  increased  gastric  pH.  This  effect  was  not  observed  in  another study when tegaserod was administered simultaneously with enteric-coated omeprazol. The effect of an increased pH probably lacks clinical relevance and is not considered to be clinically relevant..

In vivo drug-drug interaction studies with theophylline (CYP1A2 prototype substrate), dextromethorphan  (CYP2D6  prototype  substrate),  warfarin,  and  oral  contraceptives  indicate  no clinically relevant effects of tegaserod on these drugs and on CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates. In vitro studies indicate that tegaserod does not inhibit CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 and 2E1 in vivo .

There were some indications of a modest induction both in tegaserod multiple dose pharmacokinetics and in the interaction studies with digoxin, warfarin and oral contraceptives. Although the effect was small, there may be drug combinations for which this is clinically significant. Therefore tegaserod was examined  for  its  potential  to  induce  CYP3A4  and  ABCB1  (P-gp)  mRNA,  and  CYP3A  activity  in primary human hepatocytes of three individual donors after 72 h of incubation. A slight 3A4 induction was observed in cells from one out of three livers. Both increases in mRNA and 3A4 activity were observed.  However,  the  increases  were  small  and  seemed  not  to  be  dose-related.  The  cause  of  the difference between livers is unknown but large inter-individual variability in inducibility both in vivo and in vitro has been observed for other inducers. An in vivo CYP3A4 induction study with an oral CYP3A4  marker  to  confirm  the  complete  absence  of  enzyme  induction  was  not  considered  to  be necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

The pharmacodynamic properties of tegaserod have been evaluated with respect to effects on colonic transit time, colonic tone and phasic motility, small bowel transit time, lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and oesophageal pH, gastric emptying, rectal sensitivity, and anorectal motor activity.

The mechanism of action is shown to be stimulation of the peristaltic reflex (promotile effect on the GIT) via activation of 5-HT4 receptors in the GIT.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Constipation-IBS (IBS-C)

Study B304 assessed the effect of Zelnorm (2 mg bid during 4 weeks) on rectal sensitivity compared to placebo in 12 patients with IBS-C and rectal hypersensitivity. Zelnorm showed neither a clinically relevant  nor  a  statistically  significant  difference  to  placebo  in  the  relative  pressure  change  (relative change  from  pre-treatment  in  the  lowest  distension  pressure  eliciting  rectal  pain  grade ≥ 4  or  the highest  pressure  reached  if  no  score  exceeded  3),  rectal  compliance  during  distension,  time  to  first sensation  during  distension,  bloating,  urge  for  defecation,  unpleasantness  and  rectal  tone  pre-  and post-dilatation.  In  conclusion,  Zelnorm  at  2  mg  bid  did  not  have  any  significant  effect  on  rectal compliance.

Study  B357  assessed  the  effects  of  Zelnorm  (2  mg  bid  during  12  days)  on  GI  transit  compared  to placebo  in  24  patients  with  IBS-C.  Zelnorm  did  not  show  a  statistically  significant  difference  to placebo in both primary efficacy variables: mean colonic transit time was similar in both groups and half proximal colonic emptying time was accelerated by approximately 20% with tegaserod.

Non-clinical findings indicating a decrease in prolactin secretion following administration of tegaserod in rats, led to a study for the determination of prolactin in human plasma. Compared to placebo, single and multiple oral administrations of 25 mg and 100 mg of tegaserod (b.i.d. for 15 days) did not affect prolactin secretion to a clinically relevant extent.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response studies

A  total  of  three  studies  B251,  B301  and  B351  included  dose-finding  elements.  Zelnorm  was administered bid and within 30 minutes prior to meals. Dosing interval and timing of doses were based on the following considerations:

- IBS symptoms are typically related to meals, and once daily dosing was thought to be unlikely to offer adequate relief from symptoms around both morning and evening meals.
- The  pharmacokinetics  of  tegaserod,  with  a  t1/2 of  approximately  11 hours  and  a  tmax  of approximately 1 hour are more consistent with bid dosing than with once daily (o.d) dosing.

In study B251 investigating doses between 0.5 mg bid and 12 mg bid, an apparently bell-shaped doseresponse curve was identified in terms of symptom relief. In studies B301 and B351, 6 mg bid was found to be numerically better than 2 mg bid after 4 weeks of therapy. However, data to support the selection of the 6 mg bid dose were considered rather weak.

- Main study

## Study A2306

The efficacy claims are based on 1 key study - A2306, with two primary efficacy variables and a 4week repeated  treatment  design.  Study  A2306  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and safety of repeated treatment with tegaserod 6 mg bid and placebo in women with IBS-C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study was conducted in 24 countries worldwide.

## METHODS

Study A2306 consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 2-week baseline period (no medication), and two 4-week placebo-controlled treatment periods (first and repeated treatment - Period 1 and Period 2), which were separated by a treatment-free interval of 2 to 12 weeks.

<!-- image -->

Patients  assessed  several  symptoms  either  daily  or  weekly  during  all  study  periods.  However  the decision  for  inclusion  of  a  patient  into  Period  2  was  based  on  the  weekly  assessments  of  the two primary variables: satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms and satisfactory relief of abdominal discomfort/pain.

At the end of Period 1, patients who had at least a partial response (partial responders) entered the treatment-free interval. A partial responder to treatment was defined as a patient who had experienced satisfactory  relief  of  at  least  one  of  the  primary  variables,  for  at  least  2 weeks  out  of  the  4-week treatment period.

In the treatment free interval, patients who experienced a recurrence of symptoms, defined as lack of satisfactory relief of both primary variables in 3 out of 4 consecutive weeks, were eligible to receive repeated treatment.

Non-responders at the end of Period 1 were excluded from further participation in the study.

## Study Participants

The study population comprised of women from 18 to 65 years of age, who met ROME II criteria for IBS-C.

Patients  had  to  have  at  least  12 weeks  (not  necessarily  consecutive)  in  the  preceding  12 months  of abdominal discomfort/pain with 2 out of 3 features:

- 1) relieved with defecation and/or
- 2) onset associated with a change in frequency of stools and/or
- 3) onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.

Patients also had to meet the criteria stated in the IBS Questionnaire during the last 3 months prior to study entry.

Patients were excluded if they had 'diarrhoea ≥ 25%' (significant diarrhoea associated with IBS-C at least 25% of the time during the past 3 months), showed evidence of cathartic colon or a history of laxative abuse, or if they had other significant bowel disorders.

## Treatments

In  both  periods,  the  study  had  two  treatment  arms:  placebo  or  Zelnorm  6  mg.  Each  patient  was required to take one tablet containing tegaserod 6 mg or placebo as appropriate twice daily within 30 minutes before breakfast and the evening meal. Dose variation was not permitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The total study duration for an individual patient was between 6 and 26 weeks, depending on the time to recurrence of IBS symptoms.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to assess the:

- 1) 4-week efficacy of Zelnorm during Period 1 and
- 2) efficacy of re-treatment with Zelnorm during Period 2 in patients who had at least a partial response during Period 1.

The secondary objectives were to assess the:

- 1) efficacy of Zelnorm on individual IBS symptoms
- 2) time of onset of IBS symptom relief following tegaserod treatment, using these measures
- 3) recurrence of IBS symptoms after withdrawal of Zelnorm treatment
- 4) safety and tolerability of Zelnorm during repeated 4-week treatments.

The tertiary objectives were to assess the:

- 1) disease specific quality of life (IBS-QoL),
- 2) health state,
- 3) work productivity
- 4) satisfaction with treatment.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Two primary endpoints were selected:

- 1) relief of overall IBS symptoms and
- 2) relief of abdominal discomfort/pain.

These  primary  endpoints  were  assessed  on  a  weekly  basis,  using  a  binary  scale  (yes/no)  with  the following questions:

- -Did you have satisfactory relief of your overall IBS symptoms during the last week?
- -Did you have satisfactory relief of your abdominal discomfort or pain during the last week?

During  each  treatment  period,  a  responder  for  satisfactory  relief  of  overall  IBS  symptoms  and satisfactory  relief  of  abdominal  discomfort/pain  was  defined  as  a  patient  who  recorded  satisfactory relief, for at least 3 out of the first 4 weeks of that period ('75% rule').

Primary efficacy variables were analyzed for each treatment period:

1. Response for satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms during first treatment
2. Response for satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms during repeated treatment
3. Response for satisfactory relief of abdominal discomfort/pain during first treatment
4. Response for satisfactory relief of abdominal discomfort/pain during repeated treatment

To examine if the response of the primary variables was consistent with individual symptom response, the association between the primary variables and individual symptoms was evaluated.

## Secondary efficacy variables included:

- Relief  of  overall  IBS  symptoms  and  abdominal  discomfort/pain  using  a  second  responder definition,  requiring  at  least  2 weeks  with  satisfactory  relief  within  the  first  4 weeks  of treatment (50% rule).
- Daily assessments of individual IBS symptoms, namely: intensity of abdominal discomfort/pain and abdominal bloating, stool consistency and stool frequency.
- Weekly assessment of relief of constipation
- The time to onset of improvement of overall and individual IBS symptoms based on daily and weekly assessments mentioned above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tertiary  efficacy  variables  were  assessed  using  questionnaires  for  the  quality  of  life  (IBS-QoL), satisfaction  with  treatment,  health  state  evaluation  (EQ-5D),  and  Work  Productivity  and  Activities Impairment for IBS (WPAI-IBS).

## Sample size

The samples were calculated in order to detect a treatment difference of 15% in relief of overall IBS symptoms  and  10%  in  relief  of  abdominal  discomfort/pain  during  each  treatment  period,  at  an assumed placebo response rate of 50%.

A sample size of 2000 patients in the Zelnorm group and 500 patients in the placebo group in Period 1, and 535 per treatment group in Period 2 was considered sufficient based on the above listed criteria with 85% power at a significance level of 0.05.

The target enrolment for Period 1 was 2500 women with IBS-C, randomised in a 4:1 ratio (Zelnorm: 2000,  placebo:  500)  using  an  IVR  (Interactive  Voice  Randomisation)  System.  For  Period  2,  the enrolment target was 1070 patients randomised in a 1:1 ratio, who were on Zelnorm during Period 1 and  showed  at  least  a  partial  response,  and  whose  symptoms  recurred  during  the  treatment-free interval.

## Randomisation

During Period 1, patients were randomly assigned to either Zelnorm or placebo (allocation ratio 4:1). In Period 2 those who were in the tegaserod group in Period 1 were randomized to either Zelnorm or placebo (allocation ratio 1:1). Those who were in the placebo group during Period 1 were assigned (mock randomised) to tegaserod in Period 2.

## Blinding (masking)

The double-blind study drugs (tegaserod and placebo) were identical with regard to color, appearance, and  packaging.  Emergency  code  breaks  for  serious  adverse  events  were  performed  using  the  IVR System.

## Statistical methods

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population of Period 1 was defined as all patients randomized into Period 1, irrespective of whether or not they took any study medication.

The ITT population in the treatment free interval was defined as all patients in the ITT population in Period 1 who entered the treatment free interval.

The ITT population of Period 2 was defined as all patients from the Zelnorm group in Period 1 that were randomized to study treatment in Period 2. The ITT placebo-Zelnorm population in Period 2 was defined  as  all  patients  who  received  placebo  during  Period  1  and  were  (mock)  randomized  to tegaserod in Period 2.

Using the ITT populations, relief of overall IBS symptoms and of abdominal discomfort/pain during the first and repeated treatment were compared between treatment periods using the Cochran-MantelHaenszel test, stratified by centre. Treatment differences and 95% confidence intervals presented were calculated using this model.

The analysis of the 2 primary efficacy variables, at 2 timepoints used a sequentially rejective multiple testing  procedure on the four statistical tests in order to maintain the overall two-sided significance level of 0.05. The testing hierarchy followed the order as presented in the list of the primary efficacy variables mentioned above.

The Per Protocol (PP) population was generally defined as all ITT patients without any major protocol violations.

Odds ratios were calculated based on logistic regression models.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Longitudinal  analyses  of  the  weekly  response  rates  were  performed  using  General  Estimation Equation (GEE) models, with p-values derived for each week and overall week 1-4.

In addition, Number Needed to Treat (NNT), calculated as the reciprocal of the treatment difference in responder rates is presented.

Secondary  and  tertiary  efficacy  variables  were  analysed  with  appropriate  statistical  methods.  No corrections for multiple testing were applied.

Background information, demographics, study medication, concomitant medications, study completion information, and safety data were listed and summarized descriptively by treatment group.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

A total of 4689 patients from 24 countries were screened. The most frequent reason for screen failure before  baseline  was  withdrawal  of  consent.  Most  patients  who  entered  baseline  and  were  not randomized did not meet the diagnostic/severity criteria. Few patients were discontinued during first treatment. Reasons for discontinuation were similar for both groups, the most common reason being unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Very few patients were discontinued during repeated treatment with similar  reasons  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  percentage  of  patients  that  withdrew  due  to  adverse events was similar for both placebo and Zelnorm in all the periods of the study.

There were 3 randomized patients who were 66 years of age. These patients are included throughout the analyses presented (even though headers indicate 'women, up to 65 years'). Protocol deviations did not affect the study results.

## Conduct of the study

The  study  was  performed  according  to  Good  Clinical  Practice  recommendations  and  following  all international ethics principles, according to the applicant.

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characteristics  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  Most  patients  were Caucasian, pre-menopausal and between the ages of 25 and 55 years, with an overall mean age of 42.0 years. Nearly all patients fulfilled the Rome I and Rome II criteria. A high grading of discomfort and bloating was noticed compared with prior studies.

In Period 1, 301 patients were excluded from the PP population. The most common reasons for exclusion were:

- Use of laxatives &gt; 1 day/week (172 patients).
- Satisfactory relief for either of the primary efficacy variables during either of the 2 weeks of
- Mean stool consistency score &lt; 4 during the last 14 days of baseline (52 patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline (45 patients).

A total of 298 patients were excluded from the PP population in Period 2. The most common reasons for exclusion were:

- Recurrence criteria in treatment-free-interval not fulfilled (122 patients).
- Use of laxatives &gt; 1 day/week (71 patients).
- Partial response criteria in Period 1 not fulfilled (102 patients).

The  primary  population  for  efficacy  analysis  was  the  ITT  population  and  therefore  only  the  ITT results are discussed in this report. The PP population was used in supportive analyses. This approach was considered adequate by the CHMP.

## Outcomes and estimation

Two response criteria were prospectively defined for relief of symptoms:

- -satisfactory relief of IBS symptoms for at least 3 out of 4 weeks (primary efficacy variable, 75% rule) and
- -satisfactory relief of IBS symptoms for at least 2 out of 4 weeks (secondary efficacy variable, 50% rule).

Results  for  relief  of  overall  IBS  symptoms  and  abdominal  discomfort  or  pain  for  at  least  3  out  of 4 weeks (primary efficacy variable, 75% rule) are shown in the following table.

## Combined response for overall IBS symptoms and abdominal discomfort or pain

In Period 1, the majority of patients meeting the response definition for one variable (relief of overall IBS symptoms), were also responders for the second variable (relief of abdominal discomfort or pain). Few patients (&lt;5.7%) were responders for only one variable.

The  combined  response  according  to  the  75%  rule  (i.e.  responders  for  both  relief  of  overall  IBS symptoms  and  relief  of  abdominal  discomfort  or  pain)  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  the Zelnorm  (tegaserod)  group  compared  to  placebo  in  both  treatment  periods  (9.5%  in  Period  1  and 14.8% in Period 2), but failed to reach the pre-defined 15%.

## Secondary efficacy

Using  the  50%  rule,  50.5%  of  patients  receiving  Zelnorm  had  satisfactory  relief  of  overall  IBS symptoms compared to 39.8% receiving placebo during Period 1. With repeated treatment, 60.5% of patients receiving Zelnorm and 42.8% receiving placebo reported satisfactory relief. Both treatment differences, 10.6% and 17.0%, were significant (p&lt;0.0001). For first and repeated treatment, the NNT were 9.4 and 5.9, and the odds ratios were 1.58 and 2.16.

Applying  the  50%  rule,  with  first  treatment,  47.8%  of  patients  receiving  Zelnorm  had  satisfactory relief of abdominal discomfort/pain compared to 38.7% receiving placebo. With repeated treatment, 58.8% of patients receiving Zelnorm and 38.8% receiving placebo reported satisfactory relief. Both treatment differences, 9.0% and 19.9%, were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0003). For first and repeated treatment, the NNT were 11.1 and 5.0, and the odds ratios were 1.48 and 2.51.

## Maintenance of effect

During  the  evaluation,  further  data  were  presented  by  the  applicant  on  the  proportion  of  patients having responded during Period 1, who maintain the same or higher level of response during Period 2. In Table 6 the response in Period 2 among patients who responded in Period 1 are presented for relief of overall symptoms of IBS and for relief of discomfort/pain separate and combined for the tegaserodtegaserod and the tegaserod-placebo groups.

## Recurrence

During the treatment-free interval approximately 50% of the ITT responders experienced a recurrence of  symptoms  within  4 weeks  and  70%  within  8  weeks.  There  were  more  tegaserod-treated  patients with  recurrence  at  each  week  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients.  Similarly,  the  proportion  of patients  requiring  an  increased  laxative  intake,  and  the  number  of  days  on  laxatives,  tended  to  be higher among those being treated with Zelnorm during the first period.

## Weekly relief of constipation

The proportion of patients  reporting  satisfactory  relief  of  constipation  was  statistically  significantly greater with Zelnorm than with placebo during first and second treatment periods, as shown in the next figure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Proportion of patients with satisfactory relief of constipation

p&lt;0.05, Tegaserod versus placebo, using GEE analysis for Wks 1-4 and logistic regression for EOT. EOT = end of treatment, Only values during the last 7 days of treatment are considered for EOT.

<!-- image -->

Statistical  significance  favouring  Zelnorm  (tegaserod)  was  achieved  for  the  remaining  secondary endpoints  including  stool  frequency  and  consistency,  weekly  number  of  days  with  no  bowel movements, early effect (Days 1-7) on bowel movements and stool consistency; number of days with hard or very hard stools and the other assessments of abdominal discomfort or pain, bloating, bowel movements.

## Tertiary efficacy

## ¾ IBS-QoL (Quality of Life)

Tegaserod-treatment showed a statistically significant effect on the IBS-QoL versus placebo on the overall score, as well as on 5 of the 8 domains (dysphoria, body image, health worry, food avoidance, and relationship).

## ¾ Overall satisfaction with treatment

There  was  a  statistically  significantly  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Zelnorm  group  who reported:

- -satisfactory relief of abdominal pain/discomfort, constipation, and other symptoms,
- -level of expectations being met or exceeded,
- -greater relief of IBS symptoms with study medication versus previous medication use,
- -willingness to use the drug in the future,
- -willingness to recommend the medication to other patients with IBS

## ¾ EQ-5D health state questionnaire

The  EQ-5D  health  state  questionnaire  was  introduced  after  the  start  of  the  study,  in  protocol amendment 1. The questionnaire was completed at baseline and end of first treatment by 238 Zelnorm patients and 44 placebo patients. Considering the small numbers of patients, trends seen in the EQ-5D results did not reach statistical significance.

## ¾ Work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI-IBS)

Baseline  values  in  WPAI-IBS  scores  were  balanced  between  treatment  groups  and  indicative  of  a population with working and activity impairment. Patients on Zelnorm had significantly greater work productivity compared with placebo patients such as; greater presenteeism (5.4% improvement over

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo), less absenteeism (2.6% improvement over placebo), less work impairment (6.3% improvement over placebo), less activity impairment (3.5% improvement over placebo).

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The applicant provided additional information to support the efficacy, based on the results of the 5 supportive,  double  blind  3-month  studies  that  were  reanalysed  focusing  on  the  first  4  weeks  of therapy, in women below 65 years of age and, as far as possible, on response rates based on similar, but less stringent outcome measures as those in the pivotal study. A meta-analysis of previous clinical trials was performed to claim consistency of the results with the pivotal study A2306 (See below and Discussion on clinical efficacy).

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The magnitude of the treatment effect in the pivotal study did not meet the pre-specified objectives. Instead  of  a  15%  (absolute)  difference  in  response  rate,  which  in  the  view  of  the  CHMP  was considered  a  treatment  difference  necessary  to  allow  conclusion  of  clinical  relevance,  only  a  9+% difference  was  achieved  in  the  first  treatment  period  -  Period  1.  The  combined  response  rates  for Period  1,  i.e.  relief  of  overall  symptoms  and  pain  were  28.1%  vs.  18.5%  [95%  CI;  6%;  14%]. Secondary endpoints, including effects on constipation, pain relief, bloating, stool consistency, bowel movements, were statistically significant but the magnitude of the treatment effects in absolute terms was as low as those reported for the co-primary endpoints.

In  most  patient-derived  outcome  measures,  the  absolute  difference  between  placebo  and  Zelnorm (tegaserod)  was between 10 to 15%. This was true also in cases where a large placebo/study effect is present, such as 'Would you use the study medication in the future for IBS?' - 77% (Zelnorm) vs. 64% (placebo).

It was noted that the placebo effect was between 22-29%, rather than the assumed 50%. Although the onset of relief with Zelnorm appears to be rapid, it is nevertheless noted that the response pattern to both placebo and Zelnorm run in parallel over the evaluation period, indicating that the response to placebo increases over time.

The applicant provided further arguments to support the clinical relevance of the findings, which are summarised below together with CHMP's view on these:

- -For individuals identified as responders to treatment, there was on average an improvement in the key  symptoms  from  baseline,  i.e.  abdominal  discomfort/pain,  bloating,  and  stool  consistency corresponding to 1.4 to 2.1 points on the 7-point scale. This magnitude of improvement was also seen  for  patients  identified  as  responders  by  the  co-primary  variable,  satisfactory  relief  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

abdominal pain in study A2306. The applicant argues that a change of 0.5 points or more on the 7point scale is  generally  considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  CHMP,  however,  has  not questioned  the  relevance  of  'response'  according  to  agreed  criteria,  but  the  low  percentage  of responders.  In  this  context  it  may  be  noted  that  the  change  in  placebo  responders  was approximately similar for all key symptoms except for number of bowel movements/week where the difference, in line with the mechanisms of action, differed in favour of Zelnorm (tegaserod).

- -To allow a comparison with the A2306 results, earlier studies were retrospectively analyzed for the  treatment  effect  after  4  weeks  in  the  target  population,  using  the  75%  rule,  where  possible. Disease characteristics at baseline were similar between the studies. Responder rates for overall symptom  relief  were  consistent  across  studies  and  variables  in  the  key  study  A2306  and  the 5 supportive trials.

Based  on  a  fixed  effects  meta-analytic  algorithm  (Cochrane  Collaboration  manual)  the  mean therapeutic gain across all studies was 12.1% [CI 9.6; 14.3], corresponding to a NNT of 8.3 [CI 6.9; 10.4]. If the meta-analysis is applied on the study results based on the '50% rule' response definition, the mean treatment gain is 13.8% [CI 11.2; 16.3] and the NNT 7.3 [CI 6.1; 9.0]. The CHMP noted these results, as well as the fact that a treatment gain of 15% in the relief of overall IBS  symptoms  could  not  be  demonstrated.  Importantly,  while  these  studies  provide  conceptual support, more weight must be put on the effect size estimate derived from the pivotal study.

Despite  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  applicant  relating  to  consistency  between  studies  and different patient derived outcome measures such as QoL, presentism at work, etc, the modest activity observed with Zelnorm (tegaserod) was seen as a major concern.

## Maintenance of the treatment effect

The selection criteria for Period 2 led to an enrichment of the patient population, where 46% of the patients entered the second cycle. In an enriched population, a high response rate is expected. In this respect, the increase in the response rate in Period 2 (approximately 45% Zelnorm vs. 29% placebo;  i.e.  16%  absolute  difference)  in  the  relief  of  overall  IBS  symptoms  as  compared  to Period 1 (approximately 34% Zelnorm vs. 24% placebo) was modest, and not considered to be convincing.  This  suggests  a  significant  inter-occasion  variability,  but  a  possible  loss  of  a substantial part of the treatment effect with subsequent treatment courses is a concern. The fact that not only patients with complete response, but also patients with partial response were eligible for the second period is likely to have influenced the response rate observed in Period 2. It was therefore  not  considered  possible  to  make  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  magnitude  of  the treatment effect that is lost in subsequent treatment courses.

In  this  context  it  should  be  noted  that  2  out  of  3  patients  treated  with  placebo  found  that  the results of therapy were sufficiently good to support the use of 'placebo' in patients with IBS-C (vs. 3 out of 4 on Zelnorm). These results cannot be translated to what would happen in clinical practice where, on the one hand, the study effect is absent and, on the other hand, patients know that  they  are  on  active  therapy.  Several  single  arm  studies  indicate  that  between  2/3  to  5/6  of patients report 'satisfactory relief' of IBS symptoms.

The applicant provided further information in response to this issue. The response in Period 2 of the patients by response in Period 1 were presented for relief of overall symptoms of IBS and for relief  of  discomfort/pain  separate  and  combined  for  the  tegaserod-tegaserod  and  the  tegaserodplacebo  groups.  In  the  tegaserod-group  for  both  variables  the  responder  rates  in  Period  2  was about 50% using the 75% rule, and the responder rate using the 50%-rule in Period 2 was about 64%.  Responder  rates  for  the  combined  endpoint  were  between  50%  and  61%,  respectively. Although the difference from placebo in Period 1 in this population has not been assessed, the incremental effect over placebo in Period 2 ranged between 12 - 20% (75% rule) and 20 - 22% (50% rule) for the individual and the combined variables.

In view of the data and the arguments provided by the applicant, the CHMP was not assured of the maintenance effect of Zelnorm (tegaserod) in recurrent IBS-C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recurrence

During  the  treatment-free  interval  approximately  50%  of  the  ITT  responders  experienced  a recurrence  of  symptoms  within  4 weeks  and  70%  within  8  weeks.  There  were  more  Zelnormtreated patients with recurrence at each week compared to placebo treated patients. Similarly the proportion of patients requiring an increased laxative intake, and the number of days on laxatives, tended to be higher among those being treated with Zelnorm during the first period.

The applicant argued that this may reflect the patient's desire to compensate for the withdrawal of a pharmacological  active  compound  and  that  the  provided  data  support  the  absence  of  a  rebound phenomenon. However the CHMP disagreed, considering the data from Study 0358, which show similar results even if non-responders were not excluded. The observed trend in the use of laxatives and the small differences in the rate of reappearance of IBS symptoms during the treatment free interval  were  recognised,  and  the  possibility  of  a  rebound  phenomena  was  considered  to  be  a matter of concern.

On  16  November  '05,  the  CHMP  invited  gastroenterology  experts  to  the  CHMP  discussion  on Zelnorm and to the oral explanation made by the applicant. During this oral explanation, the applicant presented  the  available  data  to  argue  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  efficacy  and  a  favourable  safety profile of Zelnorm (tegaserod). Following this discussion, some experts supported the view that the small effect size was not considered to be clinically relevant.

The magnitude of the treatment effect that did not meet the pre-specified objectives and the clinical relevance of the observed efficacy was seriously questioned by the CHMP. Moreover, in the second period,  which  studied  an  enriched  population,  the  effect  size  was  smaller  than  expected  from  the results in Period 1. Hence, available data do not support maintenance of an effect.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

Tegaserod (the active substance of Zelnorm) is currently authorised in 56 countries for the treatment of IBS-C at a dose of 6 mg bid and for a duration of up to 3 months. The estimated number of patient years is about 300,000 (March 31 st 2004).

The key 4-week safety population comes from 6 studies with a total of 3032 patients on tegaserod and 2166  patients  on  placebo,  while  the  largest  controlled  data  set  including  also  other  indications encompasses about 9000 patients on tegaserod and 5000 on placebo. Included here are two long-term (52 w.) dose-comparative (2mg vs. 6mg bid) studies in a total of about 1400 patients.

An increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, mainly diarrhoea, has been documented. These  events  relate  to  the  pharmacology  of  tegaserod.  The  short  time  to  onset  of  diarrhoea  is noticeable and underscores the pharmacological character of this adverse reaction.

Generally, no action or intervention was necessary in patients reporting diarrhoea.  Dose adjustment, interrupting, or discontinuation of treatment or use of concomitant medication(s) related to diarrhoea were  more  frequent  with  tegaserod  than  placebo.  In  one  case  (2 mg bid,  Day  1)  diarrhoea  was associated with dizziness and hypotension and led to discontinuation from the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analyses performed for double-blind 4- and 12-week studies within this subset indicate that headache is the most frequent single adverse event, both in the Zelnorm (tegaserod) and the placebo treatment groups.

Estimates  of  the  incidence  of  diarrhoea  with  clinically  significant  consequences  (CSC-diarrhoea) associated  with  the  long-term  (repeated  courses)  use  of  tegaserod  have  been  provided.  In  the controlled studies, rare cases of CSC-diarrhoea were reported in 3/9284 patients (0.03%) on tegaserod, and  in  uncontrolled  studies  1/5877  patients  (0.02%)  on  tegaserod.  The  time  between  onset  of tegaserod therapy and the occurrence of CSC-diarrhoea in the 4 reported cases was 1-49 days (median 4.5 days)

Based on the worldwide sales data up to 30 April 2005, there are 43 cases of CSC-diarrhoea resulting in  a  reporting  rate  of  43/640,215  patient-years,  or  6.7  cases/100,000  patient-years.  The  duration  of tegaserod treatment prior to the occurrence of the CSC-diarrhoea in the post-marketing experience was between 1 and 7 days in the 21 patients for whom exposure data were available.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There  were  6 deaths  in  clinical  development,  1 in  the  key  4 week  safety  population  and  5 in  other populations (5 IBS patients and 1 chronic constipation patient); 3 during the study or in the 30-day follow-up period, and 3 at a later stage. Patients who died had all taken tegaserod, but no deaths were felt by the investigator to be related to study drug, demographic factors or other therapies.

IBS patients constitute a vulnerable population for psychiatric events. Two suicides are perhaps not unexpected, but strengthen the signal with respect to 'psychiatric events' discussed further below.

Analyses of a US claims database (MarketScan) show that the reported incidence of suicide tendency, suicidal  behaviour,  depression,  anxiety,  etc.  is  approximately  doubled  for  patients  with  IBS/chronic constipation, irrespective of age, gender, etc. Actually the only covariate not found to be associated with a doubling of the risk in IBS patients was 'history of depression' (but the risk in this group was about 10 times higher than in those without a history of depression).

There were a total of 16 post-marketing reports for tegaserod of: suicide (2), attempted suicide (3), suicidal ideation (11). In 13 cases, there were associated risk factors.

As tegaserod is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in humans, the P-gp expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is likely to limit the concentration of tegaserod in the brain. A clinical interaction study with the P-gp inhibitor quinidine showed increased exposure (about 70%). There are some safety data from patients exposed to higher doses of tegaserod (12 mg bid n=110) providing similar exposure. The safety data linked with the potential use of P-gp inhibitors, as such, do not indicate an increased risk for common events, but the sample size is too small to exclude relevant differences.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with alterations in expression of the P-gp protein or with the response to known P-gp inhibitors. It is possible that genotypes that are associated  with  decreased  expression  of  the  P-gp  protein  could  result  in  a  greater  exposure  to  the brain, of certain drugs such as tegaserod, due to decreased efflux across the BBB and thus result in an increase in CNS adverse events. To address this question, the applicant performed a pharmacogenetic

analysis on 9 polymorphisms in the P-gp gene for association with psychiatric and CNS-related side effects.  The  frequencies  of  adverse  events  by  genotype  were  similar  between  the  tegaserod  and placebo recipients.

There seems to be an increased event rate in the frequency of CNS and psychiatric disorders related adverse events in patients with concomitant treatment with a P-gp inhibitor in the 12-week but not in the 4-week studies. However a temporal relationship between the intake of the co-medication during the  study  and  the  observed  adverse  event  is  not  feasible  to  assess,  as  the  time  point  of  the  comedication intake was not recorded in most studies (see Table 17).

Teg = Zelnorm (tegaserod)

At present no consistent pattern associating tegaserod and P-gp inhibition with an increased incidence of adverse events has been identified. As discussed, there might be an association between dose (2 mg bid vs. 6 mg bid), use of P-gp inhibitors and psychiatric events.

Cardiac arrhythmias: There were 4 cases (0.08%) of arrhythmias, including one case of ventricular tachycardia,  reported  in  the  tegaserod  4-week  safety  population  vs.  none  in  the  placebo  groups. Otherwise no differences were seen between placebo and tegaserod in the safety populations. The case of  ventricular  tachycardia  was  reported  to  have  occurred  after  coronary  by  pass  surgery.  No  other cases of ventricular tachycardia have been reported.

- ¾ ECG: New or worsened ECG abnormalities were observed in the 12-week studies in similar incidences  in  tegaserod  and  placebo  groups  -  about  10%.  Similarly,  there  were  no  signals

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related to QT-prolongation.

- ¾ Hypersensitivity reactions: A total of 271 post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking tegaserod have been received. Of these, 38 were serious reaction reports. There does  not  appear  to  be  any  identifiable  risk  factor  beyond  possibly  a  prior  history  of  drug hypersensitivity  reactions,  atopy,  or  autoimmune  disease,  which  were  reported  in  54%  of  the serious  cases  in  which  medical  history  was  provided.  Serious  reports  of  hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking tegaserod are rare with a reporting rate of 7.3/100,000 patient years. In the clinical database there were 3 reported cases of hypersensitivity reactions.
- ¾ Ischaemic  colitis  (IC):  The  association  between  IBS  and  IC  is  acknowledged.  There  might, however, be a difference between diarrhoea and constipation predominant diseases, both in the sense that cases of IC might be misdiagnosed as diarrhoea predominant IBS (IBS-D) and that anti-diarrhoeal compounds in general or drugs with constipation as side effect might increase the risk for IC. No epidemiological data differentiating between IBS-D and IBS-C have been submitted.

With respect to duration of therapy and risk for IC, there appears to be no strong relationship, but apparently the risk is not reduced with prolonged therapy as about 50% of the events were reported after 8 weeks or more of therapy while about 30% of the patients used tegaserod for more than 8 weeks.

- ¾ Weak signals with respect to myositis and conjunctivitis have also been observed.
- ¾ A numerically higher incidence of cholecystectomy has been shown. Therefore an epidemiological  study  (ZEST)  was  initiated  by  the  applicant,  and  the  final  results  were submitted after the conclusion of the CHMP opinion for Zelnorm in December 2005 (within the re-examination procedure).

## · Laboratory findings

Haematology: A slightly higher incidence of eosinophilia was observed in the tegaserod arm (1.9%) compared with the placebo arm (1.6%) in the key 4-week safety population. Otherwise, there were no differences.  In  the  re-treatment  study  no  exaggeration  of  eosinophilia  was  observed  on  repeated exposure.

In the 12-weeks studies a higher incidence of ANC ≤ 1.0 (Absolute Neutrophil Count) was observed in the  tegaserod  groups  than  in  the  placebo  groups  -  0.6%  vs.  0.2%.  As  in  the  4-week  studies,  more patients with eosinophilia were observed in the tegaserod arms (2.7%, 6 mg bid vs. 1.7%, placebo).

In  the  pooled  safety  data  base,  a  seemingly  higher  incidence  of  neutropenia  was  noted  in  patients treated  with  doses  &gt;12  mg/day,  (4/345).  The  likelihood  of  a  causative  association  was  found  to  be extremely low and no further actions were considered to be required.

There were no signals with respect to the liver (except for cholecystectomy) and kidney or electrolytes reported in the summary of safety.

## · Safety in special populations

Altogether 73 pregnancies were reported in clinical trials, but no evidence of differences in outcome between  placebo  and  tegaserod  were  identified.  These  data  are  too  limited  to  draw  conclusions regarding use in pregnancy.

The incidence of adverse events was higher in patients above 65 years of age. In patients above 65 years diarrhoea was observed in 6.9% vs. 5.0% and in those below 65 years 3.9% vs. 1.7%, tegaserod and placebo, respectively.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The safety data base has been searched for signals in relation to commonly co-prescribed compounds

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  patients  with  IBS.  Only  with  respect  to  proton  pump  inhibitors  and  H2  antagonists,  a  higher incidence  of  gastrointestinal  events  was  found.  The  results  however  were  similar  in  the  verum  and placebo groups.

Patient  withdrawals  in  the  tegaserod  group  was  similar  to  placebo  group.  However,  adverse  events were  the  most  frequent  reason  for  study  discontinuation  in  the  tegaserod  group  compared  to  the placebo group.

## · Post marketing experience

Two main safety aspects emerged from the post marketing surveillance (PMS) database, which led to a modification in the labelling of tegaserod in the USA, in April 2004:

- -Serious complications of diarrhoea: By 30 June 2004, events of clinically significant consequences of  diarrhoea  had  been  reported  in  33  patients  (equivalent  to  8.5/100 000 patient  years).  These included rare reports of hypovolemia, hypokalemia, and need for i.v. fluid replacements, but did not involve any diarrhoea-related deaths.
- -Ischemic  colitis  and  other  ischemic  events  of  the  bowel:  No  cases  of  ischemic  colitis  or  other ischemic events of the bowel in tegaserod patients have been reported in clinical trials. However on 30 June 2004, there were 32 case reports or 8.2/100 000 patient years from post-marketed use of tegaserod,  similar  to  the  incidence  of  ischemic  colitis  reported  in  the  general  population  (747/100 000 patient years). The incidence of ischemic colitis in the IBS population (not treated with tegaserod) is estimated to be from 43 to 179 cases per 100 000 patient years.

The possibility for ischemic colitis was added to the US label as a precautionary statement.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Given the benign nature of IBS-C, and the modest effect observed with tegaserod, the safety profile of the compound has to be very favourable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From some aspects, the safety database is reassuring, e.g. with respect to number of patients. It should be  noted,  however,  that  even  if  the  sought  indication  relates  to  episodic  therapy,  median  time  to recurrence of symptoms was about 4 weeks. Therefore what might in fact be close to long-term use, continuous  therapy  appears  foreseeable  in  many  patients  and  here  the  safety  database  is  less reassuring.

Some of the gastroenterology experts that were invited to the CHMP discussion on Zelnorm on 16 November  2005,  were  also  in  agreement  with  the  view  that  long-term  data  was  necessary  to demonstrate safety with repeated use (in addition to the maintenance of efficacy).

Two  adverse reactions were initially raised as major concerns, namely; clinical significant consequences diarrhoea and hypersensitivity reactions. The incidences of these events have thereafter been defined with acceptable precision.

From a tolerability  perspective,  obvious  adverse  reactions  relate  to  the  pharmacology  of  tegaserod, mainly diarrhoea.

After  detailed  review  of  uncommon  events  with  a  less  obvious  causal  relationship  to  tegaserod (neutropenia, myositis, conjunctivitis and CNS -related), the remaining main safety concern is CNSrelated adverse events, including depression and potential risk for suicidality. It was argued that these signals are weak, inconsistent and that the apparent increase, if any, is small. This, however, should be interpreted  from  the  perspective  that  these  data  are  derived  from  clinical  studies,  where  the  study effect  related  to  counselling,  frequent  contact  with health  personnel,  questionnaires,  etc.  is  likely  to reduce the risk for depression. Furthermore, IBS patients constitute a vulnerable population with an estimated incidence of suicidality approximately doubled compared with non-IBS patients.

The  use  of  P-gp  inhibitors  and  P-gp  polymorphism  were  discussed  in  relation  to  CNS  signals. Although  the  applicant's  response  was  comprehensive,  data  on  pharmacogenomics  are  hard  to interpret without a hypothesis linking certain genotypes to poor function of the blood-brain barrier.

A  clinical  interaction  study  with  quinidine  showed  increased  exposure  of  tegaserod  (about  70%). There are some safety data from patients exposed to higher doses of tegaserod (12 mg bid n=110) providing similar exposure. The safety data linked with the potential use of P-gp inhibitors, such as quinidine did not indicate an increased risk for common events, but the sample size was too small to exclude relevant differences.

In  conclusion  the  safety  profile  of  Zelnorm  (tegaserod)  is  not  devoid  of  concerns  for  a  benign condition such as IBS-C and the post-marketing signals add to this concern.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

- Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The description of the Pharmacovigilance system was provided by the applicant.

## · Risk Management Plan

The  applicant  submitted  a  risk  management  plan,  which  included  a  risk  minimisation  plan.  The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at that time.

## 2.6 Conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation prior to appeal

## Quality

The design, manufacture, quality control and stability of this product were satisfactory. There were no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

unresolved quality issues that could have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

In  vitro and in  vivo studies  have  shown  that  tegaserod  is  a  specific  partial  agonist  of  the  5-HT 4 receptor.  In  the  GIT,  it  increased  motility  and  tone,  and  may  have  some  anti-nociceptive  activity. Safety pharmacology studies reveal no cause for concern, including cardiovascular safety.

The  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  tegaserod  in  the  species  used  for  toxicity  testing  have  been described  adequately,  and  it  appears  that  exposure  to  all  identified  human  metabolites  has  been achieved in at least one species used in the respective toxicology studies.

No  non-clinical  concerns  were  identified  in  studies  of  general  toxicity,  genotoxicity  or  the  rat carcinogenicity study. The intestinal tumours identified in the mouse carcinogenicity study have been discussed  in  depth,  and  the  applicant  has  provided  reasonable  mechanistic  support  to  allow  the conclusion that these tumours are not of concern for the intended clinical use of Zelnorm.

Embryotoxicity but no teratogenic effects, was observed. In rabbits, a NOEL cannot be established. Moreover, tegaserod impaired implantation, early embryonic development and reduced pup survival in rats, where the exposure at the LOEL was 8 times the clinical exposure. Peri-post natal development was affected, including reduced pup survival, at maternal exposure levels less than 2 times the clinical exposure and delayed sexual development. The use of Zelnorm during pregnancy and breast feeding should be avoided, and it should not be used in women attempting to conceive.

## Efficacy and safety

The pivotal, placebo controlled trial in women with IBS-C, A2306, was designed in agreement with the  CPMP  within  previous  Scientific  Advice  procedures.  The  primary  outcome  measures  are considered relevant and there was a high degree of consistency in response in primary, secondary and tertiary  endpoints.  Also  in  the  second  period,  which  studied  an  enriched  population,  there  was  a statistically significant effect. From this perspective the results are considered statistically convincing and robust.

However,  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  did  not  meet  the  pre-specified  objectives  and  the clinical relevance of the observed efficacy was seriously questioned by the CHMP. Moreover, in the second  period,  which  studied  an  enriched  population,  the  effect  size  was  smaller  than  expected  by CHMP from the results in Period 1. Hence, available data do not support maintenance of an effect.

The company is applying for repeated treatment in line with symptomatic treatment of a fluctuating disease. The need for repeated treatment was apparent in the pivotal study where the median time to recurrence of symptoms in responders was about 4 weeks. As long-term treatment is foreseeable in many  patients,  the  lack  of  long-term  data  demonstrating  sustained  activity  over  several  cycles  of therapy was considered to be a significant deficiency in the documentation.

In terms of the safety of Zelnorm (tegaserod), CNS/psychiatric events were considered to constitute an outstanding safety issue. This should be added to an albeit low frequency of serious hypersensitivity reactions and clinically significant consequences of diarrhoea and the non-resolved issues related to cholecystitis and ischemic colitis.

Taking all  the  above  into  consideration,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  demonstrated  modest  shortterm effect of questionable clinical relevance cannot outweigh the known adverse event profile as well as the long-term safety uncertainties. Therefore, the benefit/risk balance for Zelnorm in the proposed indication is unfavourable.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision  that  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  Zelnorm  indicated  for  the  repeated  symptomatic  short-term treatment  of  Irritable  Bowel  Syndrome  in  women  whose  predominant  bowel  habit  is  constipation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(IBS-C)  was  unfavourable,  and  therefore  did  not  recommend  the  granting  of  the  marketing authorisation.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

Whereas

- -the treatment effect, although statistically significant, is not considered clinically relevant
- -the effect size in the enriched population in the second period of treatment was lower than expected, not supporting maintenance of effect
- -the known adverse event profile as well as long-term safety uncertainties

the CHMP recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Zelnorm at the December 2005 CHMP meeting.

## RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION OF 14 DECEMBER 2005 FOR ZELNORM

At the December 2005 CHMP meeting following discussion of the Marketing Authorisation Application for  Zelnorm,  the  CHMP  had  concluded  that  the  overall  benefit/risk  for  Zelnorm  in  the  symptomatic treatment of women with IBS-C was unfavourable.

On  22  December  2005,  the  applicant  submitted  written  notice  requesting  a  re-examination,  and  the detailed grounds for the re-examination request were submitted on the 17 February 2006.

Written  responses  to  various  safety  and  efficacy  comments  in  the  Appeal  Assessment  Reports  were submitted on 10 March 06.

An ad hoc expert group meeting was held on 15 March 2006 in preparation of the CHMP meeting on 20-23 March 2006, and the conclusions of the expert group were:

- -The definition of severity proposed by the applicant, and the identification of patients with 'severe' IBS were not seen to be feasible in clinical practice. Furthermore the definition of severity  was  not  seen  to  reflect  the  actual  burden  of  severity  and  was  considered  likely  to cause  difficulties  in  clinical  practice.  It  was  therefore  agreed  that  the  restriction  of  the indication of   Zelnorm to 'severe IBS' would not be meaningful, and that consideration of the overall population as initially presented by the applicant, would be preferable.
- -It was acknowledged that the results seen with the 75% rule (i.e. an improvement over 3 out of 4 weeks) although small were consistent to the extent that the endpoints measured, were fairly stringent. Although the ~ 10% difference was admittedly low and less than the proposed 15%, this was nevertheless a significant effect.

Bearing  in  mind  the  weaknesses  of  the  IBS-QoL  questionnaire  used,  the  effect  seen  was thought unlikely to be significant. Although the QoL measures used were only tertiary efficacy endpoints (predefined), it was agreed that they could have supported the clinical relevance of the weak primary endpoint results, had they been convincing.

- -It was recognised that the patient populations included in Period 1 and Period 2 were not the same. Nevertheless the effect observed with Zelnorm in Period 2 is undoubtedly significant (statistically). It was noted that there appeared to be no sustained effect once treatment with Zelnorm had been stopped.

It had been noted earlier during the discussion that there was no loss of efficacy on re-treatment of the partially  enriched  population  in  Period  2.  Overall  the  experts  concluded  that  although  the  efficacy  of Zelnorm was low, there were currently no safety concerns that could be identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant gave oral explanations at both the ad hoc expert group meeting and at the CHMP meeting.

## Grounds for refusal 1: the treatment effect, although statistically significant, is not considered clinically relevant:

## Applicant's position

Study  A2306  showed  statistically  significant  and  consistent  efficacy  of  tegaserod  during  both  initial treatment (Period 1) and re-treatment (Period 2) on the primary and co-primary outcome variables using the predefined response definition (75% rule).

In  order  to  optimize  the  benefit/risk  of  the  treatment,  the  applicant  proposed  to  restrict  the  use  of tegaserod  to  the  IBS-C  population  with  highest  need  of  therapy,  i.e.  those  with  severe  abdominal pain/discomfort and/or severe abdominal bloating.

-  In patients with severe abdominal discomfort/pain at baseline (Table 19), the therapeutic gain over placebo in Period 1 was 13.5% and 12.9% (75% rule) for the primary and the co-primary variables  respectively.  Using  the  50%  rule,  which  is  the  current  CHMP  recommendation (CPMP/EWP/785/97), the therapeutic gain over placebo in Period 1 was 17.7% (overall relief) and 16.6% (abdominal discomfort/pain) (all p&lt;0.001).
-  In  patients  with  severe  abdominal  bloating  at  baseline  (Table  20),  the  therapeutic  gain  in Period  1  was  13.7%  and  11.8%  (75%  rule)  for  the  primary  and  the  co-primary  variables respectively. Using the 50% rule, the therapeutic gain in Period 1 was 18.5% (overall relief) and 15.0% (abdominal discomfort/pain) (all p&lt;0.001).

Tega = Zelnorm (tegaserod)

In order to limit the use of Zelnorm (tegaserod) in patients who are unlikely to respond to treatment, the applicant  proposed  to  recommend  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  that  treatment should be stopped in patients who do not have satisfactory relief of IBS symptoms after they have been treated for 2 weeks.

## CHMP position:

The CHMP was of the opinion that the restriction of the indication of Zelnorm (tegaserod) to 'severe IBS' would not be meaningful, and that consideration of the overall population as initially presented by the applicant, would be preferable and should be kept. This was in line with the view of the experts that the definition of severity proposed by the applicant, and the identification of patients with 'severe' IBS were not seen to be feasible in clinical practice. Furthermore the definition of severity was not seen to reflect the actual burden of severity and was considered likely to cause difficulties in clinical practice.

As  regards  the  measured  clinical  effect,  the  experts  acknowledged  that  the  results  for  the  overall population seen were small although statistically significant - 9.3% difference for the overall relief of symptoms and 9.1% difference for relief of abdominal discomfort/pain. This effect was based on the 75% rule (i.e. an improvement over 3 out of 4 weeks), which was considered to be fairly stringent and more conservative than current CHMP Points to Consider document.

However based on the discussion at the expert meeting and the assessment reports from the Rapporteurs, the CHMP remained concerned regarding the high placebo response rate observed in both the 'severe'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subgroup and in the overall patient population, and affecting both treatment groups. This remained a major cause for concern. In fact for the primary efficacy endpoint - relief of overall symptoms - the percentage of response seen in Period 1 was 33.7% in the tegaserod group and 24.2% in the placebo group. Similarly for the primary co-endpoint relief of abdominal discomfort/pain a response of 31.3% was  seen  for  the  tegaserod  group  and  22.1%  in  the  placebo  group  in  Period  1.  The  CHMP  did  not consider the differences in effect compared to placebo to be relevant and as such did not represent a sufficient demonstration of efficacy.

The CHMP in agreement with the experts considered that QoL is an important issue in IBS. Bearing in mind the weaknesses of the IBS-QoL questionnaire used, the expert's views were that the effect seen was unlikely to be significant. Although the QoL measures used were only tertiary efficacy endpoints (predefined), it was agreed that they could have supported the clinical relevance of the weak primary endpoint results, had they been convincing. The CHMP considered that while IBS is known to have a major influence on the QoL of these patients, Zelnorm (tegaserod) was not shown to influence IBS-QoL. The CHMP agreed that the QoL results did not contribute to demonstrate a benefit of the drug.

## Grounds for refusal 2; the effect size in the enriched population in the second period of treatment was lower than expected, not supporting maintenance of effect

## Applicant's response:

Further to the inclusion of responders, patients with only a partial response (those without response for one  of  the  two  outcome  variables)  were  also  allowed  to  undergo  re-treatment.  Thus  the  Period  2 population was at most only partially enriched. Responder rates in study A2306 for both primary and coprimary outcome variables showed that the partial enrichment design leads to an increased effect with repeated treatment from approximately 9% in Period 1 to 16-17% in Period 2.

In  the  subpopulation  with  severe  abdominal  discomfort/pain  at  baseline,  the  magnitude  of  effect  in Period 2 met or exceeded the criteria of ≥ 15%, using both the 75% and the 50% rule.

## CHMP's position:

It was recognised that the patient populations included in Period 1 and Period 2 were not the same. It was also recognised that symptom pattern and intensity may vary over time, especially in a disorder such as IBS. While it is acknowledged by the CHMP that in Period 2 Zelnorm (tegaserod) has a statistically significantly different effect from placebo and that the magnitude of this difference is numerically higher than in Period 1, a marked loss of responders is observed among patients having responded to the first treatment cycle. Although it is acknowledged that the expected variability in the placebo response may have played a role in this finding, in a treatment with such a high placebo component this would lead to a  large  loss of  the  responders  over  repeated  cycles.  This  supports  the  CHMP  conclusion  regarding grounds for refusal no. 1.

## Grounds for refusal 3; the known adverse event profile as well as long-term safety uncertainties

## Applicant's response:

Severe hypersensitivity and CSC-diarrhoea are identified risks, whereas psychiatric disorders, gallbladder/abdominal surgery, and ischaemic colitis have been acknowledged as potential risks, even though extensive studies did not reveal an association with tegaserod therapy. The final results of the ZEST study  did  not  reveal  any  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  either  abdominal/pelvic  surgery  or gallbladder surgery amongst patients who used tegaserod. In addition, the CHMP concern that severe diarrhoea might be a sign of IC was not confirmed in a comprehensive database search performed by the applicant.

To date, over 14,000 patients have been exposed to tegaserod in clinical trials. Eight hundred patients have  been  continuously  exposed  to  tegaserod  for  12  months  or  more  and  at  least  half  of  these  have received  tegaserod  at  the  recommended  dose  of  6  mg  b.i.d.  More  than  1,000  patients  were  treated continuously for at least 6 months at 6 mg b.i.d. Furthermore, an estimated 2.5 million patients have been prescribed tegaserod, corresponding to an exposure duration of 640,215 patient-years (April 30, 2005). The post-marketing safety profile of tegaserod, based on the most recent data (Nov 30, 2005;

921,206 patients-years), is unchanged from the one based on the previous cut-off (April 30, 2005). This extensive database did not suggest that tegaserod was unsafe during short- or long-term treatment.

## CHMP position:

The CHMP concluded that the safety profile had been adequately characterized for the claimed use.

## CHMP overall conclusion on benefit/risk

Having  considered  the  response  from  the  applicant,  the  discussion  during  the  ad  hoc  expert  group meeting  and the CHMP members and experts discussion during the oral explanation, the CHMP, by majority (with 11 divergent opinions), was of the opinion that the benefit/risk for Zelnorm (tegaserod) in the claimed indication was not considered positive.
