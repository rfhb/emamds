1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | reinforce the   | Product Information. During this period a number of product technical complaints were received concerning the functionality of the pen, namely a blocked pen, where it is impossible to dial or inject a dose. The cause was identified that when dialling a dose and pushing the dose button without a needle attached to the pen, a mechanical pressure within the system builds, leading to a blockage of the pen mechanism. For this reason the Instructions for Use are updated to make the patient aware not to dial a dose or push the dose button without having a needle attached. There was no technical change made to the Solostar prefilled pen. authorised   |

The CHMP granted a renewal with unlimited validity for Insuman on 16 November 2006. The clinical efficacy of recombinant human insulin is well established. The post-marketing surveillance of Insuman has not revealed unexpected safety concern. The data provided in the PSURs submitted with this renewal application do not raise any new safety signal. Consequently, the benefit risk balance remains unchanged. The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation for Insulin Human Winthrop with unlimited validity. |

The complexity regarding the various insulin treatments used in a single diabetic patient, (i.e. long acting, rapid acting; with the latter needing to be administered multiple times a day) in order to achieve optimal glycaemia control has created a situation wherein product differentiation becomes increasingly important. Adverse events associated with insulins mix-ups, often result in massive overdose of the rapid-acting insulin which may subsequently lead to hypoglycaemia, which if left untreated may be life-threatening, or result in death. In most cases, however, the patients noticed the mistake and took measures to avoid hypoglycaemia, which may explain the |

In order to mitigate the risk of medication errors, the MAH has focused its efforts up to now on educational activities to ensure the safe administration of their insulins. The MAH has also focused on differentiation strategies for insulin products to mitigate the potential risk of administering the wrong insulin to a person with diabetes. The product information for all the insulins from this MAH has been updated through the present variation to include warnings on the risk of insulin mix-up. Additionally, the MAH will incorporate changes to the existing insulins packaging. The aim of these changes is to better differentiate the different products and to increase readability for the pharmacist, Health Care Professional or patient in order to reduce potential mix-ups. authorised   |
