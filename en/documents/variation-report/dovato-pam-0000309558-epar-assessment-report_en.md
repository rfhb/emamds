## 1. Introduction

On 31 October 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Dovato, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study ' An open-label, single arm study to evaluate the week 48 efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) as a fixed dose combination (FDC), in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1infected adolescents, ≥12 to &lt;18 years of age who weigh at least 25 kg ' (205861) is a stand-alone study.

DTG/3TC is assessed in paediatric participants 2 to &lt;15 years of age in a separate study.

Study 205861 is not part of any Paediatric Investigation Plan.

The MAH has reviewed the results of this study and has concluded that an update to the EU product information is considered necessary. The updated EU product information will be submitted in a variation application by end Q1 2026.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Dovato (DTG/3TC FDC; 50/300 mg) is approved in the EU for treating adults and adolescents over 12 years old who weigh at least 40 kg.

The purpose of the Study 205861 was to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the 2-drug regimen DTG/3TC FDC in ART-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents to supplement the dataset in the adult studies GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies (204861 and 205543).

The MAH submitted a final report for Study 205861.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

Study 205861 was a Phase 3b, single arm, open-label, multicentre assessment of DTG/3TC FDC in 32 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naive adolescents with plasma HIV1 RNA between 1000 and ≤500 000 c/mL. All enrolled participants received an open-label DTG/3TC FDC for 48 weeks. Participants who successfully completed 48 weeks of treatment entered the study Extension Phase for an additional 96 weeks.

After Week 144, participants who continued to receive benefit from DTG/3TC FDC and for whom these medications were not locally accessible, were provided access to medication in a Continuation Phase until it was available locally.

Data cut-off date was 10 June 2025, however, the participants' SAE and pregnancy narratives include data captured through 25 June 2025.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Key inclusion criteria

1. Male or female HIV-1 infected adolescents ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age and weighing ≥ 25 kg.
2. Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA between 1,000 and ≤ 500,000 c/mL.
3. Antiretroviral-naïve (defined as no prior therapy with any antiretroviral agent for the treatment of HIV following a diagnosis of HIV-1 infection).
4. o Participants who received antiretroviral therapy for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV in the first 3 months of life are allowed.
5. o Participants who received HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the past are allowed as long as the last PEP/PrEP dose was &gt;6 months from HIV diagnosis or there is documented HIV seronegativity at least 2 months after the last prophylactic dose and prior to the date of HIV diagnosis. The study site must have documentation of the seronegative test available and placed into the study source documents.

## Key exclusion criteria

1. Females who are breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study.
2. Any evidence of an active CDC Stage 3 and/or Category C or WHO Stage 4 disease. Except cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy and historical or current CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3 or CD4% &lt;15%.
3. Participants with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by Child-Pugh classification.
4. Unstable liver disease, cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

## Efficacy Assessments

Plasma HIV-1 RNA: Plasma for quantitative HIV-1 RNA will be collected at screening, baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 during the treatment phase and additionally every 12 weeks in the extension or continuation phase. Methods to be used may include but are not limited to the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay with a lower limit of quantitation of 40 c/mL. In some cases (e.g. where the plasma HIV-1 RNA is below the lower limit of detection for a given assay) additional exploratory methods may be used to further characterize plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Lymphocyte Subsets: Lymphocyte subsets will be collected for assessment by flow cytometry (total lymphocyte counts, percentage, and absolute CD4+ cell counts) at screening, baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 during the treatment phase and additionally every 12 weeks in the extension phase. Safety Assessments All AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until the follow-up visit or contact at the time points specified in the protocol.

All SAEs will be collected from the start of treatment until the follow-up visit or contact at the time points specified in the protocol. Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a sponsor product will be recorded from the time a participant consents to participate in the study. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.

## Sample size

It was planned to enrol 30 adolescent participants to provide a descriptive analysis to complement the fully powered non-inferiority evaluation of the DTG/3TC combination performed in adults. The reported Week 48 response rates for DTG+2NRTIs in adults are 88% to 90% (ITTE, % &lt;50 c/mL by Snapshot algorithm). It is therefore reasonable to conservatively expect a lower response rate of 77% (23/30) or 80% (24/30) in adolescents based on their recognized treatment adherence difficulties. A single arm study with 30 participants will provide an exact Clopper Pearson 95% CI of 61%-92% for an assumed response rate of 80% (% &lt;50 c/mL by Snapshot algorithm at Week 48). The study will provide an exact Clopper Pearson 95% CI of 58%-90% if the assumed response rate is 77% (% &lt;50 c/mL by Snapshot algorithm at Week 48). Participants who prematurely discontinue the study will not be replaced. A subset of approximately 12

participants will provide intensive PK samples to ensure data are available from at least 10 evaluable participants.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

All participants were centrally enrolled using an interactive voice/web response system. This was a single-arm, open-label study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analysis sets

All Screened Participants - This population consisted of participants screened for inclusion in the study. ITT-E Population - This population consisted of all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. ITT-E Sensitivity 1 Population - This population consisted of all participants in the ITT-E Population with the exception of participants at closed site who were withdrawn prior to Week 48 due to site closure. ITT-E Sensitivity 2 Population - This population consisted of all participants in the ITT-E Population with the exception of participants at the site that was closed before study end. Safety Population - The Safety Population consisted of all participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal Population - The CVW Population consisted of all participants in the ITT-E Population who met derived CVW criteria specified in the Protocol Section 8.1.1. The CVW algorithm was derived using nominal eCRF visit rather than using the assessment window, taking unscheduled visits into account. A participant could only be classified as CVW for the analyses if the participant had not withdrawn study intervention at the time the HIV RNA sample was taken. Pharmacokinetic Population - The PK Population consisted of all participants in the Safety Population for whom a PK sample was obtained and analysed.

## Statistical Methods

All analyses were descriptive. All efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT-E Population. The primary endpoint of the proportions of participants meeting the criteria for virologic success (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL) as defined by the Snapshot algorithm were reported with exact Clopper Pearson 95% CIs. Change in CD4+/CD8+ count and percent from Baseline to Week 144 were bounded by 95% CIs. All safety analyses were performed on the Safety Population. Exposure to study intervention, measured by the number of weeks on study intervention, were summarized. The proportion of participants reporting AEs were tabulated. Safety summary statistics were presented for All Available Data, including participants who entered the Continuation Phase and have data available beyond Week 144. Laboratory data were summarised by visit. In addition, the number and percentage of participants with graded laboratory toxicities (based on DAIDS categories) were summarised. Safety and efficacy analyses were performed at Week 48, Week 96, and Week 144. In addition to the primary analyses, sensitivity analyses were performed due to the closure of a study site.

## Results

## Participant flow

Of the 60 participants screened for the study, 28 failed screening. A total of 32 participants were enrolled and treated on the study. Through the End of Study, 20 participants completed the study and 12 participants withdrew. Eleven of the 12 withdrawals had occurred by the Week 96 visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One study site was closed (due to GCP noncompliance). In the Sensitivity 1 Population, 2 participants with an absence of Week 48 data as a result of the site closure were excluded. In the Sensitivity 2 Population, all 7 participants from the closed site were excluded.

Extension Phase Disposition: 21 participants in the ITT-E Population completed the study through Week 144, and 6 withdrew from the study. The most common primary reason for withdrawal was closure of study site (3/27, 11%).

Continuation Phase Disposition: 20 participants completed the Continuation Phase of the study, and 1 participant withdrew from the study due to relocating.

Of the 20 participants who completed the Continuation Phase Visit, 7 participants transitioned to a DTG-containing 3 drug local standard of care regimen, and the remaining participants transitioned to a commercially available DTG/3TC regimen.

Note: Table summarizes post-Baseline AEs. A post-Baseline AE is defined as any AE onset after the treatment start date. AE with missing onset date is considered as a post-Baseline AE. AEs were grouped by SOC and preferred term using MedDRA 28.0.

## Adverse events by grade

The majority of AEs reported had a maximum intensity of Grade 1 or Grade 2. Through Week 144, 5 maximum toxicity Grade 3 AEs (major depression, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased (for eGFR information see section below), liver function test abnormal and food allergy were reported. No participant had a Grade 4 (potentially life-threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) event.

The Grade 3 AE of major depression is also an SAE. It is not considered related to study intervention and there were other factors which may have contributed to the AE such as psychosocial stressors and concurrent medication. The AE was ongoing through the End of Study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Grade 3 AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased resolved in 22 days without changes to the study treatment and was not deemed drug-related.

The Grade 3 AE of liver function test abnormal was not considered serious, did not lead to withdrawal, and was not considered related to study intervention.

The Grade 3 AE of food allergy was non-serious not considered study intervention-related and resolved on continued treatment.

## Adverse events related to study intervention

Grade 3 glomerular filtration rate decreased (which started after Week 16) was the only study intervention-related AE reported and lead to study intervention being discontinued. Follow-up data indicated improvement after discontinuation.

## Adverse events leading to withdrawal

Through Week 48, 2 participants experienced an AE leading to withdrawal/permanent discontinuation of study intervention. 1 participant had glomerular filtration rate decreased (described above) and the other participant had suicidal ideation and depression. Through Week 144, and through the end of the Continuation Phase, no additional AEs leading to withdrawal were reported.

## Deaths

No deaths were reported in the study.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Drug hypersensitivity and rash:

Through the Continuation Phase, a total of 7 (22%) participants experienced AEs in the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC (acne Grade 1, dermatitis allergic Grade 1 [n=2], dermatitis contact Grade 1, and rash pruritic Grade 2). Five of seven AEs were reported through Week 96. The 2/7 additional AEs were a second AE of acne (Grade 1) which occurred through Week 144 and an AE of acanthosis nigricans (Grade 1) which occurred during the Continuation Phase.

## Psychiatric disorders including suicidality:

Through the Continuation Phase, 5 (16%) participants reported 8 AEs in the Psychiatric disorders SOC including bipolar disorder (Grade 2; reported through Week 96), conversion disorder (Grade 1; reported through Week 24), depression (n=2, both toxicity Grade 2; one reported through Week 48 and one reported through Week 144), depression suicidal (Grade 2; reported through Week 48), suicidal ideation (n=2, both toxicity Grade 2; one reported through Week 48 and one reported through Week 144), and major depression (Grade 3; reported through Week 144).

None of the AEs were considered to be study intervention-related. 1 AE, major depression, was considered serious and was considered ongoing through the End of Study. Study intervention was discontinued in 1 participant due to Grade 2 AEs of suicidal ideation and depression; both of these events were considered ongoing through the End of Study.

## Gastrointestinal disorders:

Through the End of Study, AEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were reported in 10 (31%) participants, all events were Grade 1 or Grade 2.

## Musculoskeletal Disorders:

Through the End of Study, AEs in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC were reported in 4 (13%) participants and included arthralgia (Grade 1), myalgia (Grade 1, reported in 2 participants), and back pain (Grade 1 reported in 1 participant and Grade 2 reported in another participant).

## Pregnancies

Throughout the study, 1 participant became pregnant and was withdrawn from the study.

## Viral genotyping and phenotyping results

Protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal (CVW) through Week 144 was low with 1 participant meeting CVW criteria at Week 72. No resistance was identified to NRTI, NNRTI or PI. The assay failed in the integrase region.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Dovato (DTG/3TC FDC; 50/300 mg) is approved in the EU for treating HIV-1 in adults and adolescents over 12 years old who weigh at least 40 kg. Efficacy and safety in the adolescent population have been established through extrapolation from adults, via exposure-matching. The purpose of the single arm, open-label, phase 3b Study 205861 was to provide additional descriptive safety, efficacy, and tolerability data in ART-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents up to Week 144.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Participants ≥12 to &lt;18 years of age and weighing ≥25 kg with screening plasma HIV -1 RNA between 1,000 and ≤500,000 c/mL were included. All participants received the FDC tablet of DTG/3TC (50/300 mg) for once daily oral dosing up to 144 weeks. Thereafter the participants were offered to enter a continuation phase until the medication were locally available. Overall, 32 participants were enrolled and treated on the study. All participants were either Asian (Southeast Asian Heritage, [59%]) or Black (41%). The median (min, max) age was 17 (13, 17) years. At Week 48 (Primary Endpoint) 87% (26/30) (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 69, 96) of participants had a plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (ITT-E Sensitivity 1 Population by Snapshot Analysis), and at Week 144 84% (21/25) (95% CI: 64, 95) of participants had a plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (ITT-E Sensitivity 2 Population by Snapshot Analysis). The sensitivity populations consisted of all participants who received 1 dose with the exception of participants from the site which was closed due to GCP issues raise prior to the Week 48 analysis. The median CD4+ cell count change from Baseline at Week 48 was 223.5 10^6/L. These increases were stable over time, with median change from Baseline at Week 144 of 214.0 10^6/L. The effect of DTG/3TC in the adolescent population are in line with the effect observed in the pooled adult studies GEMINI-1 and -2. In the adult studies at week 48, 91% (655/716) of the participants achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL and the mean change from Baseline in CD4+ cells was 220 cells/mL. Regarding the safety of DTG/3TC, most adolescent participants who experienced AEs reported an AE in the first 24 weeks of study intervention, 23/32 (72%). Through week 144 the most commonly reported AEs were infections, 26/32 (81%). None of these AEs were considered drug-related. Other common AEs in the adolescent population such as headache (13%, n= 4/32) and diarrhoea (6%, n=2/32) are listed as very common adverse reactions in the SmPC. The only other AE observed in the adolescent population which is listed as common in the SmPC was depression, reported in 2 of 32 (6%) adolescent participants. Most of the other reported AEs were observed in 2-3 participants, thus, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding these AEs. There was one AE considered related to study intervention which was a Grade 3 glomerular filtration rate decreased reported through Week 24 and led to discontinuation of study intervention. There were no renal AEs reported for this participant. There were 6 SAE reported through End of Study (anal abscess, major depression, orchitis, postoperative wound complication, ulcerative keratitis, vulvovaginal warts), none considered related to study intervention. Through the End of Study, no deaths were reported. In summary, the effect of DTG/3TC in the adolescent population was similar to the effect demonstrated in adult studies. The study did not identify any new safety concerns or new safety signals relative to the established safety profile for DTG/3TC FDC. The limitations of the study include the descriptive nature, small study population (32 participants) and lack of control arm. SmPC regarding the absence of clinical data in the paediatric population should be revised at the next
