## Introduction

Focetria  is  a  pandemic  H1N1v  vaccine.  The  strain  change  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  from  H5N1  to H1N1v was approved on 29/09/09 (EMEA/H/C/710/PU/05).

The current posology of Focetria was based on data from the mock-up vaccines, largely represented by vaccines containing the avian derived H5N1 antigen, scarcely immunogenic in humans. The current pandemic is caused by an A/H1N1 viral strain. Immune response to the pandemic virus is expected to be higher than that observed with viruses of non-human sources so far used in the mock-up vaccines.

The subjects enrolled were healthy meeting eligibility criteria. In total 661 subjects were enrolled, of which 410 were aged 18 to 60 years and 251 were aged over 60 years (see table below). In both adults 18 to 60 years and adults over 60 years, 96% to 99% subjects completed the day 22 visit. For those who did not complete the day 22 visit, the major reasons for withdrawal was inappropriate enrolment, generally due to screening failure.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) is conducting a H1N1 clinical trial (study V111\\_02) to assess the effect of the full dose compared to half dose and to non-adjuvated vaccine in adults and of the two Focetria dosages in elderly. Based on available safety and immunogenicity from this study, the MAH applied for a change in the posology for recommendation of a single dose and of a half dose (0.25 ml). Clinical immunogenicity and safety Study design Study V111\\_02 is an ongoing randomised, single-blind, dose-ranging study. The study is run in seven study sites in three  EU  Countries.  It  started  with  the  first  subject  enrolled  on  24/08/09  and  the  last subject day 22 visit was completed on 28/09/09. Three  candidate  vaccines  were  compared  in  this  study  to  evaluate  preferred  formulation,  dose  and schedule: · 3.75 µg H1N1 antigen and half adjuvant MF59 (3.75\\_halfMF59) · 7.5 µg H1N1 antigen and full adjuvant MF59 (7.5\\_fullMF59) · 15 µg H1N1antigen without MF59 (15\\_noMF59) The vaccines formulation per group is shown below. The MAH proposed a sample size of 228 subjects per vaccination group (456 in total) claiming 82% power to reject  the  null  hypothesis,  if  the  real  ratio  of  GMTs  is  0.93  (differences  in  term  of  mean log10 HI is -0.03), considering a common standard deviation of 1.0 (calculated as the upper limit of 80% CI in previous studies), and a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. The non-inferiority margin was set to 0.5 however in the present preliminary analyses non-inferiority evaluation was not performed.

## Objectives

Medicinal product no longer authorised The primary objectives were: to identify the preferred vaccine formulation (with and without adjuvant, MF59), dosage (of antigen and adjuvant) and schedule (one or two administrations) of the egg-derived H1N1sw  monovalent  vaccine  in  healthy  adults  based  on  CHMP  criteria  and  pairwise  statistical comparisons for immunogenicity, and safety &amp; tolerability. The secondary objectives were: ·  To  evaluate  immunogenicity of a booster dose  of the egg-derived H1N1sw monovalent influenza vaccine administered 12 months after the primary course with respect to CHMP criteria. ·  To  evaluate  the  non-inferiority  of  the  post-vaccination  (Day  43)  hemagglutination  inhibition  (HI) geometric  mean  titer  (GMT)  of  the  half  dose  (3.75  µg  of  HA  +  half  MF59)  of  the  egg-derived H1N1sw monovalent vaccine to the corresponding GMTs of the full dose (7.5 µg of HA + full MF59) of the egg-derived H1N1sw monovalent vaccine, after two doses administered 3 weeks apart in the pooled adult and elderly population. In both adults 18 to 60 years and adults over 60 years, 96% to 99% subjects completed the day 22 visit.  For  those  who  did  not  complete  the  day  22  visit,  the  major  reasons  for  withdrawal  was inappropriate enrolment, generally due to screening failure. Population definition: (a) All randomised set All subjects enrolled in this study and randomised irrespective of whether they have been vaccinated or not. (b) Full analysis set (FAS) Immunogenicity: all subjects in the All randomised set who: ▫ actually received a study vaccination, and ▫ provided at least one evaluable serum sample both before and after baseline In case of vaccination not done according to randomisation, subjects were analysed as randomised in the FAS. (c) Per protocol set (PPS) Immunogenicity: all subjects in the FAS who: ▫ receive all the relevant doses of vaccine correctly, and ▫ provide evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points, and ▫ have no major protocol violation as pre-specified in the Analysis Plan

A major deviation was defined as a protocol deviation that is considered to have a significant impact on the immunogenicity result of the subject.

- (d) Exposed Set: all subjects in the all randomised set who actually received a study vaccination.

Medicinal product no longer authorised At baseline most subjects of all vaccination groups (85 of 132 for the 3.75\\_halfMF59; 82 of 132 for the 7.5\\_fullMF59; and 81 of 131 for the 15\\_noMF59 vaccination group) were seropositive (HI ≥ 1:10). After  first  vaccination,  at  day  22,  the  CHMP  criterion  for  18  to  60  year  adults  was  met,  with  the highest response being in the 7.5\\_fullMF59 group. At baseline, more than half the subjects (181/246 subjects) had detectable titers. GMTs were similar between the two vaccination groups. Results Immunogenicity  data  assessed  by  hemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  and  microneutralisation  (MN) assays of serum samples collected up to day 22 (range 18-22) are presented in this section. The CHMP criteria for the evaluation of pandemic vaccines were used to assess the immune response.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pairwise  comparisons  of  GMTs  at  day  22  between  vaccination  groups  indicated  that  the  immune response to the 3.75\\_halfMF59 vaccine was less than that to the 7.5\\_fullMF59 vaccine, and similar to that  of  the  15\\_noMF59  vaccine.  The  response  to  7.5\\_fullMF59  vaccine  was  superior  to  both  the 3.75\\_halfMF59  and  15\\_noMF59  vaccine.  The  3.75\\_halfMF59  and  15\\_noMF59  vaccine  induced similar responses. Pairwise  comparisons  of  seroprotection  at  day  22  between  vaccination  groups  indicated  that  the immune  response  to  the  7.5\\_fullMF59  vaccine  was  superior  to  both  the  3.75\\_halfMF59  and 15\\_noMF59 vaccine. The 3.75\\_halfMF59 and 15\\_noMF59 vaccine inducted similar responses. A pairwise comparison of GMTs at day 22 between vaccination groups indicated that the immune response to the 3.75\\_halfMF59 vaccine was inferior to that of the 7.5\\_fullMF59 vaccine. The biological functionality of antibodies measured by HI assay was further assessed by MN assay (shown below) IMMUNE MN RESULTS AFTER ONE DOSE (DAY 22). ADULTS AND ELDERLY

21 to 42-fold after vaccination. Likewise, the percentages with MN titer ≥ 40  increased  from a low baseline  (16%  to  18%)  to  85%  to  98%.  From  79%  to  95%  subjects  demonstrated  at  least  4-fold increases  in  MN  titers  after  vaccination.  Overall,  the  highest  MN  response  was  observed  after administration of the 7.5\\_fullMF59.

It  is  noted  that  half  dose  of  Focetria  induced  an  immune  response  comparable  to  the  15 µ g  of unadjuvated vaccine (with 4 times less antigen quantity), however the results clearly point out that the full dose of Focetria provides the best response in adults and elderly among the assessed formulations. In  elderly  the  three  CHMP  criteria  are  not  met  with  the  half  dose.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the results from this trial provide hints on the suggested advantage of the administration of one dose of non-adjuvated  vaccine,  which  is  lower  compared  to  the  full  adjuvated  dose  and  similar  to  the adjuvanted half dose.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Although non-inferiority statistical analysis is not presented, satisfactory immunogenicity is shown for the  full  dose.  In  contrast  with  the  data  previously  provided  with  the  mock-up  vaccine  H5N1,  the results from the V111\\_02 study suggest that one full dose of Focetria H1N1 may be able to induce a satisfactory immune response, meeting the CHMP criteria for adults. No  specific  threshold  for  protection  has  been  defined  for  MN  assay,  however  the  results  obtained confirm the immunogenicity profile observed with HI. Results by baseline antibody titre In  all  three  vaccination  groups,  307  adults  aged  18  to  60  years  were  not  seroprotected  while 88 subjects were seroprotected at the baseline. In both vaccination groups, 184 adults aged over 60 years were not seroprotected while 62 subjects were seroprotected at the baseline. In order to assess the effect of pre-existing immunity  the proportion of subjects showing seroconversion  or  significant  increase  following  immunisation  was  computed  in  seronegative  and seropositive  subjects.  The  following  tables  shows  the  proportion  of  seroconverted  subjects  with baseline  HI  titres  below  1:10  (to  be  considered  seronegative  at  baseline)  and  the  proportion  of serocoverters among those with a baseline HI titres equal or above 1:10 (seropositive) . Adults 18-60 years In  the  seronegative adults 18-60  years, the proportions were 74%, 98% and 80% in the three study groups (3.75 µ g, 7.5 µ g and 15 µ g, respectively).

Similar data for seropositive subjects at the baseline is reported below, showing that 59%, 82%, and 62% of subjects  in  the  three  study  arms  (3.75 µ g,  7.5 µ g  and  15 µ g,  respectively)  had  significant increase in the antibody titres at day 22.

Detailed analyses took into consideration the distribution of MN responses at day 22 stratified according to the baseline titres assessed with the MN assay  and  is  reported  in  the  two  tables  below.  In  adults  18-60  years  with  negative  MN  assay  at baseline  98%  of  recipients  of  a  full  dose  of  Focetria  showed  post-immunisation  titers  measured  in MN ≥ 1:40.  The  corresponding  proportion  for  recipients  of  half  dose  of  Focetria  was  84%  and  for recipients of non-adjuvated vaccine was 76%. Higher proportions at MN assay were observed for subjects positive at baseline with values ranging between 98% and 100%.

The data in elderly subjects from the MN assay were also reported for seronegative and seropositive subjects respectively (see tables below). Results showed that 59% of seronegative subjects at baseline recipients  of  the  full  dose  are  seroprotected  according  to  percentages  achieving  1:40  titers.  In seropositive subjects at baseline the seroprotection rate was 97%.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The following tables summarise the data on the effect of seropositivity at pre-immunisation by agegroups.  Pooled  summary  of  seroprotection  and  GMR  are  reported.  Taking  into  account  CHMP criterion  percentage  seroconversion  or  significant  increase  (SC)  is  not  reached  for  elderly  subjects (&gt;60 years) exposed to half dosage of vaccine and ≥ 71 year patients with baseline HI ≥ 1:10. Percentage of Subjects Showing Seroconversion or Significant Increase at Day 22 in Adults and Elderly - FAS

CHMP criterion: Percentage seroconversion or significant increase (SC) should exceed 40% (adults) and 30% (elderly). Please note: For subjects with HI ≥ 1:10 at baseline SC is equivalent to significant increase (at least 4-fold to baseline); for subjects with HI&lt;1:10 at baseline SC is equivalent to seroconversion (at least a titer of 1:40).

The presence of subjects already seropositive before the trial complicates the analysis, however such setting  is  similar  to  the  conditions  to  be  expected  when  the  vaccine  will  be  used.  During  extended vaccination  programs  a  higher  proportion  of  already  seropositive  subjects  should  be  expected.  The degree  of  clinical  protection  of  these  seroprotected  subjects  at  baseline  is  unknown,  however additional benefit provided by vaccination should be pursued.

## Results by effect of history of influenza vaccination

In all three vaccination groups about half of the adults aged 18 to 60 years were previously immunised (204  subjects-immunised  versus  191  subjects-not  immunised)  with  at  least  one  seasonal  influenza vaccine.

After  the  first  vaccination,  in  the  subgroup  not  previously  immunised  with  influenza  seasonal vaccination, three out of three CHMP criteria were met by all three vaccines while in the subgroup of subjects  who  had  been  previously  vaccinated  all  three  CHMP  criteria  were  met  only  by  the 7.5\\_fullMF59 and 15\\_noMF59 groups. The CHMP GMR and seroconversion criteria were met by the 3.75\\_halfMF59 group, with seroprotection being marginally missed (69%).

After  the  first  vaccination,  in  the  subgroup  who  had  not  previously  received  influenza  seasonal vaccination,  there  was  more  increase  in  titers  across  three  vaccination  groups  (GMR  12  to  32),  as compared with the subgroup that had been previously vaccinated (GMR 5.13 to 14).

Medicinal product no longer authorised A possible explanation for the greater immune response in the subset not previously vaccinated is that the average age was lower that that of the subset who were previously vaccinated and no adjustment in the analyses was performed. In the two vaccination groups (3.75\\_halfMF59 and 7.5\\_fullMF59) in the elderly (subjects above 60 years  of  age),  most  of  the  subjects  were  previously  immunised  (210  subjects-immunised  versus 36 subjects not immunised) with at least one seasonal influenza vaccine. After the first vaccination, in the subgroup which had not previously received influenza vaccines, both 3.75\\_halfMF59  and  7.5\\_fullMF59  groups  met  all  the  CHMP  criteria.  In  the  subgroup  which  had previously  received  seasonal  influenza  vaccination  all  three  CHMP  criteria  were  met  by  the 7.5\\_fullMF59 group. None of the CHMP criteria were met by 3.75\\_halfMF59 group. After the first vaccination,  in  the  subgroup  who  had  not  previously  received  influenza  seasonal  vaccination,  there was  more  increase  in  titers  (GMR  4.31  and  5.33),  as  compared  with  the  subgroup  that  had  been previously vaccinated (GMR 1.89 and 3.78). As for the 18 to 60 year age group, subjects who had been previously immunised were older than the subgroup that had not been previously immunised. The table below summarises the results. IMMUNE HI RESULTS AFTER ONE DOSE (DAY 22). ADULTS AND ELDERLY BY PREVIOUS INFLUENZA VACCINATION (FAS)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup  analyses  suggest  a  better  immune  response  in  subjects  who  had  not  previously  received influenza seasonal immunisation than subjects who had been previously immunised and the immune response decreased by age group with immune responses being the highest for the 18 to 39 year old.

## Results by body mass index (BMI)

Additional subanalyses on the effect of BMI were presented as subjects with BMI &gt; 30 have been indicated as at risk subjects to be offered vaccination by many health authorities.

The subanalyses showed that the immune response is inversely proportional to BMI and lower for the recipients of the half dose of Focetria.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Discussion on immunogenicity The demographic and other baseline characteristics were balanced among the three vaccine groups of the 18 to 60 year age stratum and between the two vaccine groups of the over 60 year age stratum. Nearly  all  enrolled  subjects  (96%  to  98%  across  vaccine  and  age  groups)  were  included  in  the immunogenicity analysis. The presence of subjects already seropositive before the trial complicated the analysis, although such observation is not fully unexpected as the trial was conducted during the late summer when a large circulation  of  H1N1  was  already  reported.  It  has  to  be  noted  also  that  the  proportion  of  subjects positive at baseline was higher in adults than in elderly. This observation matches with the reported epidemiological pattern for the pandemic so far in EU where reported cases were for the vast majority young adults. It is also likely that the source of positivity at baseline is different among adults and elderly, being the first one due to recent infections and for the second to residual cross-protection from the  past.  It  is  unknown  if  there  is  any  biological  difference  in  quality  and  the  effect  of  preimmunisation titres. Detailed analyses on the data provided were reported in order to support the inference on the effects of vaccination of seropositive and seronegative subjects. However, in this situation the true efficacy of the vaccination is best estimated from  the effect in seronegative subjects to be considered representative  of  the  naïve  population  exposed  to  the  pandemic.  The  data  provided  showed  that positivity at baseline is affecting the amount of the immune response after one dose of Focetria. Of note, baseline serostatus obtained with the  two  assays  HI  and  MN  showed  slightly  higher seropositivity with HI versus MN. In adults after the first vaccination, all three CHMP criteria were met both by the subjects who were seropositive and seronegative at baseline in the 7.5\\_fullMF59 group and across age strata. Therefore the data provided suggests the use of one full dose in adults 18-60 may be sufficient in this patient population, as 98% of naïve subjects (seronegative at baseline with HI assay) seroconverted 22 days following immunisation. Lower proportions were observed for recipients of half dose vaccine (74%) or unadjuvanted vaccine (80%). The MAH claim for a reduced posology for half the dose (0.25 ml) instead of full dose (0.5 ml) in adults was based on the advantage of a potential increased number of vaccinated subjects with the same amount of vaccine production but was not supported by the results observed. The results showed that the half dose of Focetria in adults provided lower immune response than the full dose adjuvanted and similar to the non-adjuvanted vaccine. The Committee also noted that the future investigations of the company regarding the use of a different posology (e.g., 0.25 ml vs 0.5  ml)  for  various  population  subgroups  may  be  a  source  of  errors  and  additional  procedures  and systems should be developed in order to record the volume injected.

The proportion of elderly subjects with pre immunisation antibody was not higher than that observed in  adults. The proportion of seronegative subjects who are seroprotected following one full dose of Focetria  was  56%,  not  meeting  the  CHMP  criterion  of  seroprotection  (60%),  while  77%  of seropositive  subjects  showed  seroprotection.  The  seconversion  rate  in  the  seropositive  subjects  was only  39%.  The  lack  of  adequate  seroprotection  in  the  seronegative  subjects  older  than  60  did  not provide adequate reassurance on vaccine efficacy after one single dose of Focetria in this population. Results from the MN assay showed that 59% of seronegative subjects at baseline recipients of the full dose  are  seroprotected  according  to  percentages  achieving  1:40  titers.  In  seropositive  subjects  at baseline the seroprotection rate was 97%. The results from MN are in line with the results obtained

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with HI assay. However, the lower baseline serostatus detected by MN versus HI would still underline the  need  of  assay  validation  and,  as  general  comment,  the  need  of  assay  standardisation.  The validation reports for the HI and MN assays are expected. Serological samples will also be analysed by  OMCL  laboratories.  The  MAH  committed  to  provide  these  in  accordance  with  appropriate timelines.

In summary, the HI response data on the full 7.5 µ g dose in healthy adults 18-60 years provided good seroprotection rates of 93% -100% in subjects with baseline HI titres &lt;10. The three CHMP criteria were  reached  for  all  age  groups  and  regardless  of  baseline  serostatus  and  of  any  other  subject characteristics (e.g., age, history of previous vaccination, etc).

Medicinal product no longer authorised In the elderly CHMP criteria are met in the overall analyses. However such result is obtained with the contribution of subjects seropositive at baseline and the CHMP criteria following one dose were not met in subjects seronegative at the baseline. Therefore there is a need to assess the value of a second dose for this age group. Following this consideration the CHMP considered prudent at the present time to remain with the 2-dose recommendation for elderly subjects, to ensure optimal protection. Based  on  previous  experience  with  H5N1  and  on  the  robust  immune  response  achieved  in  young adults with H1N1 as shown in this report, the observation gathered for adult subjects are likely to be relevant also for adolescents in the age group 9-17 years and therefore the adult posology could be considered for immunisation of adolescents. As far as children of lower age are concerned results from an ongoing study are to be awaited for confirming posology. Safety The safety analyses included all enrolled subjects except twelve 18 to 60 year (4 subjects from each vaccination group) and 4 over 60 year subject who were not vaccinated (2 subjects from each group). Similar percentages of adults received the first vaccination among the vaccination groups

## Adults 18-60 years

After the first vaccination, higher percentages of 18 to 60 year adults in the adjuvanted vaccination groups  reported  solicited  local  and  systemic  reactions  (58%  and  69%  for  the  3.75\\_halfMF59  and 7.5\\_fullMF59 groups, respectively) than in the unadjuvanted vaccination group (52%;). Most reactions were local reactions, which were most frequent in the 7.5\\_fullMF59 group (55%) and lowest in the 15\\_noMF59  group  (22%).  Although  systemic  reactions  were  reported  less  frequently  than  local reactions they were also most common in the 7.5\\_fullMF59 group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no reports of severe local reactions and most of the local reactions had onset within one or two days of vaccination with only 1% to 2% of subjects reporting any of local reactions on day 7.

The table below provide a summary of local and systemic reactions reported.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Adults over 60 years

In  adults  over  60  years  there  was  a  tendency  for  higher  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  pain  and swelling, but not the other local reactions, in the 7.5\\_fullMF59 than 3.75\\_halfMF59 group after the first vaccination. The most commonly reported local reactions were also pain and erythema in both the vaccination groups. No severe local reactions were reported.

Overall frequencies of the systemic reactions were similar in both vaccination groups.

Fatigue,  headache,  and  sweating  were  the  most  commonly  reported  solicited  systemic  reactions  by adults  of  over  60  years,  with  severe  reactions  being  infrequent.  No  subjects  reported  severe  fever ( ≥ 40°C) and most subjects did not take analgesics/antipyretics nor stayed at home.

The safety analyses included 99% of the exposed subjects (N= 645; 398 adults aged 18-60 years and 247 adults over 60 years).

Local and systemic reactions were typically mild or moderate in severity and were of short duration (generally resolving within the 7-day time window). Severe local reactions were infrequent, with none of  the  subjects  in  either  age  group  reporting  severe  pain.  Severe  systemic  reactions  were  also infrequent.  No  subject  reported  fever ≥ 40°C.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  adverse events  (AEs)  was  balanced  among  vaccination  groups.  AEs  were  generally  mild  or  moderate  in severity and were of short duration. Unsolicited AEs that were judged by the investigator to be at least

possibly  related  to  vaccination  were  balanced  among  the  vaccine  groups  reported  and  caused  by ongoing local and systemic reactions or other known side effects of vaccination.

No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event was reported which was judged unrelated to the study vaccine. There was one premature withdrawal due to an AE after first vaccination (arthralgia, possibly related) which onset on day 8 and lasted 10 days.

The results are in line with the profile of Focetria. In adults recipients, half dose showed a reduced local reactogenicity (43% vs 55%), but comparable systemic reactogenicity (46% vs 49%). In elderly the differences were even lower (22% vs 28%). The use of the half dose formulation may be related to a small reduction in reactogenicity, however the recommended dose is 0.5 ml.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Changes to the Product Information The proposed changes to section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) were  reviewed  and  initially  not  agreed  with.  A  revision  of  the  wording  was  submitted  taking  into account the results of the assessment and this was agreed with by the CHMP. The package leaflet (PL) was updated accordingly. Annex II was amended to reflect the fulfilment of specific obligations. Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment The interpretation of results from the V111\\_02 study is complicated by the high number of subjects with evidence of immunity at the baseline and the actual effect of the immunisation is better estimated by the analyses restricted to the immune response developed by subjects seronegative at the baseline. With this approach, taking into consideration data obtained after one dose of Focetria H1N1 in adults and elderly the CHMP criteria are met in adults, but not in the elderly and therefore results from the effect of the second dose are considered necessary in order to review the posology for this age group. Previous observations obtained with Focetria H5N1 had shown that in adults one dose should be given and a second dose should preferably be given. However, results with Focetria 7.5 ug H1N1 (0.5 ml) from  the  present  study  with  a  single  adjuvanted  H1N1  7.5µg  dose  suggest  that  adequate  immune response is observed after the first  dose  in  healthy  adults.  Based  on  these  data,  inclusion  of  advice regarding the possibility of using a single dose in adults aged 18-60 years is deemed appropriate in the SPC. The observation gathered for adult subjects are likely to be relevant also for adolescents in the age  group  9-17  years  and  therefore  the  adult  posology  could  be  considered  for  immunisation  of adolescents. Administration of half dose of Focetria was shown to induce immune responses lower than the full dose and affected by background conditions of the vaccine recipients (the response was lower in those aged above 40 years, in those with history of previous influenza vaccination, in those with antibodies at the baseline, in those with BMI &gt;30). A reduced local reactogenicity (43% vs 55%), but comparable systemic reactogenicity (46% vs 49%) was observed in adults receiving the half dose. In elderly the differences were even lower (22% vs 28%). The Committee considered there is no relevant advantage in terms of safety with the 0.25 ml vs 0.5 ml, and that the immunogenicity was not as satisfactory as with the full dose. Based on the results and in view of the various situations in which the vaccine is going  to  be  used  in  the  field  and  that  vaccination  is  first  recommended  to  at  risk  population  with underlying  health  conditions  the  proposal  to  accept  a  posology  with  half  dose  of  Focetria  was  not accepted.
