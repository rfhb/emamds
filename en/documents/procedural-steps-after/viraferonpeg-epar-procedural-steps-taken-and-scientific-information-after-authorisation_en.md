The Labelling and product | 22/06/2017 | 19/02/2018 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Cases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interferon. The frequency of such re-activation appears to be low. All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. |

| WS/0735   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to include new information on the potential interactions of peginterferon alfa-2b with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. In addition, the Worksharing applicant took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 23/07/2015   | 29/06/2016 no   | SmPC        | The potential interaction of peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) on substrates of metabolic enzymes was evaluated in 3 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. In these studies, the effects of multiple dose regimens of peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) were investigated in Hepatitis C subjects (1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week). A clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) and tolbutamide, midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is necessary when peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) is administered with medicines metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and N acetyltransferase. Concomitant administration of peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) with caffeine or desipramine modestly increased the exposure of caffeine and desipramine. When patients are administered PegIntron with medications metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2D6, the extent of the decrease in cytochrome P 450 activity is unlikely to have a clinical impact, except with medicines which have a narrow therapeutic margin. longer   |

A number of these reports are confounded with independent risk factors for the development of retinal detachment. Furthermore, retinal detachment is more common with increasing age, and many of the reports occurred in individuals over the age of 49 which is the peak age at which retinal detachment occurrs. Nevertheless, there were reports with no clear confounders and with ages below the peak incidence of retinal detachment. Therefore the term of 'serous retinal detachment' has been included into the established ocular sections of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. |

Section 4 of the PL is updated accordingly.

Growth inhibition was observed that may be irreversible in some patients. As reflected in the product information, initiation of therapy in children who have not reached their adult height should be restrictive and carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.   |

| WS/0124   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Further to request of the CHMP On 16 December 2010, as part of a class-labelling change, the Product Information of ribavirin and the interferon-containing products is updated to remove from SmPC section 4.6 the requirement of double contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male patients, and to revise SmPC section 5.2 to reflect the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to transfer in seminal fluid. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH 21/07/2011 no   |            | 24/08/2011   | SmPC and PL   | A review of reported relevant prospective cases of maternal and paternal exposure to ribavirin has been carried out. Only a limited number of cases are available. However, a large number of data would be necessary to draw a definitive conclusion on the teratogenic potential of ribavirin. The malformative risk is possible in human, but it is not confirmed. For paternal exposure, the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. Taking into account the number of reference cases outnumbering 300 after paternal exposure with no increase of congenital anomaly risk, it is recommended to remove the requirement of double contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male patient. For female patients, the CHMP agreed that they should be instructed to use an effective contraceptive. For male patients, the CHMP recommended that either male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to use an effective contraceptive. Furthermore the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to the transfer of ribavirin in seminal fluid are included in the SmPC. longer   |

In order to get a better insight to this issue, and to improve the information available to prescribers in SmPC of interferon-alfa containing products, the CHMP requested the MAH to provide yearly literature review on the management of psychiatric disorders in HCV-infected patients. This first literature review indicated that, as for patients with psychiatric disorders, patients with substance abuse/use need to be carefully managed with the aim of improving the adherence to therapy and the treatment success. It was noted that this issue was currently not addressed in the SmPC of interferon-alfa/ribavirin containing products as well as data on the management of patients with alcohol abuse. Thus, the recommendations in the product information for this sensitive population of patients have been updated. longer |

Of the 68 cases reporting an overdose of peginterferon alfa-2b there were three cases of note: one was with a potential overdose of 10.5 times the intended dose (about 500 mcg), one of 7.5 times the dose (1200 mcg) and one of 5 times the dose (600 mcg, taken over a 5-day period). There were an additional seven cases reported in patients taking between 300 and 575 mcg (2 to 4 times the intended dose), with a maximum of four times the intended dose administered Based on a review of these cases, the majority of reported events resulting from an overdose of up to 10.5 times the intended dose were generally events that are part of the known spectrum of pharmacologic effects of alfa interferons but perhaps were of greater severity than the adverse events reported for peginterferon alfa-2b during therapeutic use. The SPC has been updated to reflect this. longer |

Anaemia is the primary cause for ribavirin dose reduction. Since ribavirin dose reduction may negatively impact Sustained Virologic Response, risk factors for anaemia such as concomitant use of zidovudine is a cause of concern on a safety but also efficacy point of view. As such the product information is revised to include a warning to prescribers that the concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended and to highlight the associated risk of anaemia. longer |

This study aimed to assess the durability of virologic response and to assess HCV disease progression. Overall the results of the study confirm the durability of the virologic response up to 5 years. The likelihood of maintaining virologic response over 5 years in subjects who initially achieved a sustained response is 99 %(95 %CI: 98-100 %). However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).                   |

In two clinical studies in HCV-HIV coinfected patients co-administration of ribavirin with zidovudine or stavudine did not significantly affect the intracellular phosphorylation of these NRTIs in vivo. Furthermore there is evidence that ribavarin does not negatively interfere with antiviral efficacy in HIV infection. As this in vitro interaction has no clinical impact the CHMP agreed to delete the entire existing paragraph referring to this interaction from section 4.5 of the SPC. longer |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics                     | 21/09/2006   | 20/10/2006 no | SmPC        | This variation concerns an up date of section 4.5 of the SPC following the results of a study to determine the effect of ViraferonPeg treatment on the pharmacokinetics of methadone. This study was carried out because some individuals who have previously used injected narcotics and subsequently take methadone have been identified as being infected with hepatitis C. Therefore these patients may be candidates for therapy with PegIntron/ViraferonPeg. The results demonstrate a small (about 15% to 19%) increase in the AUC and Cmax of methadone at addition of ViraferonPeg therapy. The clinical significance of this increase is not known, however the CHMP concluded that it appears relevant to include in the SPC a warning to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect. longer |

products. Rather the existing paragraphs pertaining to psychiatric disorders in the SPCs and Package Leaflets have been moved to the beginning of the corresponding sections and placed in a warning box in order to draw attention to these serious adverse effects.

The need to harmonise the SPCs of the ribavirin and alfa interferon containing medicinal products has been highlighted on previous occasions as existing discrepancies regarding the recommendations for pregnancy and lactation might be confusing for prescribers and patients. The CHMP concluded that contraceptive measures should be used during treatment and  for 4 months after treatment discontinuation in female patients and during treatment and for 7 months after treatment discontinuation in male patients and their female partners. Section 4.6 \"Pregnancy and Lactation\" of the SPC of ViraferonPeg has therefore been up dated to add the seven month duration of contraception after treatment termination for male patients and their female partners when alfa-Interferon is used in combination  with Ribavarin. Regarding lactation a minor change to the existing wording in section 4.6 \"Pregnancy and Lactation\" has been made to reflect the fact that although lactation is not recommended, it is not subject to a contraindication when alfa-Interferon is used without Ribavarin. The presentation of information in Section 4.2 and 4.3 have been harmonised as regards the contraindication for  ViraferonPeg when used in combination with Ribavarin. This change does not affect the content of the SPC, rather the presentation.

| II/0058                                 | Update of Section 4.4 of the ViraferonPeg SPC to alert the prescribers on the fact that patients treated with ribavirin and interferon combination therapy and Zidovudine could be at higher risk of developing anaemia, further to the assessment of the PSUR 7 of interferon alfa-2b and Pharmacovigilance follow up measures. The PL is up dated accordingly. A minor correction to the paragraph duration of treatment in section 4.2 of ViraferonPeg SPC is also introduced in order to replace the term \"posology\" by \"duration of treatment\".

As anaemia is an important limiting factor for the success of combination therapy in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, the CHMP requested that the MAH review safety data with regard to the necessity to include a warning in the SPC and package leaflet. In light of these safety review provide by the company the CHMP concluded that the hypothesis of an interference between haemolysis due to ribavirin and the myelosuppresive effect of AZT with reduction of erythropoiesis as suggested in literature should be taken into consideration and reflected as a warning in the SPC of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b. longer   |

undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with ViraferonPeg be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.

Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:  If treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.

Dental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.

clearance of ViraferonPeg is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function. Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. The dose of ViraferonPeg for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Patients with creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.

Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with ViraferonPeg.

The SPC recommendations on use in patients with renal impairment are as follows:

Monotherapy: ViraferonPeg should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of VirferonPeg should be reduced by 25 %. Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of ViraferonPeg reduced by 50 %. Data are not available for the use of ViraferonPeg in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute. Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. If renal function decreases with renal impairment. The PL has been updated accordingly.

Changes to Sections 4.4 and 4.8 were made following the 5th

ViraferonPeg PSUR.

The use of interferon alpha in patient undergoing solid organ transplantation is controversial and has been debated over the years as Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) regularly recurs after liver transplantation and concomitant CHC is common in patients undergoing renal transplantation.  Based on case series, there seems to be an increased risk for rejection in patients with kidney grafts, but, surprisingly, no such tendencies have been reported (or actually refuted) in patients with liver grafts.

Following reports of several cases of liver transplant rejection in the PSUR, the following warning was added to Section 4.4 of the SPC: \"Organ transplant recipients: The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin for treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied. Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.

Based on an analysis of safety data, the adverse reactions: rhabdomyolysis/myositis, renal insufficiency and renal failure were added as rare reactions.  Ulcerative and ischaemic colitis and aplastic anaemia were added as very

Dosing tables were added to section 4.2 of the SPC to provide advice on the recommended strength and volume of PegIntron to be injected based on the patient's body weight.

Retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that the response to treatment was correlated with body weight in that lighter patients had a better response than heavier patients.  As a result of this, the clinical trials of PegIntron/ViraferonPeg used dosages based on body weight. Results from the PegIntron/ViraferonPeg monotherapy study confirmed that when dosing is based on body weight, body weight is no longer a predictive factor for response. Therefore being able to titrate the dose according to the individual patient's weight is important for efficacy.

The currently authorised formulations of PegIntron include 5 vial and pen strengths: 50, 80, 100, 120 and 150 µg/0.5 ml. Although  the physician is advised on the appropriate dose per kg, no guidance is given on what strength to prescribe or the amount the patient needs to inject to obtain the required dosage.  There is an additional complication in that the dosing recommendations for PegIntron when used in combination with Rebetol are 1.5 µg/kg/week whilst in monotherapy the dose is either 0.5 or 1.0 µg/kg/week.

If a reduced dose is necessary because of adverse events, the current recommendations are to reduce the PegIntron dose by half but again no recommendations as to how this is to be achieved are given.

The tables which have been added to section 4.2 of the SPC provide information  on suggested strengths and volume for injection when PegIntron is used in combination therapy at a dose of 1.5 µg/kg and also for the 1.0 µg/kg and 0.5 µg/kg PegIntron dose when used as monotherapy.  The tables for combination therapy also provide guidance on Rebetol posology.

Achievement of target doseWith full dose combination therapy, using the tables provided, the amount to be injected is either 0.4ml or 0.5ml which enables the delivered

The CPMP requested that the term \"histologically proven\" be removed from the indication of all the centrally authorised alfa interferons and an appropriate warning added to section 4.4 of the SPC.

In the French Consensus Conference on Hepatitis C  it is stated that biopsy may not be necessary if a decision to treat has been made on other grounds and the primary objective is viral eradication.  This is also largely in line with other National Guidelines.  The viral eradication rate is sufficiently high for patients with genotype 2/3 that treatment is indicated in many cases even if the histology turns out to be benign.  Therefore histology is not always needed.

Corresponding changes were made to the Package Information Leaflet. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 18/12/2002 17/03/2003 SmPC and product | This variation refers to changes to sections 4.2, 4.4. 4.6. 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC. Changes were made to section 4.2 and section 5.1 to include information on the predictability of sustained virological response with recommendations for treatment duration. During a concurrent scientific advice procedure, the MAH presented data that a reliable decision regarding treatment discontinuation can be made at 3 months. Patients who fail to achieve virological response after 12 weeks treatment are |

highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders

(negative predictive value 100% for combination therapy,

98% for monotherapy).

For patients with genotype 1 who are responders at week 12, combination therapy should be continued for another 9 months.  All patients with genotype 2 or 3 achieved virological response following 12 weeks of combination therapy.  These patients should be treated for a total of 6 months with the decision to extend therapy to one year based on prognostic factors such as age, sex and bridging fibrosis.

For patients on PegIntron monotherapy, responders at 12 weeks should have treatment continued for at least a further 3 months with the decision to extend therapy to one year of treatment based on the above prognostic factors.Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC were updated with regard to ophthalmological disorders.  The current SPC already contained a warning in section 4.4 regarding ophthalmic symptoms and the need for eye examination.

Section 4.4 was strengthened to advise that all patients should have a baseline eye examination and that periodic eye examinations were recommended, particularly in patients with disorders associated with retinopathy.  Discontinuation of PegIntron should be considered in patients who developed new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.
