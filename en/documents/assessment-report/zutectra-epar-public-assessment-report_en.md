## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

The  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  is  a  double-stranded  DNA  virus  in  the  hepadnaviridae  family. Approximately 2 billion people in the world have been infected by HBV and 300-350 million of them are  chronically  infected  with  virus.  Most  of  European  countries  fall  into  category  of  low  or intermediate  risk  endemicity  areas  for  HBV  (&lt;2%  or  2-8%  of  chronic  HBV,  respectively).  HBV  is transmitted by  perinatal,  percutaneous,  and  sexual  exposure,  as  well  as by  close  person-to-person contact presumably by open cuts and sores, especially among children in hyperendemic areas. In low prevalence  areas,  injection  drug  abuse  and  unprotected  sex  are  the  primary  transmission  routes, although other factors may be important.

HBV  infection  may  either  be  acute  (self-limiting)  or  chronic  (long-standing).  Persons  with  selflimiting infection clear the infection spontaneously within weeks to months. Children are less likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become infected as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the ages of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.

The  prevention  of  recurrent  HBV  infection  after  liver  transplantation  for  hepatitis  B  induced  liver failure  is  a  specific  treatment  objective.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin (HBIG) is  a  passive  immunisation  against  infection  with  the  hepatitis  B  virus.  The  introduction  of HBIG  in  the  late  1980s  and  subsequently  nucleotide  analogues  have  significantly  improved  the outcome of liver transplantation with regard to re-infection and survival rates. The overall survival of patients transplanted for HBV-related cirrhosis now exceeds 85 % at one year and 75 % at five years. The current standard of care recommends using a combination of indefinite HBIG and antiviral and has led to &lt;10% of HBV recurrence. The HBIG therapy without any viral prophylaxis is potentially an indefinite  treatment  aiming  to  maintain  anti-HBs  levels  of  100-500  IU/l,  depending  on  the  viral replication status of the patient at the time of the transplantation.

Zutectra  is  a  purified  human  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  preparation  obtained  from  plasma  from selected and/or immunised donors having antibodies against hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen. It is a sterile solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection containing 150 mg human plasma protein with at least 96 % IgG and 500 IU/ml anti-HBs antibody. The product is considered a further development of an already  approved  HBIG  preparation  for  intravenous  (IV)  administration  (Hepatect  CP)  with  the difference being that the intravenous product is less concentrated. Zutectra is presented in 1 ml glass syringes.

A  so-called  full  application  has  been  submitted  for  the  marketing  authorisation;  access  to  the centralised procedure was granted under the optional scope on the basis of the claim of therapeutic innovation.  The  application  was  exempted  for  the  requirements  of  the  paediatric  legislation  as  the concept of the new product being part of the same global marketing authorisation as Hepatect CP was applied.

The initially claimed indication read as follows: 'Prevention of hepatitis B virus re-infection after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure. Zutectra is indicated in adults only.' The approved indication  is:  'Prevention  of  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  re-infection  in  HBV-DNA  negative  patients ≥ 6 months  after  liver  transplantation  for  hepatitis  B  induced  liver  failure.  Zutectra  is  indicated  in adults only. The concomitant use of adequate virostatic agents should be considered, if appropriate, as standard of hepatitis B re-infection prophylaxis.'

Patients  with  bodyweight  &lt;  75  kg  should  receive  500  IU  (1  ml)/week;  patients  with  bodyweight ≥ 75 kg should receive 1,000 IU (2 times 1 ml)/week. Prior to the initiation of subcutaneous treatment with  Zutectra,  anti-HBs  serum  levels  should  be  stabilised  with  an  adequate  intravenous  hepatitis  B

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunoglobulin to levels at or above 300-500 IU/l. Anti-HBs serum level of &gt; 100 IU/l should be maintained and levels of anti-HBs antibody should be regularly monitored.

No formal scientific advice from CHMP was obtained for the development of Zutectra.

Compliance with the current international GMP and EU-regulations has been demonstrated.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Zutectra  is  a  medicinal  product  containing  purified  human  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin.  Zutectra  is obtained from plasma from selected and/or immunised donors having antibodies against hepatitis B surface  (HBs)  antigen.  Human  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  no. 0722 on Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin and 0388 on Human normal immunoglobulin.

Zutectra is a sterile solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection containing 150 mg human plasma protein with at least 96 % IgG and 500 IU/ml anti-HBs antibody. It is presented in 1 ml glass syringes.

The excipients are human normal immunoglobulin, glycine and water for injections, the formulation does not contain preservatives. All excipients comply with the Ph. Eur.

Zutectra  is  a  further  development  of  Hepatect  CP,  a  less  concentrated  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin product manufactured by Biotest GmbH and intended for intravenous (IV) administration. It contains the same active substance as Zutectra and has been licensed in some member states in the EU since 2000. The essential difference between the two formulations is the concentration of the final product (Hepatect 50mg/ml human plasma protein; 50 IU/ml hepatitis B antibodies).

## Active Substance

Zutectra  contains  human  immunoglobulin  G  molecules  as  the  active  substance.  The  preparation  is enriched for antibodies against hepatitis B virus. The activity of Zutectra is standardized based on the content of HBs antibodies. The active substance is prepared from pooled human plasma obtained from healthy donors, selected and/or immunized with hepatitis B surface antigen, having antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen. It is manufactured from cryo-poor human plasma fractionated according to a modified cold ethanol plasma fractionation method. The quality of plasma and the donation centres are described in the Biotest Plasma Master File (PMF) dossier. The Biotest PMF has been certified by EMEA (EMEA/H/PMF/000009/05) in accordance with the specific requirements as laid down in Part III, section 1.1 of Annex I to the Directive 2001/83EC.

The production  site  of  the  intermediates  and  drug  substance  of  Zutectra  is  Biotest  AG  and  Biotest Pharma GmbH, Dreieich, Germany.

The drug substance of Zutectra is manufactured from human plasma under microbiological reduced conditions  in  a  GMP  controlled  environment.  The  manufacturing  process  follows  a  modified  cold ethanol fractionating process to isolate the intermediate, fraction II.

Human plasma for fractionation is used as starting material. Single plasma donations are pooled to obtain  a  representative  plasma  pool  from  which  the  cryoprecipitate  is  separated.  An  optional adsorption step to remove the coagulation factors of the prothrombin complex by filtration may be performed  on  the  cryo-poor  plasma.  Results  of  validation  studies  confirm  that  this  step  can  be optionally  omitted  without  impairment  of  the  drug  substance  quality.  In  subsequent  steps,  the following  fractions  are  precipitated  and  separated  from  the  cryo-poor  plasma:  Fraction  I/II/III  is precipitated  with  ethanol  and  separated.  Fraction  I/III  is  precipitated  with  ethanol  and  separated. Fraction II is precipitated and separated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To remove impurities and inactivate viruses prior to a critical virus inactivation step, fractions II are pooled and treated with caprylic acid. The caprylic acid treated intermediate is filtered and subjected to the critical step of virus inactivation with polysorbate 80/tri-n-butyl phosphate.

Final purification using cation exchange chromatography, nanofiltration, concentration and purification  by  ultra-  and  diafiltration,  adjustment  of  protein  concentration  and  pH,  and  subsequent filtration result in the drug substance.

Final  concentration  by  ultrafiltration,  adjustment  of  protein  concentration  and  pH,  and  subsequent filtration results in the drug substance of Zutectra. The drug substance may be stored at 5 ± 3°C.

The following steps in the manufacturing process of the drug substance of Zutectra were identified as critical steps: precipitation and separation of fraction I/III; treatment with caprylic acid solution and calcium acetate; virus inactivation with polysorbate 80 and tri-n-butyl phosphate; and nanofiltration. Critical process steps are adequately monitored by in-process controls. The consistency of the critical steps has been evaluated with production scale batches.

Reproducibility and consistency of the manufacturing process in pilot scale and production scale is adequately documented for all intermediates

General biological characteristics of pilot scale batches are presented. The characterisation of Zutectra is comprehensive. Extensive testing of biological characteristics and activities of batches of the drug product Zutectra is in accordance with the Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Human Normal  Immunoglobulin  for  Subcutaneous  and  Intramuscular  Use  (CPMP/BPWG/283/00).  These characterisation data can also be conferred to the drug substance, as the production process from the drug substance to the drug product, adjustment of the protein content and filling, does not change the functional characteristics of the immunoglobulin preparation.

The  impurities  arising  from  the  starting  material  and  the  manufacturing  process  derived  impurities were  identified.  All  critical  impurities  are  tested  for  the  release  of  the  drug  substance.  It  is  clearly demonstrated that these impurities can be removed in an acceptable manner.

The selected parameters and specifications are suitable to control the drug substance quality. Sixteen different analytical methods are used for the control of the drug substance. Description and validation data for methods used for the drug substance are sufficient. The applicant presented acceptable batch data  from  ten  pilot  and  two  production  scale  batches  to  demonstrate  consistency  of  the  full  scale manufacturing process. The specifications proposed are sufficient.

In  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines  Q5C  and  Q1E  based  on  acceptable  analytical  (primary  and supportive) real time data a shelf life of the drug substance of Zutectra for 12 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C is justified.

The applicant provided data for two production scale batches for 6 months at 2-8°C. An extension of the stability study for one additional batch is currently ongoing. The applicant commits to finalise the ongoing  stability  studies  and  submit  to  the  EMEA  the  final  report.  Supportive  real  time/real temperature stability data were submitted. The data between the studies are comparable.

## Medicinal Product

The  medicinal  product  Zutectra  is  supplied  as  a  solution  for  injection.  The  solution  is  clear  to opalescent and colourless to pale yellow. The excipients are human normal immunoglobulin, glycine and water for injections, the formulation does not contain preservatives. All excipients comply with the Ph. Eur.

IgG subclass distribution is approx. 59 % IgG1, 35 % IgG2, 3 % IgG3, 3 % IgG4. The IgA content is limited to a maximum of 4 % of protein (IgA ≤ 6 mg/ml).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  drug  product  Zutectra  is  presented  in  glass-syringes  containing  500 IU  in  1 ml  solution  for injection.

The  drug  product  is  manufactured  from  the  drug  substance  under  controlled  conditions  in  a  GMP environment.  Drug  product  manufacture  consists  of  formulation  and  filling  the  product  into  1 ml syringes.  The  drug  substance  is  transported  to  the  production  building,  where  the  production  of  the final filling pool is performed. For the production of a final filling pool, the necessary excipients are added. The final filling  pool  is  subsequently  sterile  filtered  into  plastic  bags  where  it  remains  until transporting  to  the  contract  manufacturer,  where  the  aseptic  filling  into  the  final  containers  is performed. At the contract manufacturer the plastic bag with the final filling pool is transferred to the drug product filling site and connected to the filling line. The final filling pool is sterile in-line filtered and directly filled into the syringes pre-assembled with a closure. The filled syringes of drug product are  automatically  sealed  with  plungers,  release  tested,  labelled,  packaged,  and  finally  released  at Biotest.

The  process  and  in-process  controls  performed  during  manufacture  of  the  drug  product  including critical steps, acceptance criteria and points of sampling are sufficient.

The  selected  parameters  and  specifications  are  suitable  to  control  the  drug  product  quality.  To demonstrate consistency of the full scale manufacturing process the applicant has presented batch data from ten pilot and two production scale batches and finally within the response document an update with two newly produced drug product batches of Zutectra.

The  applicant  presented  an  update  of  acceptable  12  month  real  time  stability  data  for  each  drug product filling size (0.4 ml filling and 1.0 ml filling). The next two manufactured drug product batches will be included into the current stability study. In conjunction with extensive supportive stability data, the new requested shelf life of 18 months at 5 ± 3°C for Zutectra drug product (0.4 ml and 1.0 ml filling  size)  is  justified  with  regard  to  ICH  guideline  Q5C  (Quality  of  Biotechnological  Products: Stability  Testing  of  Biotechnological/  Biological  Products;  CPMP/ICH/138/95-ICH-Q5C)  and  ICH guideline Q1E (Evaluation for Stability Data; CPMP/ICH/ 420/02-ICH Q1E)). The applicant commits to submit the final report including at least 18 months stability data for Zutectra drug product.

## TSE Safety

TSE reduction/removal studies have been performed for two steps of the manufacturing process for Zutectra  i.e.  the  precipitation  and  separation  of  fraction  I/III  from  fraction  II  and  the  nanofiltration step. Safety with regard to TSE has been adequately demonstrated.

## Virus safety

Zutectra is produced from human plasma by cold ethanol fractionation up to fraction II followed by caprylic  acid  treatment,  solvent/detergent  (S/D)  treatment  with  polysorbate  80  and  tri-n-butyl phosphate,  cation  exchange  chromatography  and  nanofiltration.  The  relevant  production  steps  have been investigated for their capacity to remove or inactivate viruses. Two steps (caprylic acid treatment and S/D treatment) have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate enveloped viruses. Virus safety against  enveloped  viruses  such  as  HIV,  HCV,  HBV  has  been  adequately  demonstrated.  The precipitation  and  separation  of  Fraction  I/III  from  Fraction  II  is  important  for  removal  of  nonenveloped viruses from the product. Efficient removal of non-enveloped model viruses Reovirus and porcine  parvovirus  (a  model  for  parvovirus  B19  and  a  very  stable,  small  non-enveloped  virus  for which antibodies are not present in the product) was demonstrated for this step. To improve the viral safety of Zutectra further, nanofiltration is also performed and effective reduction of both enveloped viruses and non-enveloped viruses has been demonstrated. Furthermore it is expected that neutralising antibodies  make  an  important  contribution  of  the  safety  of  Zutectra  against  hepatitis  A  virus  and parvovirus B19.

Virus and TSE safety has been adequately demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Based on the submitted data, the marketing authorisation application for Zutectra is recommended for approval  based  on  quality  grounds.  Overall,  information  on  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug substance and drug product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important quality characteristics.

At the time of the opinion, the applicant has committed to finalise the ongoing stability studies and report the outcome within an agreed timeframe.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Zutectra is a sterile, purified solution of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin derived from plasma. It complies with the relevant Ph. Eur. monograph (see Quality aspects).

A limited nonclinical programme has been performed with Zutectra. Standard nonclinical models for the investigation were in general considered of limited relevance as the product is a human protein hence eliciting in animal species an immune response that is not predictive of the situation in humans. The scope of the programme was in compliance with the principles outlined in the Note for Guidance on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/302/95, ICH S  6),  which  are  applicable  to  plasma  derived  products.  The  applicant  also  made  reference  to nonclinical  studies  conducted  with  another  immunoglobulin  preparation,  Intratect,  and  extrapolated these results to Zutectra. Intratect is a  standard  immunoglobulin  preparation  for  intravenous administration. The manufacturing process of Intratect differed from the one for Zutectra in terms of the starting material (normal plasma instead of specific plasma), the nanometre filtration and the final ultra-/diafiltration  step.  The  differences  were  considered  marginal  by  the  applicant  with  regard  to product  characteristics,  production  process  and  safety  hence  the  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  were considered relevant for Zutectra.

Therefore, the nonclinical programme consisted of two local tolerance studies conducted with Zutectra as  well  as  a  study  investigating  single-dose  toxicity  and  safety  pharmacology  of  Intratect.  These studies were GLP-compliant. References to published literature were provided where appropriate to address aspects which have not been covered by designated studies.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

The  mechanism  of  action  of  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  is  passive  immunisation  against  infection with the hepatitis B virus. The immunoglobulins will neutralise viral particles, preventing them from binding to the target cells (hepatocytes). The viral particles will also be eliminated.

Specific pharmacodynamic studies have not been performed with Zutectra, except for the evaluation of a survey of antibody functional activity and binding function in vitro in a minimum of three batches of product. The study demonstrated the presence of anti-HBs antibodies required for anti-hepatitis B activity.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The above-mentioned in vitro studies further showed the presence of antibodies against a variety of bacteria, viruses and fungi. In addition, Fc functional activity was confirmed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Safety pharmacology programme

Reference was made from a safety pharmacology study using Intratect (study LPT 12422/99). In this study Intratect was compared with the previously marketed product (Intraglobin CP) by intravenous infusion  of  0.6 ml/kg/min  for  8  min  in  Beagle  dogs.  Measurements  included  respiratory  rate,  body temperature, blood pressure, electrocardiography recordings and urinalysis.

No significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate or urinalysis. The ECG showed no substance-related  alterations  in  PW,  QT,  QRS-interval  or  P-segment.  Since  Zutectra  is  given subcutaneously rather than intravenously, it is likely to reach Cmax more slowly than Intratect. It is accepted that the data from Intratect can be extrapolated to Zutectra.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No studies are required for this type of product.

## Pharmacokinetics

No nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted. The immunoglobulin molecules present in  Zutectra  are  normal  constituents  of  the  human  body.  The  plasma  half-life  in  animals  is  usually considerably  shorter  than  that  in  humans.  Animals  that  are  genetically  similar  to  humans  typically show  a  moderately  reduced  plasma  half-life  compared  with  humans  (to  two  thirds  in  primates), whereas it is drastically reduced in rodents (few days). Therefore, pharmacokinetic studies in animals are  in  general  of  limited  predictive  value  for  the  situation  in  humans  and  are  not  used  for  the justification of the dose and dosing scheme. With regard to excretion it can be assumed that Zutectra will  be  degraded  into  small  peptides  and  component  amino  acids  via  catabolic  pathways  that  are typically associated with endogenous IgG.

Therefore,  in  accordance  with  the  principles  applied  for  the  nonclinical  development  of  plasmaderived immunoglobulin preparations this approach is considered acceptable.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

A single dose toxicity study was performed with Intratect (study LPT 12422/99) and the results were extrapolated to Zutectra. In this study, which was conducted together with the safety pharmacology analysis, beagle dogs (2/sex/group) were intravenously infused with 0.9 % NaCl solution, Intraglobin CP  (reference  product  for  Intratect)  or  Intratect  (0.6  ml/kg  bw/min  for  8  minutes  resulting  in 240 mg/kg). Dogs were followed for 14 days after treatment. Samples for haematology and clinical biochemistry were taken during the first 24 hours after infusion and on test day 14.

No mortality occurred and no substance-related clinical signs were noted. With regard to haematology, a reduction in leukocytes and platelets was observed in the treated compared to control animals and the  ratio  of  neutrophils  to  leukocytes  had  shifted  toward  leukocytes.  These  changes  are  considered typical for normal immune system responses to an antigenic material. At the end of the observation period leukocyte and platelet numbers had returned to normal. A slight to moderate increase in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase  activity was  observed following  treatment  with  Intratect.  None  of  these  changes  is  considered  to  raise  any  toxicological concerns. No test substance-related pathological macroscopic findings were observed at necropsy after the end of the 14-day follow up period.

Given  that  Intratect  is  produced  by  a  comparable  process,  the  data  obtained  with  Intratect  are considered indicative of the toxicity of Zutectra. In this study, Intratect was given intravenous which is considered as worst case because drug peak levels are reached faster than with the subcutaneous route of administration intended for Zutectra.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

No  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed.  This  is  considered  acceptable  given  that  human immunoglobulins administered to animals can be expected to elicit an immune response, which would interfere with the toxicity evaluation.

- Genotoxicity

No  studies  on  genotoxicity  were  performed,  which  is  in  accordance  with  Note  for  Guidance  on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/302/95, ICH S 6). Human  immunglobulins  are  not  expected  to  directly interact  with  DNA  or  other chromosomal material.

- Carcinogenicity

No studies  on  carcinogenicity  were  performed,  which  is  in  accordance  with  Note  for  Guidance  on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/302/95, ICH S 6).  Human  immunglobulins  are  endogenous  materials  for  which  carcinogenicity  studies  are inappropriate.

- Reproduction Toxicity

No studies on the reproductive and developmental toxicity were performed. According to the Note for Guidance on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/302/95, ICH S 6) the need for such studies depend on the product. In case of plasmaderived human immunoglobulin preparations such studies are not required.

- Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic data has not been generated and are not considered necessary.

- Local tolerance

The  local  tolerance  to  Zutectra  was  investigated  in  two  studies  in  New  Zealand  White  rabbits.  In addition, supportive data can be derived from the safety pharmacology/toxicology study with Intratect.

The acute local tolerance was investigated after a single subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra-arterial or intravenous  injection  of  Zutectra  (149  mg/ml)  and  the  vehicle  (0.9  %  NaCl)  as  control  article. Injection volume of both test article and vehicle was 1 ml per injection site. This study is considered the pivotal local tolerance study since the product used in that study was produced according to the latest process (with nanofiltration).

No local reactions attributable to the test item were observed. Haematoma observed at the injection sites after intra-arterial, intravenous and intramuscular injection occurred with similar incidence and similar severity in test and control animals hence these findings were considered to be associated with the  administration  procedure.  At  subcutaneous  injection  sites,  no  local  reactions  were  recorded. Further  macroscopic  findings  did  not  indicate  a  difference  between  the  test  article  and  the  controltreated sites. Histopathology findings were few, of low severity, and with no difference between the test article-treated and the vehicle-treated sites for any route of application.

Based on this data it is concluded that administration of 150 mg Zutectra (1 ml) is well tolerated at the intended subcutaneous route and other accidental routes of administration (intra-arterial, intravenous or intramuscular).

## Study10-3-0199-03:

The  acute  local  tolerance  was  investigated  in  rabbits  after  single  intramuscular  and  subcutaneous injection. Rabbits (6/sex) were treated with test article and vehicle by both routes of administration, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Injection volume was 2 ml (approximately 300 mg) per injection site and  the  observation  period  was  7  days.  The  product  used  in  this  study  was  produced  without nanofiltration.

In all animals, there were no abnormal clinical signs and body weight changes were normal. At the injection sites, there were no findings during the 7 days observation period. The sites were visible due to  the  labelling,  but  no  tissue  reactions  were  observed  macroscopically.  Microscopically,  a  small number  of  morphologic  findings  was  observed  in  skin  and  intramuscular  injection  sites,  but  the alterations  in  the  test  article-treated  sites  did  not  differ  significantly  from  those  observed  in  the vehicle-treated control sites. Posttraumatic changes were observed at almost all intramuscular injection sites (treated and control sites). These changes were considered to have been induced by the labelling suture material or to be due to the mechanical injury during the injection procedure rather than to a direct irritating effect of the test article.

In  this  study,  the  single  intramuscular  and  subcutaneous  injection  of  Zutectra  to  rabbits  did  not produce any evidence of a toxic effect. The fact that the product used in this study was manufactured slightly differently (without nanofiltration) was considered minor and not relevant for the conclusion that Zutectra is considered to be well tolerated after an intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.

## Study LPT 12422/99

This  combined  safety  pharmacology/single-dose  toxicity  study  (see  above)  also  addressed  the  local tolerance to Intratect administered intravenous. Beagle dogs (2/sex/group) were intravenously infused with  0.9  %  NaCl  solution,  Intraglobin  CP  (reference  product  for  Intratect)  or  Intratect  (0.6  ml/kg bw/min for 8 minutes resulting in 240 mg/kg).

No substance related local intolerance reaction at or around the infusion sites was found during the daily  observations  of  clinical  symptoms.  There  were  no  substance-related  findings  at  necropsy  or during histopathology.  The  few  microscopic  findings  were  regarded  spontaneous  and  related  to  the infusion procedure.

Overall, this study supports the results obtained in rabbits with Zutectra.

- Other toxicity studies

Process-related impurities in Zutectra are tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) and polysorbate 80, both of which are used during manufacturing for virus inactivation. The applicant has provided a review of the toxicological properties of TNBP and polysorbate 80 after single and multiple doses in various animal species based on published references; the main findings are summarised in table 1:

LDso=Lethal Dose Fifty (a calculated dose of a substance which is expected to cause the death of 50%of an entire defined experimental animalpopulation)

TDLo = Toxic Dose Low (the lowest dose of a substance introduced by any route, other than inhalation, over any given period of effects in humans or animals)

Taking  into  account  the  concentrations  of  TNBP  and  polysorbate  80  in  the  finished  products,  the exposure  of  patients  to  TNBP  and  polysorbate  80  is  significantly  lower  than  the  toxic  dose  levels (LD50, LDLo, TDlo) referred to in the published nonclinical studies. Based on these data and also the long  clinical  experience  with  products  that  contain  TNBP  and  polysorbate  80,  it  is  considered acceptable  to  administer  Zutectra  to  humans  at  the  proposed  doses.  No  further  toxicity  studies  are warranted.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant has justified the absence of an environmental risk assessment for this plasma-derived immunoglobulin preparation. In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the requirement  to  perform  an  environmental  risk  assessment  because  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, the lack of such assessment is acceptable.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The main clinical programme to support the present marketing authorisation application comprised the following studies:

- -Phase  I  study  to  establish  the  pharmacokinetics  following  subcutaneous  administration compared to intramuscular administration (study 956);
- -Phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous use in liver transplanted patients (study 958).

An overview of the key elements of these studies is provided in Table 2. In addition, the data from supportive studies conducted with a different hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparation, Hepatect CP, has  been  provided.  This  product  is  authorised  for  intravenous  use  and  therefore  has  a  different composition; however the active substance is the same.

** orthotopic liver transplant

There is no specific European guideline for the clinical development of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparations for subcutaneous use currently available. The following guidance documents are to some extent applicable for this application:

- Core SPC  for human  plasma derived Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin for intravenous use (CPMP/BPWG/4027/02);
- Core  SPC  for  human  plasma  derived  Hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  for  intramuscular  use (CPMP/BPWG/4222/02);
- Guidance on the clinical  investigation of  human  normal  immunoglobulin  for  intramuscular  and subcutaneous route of administration (CPMP/BPWG/283/00).

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Absorption / Distribution / Elimination

The pharmacokinetic profile of this specific plasma-derived Hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparation has been investigated in a single pharmacokinetic study comparing the subcutaneous administration against the intramuscular administration (study 956). Additional pharmacokinetic data was provided from studies  using  a  different  Hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  preparation  for  intravenous  use  (studies 886,  930,  944).  For  the  general  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  subcutaneously  administered  human hepatitis B immunoglobulin it is established that with regard to distribution they are transported from subcutaneous compartments and are subsequently distributed between plasma and extravascular fluids. In terms of metabolism and elimination, immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-complexes are broken down  in  the  reticuloendothelial  system  and  the  vast  majority  of  immunoglobulin  is  eliminated  by catabolism.  For  all  routes  of  administration,  the  half-life  of  natural  human  immunoglobulin  is approximately 3-4 weeks.

## Study 956

This  was  an  open,  mono-centre,  randomized  Phase  I  study  investigating  the  pharmacokinetics  and safety of Zutectra in 30 healthy volunteers following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration, each as 30 IU/kg (1560- 3000 IU) single dose. The follow-up was 71 days.

Male and female healthy volunteers (age 18-50 years) with negative hepatitis and HIV serology were eligible for enrolment. Fifteen subjects received Zutectra via the subcutaneous route, and 15 subjects via  the  intramuscular  route.  There  were  no  withdrawals;  all  30  subjects  completed  the  study  as intended  in  the  study  protocol.  Demographic  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the subcutaneous  and  intramuscular  groups.  All  30  subjects  were  Caucasian.  7  (46.7%)  subjects  in  the subcutaneous group and 8 (53.3%) subjects in the intramuscular group were male. The mean ± SD age was 34.3 ± 6.4 years for the subcutaneous group versus 36.3 ± 8.7 for the intramuscular group; the mean ± SD body weight was 69.7 ± 10.6 kg versus 75.1 ± 12.6 kg, respectively; and the mean ± SD body mass index was 23.1 ± 2.4 kg/m 2 versus 24.0 ± 3.1 kg/m 2 , respectively.

The  PK  parameters  were  calculated  using  non-compartmental  modelling.  The  parameters  were described  by  statistical characteristics  stratified  for  route  of  administration  (subcutaneous  and intramuscular). No  formal statistical comparison between both routes of administration was performed.

Mean anti-HBs concentrations increased to maximum values of 0.34 ± 0.06 IU/ml (subcutaneous) and 0.38 ± 0.04 IU/ml (intramuscular), respectively, on Day 4 after application. On Day 42, mean ± SD anti-HBs  concentrations  were  0.12  ±  0.03  IU/ml  for  subcutaneous  and  0.13  ±  0.03  IU/ml  for intramuscular; at the end of the observation period on Day 71 anti-HBs concentrations were still above baseline levels at 0.05 ± 0.02 (subcutaneous) and 0.06 ± 0.02 (intramuscular) IU/ml, respectively. The mean ± SD terminal elimination half-life (t1/2el) was 23.7 ± 3.3 days for the subcutaneous group and 22.9 ± 3.6 days for the intramuscular group. A reliable elimination phase could be identified for all subjects.

The  mean  serum  anti-HBs  antibody  concentrations  measured  during  the  course  of  the  study  are displayed in Figure 1 for the subcutaneous and intramuscular treatment groups.

It was noted by the CHMP that the product used in this study was a pre-nanofiltration product, i.e. not the actual product that will be marketed. For Zutectra the comparability between the nanofiltered and non-nanofiltered product was also shown from a quality perspective. Therefore, additional pharmacokinetic or efficacy studies are not deemed necessary.

The results of this study demonstrated that the half-life (t½=23 days), tmax (~4 days) and clearance (Cl =0.11 ± 0.03) are in keeping with results expected from a typical immunoglobulin administered subcutaneously/intramuscularly.  Given  the  lower  dosing  levels  compared  to  the  intravenous  studies the  Cmax  (0.4  IU/ml)  and  AUC  (11.7  IU*d/ml)  values  are  accordingly  lower.  This  is  in  part compensated by the fact that the subcutaneous treatment would be given four times per month and thus  the  Cmax  values  would  be  expected  to  provide  stable  levels  throughout  a  given  month  of treatment. The larger fluctuations of serum anti HBs antibody levels of intravenous treatment would be mitigated.

The dosing in this pharmacokinetic study was considerably higher than in the efficacy study (mean 2280 IU in study 956 vs. 750 IU in the efficacy study 958), despite the fact that antibody consumption would be surmised to be higher in liver transplant patients. It was noted by the CHMP that a clear rationale for the dose 'finding' was not provided, nor was a dose-proportionality study conducted. The dose chosen in the efficacy study was empiric due to a larger than expected decline in anti HBs trough levels ( 30%; expected rate 20%) which ultimately led to dosing by a body weight below and above 75 kg of 500 IU (1 ml) / week and 1,000 IU (2x 1 ml) / week respectively.

The core SPC for intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin products for the orthotopic liver transplant indication  requires  specific  antibody  levels  to  be  maintained  for  the  protection;  this  principle  also applies to the subcutaneous administration. Given the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Zutectra after the subcutaneous administration, i.e. a long tmax (4d) and lower Cmax (0.4 IU/ml) obtained at doses larger than those used in the efficacy study, it appears appropriate that the product is not used in newly transplanted patients but in HBV-DNA negative, stable patients who had to have been transplanted &gt; 6 months previously.

## Studies 886, 930, 944

These  three  pharmacokinetic  studies  had  been  conducted  with  Hepatect  formulations  following intravenous administration. The results are summarised in table 3. The data shows the expected range of pharmacokinetic values for Cmax (1.8 - 3.3.IU/ml), Tmax (1.4 - 4.0 h), T1/2 (22 - 32 days), and AUC  (29  -  55  IU*d/ml),  depending  on  the  population  (healthy  volunteers,  immunodeficiency patients). All values were within the ranges reported in the literature for intravenous immunoglobulins.

CLL: chronic lymphatic leukaemia; MM: multiple myeloma; *directly after completion of infusion

Bioavailability  with  intravenous  administration  of  Hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  was  more  or  less immediate,  with  tmax  reached  at  means  of  1.4  to  4.0  hours  post-infusion;  whereas  the  maximum concentration with subcutaneous and intramuscular routes was reached at a mean of approximately 4 days post-administration. The calculated mean elimination half-life was between 3 and 4 weeks for all Hepatitis B immunoglobulin dosage forms and administration routes. It can be concluded that despite some shortcomings of the design of study 956 (larger doses than the efficacy study, pre-nanofiltration product) the expected pharmacokinetic characteristics of a subcutaneous immunoglobulin prevail.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No  dose-proportionality  study  was  conducted.  The  Hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  core  SPC  for intravenous products does not state a specific dose, rather certain antibody levels are to be maintained as they are considered to be protective; this principle would apply to the subcutaneous administration as well.

## · Special populations

Studies  in  special  populations  have  not  been  performed,  which  is  acceptable  for  this  product containing a plasma-derived immunoglobulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted,  which  is  acceptable  for  this  product containing a plasma-derived immunoglobulin.

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials have been conducted, which is acceptable for this product containing a plasma-derived immunoglobulin.

## Pharmacodynamics

There was no formal pharmacodynamic study conducted by the applicant. This is appropriate for this type of product.

- Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of hepatitis B immunoglobulin is a selective binding of the immunoglobulin to  viral  particles  (via  HBsAg)  and  their  elimination  via  complement-dependent  and  independent pathways thereby preventing further dissemination of the virus and its reuptake by neighbouring cells during post-exposure prophylaxis.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The use in liver transplant patients is based on theoretical hypothesis that large quantities of hepatitis B immunoglobulin can prevent de novo infection of the graft with circulating virus which can reside in the extra-hepatic compartments of the recipient and may prevent interhepatocyte viral transfer as well. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin also undergoes endocytosis by hepatocytes and binds to HBsAg within cells already infected, thereby decreasing viral secretion. It is also hypothesized that the Fc-fragmentmediated  complement  activity  can  trigger  the  elimination  of  virally  infected  hepatocytes  and  other virus-harbouring cells.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study

As mentioned in the pharmacokinetic section a dose finding study was not conducted. The choice of weight  guided  dose  for  immunoprophylaxis  in  adults  (500  IU/week  for  adults  &lt;75  kg  and 1000 IU/week  for  adults ≥ 75  kg)  was  based  on  a  trend  for  reduction  of  trough  anti-HBs  levels following use of 500 IU in the first 3 patients enrolled in the pivotal efficacy trial 958 (see below). The applicant claimed that the weight-based approach takes into account that the subcutaneous space may have a greater volume in patients with higher body weight. The greater volume in the subcutaneous space could lead to lower bioavailability, e.g. by influencing the kinetics of absorption of hepatitis B immunoglobulin from subcutaneous tissue into the vascular space.

Although this approach cannot be considered optimal from the point of view of clinical development, the  outcome  in  terms  of  maintaining  adequate  trough  levels  in  the  HBV-DNA  negative  and  stable population  is  recognised  as  it  reflects  the  position  of  dosing  by  titre  as  stated  in  the  core  SPC  for hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparations.

- Main study

## Study 958: Prevention of Hepatitis B recurrence following liver transplantation

This  was  a  Phase  III,  open,  prospective,  single-arm  study  investigating  efficacy  and  safety  and feasibility  of  home  treatment  after  weekly  subcutaneous  applications  of  Zutectra  in  23  liver

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

transplanted patients (HBsAg-cleared and DNA-negative liver transplant patients) for a duration of 1824 weeks.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

The main inclusion criteria were as follows: male and female patients aged 18-75 years; ≥ 3 months after  liver  transplantation;  HBsAg  negative;  regular  long-term  HBIg  prophylaxis  (combined  reinfection prophylaxis) with stabilised HBIg dosage and administration intervals; stable liver function. In addition the patients included had to have a baseline serum HBs antibody concentration ≥ 300 IU/l - 500 IU/l from their intravenous treatment.

## Treatments

Zutectra was given as a 500 IU (1 ml) dose for patients with bodyweight &lt; 75 kg and a 1000 IU (2 ml) dose for patients with bodyweight ≥ 75 kg per week. This dosing was introduced after a Substantial Amendment following decline in trough levels in 2 of the first 7 patients of &gt;30% over time which was larger than the anticipated 20% predicted from Study 956.

The study period comprised 18 weeks with a facultative extension for another 6 weeks (total study duration: 24 weeks). Patients were converted from standard intravenous to subcutaneous hepatitis B immunoglobulin according to their individual scheduled dosing interval, approximately 3 to 4 weeks after the last intravenous dosage. The planned treatment period was 18 weeks; therapy was to continue for  a  further  6  weeks  (total  duration  24  weeks)  for  patients  who  were  compliant  with  the  injection technique and had stable anti-HBs serum levels.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of Zutectra in the prevention of HBV re-infection in liver transplant HBV DNA -negative patients by maintaining serum anti-HBs antibody trough levels of ≥ 100 IU/l.

The secondary objectives for efficacy encompassed the number of hepatitis B related infections and also  included  safety  and  tolerability,  and  feasibility  of  the  subcutaneous  home  administration (percentage of self-administration, time to first self-administration, time to complete selfadministration).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  maintenance  of  serum  trough  levels  of  anti-HBs  antibody ≥ 100 IU/l  (level  of  effective  prevention).  Treatment  failure  was  defined  as  Ctrough of  anti-HBs concentration &lt; 100 IU/l at visit 18 or Ctrough of HBs values &lt; 100 IU/l leading to withdrawal prior to visit 18.

Secondary  endpoints:  Number  of  hepatitis  B  related  infections  (monitoring  of  clinical  signs,  liver function  and  measurement  of  HBsAg).  Liver  enzymes  were  measured  regularly  according  to  the schedule  of  assessment  of  safety  laboratory  parameters.  Feasibility  of  the  subcutaneous  home administration was evaluated.

## Sample size

Sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  a  HBV  re-infection  rate  of  20%  for  patients  receiving  no prophylactic treatment for HBV re-infection during an 18 week period. This estimate is a conservative one, because approximately 65% of transplanted patients with previous chronic HBV infection who do not receive HBIG are reinfected with HBV within 26 weeks of liver transplant. Patients requiring liver transplant  because of HBV-related liver cirrhosis, who form the majority of patients in this setting,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

have an even higher risk of re-infection. The upper 95% CI for a sample size of 20 patients with an assumed 20% proportion of re-infection is 37.5%, which was considered to be medically acceptable for the intended population. To allow a study population of 20 evaluable patients after adjusting for possible drop outs for non-medical reasons, 30 patients were planned for recruitment.

The study was small in size, but the estimation of sample size was considered acceptable in the light of very low expected recurrence rate in DNA-negative patients.

## Randomisation / Blinding (masking)

The study was non-randomized and open label.

## Statistical methods

Ctrough measured concentration at the end of a dosing interval (taken directly before next administration) were used. The trough values were calculated for serum HBs antibody concentrations. Serum HBs antibody concentrations described as 'negative' were set to '0' for all calculations. The failure-rate after 18 weeks and the respective 95% confidence interval were calculated. A failure was defined by two possible outcomes as follows:

1) anti-HBs concentrations &lt; 100 IU/l at last visit;

- 2)  serum  HBs  antibody  concentrations  tending  to  decrease  below  a  value  of  100  IU/l  during  the weekly subcutaneous dosing schedule, resulting in premature withdrawal of the patient from the study by the investigator.

Time to failure was analysed using survival time methods. The failure rate over time was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, i.e. events were taken into account when they occurred. The failure rate at the end of the study and the according 95% CI were determined. The rate of patients with antiHBs concentrations &lt; 100 IU/l and the respective 95% CI were calculated. Patients whose serum HBs antibody  concentration  tended  to  decrease  below  a  value  of  100  IU/l  during  the  weekly  dosing schedule  were  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  study  by  the  investigator.  The  rate  of  patients prematurely withdrawn for reasons as defined above and the respective 95% confidence interval were calculated. The time to withdrawal was analysed using survival methods.

It was noted that the statistical analysis plan for this study was finalized at a time when the data of this open  trial  was  known.  In  addition,  there  were  several  methodological  flaws  (definition  of  the  ITT population, method for the calculation of confidence intervals, statistical model applied). However, it was considered that these issues do not per se impact on the actual clinical outcome.

## Recruitment

Patients were recruited at two German centres. A centre in Italy, which was foreseen as study site, was closed following screening of three patients; this centre did not include any patient. The first patient was enrolled on 22 August 2006, the last patient completed treatment on 3 March 2008.

## Conduct of the study

This study was initially planned as phase III comparative trial assessing the intramuscular versus the subcutaneous  route.  However,  after  enrolling  7  patients,  the  trial  was  suspended  and  amended  to continue  as  a  single  arm,  non-randomized,  observational  trial  using  only  the  subcutaneous  route  of administration. There were several reasons for amendments:

- The intramuscular  arm  was  discarded  due  to  localised  pain  and  it  was  considered  that  this  AE would impose a limitation to the quality of life in a population of patients for whom a lifetime of weekly administration was foreseen. Due to dispensing with the intramuscular arm the study was no longer a comparative trial but was converted into an observational non-randomized single-arm study
- The dose of 500 IU was thought to be low to maintain the required trough levels &gt;100 IU/l (albeit trough  levels  showed  only  trend  for  reduction  but  were  above  &gt;100  IU/l),  so  a  change  in  dose regimen was required: for patients with ≥ 75 kg of weight 1000 IU/week dose was proposed.

Another amendment during the course of the study was related to a modified manufacturing process of the  medicinal  product.  The  production  process  of  the  second  batch  used  in  the  study  included  an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

additional nanofiltration step. The planned subgroup analysis to compare the two batches (nanofiltrated yes/no) was not performed for efficacy, due to small numbers.

## Baseline data

23 Caucasian stable liver transplant patients aged 29 - 72, mean age was 50.8 years, were included, all of  which  were  HIV  and/or  HCV  negative.  The  median  weight  was  72  kg,  ranging  from  51  kg  to 105 kg. The mean weight was 74.7 ± 15.3 kg.

The mean time from liver transplantation to the first administration of Zutectra in this study was 5.1 ± 3.1 years in patients of the ITT set. The median was 4.7 years ranging from 0.52 to 10.7 years. The reasons  for  liver  transplantations  were  chronic  Hepatitis  B-cirrhosis,  acute  liver  failure  (ALF),  coinfection with HCV, re-transplantation and others. Overall, 16.7% (5/30) of patients had ALF without evidence of previous HBV-related cirrhosis. Of these five patients, three were positive for HBV-DNA replication at the time of the initial diagnosis and all were receiving virostatic medication before the study,  which  continued  during  the  study.  Only  2/30  patients  had  ALF  without  cirrhosis  and  were HBV-DNA negative;  these  patients  most  likely  have  a  better  prognosis  but  given  the  size  of  this subgroup will not lead to a bias in the recurrence rate.

18 patients were taking concomitant antiviral drugs: 15 patients took lamivudine and 1 patient each took  tenofovir,  'valaciclovir  hydrochloride'  or  'valganciclovir  hydrochloride',  respectively.  All patients were on stable immunosuppressive therapy with no signs of concurrent rejection.

## Numbers analysed

The  study included 30 patients who  had  stable virological,  immunological  and  biochemical characteristics  of  the  liver  disease  (HBsAg-cleared  and  DNA-negative  liver  transplant  patients). However according to the applicant, patients nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 who started the study in 2006 according to the initial study design (randomisation to subcutaneous or intramuscular administration) were not eligible due to missing data and, therefore, not included into the ITT set. Therefore the ITT set included 23 patients and 1 was excluded for PP analysis because of protocol violation (intravenous infusion of Hepatect CP was given).

## Outcomes and estimation

All  23  patients  achieved  the  primary  endpoint  of  maintaining  serum  HBs  antibody  concentrations &gt; 100 IU/l, which are required to offer effective protection against Hepatitis B virus re-infection of transplanted liver in non-replicators. Using the Clopper Pearson method, the failure rate after 18 weeks was 0% for patients of the ITT set (95% CI: [0, 14.8%]). A failure rate of 0% was also found for the facultative extension phase (week 24) (95% CI: [0, 20.6%]). The available data for at least 5 doses in the excluded 7 patients were also within the therapeutic range.

Overall,  the  population  from  Study  958  is  considered  to  have  a  very  low  baseline  risk  of  HBV recurrence  since  most  of  the  patients  were  already  well  stabilised,  with  prior  intravenous  treatment with  HBIG,  and  no  signs  of  rejection  or  serological/molecular  signs  of  infection  (antigenaemia  or DNA replication).

After  the  core  and  extension  treatment  periods  with  subcutaneous  use  in  this  study,  patients  were switched  back  to  intravenous  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin.  This  was  done  safely,  with  no  apparent adverse reactions related to the switch. Therefore, should the need arise patients can be switched back to intravenous administration. A further return to subcutaneous would require stable trough levels of 300-500 IU/l under prior intravenous administration, which is addressed in the SPC.

With  regard  to  the  secondary  endpoint  no  hepatitis  B  related  infection,  as  measured  by  HBsAg, occurred, however one must keep in mind that this is a comparatively short trial in 23 patients. Time to recurrence  is  often  greater  than  six  months.  In  a  recent  review  of  the  literature  in  orthotopic  liver transplant  patients  who  were  between  5  -100%  HBV  DNA  positive  at  liver  transplant  and  had  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

follow-up of 18-88 months, HBV recurrence rates ranged between 2-22%. Although the 0% seen in Zutectra 6 month trial is most likely to be an underestimation the data provided lie within the range of what is attainable with the current medical regimens in liver transplant patients.

The  high  number  of  Zutectra  self-administrations  (287  versus  122  by  study  site  staff)  by  patients demonstrates  the  general  feasibility  of  self-administration.  The  number  of  patients  with  selfadministration  increased  steadily  during  the  study  and  showed  good  tolerability.  The  applicant  will however be performing a further clinical study as a post-authorisation commitment to address the issue of compliance during home therapy in more detail.

## Ancillary analyses

Ancillary analyses were not performed.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Analyses across trials were not performed.

- Clinical studies in special populations

Studies in special populations were not performed.

The  low  number  of  hepatic  failure  secondary  to  HBV  and  the  accompanying  number  of  liver transplants in children does not allow systematic collection of representative clinical data to assess the hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  prophylaxis  in  this  population.  However,  the  applicant  is  conducting  a study in infants born to HBsAg positive mothers for the perinatal prophylaxis.

Elderly patients were included in Study 958, albeit the numbers were small: 4 patients were aged 60 72 years.

- Supportive study(ies)

In the pharmacokinetic study 956 the duration of serum HBs antibody concentrations above 0.1 IU/ml (level  of  effective  prevention)  as  well  as  the  time  required  to  reach  the  target  concentration  were calculated  as  surrogate  parameter  for  efficacy  in  30  healthy  volunteers.  The  mean  ±  SD  time  after administration,  when  serum  concentrations  above  0.1  IU/ml  were  achieved  (onset  of  efficacy)  was 20.4 ± 7.5 hours in the subcutaneous group and 19.9 ± 8.2 hours in the intramuscular group. The mean ± SD time with serum anti-HBs concentrations above 0.1 IU/ml (duration of effective prevention) was 42.0 ± 8.3 days (subcutaneous) and 43.0 ± 9.0 days (intramuscular), respectively.

This  efficacy  data  is  considered  as  additionally  supportive  to  the  results  from  study  958.  Adequate anti-HBs  antibody  levels  were  reached  with  titres  above  100  IU/l  at  ~  1  day  after  application  and lasted until 42 days thereafter.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

The  safety  database  consists  of  2  studies  (956  and  958)  performed  with  Zutectra  encompassing 60 subjects (30 healthy volunteers and 30 liver transplant patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Adverse events

## Study 956

In  this  study  each  of  the  30  volunteers  received  30  IU/kg  bodyweight  of  Zutectra  (approximately 500 IU/ml) via subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. The total injection volume as calculated according to the individual body weight was 2.5 - 4.7 ml (total dose 1560 to 3000 IU).

A  total  of  57  adverse  events  (28/subcutaneous,  29/intramuscular)  were  reported  in  24/30  (80%) healthy  volunteers  (13/  subcutaneous,  11/intramuscular)  including  3  events  which  started  before application  of  study  medication.  The  investigator  assessed  43/57  (75%)  events  (23/subcutaneous, 20/intramuscular) as not related to the  study  medication,  3  events  as  unlikely  related  (swelling  and pain  at  the  wrist  (intramuscular)  and  pain  at  the  thigh  (intramuscular  about  3  weeks  after  Zutectra application) and 2 events as possibly related (extraordinary tiredness/subcutaneous, nausea/intramuscular  on  the  day  of  Zutectra  application).  For  9  adverse  events  (4/subcutaneous, 5/intramuscular)  the  relationship  to  study  medication  was  assessed  as  certain  according  to  the investigator. This concerned mild local reactions at the injection site in 4 subjects of the subcutaneous group and in 4 subjects of the intramuscular group starting on the day of Zutectra administration or on the day after the injections. In the subcutaneous group small hematoma and urticariae were observed, in the intramuscular group pain was reported as the main symptom. The latter concern contributed to the decision to remove intramuscular administration from the Study 958 protocol. All events resolved on the same day or within 1-4 days without any treatment. Two adverse events starting on the day of Zutectra application were assessed as possible related. This concerned transient extraordinary tiredness (subcutaneous) and a 6 day nausea (intramuscular). Both events were mild and resolved without any treatment.

## Study 958

In  Study  958,  Zutectra  (500  IU  (1  ml)  or  1000  IU  (2  applications  of  1  ml))  was  injected subcutaneously weekly up to 24 weeks. The mean ± SD treatment duration was 124 ± 59.1 days; and the mean ± SD number of syringes used was 23.1 ± 13.7 (safety population).

10 patients received medication only from the first (not nanofiltrated) batch, 7 patients only from the second (nanofiltrated) batch and 13 patients from both batches.

A total of 139 adverse events occurred, 135 thereof were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (4 were present at baseline) and were reported in 24/30 (80.0%) patients (5 in 2006, 19 in 2007). The investigator  assessed  24  events  as  not  related  to  the  study  medication,  101  events  as  unlikely  to  be related.  Seven  adverse  events  were  possibly  related  and  1  probably  related;  these  encompassed headache (3 patients), fatigue (1 patient), upper abdominal pain (1 patient), haematuria (1 patient), and injection site  reaction  (2  patients.).  No  clear  conclusions  could  be  drawn  from  the  different  batches administered  as  the  numbers  affected  were  too  small.  At  the  end  of  the  study  117  events  were resolved, 2 were in the process of resolving, 11 not resolved and 5 unknown

In general, in this 6 month study the rate of adverse events was low. All reported adverse events were either of mild or moderate severity.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In study 956 no serious adverse event related to Zutectra was reported.

In study 958 a total of 19 serious adverse event symptoms were reported in 9/30 (30%) patients, 16 of which  were  treatment-emergent.  10  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  event  symptoms  were assessed  as  unlikely  related,  6  as  not  related,  none  were  considered  possibly,  probably  or  certainly related. The SAEs mainly encompassed cholangitis and biliary draining procedures. At the end of the study 15 events were resolved, 1 was in the process of resolving.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  both  studies  there  were  no  deaths.  No  allergic,  anaphylactic  or  other  immunologically  relevant reactions were reported.

## · Laboratory findings

In  both  studies  (956  and  958)  routine  laboratory  assessments  (electrolytes,  haematology,  renal  and hepatic  function)  and  additionally  IgG1,  IgG2,  IgG3,  IgG4,  IgA,  IgM  and  Complement  C3  and  C4 were examined. No clinically relevant changes were observed during the studies for any subject.

- Safety in special populations

Studies in special populations have not been performed.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal interaction studies were performed. Most orthotopic liver transplant patients in study 958 were  on  concomitant  virostatic  medication.  Other  potential  interactions  e.g.  with  vaccines  are described in the SPC.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

In studies 956 and 958 there were no discontinuations due to adverse events. It is however noted that the applicant terminated the intramuscular arm of study 958 prematurely due to the apprehension that the intramuscular administration of 2 ml Zutectra into the deltoid muscle could impair the patient's well-being and consecutively the compliance.

## · Post marketing experience

In addition to the safety data from clinical trials with Zutectra or the intravenous human hepatitis B immunoglobulin  formulation  Hepatect  CP,  post-marketing  experience  is  available  for  the  use  of Hepatect CP in 28,932 patients.

The PSURs prepared for Hepatect CP so far (covering the period from April 2000 to October 2008) did not indicate findings changing the safety profile of the product. There was no new information on a change in characteristics of listed reactions with regard to severity, outcome or target population, on serious unlisted reactions, on non-serious unlisted reactions, or on an increased reporting frequency of listed  reactions.  No  reports  of  drug  interactions,  overdose,  and  drug  misuse  were  presented.  The reported cases did not reveal any new safety issue on pregnancy/lactation, special patient groups, and long-term treatment. In general the reported recurrence of HBV in the post-marketing period is very low.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Zutectra is a purified human hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparation which complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph  no.  0722  on  human  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  and  is  obtained  from  plasma  from selected  and/or  immunised  donors  having  antibodies  against  hepatitis  B  surface  (HBs)  antigen.  It contains the same active substance as Hepatect CP (licensed in Germany since 2000) with an adapted formulation for the subcutaneous route.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

A limited nonclinical programme has been performed, which is acceptable for this type of product, i.e. a  plasma  derived  human  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  preparation.  The  principles  of  the  Note  for Guidance on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/302/95, ICH S 6) have been adequately considered. In addition, reference was made to nonclinical data from another immunoglobulin preparation, Intratect.

Pharmacology aspects were covered with quality data. The safety pharmacology data generated with Intratect are considered indicative for Zutectra; no effect was observed on the cardiovascular and the respiratory  system.  In  terms  of  toxicology  studies  the  local  tolerance  of  Zutectra  was  investigated, which showed that the product is well tolerated when administered subcutaneously. The single dose toxicity study was performed with Intratect; no specific findings requiring further investigation.

Overall, the nonclinical programme is considered adequate.

## Efficacy

The  proposed  indication  in  prevention  of  HBV  re-infection  in  patients ≥ 6  months  following  liver transplantation was accompanied by the data from two trials: an open parallel group single-dose in Study 956 (study comparing PK parameters between intramuscular and subcutaneous administration in  30  healthy  volunteers)  and  an  open  non-randomized  single  arm  prospective  in  Study  958  (study monitoring  trough  levels  of  anti-HBs  in  30  stable  HBsAg-negative,  HBV  DNA-negative  liver transplant patients).

Study  956  demonstrated  the  typical  pattern  of  pharmacokinetics  for  immunoglobulin  products  with maximum  plasma  level  reached  within  2.0-7.0  days  after  either  subcutaneous  or  intramuscular injection. The anti-HBs Ig is slowly cleared with an elimination half-life of around 3 to 4 weeks. The mean  ±  SD  time  with  serum  anti-HBs  concentrations  above  0.1  IU/ml  (duration  of  effective prevention) was 42.0 ± 8.3 days (subcutaneous) and 43.0 ± 9.0 days (intramuscular), respectively. Cmax seems to be somewhat lower by subcutaneous route of administration compared with intramuscular (median values of 0.35 IU/ml and 0.40 IU/ml, respectively). This is expected with subcutaneous route, which is accompanied by slower tissue resorption and higher tissue diffusion/local elimination. The limitations of the pharmacokinetic study include the fact that the study was conducted with hepatitis B immunoglobulin produced using the process prior to introducing a 20 nm filtration step. In addition the posology 30 IU/kg utilized in the study has not been taken into phase III efficacy trial, where it was  reduced  to  6.67-13.3  IU/kg.  Extrapolation  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  to  lower  doses  is limited in terms of predicting half-life and Cmax changes and certainly inadequate in extrapolating time to reach optimal trough levels &gt;100 IU/l. However the overall conclusion from the study was that the  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  pharmacokinetic  parameters  derived  from  Study  956  confirm  the integrity  of  the  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin  molecules.  The  nanofiltration  step  introduced  into  the manufacturing at a later stage did not change the immunoglobulin properties from the quality point of view.  In  addition,  since  both  materials  were  included  in  the  subsequent  study  958  with  consistent trough  anti-HBs  levels  and  satisfactory  safety  results,  the  pharmacokinetic  characterisation  of  the product is considered to be sufficient for the licensure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  958  in  30  liver  transplant  patients  was  initially  planned  as  a  randomized  comparative  trial assessing trough levels of patients administered with HBIG either via intramuscular or subcutaneous routes. However the study protocol was amended to terminate the intramuscular route due to potential issues with compliance and long-term impact on the quality of life. The study was converted into the non-randomized study and included a new hepatitis B immunoglobulin batch manufactured using the newly  introduced  nanofiltration  step.  All  patients  enrolled  in  Study  958  had  well  established immunological, virological and biochemical control of the graft (no HBsAg, DNA-negative, no signs of rejection, concomitant antiviral medications). The range of time elapsed since the liver transplantation varied between 0.52 to 10.7 years. Thus, Study 958 would support a prevention starting no  sooner  than ≥ 6  month  after  liver  transplant  in  accordance  with  characteristics  of  the  enrolled population.

Although HBV-related acute live failure represented a significant proportion of patients in study 958, at least 43.3% of patients at the stage of diagnosis were HBV-DNA positive. Only 2/30 patients had acute liver failure without cirrhosis and were HBV-DNA negative; these patients most likely have a better prognosis but given the size of this subgroup will not lead to a bias in the recurrence rate. Since trough levels of anti-HBs antibodies were successfully maintained in all patients enrolled in study 958, there is no reason to believe that findings from this study cannot be extrapolated to both patients with acute and chronic liver failure.

The required baseline concentration of serum HBs antibody concentration ≥ 300 IU/l - 500 IU/l in this study was higher than the 'maintenance concentration' of &gt;100 IU/l to ensure that serum anti-HBs levels  remained  in  the  safety  margin  during  the  transition  from  intravenous  to  subcutaneous administration. As there was a delay in reaching peak concentrations with subcutaneous administration (Tmax  of  4  days)  and  the  subcutaneous  dosing  was  divided  into  4  weekly  doses/month,  the  serum baseline  concentration  had  to  supplement  a  period  of  1-2 weeks.  The  carry-over  from  the  last intravenous  administration  is  estimated  to  have  lasted  during  the  first  3-5  weeks  of  subcutaneous dosing.  This  baseline  concentration  is  recommended  in  the  SPC  prior  to  starting  on  subcutaneous administration.

The survival analysis showed that all 30 patients in the study had the trough serum anti-HBs antibody concentration above 100 IU/l at each time point. (7 of the 30 patients were excluded from the study since data were missing.) The failure rate was 0% after 18 and 24 weeks (95% CI: [0, 14.8%] and [0, 20.6%]  respectively).  A  HBV  re-infection  could  not  be  detected  for  any  patient.  The  study  also indicated  that  all  patients  were  able  to  learn  self-administration  and  gradually  were  able  to  inject Zutectra on weekly basis at home themselves with good degree of compliance.

After  treatment  with  subcutaneous  Zutectra,  patients  were  switched  back  to  intravenous  hepatitis  B immunoglobulin without any untoward reactions indicating that this can be done safely if the need arises.

Study 958 had a number of methodical issues concerning the change from a controlled two arm study to an open one-arm study, additionally it was a small (n=30) trial in low risk liver transplant patients (HBV DNA-negative patients, long periods since liver transplantation, good immunological control of the graft survival) conducted over a fairly short period (24 weeks) so that the overall probability to identify a recurrence was very low, thereby enhancing the success rate of the study. However, not only has the population now been adequately addressed in the SPC, but the product has to be seen in the light of its own historical development and the development of hepatitis B immunoglobulins in general in the liver transplant setting.

## Safety

Zutectra  appears  as  a  reasonably  safe  product  in  respect  of  local  and  systemic  adverse  events  and immunological events. There were no product related deaths, serious adverse events and immunologically  related  events  such  as  allergies  and  anaphylactic  reactions.  There  were  no  other adverse events previously reported with other immunoglobulin products such as haemolytic anaemia, renal complications, aseptic meningitis and complement abnormalities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Theoretically, the safety of product with subcutaneous administration is expected to be better than one of the same product for intravenous use. Lesser systemic exposure and lower propensity to induce a hypersensitivity  response  of  immediate  type  or  complement-mediated  adverse  events  during  the subcutaneous administration of Zutectra is anticipated to translate into the safety benefit.

The safety profile of Zutectra for subcutaneous maintenance therapy in stable liver transplant patients is considered acceptable. No untoward risks were identified.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

The  key  messages  for  safe  use  of  Zutectra  have  been  identified  and  the  questions reflect the key messages. Adaptations of the package leaflet have been made after the first round of user testing. Both rounds of user testing showed that, for each question, at least 90% of the volunteers were  able  to  find  the  information  as  requested,  and  at  least  90  %  of  the  participants  were  able  to answer the questions correctly. Therefore, the results of the user testing showed that the readability testing is acceptable.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The risk/benefit can be considered favourable based on the clinical data generated for Zutectra. The efficacy  of  Zutectra  in  prevention  of  Hepatitis  B  recurrence  in  HBV-DNA  negative  patients ≥ 6 months after liver transplant by maintaining anti-HBs serum levels in line with those required by the core SPC for hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparations (&gt; 100 IU/l) was demonstrated. In addition, the  available  data  and  experience  with  the  intravenous  preparation  Hepatect  can  be  regarded  as supportive.

From the  clinician/hepatologist's  and  patient's  point  of  view,  the  weekly  self-administration  of  the product  is  both  convenient  and  less  burdensome  for  public  health  services  in  terms  of  minimal involvement of medical personnel and requirements for home visits. The treatment is feasible provided appropriate training is given, initial supervision is in place and monitoring anti HBsAg levels is carried out regularly. The compliance and convenience for patients are mutually dependent, bearing in mind that the treatment is potentially indefinite.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered  that the risk-benefit balance of Zutectra in the:

Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBV-DNA negative patients ≥ 6 months after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure.

Zutectra is indicated in adults only.

The concomitant use of adequate virostatic agents should be considered, if appropriate, as standard of hepatitis B re-infection prophylaxis.

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
