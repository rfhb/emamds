## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cabotegravir (for pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

- -In view of available data on the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions from the signal assessment provided by the MAH, including one key case with a close temporal relationship which has to be assed as probable, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and cabotegravir is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing cabotegravir should be amended accordingly.
- -In view of available data on gait disturbance from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including &gt;100 cases (111 HIV and 16 PrEP) with a close temporal relationship in the context of injection site reactions, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between cabotegravir and injection site reactions (gait disturbance) is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of medicinal products containing cabotegravir (for injection) should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cabotegravir (for pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cabotegravir (for pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
