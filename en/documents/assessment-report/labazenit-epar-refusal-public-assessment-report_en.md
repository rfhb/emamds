## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The Applicant Laboratoires SMB s.a. submitted on 28 September 2011 an application for Marketing Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Labazenit,  through  the  centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the CHMP on 29 September 2008

The Applicant applied for the following indications:

Labazenit  is  indicated  in  the  regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  where  use  of  a  combination product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist) is appropriate:

- Patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonists.

or

- Patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists.

The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  10(b)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  fixed combination application.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P047/2010 on 31 March 2010 the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 January 2010. The Scientific Advice pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

## Licensing status

The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Asthma is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways; chronic inflammation causes an associated increase in airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night or in  the  early  morning.  The  episodes  are  usually  associated  with  widespread  but  variable  airflow obstruction that is usually reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment.

The  prevalence  of  atopy  and  asthma  has  increased  steeply  over  the  past  few  decades  in  western countries  and  more  recently  in less-developed  nations.  In  Europe,  the  prevalence  of  clinical  asthma ranges between 18.4% in Scotland and 4.9% in Scandinavia and the Baltic States. The natural history of  the  disease  is  characterised  by  periodic  symptomatic  exacerbations  making  additional  treatment needed. In patients with a history of multiple exacerbations there is a risk of long-term progressive decline in lung function. For all these reasons, additional treatment options are desirable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Labazenit is a new fixed combination medicinal product containing two known components, salmeterol xinafoate and budesonide. Salmeterol and budesonide have different modes of action. Corticosteroid therapy,  principally  inhaled  glucocorticosteroid  (ICS)  (such  as  budesonide),  is  considered  the  most effective anti-inflammatory treatment and therefore the cornerstone treatment of asthma. In patients not adequately controlled by an ICS alone, the addition of a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) (such  as  salmeterol)  is  preferred  to  reach  clinical  control,  over  increasing  the  dose  of  inhaled glucocorticosteroids (GINA  recommendations).  A  fixed  combination  formulation, in which both components are pre-set, offers an advantage in comparison to the use of the drugs separately, since it improves patient adherence to treatment.

This  fixed  combination  of  two  well-known,  Ph  Eur  described,  active  substances,  budesonide  and salmeterol  xinafoate,  is  formulated  in  a  hard  capsule  as  powder  for  inhalation  in  two  strengths: budesonide 120 mcg and salmeterol (as the xinafoate) 20 mcg, budesonide 240 mcg and salmeterol (as  the  xinafoate)  20  mcg.  It  is  the  first  fixed  combination  medicinal  product  of  these  two  active substances. Both budesonide and salmeterol xinafoate are available as single, dry powder inhalation products, e.g. Pulmicort Turbohaler (100, 200, and 400 mcg) and Serevent powder for inhalation (50 mcg).  The  application  is  based  on  new  clinical  study  results  relating  to  this  fixed  combination.  The maximum daily dose is 480 mcg budesonide and 40 mcg salmeterol.

It should be noted that the data submitted in the application dossier referred to Labazenit 150 μg/25 µg and 300 µg/25 µg as the finished medicinal product, which corresponds to the metered dose of both active  substances.  This  was  the  basis  used  during  the  assessment  of  this  application.  However  in accordance with the 'Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and QRD Recommendations on the expression of strength in the name of Centrally Authorised Human Medicinal Products' (as stated in Section 1 of the SmPC and in the name section of the Labelling and Package Leaflet),  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  strength  should  refer  to  the  delivered  dose  of  both  active substances and therefore the name of the medicinal product finally approved by the Committee was expressed as follows: Labazenit 240 μg/20 µg and 120 µg/20 µg, in all official approved documents (CHMP opinion/future EC decision and CHMP opinion). Since 300 μg/25 µg and 150 µg/25 µg (metered dose)  were  the  strengths  referred  to  throughout  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  this medicinal  product  and  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  this  has  been  left  unchanged  in  the sections of this assessment report relating to the non-clinical and clinical development.

## The proposed indication is:

Labazenit is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults where use of a combination product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist) is appropriate:

- Patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonists.

or

- Patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists.

The  proposed  posology  for  Labazenit  is  one  inhalation  (120  micrograms/20  micrograms  or  240 micrograms /20 micrograms) twice daily.

The  inhaler device used  is  called  MIAT  Monodose  Inhaler  or  Axahaler.  Development  studies demonstrated that the Monodose inhaler (Axahaler) has a lower airflow resistance than the devices of the comparator products (i.e. Diskus and Turbohaler), which results in inhalation with a higher airflow than  these  comparator  products.  This  leads  to  the  use  of  lower  doses  of  salmeterol  xinafoate  and budesonide in the currently proposed fixed dose combination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Labazenit is a fixed-combination product. The drug product is a powder for inhalation in hard capsules, containing budesonide and salmeterol xinafoate. Two strengths are proposed: budesonide 150 µg and salmeterol  (as  xinafoate)  25  µg  and  budesonide  300  µg  and  salmeterol  (as  xinafoate)  25  µg.  The capsule contents equate to delivered doses of budesonide 120 µg and salmeterol (as xinafoate) 20 µg and budesonide 240 µg and salmeterol (as xinafoate) 20 µg. The capsules are presented in an HDPE bottle  closed  with  a  polypropylene  screw  cap  which  contains  desiccant.  A  single-dose  'axahaler' inhalation device made from plastic materials is provided in each pack.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

## Active Substance

The drug product contains two well-known active substances, salmeterol xinafoate (a long-acting β2agonist),  and  budesonide (a  corticosteroid  anti-inflammatory),  which  are  described in  Ph.  Eur.  Valid certificates  of  suitability  to  the  Ph.  Eur.  monographs  (CEP)  have  been  submitted  as  part  of  this application for both active substances by their manufacturers. The information provided regarding the manufacturing processes and the control of the active substances was assessed and approved by the European  Directorate  for  the  Quality  of  Medicines.  Satisfactory  quality  of  the  active  substance  is ensured  through  the  CEPs.  Budesonide  is  supplied  by  2  manufacturers  and  Salmeterol  Xinafoate  is manufactured by 2 manufacturers.

## Budesonide

Budesonide is a corticosteroid designated chemically as ( R , S )-11β,16 α ,17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4 diene-3,20-dione  cyclic  16,17  acetal  with  butyraldehyde.  The  active  ingredient  budesonide  has  nine chiral  centres.  It  is  a  mixture  of  the  two  diastereoisomers  with S and R configurations  at  C*. Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odourless, crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water and in heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform.

## The chemical structure of budesonide is:

<!-- image -->

The  manufacturer  of  the  finished  product  applies  a  single  composite  specification  to  all  sources  of budesonide. The specification includes all of the controls specified in the monograph for Budesonide performed  using  the  pharmacopoeial  test  methods,  as  well  as  additional  specifications  for  residual solvents and particle size indicated in the CEP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The release specifications  include tests  for  appearance  (Ph.  Eur.),  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), epimer A (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC) and Particle size (laser diffraction).

The  GC  methods  used  for  quantification  of  methanol  are  described  in  the  respective  CEPs  and  no validation data is presented since it was already assessed by EDQM. The laser diffraction method used by the DP manufacturer has been adequately described and validated.

Batch  analytical  data  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  drug  substance  specification  have  been provided for three batches from each supplier.

The first manufacturer submitted data for three production scale batches stored for 24 months under long term (25 °C / 60% RH) and 9 batches stored for 6 months under accelerated (40 °C / 75 %RH) conditions as per ICH guidelines. Results on 6 further production scale batches stored for 60 months at long-term conditions and tested for compliance with an older specification for related substance were provided as supporting evidence. All the batches were stored in the proposed commercial packaging. The parameters tested were appearance, identification, assay, loss on drying, epimer A, specified and other impurities, and total impurities.

The  second  manufacturer  provided  stability  results  on  9  production  scale  batches  and  2  pilot  scale batches for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH) as per ICH guidelines. No data was provided for batches stored under accelerated conditions, but the results generated under long-term storage conditions indicate that the drug substance is chemically stable. All the batches were stored  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging.  The  parameters  tested  were  identity,  assay,  loss  on drying, purity, epimer A, total related substances and single unknown impurities.

No evidence was presented on stability of the particle size distribution (PSD) of budesonide during the stability  studies,  but  this  is  a  key  measure  since  PSD  is  a  critical  quality  attribute  for  inhaled  dry powder  drugs.  Consequently,  the  particle  size  distribution  is  re-tested  before  use  in  drug  product manufacture.

The stability results are within the specifications and justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

## Salmeterol xinafoate

Salmeterol xinafoate is a 1:1 salt of 1-hydroxy-2-naphtoic acid and salmeterol. Salmeterol is chiral, having  a  single  stereocentre,  and  is  prepared  as  the  racemate.  36.3 µ g  of  salmeterol  xinafoate  is equivalent to 25 µ g of salmeterol free base. Salmeterol xinafoate is a white or almost white crystalline powder, which is slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform and isopropanol and sparingly soluble in water. Two  polymorphs  of  salmeterol  xinafoate  are  described  in  the  literature.  All  the  proposed  suppliers synthesise the polymorph I which is the most thermodynamically stable form at room temperature.

The chemical structure of salmeterol xinafoate is:

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The manufacturer of the finished product applies a single composite specification to all sources. The specification includes all of the controls specified in the monograph for Salmeterol Xinafoate performed using the pharmacopoeial test methods, as well as the additional specifications for residual solvents, particle size, and related substances indicated in the CEP.

The release specifications  include tests  for  appearance  (Ph.  Eur.),  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (Ph.  Eur.  and  HPLC  method  of  Ph.Eur  monograph  1765),  water  (Ph. Eur.),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (Ph.  Eur.),  residual  solvents  (GC)  and  particle  size  (laser diffraction).

The GC methods used are described in the respective CEPs and no validation data is presented since it was already assessed by EDQM. The laser diffraction method used by the DP manufacturer has been adequately described and validated.

Batch  analytical  data  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  drug  substance  specification  have  been provided for three batches from each supplier.

The first manufacturer submitted data for 3 pilot scale batches stored for 60 months at long term (30 °C / 60% RH) and 6 months at accelerated (40 °C / 75% RH) conditions. All the batches were stored in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging.  The  parameters  tested  included  appearance,  identity,  water content, appearance of solution, assay, and related substances. The applicant has adopted the re-test period indicated in the CEP for the second manufacturer.

No evidence was presented on stability of the particle size distribution (PSD) of salmeterol xinafoate during the stability studies, but this is a key measure since PSD is a critical quality attribute for inhaled dry powder drugs. Consequently, the particle size distribution is re-tested before use in drug product manufacture.

The  stability  results  are  within  the  specifications  and  justify  the  proposed  re-test  period  in  the proposed container.

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The  objective  was  to  develop  a  dry  powder  for  inhalation  containing  a  fixed  dose  combination  of salmeterol xinafoate, a long acting β2-agonist bronchodilator, and budesonide, a corticosteroid antiinflammatory, to treat the symptoms of asthma. The dry powder was developed to be used in a Miat Monodose  Inhaler,  also  known  as  Axahaler.  The  complete  product  was  designed  to  be  compact, portable, easy to use and accurate. Whilst budesonide and salmeterol xinafoate are both established treatments for asthma and have been dosed to single patients separately, a product with both active substances combined has never been developed, and Labazenit is designed to fill this gap and thereby improve  patient  compliance  by  reducing  the  amount  of  individual  medicines  needed  to  adequately control the disease.

The choice of the final strength was guided by the FPD determined for the proposed combinations and for the reference products containing the same active ingredients. Reference products available during early development of the proposed formulations were Pulmicort Turbohaler for budesonide (200 µ g) and  Serevent  Discus  (50 µ g)  for  salmeterol.  The  goal  was  to  reach  similar in  vitro lung  deposition characteristics for labazenit as for the reference products. Due to the addition of lactose monohydrate to the excipient blend, lower capsule content of active substance is required to achieve comparable fine particle dose to the comparator products (salmeterol: 25 µg vs. 50 µg in Serevent and budesonide:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

150 µg vs. 200 µg in Pulmicort). All clinical batches have the commercial composition and have been manufactured at the commercial site. The only differences compared to the commercial process are the batch size and, for some batches, the equipment used for mixing of the blend. However, for all batches blend homogeneity, dose uniformity, and fine particle dose was demonstrated. The applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that the batches used in the clinical study and the batches manufactured in  accordance  with  the  proposed  commercial  process  will  behave  similarly  and  have  comparable pulmonary deposition patterns.

All  of  the  chosen  excipients  are  compendial  and  widely  used  in  the  production  of  dry  powder formulations  inhalation.  The  excipients  include:  anhydrous  lactose  (carrier,  Ph.  Eur.),  micronised lactose  monohydrate  (carrier,  Ph.  Eur.),  and  hypermellose  (capsule  material,  Ph.  Eur.).  Details  of minor  components  of  the  capsule,  carrageenan  (gelling  agent,  USP),  potassium  chloride  (gelling promoter, Ph. Eur.) and black ink (in-house spec., all components Ph. Eur.), are provided but will not appear in the SmPC as they are not ingested.

The  drug  product  contains  two  different  types  of  lactose  i.e.  lactose  monohydrate  and  anhydrous lactose.  Lactose  was  chosen  as  the  carrier  because  of  its  widespread  use  in  dry  powder  inhalers. Anhydrous lactose is the major excipient component as the lower moisture content is more compatible with the active substances. Micronised lactose monohydrate was demonstrated to reduce the amount of active substance bound irreversibly to non-inhalable particles of anhydrous lactose and thus improve bioavailability.  The  ratio  of  excipients,  their  particle  size  specifications,  and  their  relevance  to  the formulation have been justified. Hard capsules composed of hypromellose were selected because they have  lower  water  content  than  hard  gelatine  capsules,  and  thus  proved  superior  in  terms  of  fine particle dose (FPD) delivered. Furthermore, they are vegetable origin and thus TSE safe.

The inhalation device is CE marked as a Class I Medical Device under 93/42/EEC the Medical Device Directive  and  applicable  amendments  and  well-known.  It  has  low  airflow  resistance  which  makes  it suitable  for  patients  with  a  low  peak  inspiratory  flow.  It  has  been  confirmed  that  no  changes  were implemented  in  the  design  and/or  manufacturing  process  of  the  delivery  device  since  the  early development of the proposed formulations. The overall product is compact, portable, easy to use, and provides accurate doses. The powder for inhalation is stored in hard capsules. On insertion into the inhaler, the capsules are mechanically pierced. On inhalation, the powder is extracted from the capsule and passes through the mouthpiece and into the patient's lungs.

The applicant has adequately described all aspects applicable to inhalation powders that are mentioned in the Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products. The performance of the drug product with the inhalation device was performed by testing with Multistage Liquid Impinger (MLI) and Next Generation Impactor (NGI). Characterisation has been done on the clinical batches with the  MLI  and  control  specifications  have  been  set  based  on  these  characterisations.  The  relationship between particle size and the stages of the MLI and the calculation of the FPD has been accurately determined.

The  powder  blend  contains  low  percentage  of  salmeterol  xinafoate.  The  mixing  process  and  the homogeneity  of  the  blend  are  therefore  the  critical  issues  of  the  process.  Four  slightly  different processes have been used during development based on the use of different mixing equipment with different mixing speeds and time. Homogeneity of the blend was always easily achieved and FPD/UDD results were also independent of the process applied, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed formulations. The less time consuming process was therefore chosen.

The  capsules  will  be  packaged  in  HDPE  containers  with  LDPP  caps.  As  the  product  is  sensitive  to environmental moisture, a desiccant capsule containing 2 g of silica gel is included in the container.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adventitious agents

Lactose is the only excipient from ruminant origin contained or used in the manufacture of the drug products. Suitable declarations from the suppliers on the TSE safety of lactose have been provided.

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products

## Manufacture of the product

The  manufacturing  process  is  equivalent  for  the  two  strengths  and  consists  of  two  blending  steps followed by encapsulation and primary and secondary packaging. There is one intermediate isolated during the manufacturing process: the filled, but unpacked capsules. The manufacturing process and equipment are adequately described. Adequate in-process controls have been set.

The method of manufacture of Labazenit is considered to be 'non-standard', as defined in the CHMP guideline on non-standard processes (CPMP/QWP/2054/03), not only because it involves a specialised dose form (dry powder inhaler), but also because both of the drug substances represent less than 2% by weight of the capsule contents. The process has been demonstrated to be capable of manufacturing the finished product of the intended quality on several pilot scale and two commercial scale batches. Furthermore,  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  significant  experience  (more  than  200  commercial batches)  in  the  manufacture  of  DPI  products  requiring  dry  blending  of  lactose  with  small  (12  mg) amounts  of  active  substance.  In  view  of  the  batch  analysis  data  provided  and  the  extensive manufacturing experience of the manufacturer with DPI products, it was considered acceptable that a full validation scheme had not been finalised prior to the CHMP Opinion. The applicant will still need to have finalised  the  validiation  scheme  prior  to  marketing the  product in  accordance  with  the  current GMP requirements.

## Product Specification

The  specifications  for  release  and  shelf-life  include  tests  for:  appearance  (visual  description),  water content  (Ph.  Eur.),  inhalation  device  identification  (visual  test)  and  microbiological  purity  (Ph.  Eur); and  for  both  active  substances  for  uniformity  and  average  of  delivered  dose  (Ph.  Eur.,  HPLC), identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  fine  particle  dose  (Ph.  Eur.,  HPLC).  Related  substances  are specified and controlled for budesonide (HPLC) and salmeterol (uHPLC). The drug product specification includes a requirement for not more than (NMT) 1% of any specified impurity related to salmeterol. However, the specification lacks information on which individual impurities are covered by the phrase 'any specified' and this information needs to be added to the drug product specification.

Other than this minor outstanding issue, control of the drug product is satisfactory. The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. and ICH guidelines. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. The drug product specification is acceptable and the specification limits are supported by batch data and stability results.

Batch analyses data of seven pilot and two full scale batches of the drug product, confirm compliance with the proposed drug product specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability of the product

For both strengths, stability data from three pilot scale batches, stored in the proposed commercial packaging (HDPE bottle) stored under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 36 months, under  intermediate  conditions  (30  ºC  /  75%  RH)  for  up  to  30  months,  and  under  accelerated conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  for  up  to  3  months  according  to  ICH  guidelines  were  provided. Additionally,  stability  data  from  three  further  pilot  scale  batches  stored  in  aluminium  blisters  under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 30 months, under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 12 months, and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months according to ICH guidelines were provided.  Samples were tested for appearance, average mass, water content, average and uniform delivered dose (UDD), fine particle dose (FPD), assay of budesonide and salmeterol,  related  substances  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol  and  microbial  contamination.  The analytical procedures used were stability indicating. The only trend observed is a significant decrease in  assay  of  salmeterol  under  accelerated  storage  conditions  (20-30%),  and  a  slight  decrease  under intermediate and long-term stability studies. Temperature rather than humidity was shown to be the main  factor  in  degradation  rate.  The  drug  product  was  demonstrated  to  be  more  stable  in  the commercial HDPE bottle rather than the aluminium blisters.

Two stability studies on commercial scale batches are on-going and will be assessed throughout the proposed  shelf-life  under  long  term  storage  conditions.  A  long  term  stability  study  on  a  third commercial batch will be carried out post-approval.

No  photostability  studies  were  carried  out  but  this  is  acceptable  since  the  proposed  commercial packaging minimises light transmission in compliance with the USP guidelines on light transmission.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life (24 months) and storage conditions (&lt;30 o C) are  acceptable.  However,  the  discrepancy  between  storage  temperature  proposed  in  SmPC  (&lt;30 o C) and that proposed in the answers to day 180 list of outstanding issues (&lt;25 o C) needs to be addressed.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  two  minor  unresolved  quality  issue  having  no  impact  on  the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product remained.

## Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory manner. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

The  CHMP  has  identified the following measures  necessary  to  address  the  identified quality developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The drug product specification includes a requirement for not more than (NMT) 1% of any specified impurity  related  to  salmeterol.  However,  the  specification  lacks  information  on  which  individual impurities are covered by the phrase 'any specified' and this information needs to be added to the drug product specification.

The discrepancy between storage temperature proposed in SmPC (&lt;30 o C) and that proposed in the answers to day 180 list of outstanding issues (&lt;25 o C) needs to be reconciled.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Salmeterol and budesonide are considered well known active substances indicated for the treatment of asthma,  with  an  established  non-clinical  and  clinical  safety  profile.  The  Applicant  performed  an extensive review of published non-clinical data available on salmeterol and on budesonide, therefore no  new  original  data  was  submitted.  In  the  light  of  the  longstanding  clinical  use  of  salmeterol  and budesonide, this was considered to be acceptable by the CHMP. Non-clinical studies conducted with the combination of salmeterol and budesonide were limited to repeat-dose toxicity studies in line with the Guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinations of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Pivotal studies regarding the combination of salmeterol and budesonide were performed in compliance with GLP.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol  is  an  inhaled  long-acting  β2-adrenergic  agonist.  β2-Adrenergic  agonists  produce  their effects through interaction with specific β2-adrenergic receptors present in high concentration in lung tissue.  The  receptors  consist  of  a  protein  that  traverses  cell  membrane  seven  times,  forming  three extracellular and three intracellular loops. The receptor is linked to a stimulatory guanine-nucleotide -binding  protein  (GS).  Occupancy  of  the  β2-adrenergic  receptor  changes  the  conformation  of  GS, leading  to  activation  of  adenylate  cyclase,  which  in  turn  catalyzes  the  conversion  of  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Protein kinase A is activated by the cAMP. Activated protein kinase A inhibits phosphorylation of key muscle proteins involved in the control of smooth muscle tone; cAMP also results in inhibition of calcium ion release from intracellular stores. Together, these events lead to a general relaxing effect of the airway smooth muscle. In rat left atria and guinea pig gastric fundus preparations, salmeterol was also shown to be a weak partial agonist of β1 and β3-adrenergic receptors. β-receptors are located in virtually every tissue of the organism. β1receptors increase cardiac output, renin secretion and lipolysis. β2-receptors produce smooth muscle relaxation,  dilation  of  coronary  arteries  and  increase  striated  muscle  contraction.  In  addition  β2receptors inhibit the release of histamine. β3-adrenoreceptors are also described in the heart tissue, they  are  activated  at  high  catecholamine  concentrations,  producing  a  negative  inotropic  effect  that antagonizes β1-and β2-adrenoreceptor activity. Putative β4 adrenoreceptor has also been described. However, β4-adrenoreceptors have been characterized as a different state of the β1-adrenoreceptor protein. The prolonged action of salmeterol is thought to be mediated by the extended side chain of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

salmeterol which allows prolonged activation of the receptor for 12 hours or more. The ' tail ' binds into  the  β  receptor  at  an  exosite,  preventing  the  molecule  from  dissociating  from  the  receptor. Meanwhile, the ' head ' binds  to  and  activates  the  β2  receptor.  The  head  continually  attaches  and detaches from the receptor site. This repeating attachment process prolongs the drug's action.

## Budesonide

Budesonide is an inhaled glucocorticosteroid. The anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids are manifested by repression of inflammatory genes expression, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory molecules and many others. Budesonide possesses a good degree of topical potency (local anti-inflammatory activity) compared to systemic effects. Corticosteroids are the most potent  antiinflammatory  agents  currently  used  to  treat  asthma.  Glucocorticoid  receptors  are  widely distributed in the airways and are expressed on inflammatory and structural cells. The target receptor for  corticosteroids  is  the  intracellular  glucocorticoid  receptor  (GR).  Under  resting  conditions,  the inactive  GR  is  largely  located  in  the  cytosol,  associated  with  multiple  chaperon  proteins.  The glucocorticoid  molecule  first  penetrates  the  cell  membrane,  then  binds  to  the  GR  through  the glucocorticoid-binding domain.  This induces a conformational change  in the receptor protein, dissociation of the chaperone proteins, and the formation of an active glucocorticoid -GR complex. The complex may then form a dimer and translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to specific DNA sequences (glucocorticoid response elements) in the promoter region of target genes,  leading  to  cofactor  activation  and  either  an  increase  or  decrease  in  gene  transcription.  This process is termed transactivation. Alternatively, the active glucocorticoid -GR complex, as a monomer, can interact directly with intracellular transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) or nuclear factor  (NF)-B,  through  a  protein -protein  interaction,  to  attenuate  the  proinflammatory  processes mediated by those transcription factors. This process, termed transrepression, involves recruitment of histone  deacetylases  and  modulation  of  chromatin  structure.  The  altered  transcription  of  many different genes is involved in the anti-asthma effect of glucocorticoids, but the most important action may be to inhibit transcription of the genes for the cytokines implicated in asthmatic inflammation.

Glucocorticoids may have direct inhibitory effects on many of the cells involved in airway inflammation in asthma, including macrophages, T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, and airway epithelial cells. They may not  inhibit  the  release  of  mediators  of  allergic  reactions  from  mast  cells,  but  they  do  reduce  the number of mast cells within the airway. In addition to their suppressive effects on inflammatory cells, glucocorticoids may also inhibit plasma exudation and mucus secretion in inflamed airways. Inhaled glucocorticoids have local anti-inflammatory effects on the bronchial mucosa in patients with asthma. Furthermore,  glucocorticoids  reverse  the  shedding  of  epithelial  cells  and  the  goblet-cell  hyperplasia characteristically seen in biopsy specimens of bronchial epithelium from patients with asthma.

Budesonide has stronger local and systemic anti-inflammatory properties compared to other molecules of  the  same  pharmaceutical  class  such  as  bethamethasone  17-valerate,  fluosinolone  acetonide, hydrocortisone 17-butyrate or hydrocortisone 21-acetate. Results of experiments in rats indicate that budesonide  has  strong  antiinflammatory  properties  with  fewer  systemic  side  effects  than  other glucocorticoids.  This  is  probably  explained  by  the  important  first  pass  hepatic  metabolism  observed after oral administration.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol  possesses  anti-inflammatory  properties  in  both  laboratory  animals  and  human  that  are beneficial in the improvement of airway functions. Its immunomodulatory action probably depends on long-lasting inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from lung mast cells, impairment of plasma protein extravasation and inhibition of eosinophils accumulation in lung tissue. These antiinflammatory properties of salmeterol are explained by the presence of low number of ß2-receptors on inflammatory  cells involved in asthma,  including  eosinophils,  neutrophils,  T  lymphocytes,  and macrophages.  Inhaled  ß2-agonists  inhibit  the  release  of  histamine  and  cysteinyl-leukotrienes  from chopped human lung and purified human lung mast cells. They have a greater protective effect against adenosine-induced  bronchoconstriction,  which  is  mediated  by  mast  cell  degranulation,  than  against histamine-  and  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction,  which  are  direct  constrictor  effects  of airway smooth muscle. This indicates the additional inhibitory effect of inhaled ß2-agonists on mast cells.  This  may  be  important  in  the  use  of  ß2-agonists  in  preventing  allergen-  and  exercise-induced asthma as well as in severe asthma and acute exacerbations, all of which involve mast cell activation. ß2-Agonists also inhibit the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerves, thus reducing cholinergic neural  (reflex)  bronchoconstriction.  Exudation  of  plasma  from  postcapillary  venules  is  an  important component of acute inflammation. ß2-Receptors are present on postcapillary venular endothelial cells, and ß2-agonists inhibit plasma exudation by preventing separation of endothelial cells in postcapillary venules. In addition, ß-Agonists have multiple effects on airway epithelial cells, including stimulating ciliary beat  frequency  and  stimulation  of  chloride  secretion  toward  the  airway  lumen,  which theoretically could improve the hydration state of the mucus by increasing the water secretion onto the airway  surface.  Both  of  these  mechanisms  could  contribute  to  the  enhanced  mucociliary  clearance (MCC)  observed  in  vivo  with  ß-adrenergics.  Impaired  airway  MCC  is  a  central  component  of  the pathophysiology of asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis.

## Budesonide

It  is  well  established  now  that  corticosteroids  stimulate  the  transcription  of  ß2-receptors.  This stimulation is done via binding to specific DNA sequences located in the 5'-noncoding promoter region of the ß2-receptor gene. Both systemic corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroids reverse ß2-receptor downregulation  after exposure  to high doses  of short-acting ß2-agonists. Corticosteroids also reportedly modulate the efficiency of coupling between the ß2-receptor and its associated stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding  protein  (GS).  As  a  result,  ß2-receptor-stimulated  adenylate  cyclase activity  and  cAMP  accumulation  increase  after  corticosteroid  treatment.  Animals  that  have  been depleted  of  corticosteroids  by  adrenalectomy,  in  contrast,  lose  the  sensitivity  of  the  ß2-receptorcoupled adenylate cyclase system.

## Safety pharmacology programme

## Salmeterol

The pharmacological side effects of β2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The coexistence of β1- and β2-adrenoceptors in the heart clearly indicates that β2-agonists do have some effect on the heart, such as increase of heart rate, even when they are highly selective. β2agonist  use  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  myocardial  infarction,  congestive  heart failure, cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. Some of the major adverse effects of β-adrenergic agonists in the treatment of asthma are caused by stimulation of β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Accordingly, drugs with preferential affinity for β2-receptors  compared  with  β1-receptors  have  been developed. However, this selectivity is not absolute. In rats, myocardial fibrosis was observed after 7days treatment with β2-agonists salbutamol and terbutaline. This showed a relation with β1-adrenergic receptor occupancy.

β-agonists are also known to decrease plasma potassium levels by stimulation of β2-adrenoreceptors in  the  liver  and  skeletal  muscle.  This  reduction  is  produced  by  an  increase  in  the  transport  of potassium ions into cells through the activation of NA+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase which increases the uptake of potassium. Compared to formoterol (another β2-agonist), salmeterol had a lower impact on plasma potassium concentrations in asthma patients treated with a 100 μg dose.

β2-adrenoceptor  agonists  (β2-agonists)  have  potent  muscle  anabolic  effects.  β-2-receptors  have indeed  been  identified  in  skeletal  muscle  and  β-agonists  may  bond  directly  to  skeletal  muscle membrane  and  activate  a  sequence  of  events  leading  to  protein  accretion.  β-agonists  may  also activate non-muscle β-receptors leading to the production of hormones or other factors. Those may in turn act on the muscle or create an environment conductive to the stimulation of protein accretion.

## Budesonide

Budesonide had no effect on the spontaneous motor activity of mice at doses up to 10.0 mg/kg. There was  no  effect  on  the  normal  body  temperature  of  mice  or  rabbits  and  no  muscle-relaxing  effect, anesthesia-potentiating effect, or analgesic effect in mice in doses up to 10.0 mg/kg. 10.0 mg/kg of budesonide  potentiated  maximal  electroshock  induced  convulsions  in  mice,  but  had  no  effect  on pentetrazol-induced convulsions. There were no evident changes in the spinal reflexes or EEG of cats. No obvious changes could be found in the respiration, circulatory system, or behavior of unanesthetized  beagle  dogs.  There  was  also  no  effect  on  the  blood  pressure  response  induced  by adrenalin or acetylcholine in anesthetized cats at doses up to 10.0 mg/kg. Doses up to 10 mg/kg had no effect on the blood coagulation system of rats or the bleeding time of mice. As for the effects on renal function in rats, doses of at least 0.01 mg/kg of budesonide increased K+ excretion and doses of at least 0.03 mg/kg increased urine volume and Na+ and Cl- excretion. In human, systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. These effects  are  much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract  and  glaucoma.  The  effect  is  probably  dependent  on  dose,  exposure  time,  concomitant  and previous  steroid  exposure,  and  individual  sensitivity.  As  with  other  inhalation  therapy,  paradoxical bronchospasm may occur in very rare  cases.  The  major  local  side  effects  of  inhaled  corticosteroids include  oral  candidiasis,  hoarseness  and  disphonia. Facial  skin  irritation  has  occurred  in  some  cases when  a  nebulizer  with  a  face  mask  has  been  used.  To  prevent  irritation,  the  facial  skin  should  be washed with  water  after  use  of  the  face  mask.  Glucocorticoid  receptors  are  very  widely  distributed outside the lungs, so systemic side effects on bone, growth, skin, skeletal muscles, and blood vessels are  common;  this  provides  the  rationale  for  the  use  of  inhaled  corticosteroids  to  reduce  systemic exposure.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Βeta-adrenergic blockers can weaken or inhibit the effect of salmeterol. Labazenit should therefore not be given together with β-adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons for their use. The relaxing actions observed in guinea-pig trachea or human bronchus are rapidly and fully reversed by the β-adrenoceptor blocking drug, propranolol (0.1 microM). Another β-adrenoceptor blocking drug, sotalol (10 microM), also fully and rapidly reverses established sub-maximal responses to salmeterol in superfused guinea-pig trachea. However, after administration of sotalol was stopped, the  antagonism  waned,  and  salmeterol  responses  were  reasserted  without  the  addition  of  further agonist. Concomitant treatment with quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, phenothiazines, antihistamines (terfenadine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic anti-depressants can prolong the  QTc-interval  and  increase  the  risk  of  ventricular  arrhythmias.  In  addition  L-Dopa,  L-thyroxine, oxytocin and alcohol can impair cardiac tolerance towards β2-sympathomimetics.

Concomitant  treatment  with  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors,  including  agents  with  similar  properties such as furazolidone and procarbazine, may precipitate hypertensive reactions. There is an elevated risk  of  arrhythmias  in  patients  receiving  concomitant  anaesthesia  with  halogenated  hydrocarbons. Concomitant use of other β-adrenergic drugs can have a potentially additive effect. Hypokalaemia may increase the disposition towards arrhythmias in patients who are treated with digitalis glycosides.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination salmeterol/budesonide  based  on  the  data  available  for  each  compound  which  was  considered acceptable.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

## Methods of analysis

## Salmeterol

The  LC/MS  assay  for  the  quantification  of  salmeterol  has  been  validated  adequately  in  horse  urine. Acceptable  linearity,  precision  and  specificity  of  salmeterol  were  observed.  The  limit  of  quantitative detection was 0.25 ng/mL and the limit of detection was 0.125 ng/mL.

Another  method  describes  the  determination  of  the  1-hydroxy-2-naphtoic  acid  (HNA)  a  salt  of salmeterol  in  human  plasma.  This  semi-automated  procedure  with  solid-phase  extraction  using  an automated analytical  sample  processor  (AASP)  and  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The method was sensitive to 10 ng/ml. The method is specific for HNA with  respect  to  endogenous  plasma  components  and  has  been  shown  to  be  robust,  accurate  and precise.

A sensitive, accurate, and precise high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of salmeterol in rat and dog plasma was reported by Colthup Ph. V. et al. Samples were prepared  by  solid-phase  extraction  and,  after  chromatography  of  the  extracts  on  a  reversed-phase styrene/divinylbenzene analytical column, salmeterol was  detected by fluorescence monitoring (excitation wavelength, 230 nm; emission wavelength, 305 nm).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Budesonide

The HPLC combined with tritiated drug assay for the quantification of budesonide has been validated adequately  in  beagle  dog  plasma.  Acceptable  linearity,  precision  and  specificity  of  budesonide  were observed. To study the pulmonary disposition of 3H-budesonide in rat lungs, the a liquid chromatograph assay has been used.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

A  validated  HPLC  assay  to  determine  parameters  in  the  toxicokinetic  part  of  the  repeated  dose toxicology studies conducted in rats and dogs using various dosages of budesonide and salmeterol as monotherapies or in combination was developed. This validated method is similar to the one used to quantify  plasma  concentrations  in  human  pharmacokinetic  studies.  In  dog  plasma,  the  method  was found to be linear over the calibration range ~15 to 1000 pg/mL for salmeterol, ~40 to 2750 pg/mL for budesonide epimer A and ~50 to 3270 pg/mL for budesonide epimer B. Accuracy and precision were within 15% for all compounds, and recovery was &gt;85.

## Absorption

The route of administration of salmeterol and budesonide is via inhalation. However, it is recognised that much of an inhaled dose is eventually swallowed and can be absorbed into the systemic circulation from  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  For  this  reason,  the  disposition  of  salmeterol  and  budesonide  in laboratory animals and human is reported after oral administration. In addition, pharmacokinetic data after IV administration in rats and dogs is available.

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol is  rapidly  absorbed  following  oral  administration  to  both  laboratory  animals  and  humans with peak concentrations of drug in plasma achieved within 2 hours in all species. The Cmax-values are similar for mice, rats and rabbits when normalised for dose level. In dogs, however, dose-normalised Cmax-values  are  much  higher,  reflecting  greater  systemic  absorption  in  this  species.  The  dosenormalised  peak  concentrations  of  salmeterol  in  human  plasma  are  higher  than  those  observed  in rodents/lagomorphs, being more closely related to dogs.

## Budesonide

The  systemic  absorption  of  budesonide  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  is  relatively  poor  with  oral bioavailability ranging form 2% or less in monkeys, 9-20% in dogs and 30-35% in rats and mice. In dogs, the systemic availability of budesonide following oral administration ranges form 9.2 to 16.2% at 10 μg/kg and from 18.3 to 18.8% at 100 μg/kg. In humans, the systemic availability is ~11% which points to an extensive first pass metabolism in the liver.

In dogs administered oral doses of 10 and 100 μg/kg, the maximal plasma concentrations are achieved within one hour indicating a fast absorption.

Budesonide  has  relatively  high  water  solubility  and  is  readily  dissolved  in  mucosal  fluids.  As  a consequence,  budesonide  is  rapidly  absorbed  into  airway  tissues.  Importantly,  the  absorption  of budesonide into airway tissue does not appear to be affected by lung function, with comparable plasma concentrations  achieved  following  pulmonary  delivery  in  healthy  and  asthmatic  individuals.  Once absorbed  intracellularly,  budesonide  undergoes  reversible  conjugation  with  intracellular  fatty  acids, which prolongs its retention within the airways and its duration of action.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After  intratracheal  administration  of  a  clinically  relevant  dose  of 3 H-budesonide via infusion into the pulmonary circulation using isolated perfused and ventilated rat lungs, a rapid initial absorption was found. About half of the given dose was slowly released into the lung perfusate. The lung uptake of budesonide  from  the  pulmonary  circulation  is  relatively  high,  showing  a  high  lung  affinity  for budesonide.

In  humans,  the  plasma  half-life  was  ~3  hours  after  intravenous  administration  and  ~2  hours  after inhalation. In dogs, plasma t1/2 after oral administration ranged from 1.8 to 3 hours depending on the dose. Elimination in rat, mouse  and  monkey  was  rapid  with  plasma  t1/2  after intravenous administration of 1.1, 1.6 and 3.8 hours, respectively.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

One  14-day  toxicokinetic  inhalation  study  (study  V9015/01)  in  dogs  has  been  provided  by  the Applicant, in which dogs were daily dosed with 10.4 mg/m 3  salmeterol only for 5 minutes, 112 mg/m 3 budesonide only for 5 minutes or a combination of both for different exposure durations (1 minute vs. 5 minutes) leading to a low concentration and a high concentration group. For budesonide, the results showed that for both epimers the time to attain the maximum plasma concentration and Cmax were similar among groups. Exposure values after a single dose were higher in the budesonide-only group but those differences tended to decrease at steady state and the AUC values were closer when taking into account the standard deviation values. The AUC values were not higher in the combination groups versus the budesonide-only group and those values did not show significant accumulation even at high doses.

For salmeterol, the results showed that the Cmax values were similar among the dosing groups after a single dose and at steady state. The Tmax values were also close together (~0.08h), except for the low concentration  combination  group  at  steady  state.  However,  this  value  was  associated  with  a  high variability which hampered a proper interpretation (2.5h±2.9). The AUC values were slightly higher in the single compound group compared to those in the combination group at single dose and at steady state. However, this difference is most probably not significant given the observed standard deviation (between  39  and  92%).  At  steady  state,  the  AUC  value  for  salmeterol  in  the  low  concentration combination group was 3 times greater than that after a single dose. However, the variability was very high for the AUC value at steady state (SD=92%). According to the Applicant, salmeterol seems to be slowly  eliminated  in  the  low  concentration  combination  group,  while  in  the  other  groups  exposures tended to remain constant during the exposure period.

## Distribution

## Salmeterol

The extent of binding of salmeterol to mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human plasma proteins in vitro was ~95%  and was independent of drug concentration. Salmeterol distributed equally between erythrocytes and plasma in all species.

After  oral  administration  of 14 C-salmeterol  xinafoate  in  rats,  radioactive  drug-related  material  was rapidly  absorbed  and  widely  distributed  although  tissue  concentrations  are  significantly  lower  than after  a  corresponding  intravenous  dose.  Autoradiographic  studies  performed  in  the  rat  showed  that within 15 minutes of intravenous administration of 14 C-salmeterol xinafoate, radioactive drug-related material  was  distributed  throughout  the  tissues.  By  30  minutes,  the  highest  concentrations  of radioactive material were found in the kidneys, liver, followed by intestinal content, heart, pituitary, bone  marrow,  lung  and  stomach/small  intestine  wall.  Lower  concentrations  of  radioactivity  were retrieved  in  blood,  whereas  only  trace  amounts  were  detected  in  the  central  nervous  system.  The levels of radioactivity declined beyond 48 hours and became undetectable 168 hours post-dose.

In pregnant rats, the concentrations of radioactive drug-related material were low in mammary tissue, placenta and foetus after oral administration of 14 C-salmeterol xinafoate and comparable to those in maternal blood up to 6 hours post-dose. At 24 hours, radioactivity in the foetus was primarily located in the gastrointestinal tract.

## Budesonide

The plasma protein binding of budesonide is 85% in rabbits, 86% in mice and human, 89% in dogs and 92% in rats. Budesonide is equally distributed between erythrocytes and plasma.

The pulmonary disposition of budesonide was studied in vitro in  rat  lungs. Budesonide was found to have  longer  tissue  retention  compared  to  that  of  other  molecules  also  administered  by  inhalation (formoterol and terbutaline). This experiment showed that the amount of budesonide that penetrates the  air/blood  barrier  is  low;  therefore  the  resulting  concentration  in  plasma  is  low  decreasing  the potential for systemic side effects.

After  intravenous  administration  of  radiolabeled  budesonide  in  mice,  budesonide  was  rapidly  and extensively distributed into tissues. Radioactivity was mainly localized in the liver, kidney, lungs and lymphatic tissues. The radioactivity observed in lung parenchyma was higher than that in the blood. In particular, the bronchi showed a higher content than the rest of the lungs, confirming the high lung affinity  of  budesonide.  Low  levels  of  radioactivity  were  detected  in  the  CNS.  A  high  uptake  of budesonide was also noted in organs and tissues from the reproductive system, such as the epithelium of the head of the epididymis and ductus deferens.

In the pregnant mouse, high amounts of radioactivity were found in the corpora lutea, the placenta and  the  foetal  membranes.  In  the  foetus,  the  distribution  of  radioactivity  is  similar  to  that  of  the mother.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No distribution PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination salmeterol/budesonide which was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the individual compounds.

## Metabolism

## Salmeterol

## In vivo metabolism

Significant differences in the metabolism of salmeterol were evidenced across species  In rat, mouse and  rabbit,  the  predominant  metabolic  route  is  via  glucuronidation  of  the  parent  drug.  Rat  bile contained  one  major  metabolite  and  a  number  of  minor  metabolites.  The  major  metabolite  is  a phenolic glucuronide conjugate of the parent compound. Two minor metabolites excreted predominantly in rat urine have been identified as products of O-dealkylation.

In  dogs,  the  identity  of  the  major  metabolite  proved  refractory  to  chromatographic  and  spectral analysis  due  to  persistent  interference  from  bile  salts.  However,  deconjugation  studies  indicated  a sulphate conjugate of a metabolite that was not observed in any other species. The major metabolite in  dogs  was  eventually  identified  as  the  3-catechol  sulphate  of  the  benzoic  acid  derivative.  This metabolite  was  shown  to  have  very  similar  physicochemical  properties  to  a  major  endogenous component of the bile explaining the difficulty to isolate it.

In  human,  salmeterol  undergoes  extensive  aliphatic  oxidation  to  α-hydroxysalmeterol.  CYP3A  was demonstrated by inhibition experiments with ketoconazole (1 μM caused substantial inhibition) to play a major role in the human metabolism of salmeterol.

## Metabolites in plasma

In all species, the plasma concentrations of total radioactive drug-related material were higher than those  of  salmeterol  at  all  sampling  times,  with  this  difference  being  more  marked  after  oral administration. In addition, the total radioactive drug-related material persisted longer in plasma than unchanged salmeterol indicating the presence of circulating metabolites.

## Budesonide

## In vitro metabolism

The  metabolism  of  budesonide  was  studied  in  livers  from  rat,  mouse  and  man.  The  systemic inactivation  of  budesonide  is  rapid  in  all  species  due  to  extensive  liver  biotransformation.  In  man, about 90% is metabolized primarily mediated by CYP3A4. Incubations of budesonide with human liver microsomes in the presence of ketoconazole, troleandomycin, erythromycin and cyclosporine showed that budesonide metabolism was inhibited in presence of those CYP3A4 inhibitors.

The two budesonide epimers produce different metabolites. Epimer 22R gives 16α-hydroxyprednisolone, while epimer 22S produces a metabolite tentatively identified as 23-hydroxybudesonide. Otherwise, budesonide follows the general metabolic pathways reported for synthetic glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are biotransformed and inactivated via oxidative, reductive and conjugation pathways. In vitro studies performed in rat livers have shown that this transformation is 5 to 6 times faster for budesonide  than  for  triamcinolone  acetonide  used  as  reference  compound.  Oxidative  metabolism predominates, 6β-hydroxybudesonide and Δ-6-budesonide being identified in all investigated species. Reductive  metabolism  giving  4,5-β-dihydrobudesonide  and  3,4,5-  β-ditetrahydrobudesonide  is  most pronounced  in  the  rat.  The  metabolism  in  mouse  and  human  was  similar  being  extensive  and predominantly  oxidative. In  vitro studies  with  human  livers  also  showed  an  extensive  first  pass metabolism, in agreement with minor effects observed on plasma cortisol after oral doses up to 8 mg in  man.  Two  major  metabolites  have  been  isolated:  6β-hydroxybudesonide  and  16α-hydroxyprednisolone. The major metabolic pathway, 16α, 17α-acetal splitting is unique for budesonide within this  group  of  compounds.  This  biotransformation  is  catalyzed  by  microsomal  monooxygenases  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

proceeds  via  hydroxylation  and  subsequent  rearrangement  to  an  intermediary  ester,  which  is  then cleaved by hydrolysis to 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and butyric acid.

In  rat  species,  there  is  a  marked  sex  difference  in  the  biotransformation  rate  of  budesonide.  The disappearance is more rapid in male rat liver. The greater 6β-hydroxylase activity seems to be the major reason for the observed differences. A marginal sex difference was seen in mouse liver.

The biological activities of 6β-hydroxybudesonide and 16α-hydroxy-prednisolone are less than 1% of budesonide.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No metabolism PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination salmeterol/budesonide which was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the individual compounds.

## Excretion

## Salmeterol

After IV administration in rats, levels of radioactivity in blood and most tissues declined after 1 to 2 hours with the exception of the kidney medulla, stomach wall and pituitary gland. By 48 hours, tissue concentration of radioactive drug-related material declined substantially and was eliminated from the body.

It has been demonstrated in humans that 57% of administered radioactivity is recovered in the faeces and  23%  in  the  urine,  with  the  most  recovered  between  24  and  72  hours  after  administration  by inhalation.  Hydroxysalmeterol  is  eliminated  predominantly  in  the  faeces.  Unchanged  salmeterol accounted for &lt;5% of the excreted dose in the urine in all species.

In another study, recoveries of the radiolabeled dose were incomplete in all species (mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, human) studied after oral and intravenous administration. Since this could not be explained by any retention in the body, it was hypothesised that the metabolism of drug-related material occurred through gut microflora with subsequent loss of the 14 C label in gaseous form.

Oral studies in bile duct-cannulated rat and dog indicated that the drug-related material present in the feces is predominantly derived from biliary secretion of metabolites confirming that salmeterol is wellabsorbed  across  the  gastro-intestinal  tract  in  these  species.  There  is  evidence  that  some  of  the metabolites in the rat undergo entero-hepatic circulation. Because the major metabolite in the rat is the glucuronide conjugate of salmeterol, it is likely that the drug is reabsorbed following deconjugation by gut microflora, as only parent drug is detected in the feces. This may contribute to the relatively long half-life in this species.

In  the  lactating  rat,  low  but  persistent  concentrations  of  salmeterol  were  observed  in  milk  up  to  8 hours after oral administration of 14 C-salmeterol xinafoate. Substantially higher peak concentrations of total radioactivity were observed in milk and plasma although the observed time to peak was at 24 hours and 6 hours, respectively, indicating a slow equilibration of predominantly metabolites between milk and plasma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Budesonide

In  rats  and  dogs,  after  oral  or  arterial  administration,  60-85%  of  budesonide  was  excreted  as metabolites in  the  bile  and  eliminated  in  the  feces,  10-30%  appeared  as  metabolites  in  urine.  This indicates an extensive biliary excretion of the compound and/or its metabolites. No apparent difference between the two epimers prevailed. In rabbits after intravenous administration, 46% was eliminated in the urine and 39% in the feces in 72 hours. Urine and bile samples revealed only traces of unchanged budesonide.  After  oral  and  inhalation  administration  in  humans,  budesonide  was  rapidly  eliminated with the majority (70%) recovered in the urine.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No excretion PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination salmeterol/budesonide which was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the individual compounds.

## Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

## Salmeterol

As stated above, CYP3A4 plays a major role in the metabolism of salmeterol. It has been shown that the co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once daily) and salmeterol (50 μg inhaled twice daily) in healthy subjects for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure (1.4-fold Cmax, 15-fold AUC). This may lead to an increase in the incidence of other systemic effects of salmeterol treatment compared with salmeterol or ketoconazole treatment alone. Clinically significant effects  were not seen on blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose and blood potassium levels. Coadministration  with  ketoconazole  did  not  increase  the  elimination  half-life  of  salmeterol  or  increase salmeterol accumulation with repeated dosing. There is likely to be a similar risk of interaction with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Co-administration of erythromycin (500 mg orally three times a day) and salmeterol (50 μg inhaled twice daily) in healthy subjects for 6 days resulted in a small but non-statistically significant increase in salmeterol  exposure  (1.4-fold  Cmax,  1.2-fold  AUC).  Co-administration  with  erythromycin  was  not associated with any serious adverse effects.

## Budesonide

Budesonide administered through inhalation has a high local anti-inflammatory activity and is rapidly and extensively inactivated after absorption. Both characteristics represent a major advantage in terms of  adverse  events  but  also  in  terms  of  potential  pharmacokinetic  interactions.  Furthermore,  as budesonide is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, the concomitant administration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase plasma levels of budesonide.

Substances  known  to  interact  with  CYP2C  (sulfaphenazole,  mephenytoin,  tolbutamide)  and  with CYP2D6 (bufuralol, quinidine) do not specifically inhibit the metabolism of budesonide.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

Since both products are administered via the inhalation route, the systemic doses are expected to be very  low.  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  that  any  clinically  relevant  interactions  will  be  observed  as  a consequence of the co-administration with pharmaceutical agents that are metabolised by CYP3A4, as indicated in SmPC of other registered combinations of glucocorticosteroid and β2-agonist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetic potential interactions between budesonide and salmeterol have been studied in humans in the pharmacokinetic study BUSAL-SD101. This study showed that when both compounds were  administered  in  combination  by  the  inhalation  route,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  each component  was  similar  to  that  observed  when  the  drugs  were  administered  separately  thereby demonstrating the absence of pharmacokinetic interactions between budesonide and salmeterol.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

The toxicity of both budesonide and salmeterol has been evaluated in various animal species and their toxicity profile is well known. Three new repeated dose studies were conducted with the combination of salmeterol and budesonide: a 28-day study in rats and a 14-day and a 3-month studies in dogs. Nonclinical  data  available  from  the  literature  has  been  provided  for  both  salmeterol  and  budesonide  as monocompound.  This  is  in  line with the Guideline on  the non-clinical development  of  fixed combinations of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).

## Single dose toxicity

## Salmeterol

Acute toxicity studies conducted in mice, juvenile and adult rats and dogs showed salmeterol to be a relatively non-toxic molecule.

In mice, 150 mg/kg per os produced decrease body weight gain and hypothermia.

In juvenile rats, 300 mg/kg p.o. produced a decrease in body weight gain. By the intra-peritoneal (ip) route, doses equal to and above 23 mg/kg caused peritonitis probably due to local irritation and 90 mg/kg was lethal. In adult rats, 600 mg/kg per os caused anal staining, ptosis, watery eyes, rough coat and discolored feces. 1000 mg/kg per os produced heavy rapid breathing, lethargy, ptosis, watery eyes  and  decreased  weight  gain.  By  the  ip  route  doses  of  75  mg/kg  onwards  caused  writhing  (a response to pain) and peritonitis. By the inhalation route, rats at 2.9 mg/kg showed a slight increase in absolute and relative liver weight.

In dogs, 0.7 mg/kg induced tachycardia, vasodilatation, trembling and mild lung inflammation (route of administration not mentioned, but presumably by inhalation). Kidneys also manifested inflammatory lesions.

## Budesonide

The acute toxicity of budesonide was investigated using mice, rats, and dogs.

Intravenous administration of budesonide to mice and rats suppressed spontaneous motor activity and led  to  prone  posture  after  administration.  Many  of  the  animals  that  died  did  so  within  24  hours. Intraperitoneal administration produced  temporary  writhing in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. Intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and oral administration all induced emaciation. Many of the animals  that  died  did  so  2  weeks  after  administration.  The  LD50  values  in  mice  and  rats  were approximately 100 mg/kg in intravenous administration, 150-300 mg/kg in intraperitoneal administration,  50-100  mg/kg  in  subcutaneous  administration,  and  more  than  3200  mg/kg  in  oral administration.

The  LD50  value  of  subcutaneous  administration  in  dogs  was  173  mg/kg.  No  particular  differences between species or genders were seen by any administration route.

Histopathologic studies of animals of all species that died and those that survived revealed atrophy of the adrenal cortex, atrophy of the lymphatic system tissue, and ulceration of the digestive tract.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No single dose toxicity studies were performed on the fixed dose combination salmeterol/budesonide which was considered acceptable based on the data available for each compound.

## Repeat dose toxicity

## Salmeterol

The  toxicity  profile  of  salmeterol  includes  mainly  tachycardia,  vasodilatation,  increased  muscle development  and  hypokaliema.  There  may  be  signs  of  irritation  of  the  respiratory  tract  when salmeterol is administered at high doses by inhalation and it seems that salmeterol is more toxic in young animals compared to adults.

In  a  90-day  study  conducted  in  mice per  os ,  there  was  a  hypertrophy  of  the  uterus  at  1.4  and  10 mg/kg.

In a 2-week oral study in rats, 2 mg/kg produced no significant toxic effects. In a 39-day p.o. study in 3-day rats, doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o. were lethal. Deaths occurred in the high dose groups within the first 10 days. The survivors showed increased body weight gain and acceleration in the rate of eye opening. Juvenile rats seem more sensitive than adults. In a 13-week inhalation/p.o. study in rats at doses  up  to  0.7  mg/kg  by  inhalation  and  2.0  mg/kg  p.o.,  no  significant  toxicity  was  seen. Hypoglycemia,  slight  increases  in  cardiac  weight  and  increases  in  serum  enzymes  were  observed although no histopathology was noted. Extending a similar study to 26-weeks, the observed changes were similar to those seen in the 13-week study. In a 78-week study in rats; doses of 0.06, 0.18 and 0.63 mg/kg were administered by inhalation. There was hypoglycaemia and hypokaliema. Increased food consumption was seen at all doses in both sexes. The males showed a decrease in vacuolated hepatocytes and an increase in vacuolated macrophages. In the females, there were ovarian follicular cysts,  bilateral  mesovarian  leiomyomas  and  mammary  lobular  hyperplasia.  Both  sexes  showed laryngeal epithelial hyperplasia accompanied by squamous metaplasia at the mid and high doses. The latter indicated an inflammatory response attributed to the aerosolised salmeterol xinafoate.

In 13-, 28-, and 52-week toxicity studies in dogs, salmeterol was administered p.o. and by inhalation using daily doses of 0.15, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg p.o. and twice daily inhalation doses of 5 x 50 µg bursts, 10 x 50 µg bursts and 20 x 50 µg bursts, for the low; mid and high doses respectively. Some animals showed transient tachycardia, vasodilatation, increased muscle development and hypokaliema. At the high dose in the 28 and 52-week studies, the dogs showed seizures and prostration. One animal died following seizures in the 52-week study. Myocardial papillary fibrosis with and without calcification was seen in all 3 studies. The incidences were increased at the mid dose in the 13-week study, at all doses in the 28-week study and at the mid and high dose in the 52-week study.

## Budesonide

The toxicity of budesonide -as detailed below - is characterised by a reduction in blood leukocytes and  eosinophils,  an  increase  in  blood  neutrophils  due  to  an  inhibition  of  their  apoptosis,  elevated AST/ALT, and increase in blood sugar. A reduction in weight and atrophy of the spleen, thymus and all lymph nodes, adrenals, small ulcerative lesions of the stomach and increased liver weight can also be observed. It should be noted that the toxicity of budesonide administered by inhalation is very low, due to its low bioavailability coupled to an extensive first pass metabolism.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Budesonide  cream  or  ointment  was  administered  to  male  and  female  Crj:CD  (SD)  rats  by  topical administration to the shaved back skin at doses of 200 and 1000 mg/kg for up to 13 weeks followed by a 13-week recovery period. Control groups received base cream or ointment. The results show a trend for decreased body weight with a reduction in food consumption. Inhibition of hair growth on the skin at  the  application  site  was  noted  during  the  dosing  period  in  each  administration  group  with budesonide with cutaneous thinning at the application site. Biochemistry showed a reduction in blood leukocytes, an increase in serum transaminases, blood sugar and serum iron. At necropsy, a reduction in  weight and atrophy of the spleen, thymus, and adrenals, small ulcerative lesions of the stomach, hemosiderosis of the Kupffer cells of the liver, a tendency toward an increase in fat cells of the bone marrow, slight hyperplasia of the breasts, and cutaneous atrophy at the application site were seen in the budesonide groups during the study period. All changes were reversible within 13 weeks.

In  longer  studies  (26  weeks)  performed  in  male  and  female  Wistar  rats  (10  animals/group), budesonide  administered  subcutaneously  at  doses  of  0.01,  0.1  and  5  μg/kg/d,  and  5,  20  and  80 μg/kg/d (15 animals/group) revealed a dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain in the groups given 5, 20 and 80 μg/kg/d compared with the control group linked to a dose-related reduction in food intake in males receiving 20 or 80 μg/kg/d. Increased values were observed for packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte counts in both sexes at the doses of 20 and 80 μg/kg/d. A marked decrease in the number of blood lymphocytes was seen for both sexes at 80 μg/kg/d, and for females  also  at  20  μg/kg/d.  Pathological  changes  associated  with  treatment  with  budesonide  were found in the liver, panacinar hepatocytic fine vacuolation in females receiving 80 μg/kg/d, as well as decreased numbers of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and thymus and acinar hyperplasia and secretion in mammary glands were observed in both sexes receiving 20 and 80 μg/kg/d.

In  Beagle  dogs,  a  subacute  toxicity  study  by  percutaneous  absorption  was  conducted  by  applying ointment that contained 0.05% budesonide to the skin of the back for 13 weeks followed by a 13-week recovery  period.  The  amounts  of  budesonide  applied  corresponded  to  0.01  and  0.2  g/kg/day.  An untreated  group  and  a  group  in  which  0.2  g/kg/day  of  the  budesonide  vehicle  was  applied  were established as control groups. A group in which 0.2 g/kg/day of betamethasone 17-valerate ointment was applied was also established as comparative control group. The recovery study was conducted in the budesonide 0.2 g/kg/day group, vehicle group, and betamethasone 17-valerate group. Budesonide administration  produced  erythema  at  the  administration  site,  reduced  the  skin  thickness,  and suppressed hair growth. Histopathologic studies revealed atrophy of the skin and reduced subcutaneous  adipose  tissue.  Hematological  and  biochemical  studies  found  decreases  in  the  blood eosinophil  count,  lymphocyte  count,  and  WBCs  and  increases  in  serum  total  cholesterol  and  serum triglycerides. In the organ weights, decreases were seen in thymus and adrenals and increases in the liver. Histopathological studies found lymph follicle atrophy in the spleen and lymph nodes, atrophy of the thymus, atrophy of the fascicular and reticular zones in the adrenals, and hypertrophy of the liver due to increased glycogen content. The betamethasone 17-valerate group exhibited basically the same changes as the budesonide groups. In the recovery study, all of these changes alleviated and increases in  blood  eosinophil  count  and  hypertrophy  of  the  thymus  thought  to  represent  rebound  phenomena were noted.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

New studies with the combination were performed in rats and dogs (see table below).

## 28-day repeated dose toxicity study with the Fixed Dose Combination in rats through the inhalation route (study TNO #5452)

Budesonide  and  salmeterol  xinafoate  were  administered  to  rats  by  inhalation  once  daily  for  6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 28 days. Besides salmeterol and budesonide, the formulation contained Tween  80  as an emulsifier. Investigated parameters were clinical signs, body weight, food consumption,  food  conversion  efficiency,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  gross  necropsy,  organ weights and histopathology. Blood samples for toxicokinetics were taken, but results were not given. It is  explained  in  the  study  report  that  salmeterol  exposure  was  too  low  to  be  measured  with  the methods  available  at  the  time  of  the  study.  However,  results  for  budesonide  were  also  not  given. Exposure in  rats  was  up  to  approximately  3  -  5  times  the  human  exposure  based  on  steady  state parameters.

It was concluded that the effects observed at the high combi level were largely similar to the effects caused by budesonide alone and that addition of salmeterol did not enhance the effects induced by budesonide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## A 3-month repeated dose toxicity study by the inhalation route in dogs (study TNO#8141)

Budesonide and salmeterol xinafoate were administered to dogs by inhalation daily for 3 months. To generate the test atmosphere, two separate turn-table dust feeders were filled with Budesonide and Salmeterol Xinafoate, respectively.  Dogs  were  exposed daily  for  5  minutes  (high  dose  groups)  or 1 minute  (low  dose  group)  with  target  concentrations  of  112  µg/m 3 budesonide  and  10.4  µg/m 3 salmeterol xinafoate. The dose of salmeterol was inadvertently calculated as xinafoate. The doses of salmeterol  base  are  therefore  69%  of  the  originally  intended  target  concentration.  Investigated parameters  were  clinical  observations,  ophthalmoscopic  examination,  body  weight,  consumption, haematology, clinical chemistry, gross necropsy, organ weights, histopathology. Most of the observed budesonide effects are known to be related to glucocorticosteroid treatment, and are considered to be secondary pharmacological effects rather than toxicological effects. Decreased eosinophil and lymphocyte  counts  and  effect  on  the  spleen  are  associated  with  the  anti-inflammatory  activity  of glucocorticosteroids. Effects on adrenals and electrolyte disbalance in blood are considered to be due to  glucocorticosteroid-mediated  inhibitory  effects  on  the  pituitary-adrenal  axis.  Inhibition  of  the pituitary  gland  function  results  in  reduced  ACTH  release  by  the  adrenals,  and  consequently,  the electrolyte  resorption  by  the  kidneys  is  affected,  leading  to  electrolyte  disbalance  in  blood.  Several other observed changes (i.e. increased liver weight, increased ALP and GGT levels, decreased glucose levels) are related to glucocorticosteroid-mediated effects on liver function. The effects observed in the high combi group were generally comparable to those observed in the animals treated with budesonide alone except for some minor differences.

## A 14-day study in dogs with toxicokinetic, cardiac, glucose/potassium data and inclusion of a recovery period (study TNO#9015)

This study was a bridging study to provide additional data on electrocardiography and toxicokinetics. Budesonide and salmeterol xinafoate were administered to dogs by inhalation daily for 2 weeks. The target concentrations and exposure durations were chosen to be the same as in the preceding 3-month inhalation study. Investigated parameters were clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, toxicokinetics,  electrocardiography,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  gross  necropsy,  organ  weights, histopathology. A mild QT increase was observed in 2 dogs, 1 female from the budesonide group and 1 female  from  the  salmeterol  group.  QT  remained  however  within  reference  values.  Of  the  effects observed, the following were still visible after 14 days recovery: in the thymus there was still lymphoid depletion, though there were signs of recovery and in the zona fasciculata in the adrenals, there was still vacuolation. It was concluded that no evidence was found of enhancement of toxic effects or onset of novel toxic effects after repetitive treatment of male and female dogs with a mixture of budesonide and salmeterol xinafoate for 2 weeks, in comparison with the effects observed after treatment with either budesonide or salmeterol xinafoate alone.

The maximum exposure to budesonide in combination with salmeterol was 11 and 16 times the human exposure to epimer A based on AUC and Cmax respectively and 12 and 19 times the human exposure to epimer B (for toxicokinetic values in the dog study see section 3.2; based on human steady state values AUC 1746 pg.h/ml and Cmax 879 pg/ml for epimer A and AUC 1430 pg.h/ml and Cmax 776 pg/ml for epimer B). The maximum exposure to salmeterol in combination with budesonide was 57 times human exposure based on AUC and 19 times human exposure based on Cmax (based on human values AUC 138 pg.h/ml and Cmax 138 pg/ml).

## Interspecies comparison

No  new  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  provided  by  the  applicant  for  interspecies  comparison. Therefore, only a brief summary on interspecies comparison can be made based on the pharmacokinetics of the separate compounds.

The  plasma  protein  binding  of  salmeterol  was  independent  of  drug  concentration  and  ~95%  in  all species. For budesonide, plasma protein binding was 85% in rabbits, 86% in mice and human, 89% in dogs and 92% in rats.

The metabolic pattern in the pre-clinical species and humans is different for salmeterol. In mouse, rat and  rabbit  the  predominant  metabolic  route  is  via  glucuronidation  of  the  parent  drug.  The  major metabolite in dogs was eventually identified as the 3-catechol sulphate of the benzoic acid derivative. This  metabolite  was  shown  to  have  very  similar  physicochemical  properties  to  a  major  endogenous component  of  the  bile.  In  humans,  salmeterol  undergoes  extensive  aliphatic  oxidation  to  αhydroxysalmeterol. For budesonide, the metabolic pattern is more comparable across the pre-clinical species  mouse and rat and in humans, except that in rat two metabolites are formed via reductive metabolism which are not present in mouse and one metabolite not present in humans.

For salmeterol, excretion was predominantly via feces in all species both after oral and intravenous administration.  Biliary  excretion  was  found  in  rats  and  dogs  after  oral  administration.  After  oral administration, budesonide was mainly excreted as metabolites in the bile and eliminated in the feces in rat and dog. After intravenous administration in rabbits, approximately the same was eliminated in urine and feces. In humans, after oral and inhalation administration, budesonide was mainly excreted in urine.

## Genotoxicity

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol was found devoid of genotoxic potential in the following in vitro and in vivo tests: in vitro chromosomal aberration test, Ames test, fluctuation test, a gene conversion assay using Saccharyomyces cerevisiae, Chinese hamster assay and in an in vivo micronucleus test.

## Budesonide

Budesonide was found negative in the six following genotoxicity assays: Ames test, mouse lymphoma, unscheduled DNA synthesis, human lymphocyte chromosome aberration, mouse in vivo micronucleus and recessive lethal test in Drosophila.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination  salmeterol/budesonide  which  is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Carcinogenicity

## Salmeterol

Long-term  carcinogenity  assays  with  salmeterol  xinafoate  were  conducted  in  rats  administered  by inhalation  (doses  0.06,  0.18  and  0.58  mg/kg/day)  followed  by  gavage  (doses  (0.15,  0.5  and  2.0 mg/kg/day) for 104 weeks and in mice administered by gavage (doses 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg/day) for 80  weeks.  Treatment  was  associated  with  increased  incidences  of  smooth  muscle  hyperplasia  and benign  smooth  muscle  tumours  (leiomyomas)  of  the  mesovarium  in  the  rat  and  the  uterus  in  the mouse.  For  both  species  the  incidence  of  tumours  was  statistically  significantly  increased  at  the intermediate  and  high  doses  only.  Three  malignant  smooth  tumours  were  identified  in  salmeteroltreated mice. Significant increases were observed in the incidence of tumours of the pars anterior of the pituitary in the rat study in intermediate and high dose groups. The number of malignant smooth muscle tumours were not statistically significant compared to controls and were reported within the laboratory range. The greater number of pituitary adenomas noted correlated with a reduction in the proportion of rats with hyperplasia with the pars anterior suggesting that rather than initiating tumour formation,  treatment  with  salmeterol  had  merely  accelerated  the  progression  from  hyperplasia  to adenoma formation that occurs as normal ageing process in rats. At the no effect doses, clear safety margins  could  be  calculated  (figures  not  given).  Leiomyomas  are  believed  to  be  an  adaptive physiological  response  to  continuous  relaxation  of  the  smooth  muscle.  Mouse  uterus  and  rat mesovarium are described as uniquely sensitive to the pharmacological effects of β2-agonists and the tumours in these organs were considered not clinically relevant.

## Budesonide

Long  term  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  and  rats  using  oral  administration  to  evaluate  the carcinogenic potential of budesonide. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when budesonide was administered orally for 91 weeks to mice at doses up to 200 µg/kg/day. In a 104-week oral study in Sprague Dawley rats, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas was observed in male rats receiving an oral dose of 50 µg/kg/day. No such changes were seen in male rats receiving oral doses of 10 and 25 µg/kg/day, or in female rats at oral doses up to 50 µg/kg/day. Two additional 104-week carcinogenicity studies have been performed with oral budesonide at doses of 50 µg/kg/day in  male  Sprague-Dawley  and  Fischer  rats.  These  studies  did  not  demonstrate  an  increased  glioma incidence in budesonide-treated animals, as compared  with concurrent controls or reference corticosteroid-treated groups (prednisolone and triamcinolone acetonide) in these studies.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

The  fixed  dose  combination  of  salmeterol/budesonide  contains  two  compounds  assessed  as  non carcinogenic.  The  carcinogenic  potential  is  thus  fully  assessed.  Hence  other  studies  assessing carcinogenic potential with the combination are not needed in accordance with the requirements of the 'Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products '(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).

## Reproduction Toxicity

## Salmeterol

In reproductive toxicology studies, salmeterol xinafoate did not affect fertility in rats at doses of 0.15, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg per os. Salmeterol xinafoate was not teratogenic in rats at doses of 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg per os. However, in rabbits administered 0.1 and 10.0 mg/kg per os, teratogenicity was seen at doses of 1.0 mg/kg and above per os. The malformations consisted of open eyelid and/or cleft palates. In pregnant Dutch rabbits administered oral doses of 1 mg/kg and above, salmeterol exhibited foetal toxic effects characteristically resulting from β -adrenoreceptor stimulation. These included precocious eyelid openings, cleft palate, sternebral fusion, limb and paw flexures, and delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones. No significant effects occurred at an oral dose of 0.6 mg/kg. New Zealand White rabbits were less sensitive since only delayed ossification of the frontal bones was seen at an oral dose of 10.0 mg/kg In the peri- and post-natal development stage in rats 10 mg/kg per os was fetotoxic and decreased the fertility of the survivors. Salmeterol xinafoate crosses the placenta following oral administration of 10.0 mg/kg to mice and is excreted in the milk.

## Budesonide

The effects of subcutaneous budesonide on fertility and general reproductive performance were studied in rats. At 20.0 µg/kg/day decreases in maternal body weight gain, prenatal viability and viability of the young at birth and during lactation were observed. No such effects were observed at 5 µg/kg/day. As  with  other  glucocorticoids,  budesonide  produced  fetal  loss,  decreased  pup  weight  and  skeletal abnormalities  at  subcutaneous  doses  of  25  µg/kg/day  in  rabbits  and  500  µg/kg/day  in  rats.  No teratogenic  or  embryocidal  effects  were  observed  in  rats  when  budesonide  was  administered  by inhalation at doses up to 250 µg/kg/day. Corticosteroids are secreted in human milk.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No fertility and early embryonic , embryo-foetal, pre-natal and post-natal development studies have been  performed  for  the  combination  salmeterol/budesonide  which  is  considered  acceptable  by  the CHMP.

## Local Tolerance

In the literature data provided with this application, no specific concerns appear for the local tolerance of either salmeterol or budesonide. During the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in the rat and dog  with  the  combination,  a  thorough  examination  of  the  respiratory  tract  i.e.  trachea/bronchi  and lungs  was  performed  and  did  not  reveal  any  particularity  with  the  exception  of  slight  inflammatory signs occasionally seen in the respiratory tract but not considered of importance.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No local toterance studies have been performed for the combination salmeterol/budesonide which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

## Salmeterol

A publication  was  provided  describing  a  28-day  repeated dose  toxicity test in  which  salmeterol  was administered  to  Wistar  rats.  Several  immunotoxicity  screening  parameters  were  incorporated  in  the study protocol to investigate the immunotoxic potential of the compound. Male rats were orally treated with 0, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg salmeterol/kg body weight/day. At the 20 mg/kg/day dose level, intubation errors occurred  because  the  animals  tried  to resist  intubation.  Some  of  these  animals  died intercurrently.  Therefore,  the  magnitude  of  the  dose  was  lowered  to  10  mg/kg/day  at  day  9  of treatment. Body weight and bone marrow cellularity were not affected. Hematological parameters were not altered either, except for platelet counts, that were decreased at all dose levels. Also liver weights were decreased at all dose levels tested. Absolute thymic weights were decreased at the 2 and 20/10 mg/kg/day dose levels. No treatment-related (histo)pathological lesions were seen in the (non)lymphoid  organs.  Serum  IgM  levels  were  increased  at  the  0.2,  and  IgG  at  the  2  and  20/10 mg/kg/day dose levels, respectively. B cell numbers in the spleen were decreased at all dose levels tested. It was concluded that salmeterol has weak immunotoxic properties, as can be expected based on its anti-inflammatory properties. Salmeterol-associated immune dysfunction is however considered unlikely because the dose levels in this study are extremely high compared to therapeutic dose levels used in asthma.

## Budesonide

Immunotoxicity studies were not considered relevant since budesonide has strong anti-inflammatory properties  which  are  dose-dependent  as  seen  in  all  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  presented earlier.  Those  changes  consist  of  lymphoid  depletion  in  thymus  and  all  lymphoid  tissues,  decreased cellularity  in  the  bone  marrow  and  decreased  white  blood  cell  counts  (except  for  the  apparent neutrophil increase).

## Salmeterol/budesonide

No immunotoxicity studies have been performed for the combination salmeterol/budesonide which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) submitted for Labazenit was prepared in compliance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment  of Medicinal Products for  Human  Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  The  two  active  substances  salmeterol  and  budesonide  have  been assessed separately.

## Salmeterol

## Phase I

## Calculation of the Predicted Environment Concentration (PEC)

The environmental exposure assessment was estimated according to the formula for the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## DILUTION WASTEW F DOSE PEC ⋅ ⋅ = inhab pen SURFACE WATER ai

The following values were used for the calculation:

DOSEai  =  0.100  mg  (The  maximum  daily  dose  of  salmeterol  recommended  for  the  treatment  is  2 capsules of 50 μg)

Fpen = 1 % (default values proposed in the guideline)

WASTEWinhab = 200 (default values proposed in the guideline)

DILUTION = 10 (default values proposed in the guideline)

PECsurfacewater is 0.0005 µg/L.

PECsurfacewater is below 0.01 μg/L, and thus a phase II assessment is not necessary.

## Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient

As stated earlier, salmeterol is also a well-known substance used as inhaled anti-inflammatory drug for respiratory  affections.  The  Octanol/Water  partition  coefficient  (LogKow)  measured  at  3  different  pH conditions  and  3  concentrations  of  the  substance  was  found  to  be  between  1.32  and  2.20 (Environmental  Assessment,  Serevent,  NDA  20-692,  Attachment  4).  The  value  provided  by  the originator of salmeterol is LogKow = 2.2 at pH 7 (MSDS-2, Serevent Diskus). Also according to the ERA of salmeterol (Serevent) available on the website of the Swedish Medicine Agency (MPA) there is no  significant  bioaccumulation  potential  for  salmeterol  as  its  Octanol/Water  partition  coefficient  was found to be 1.71 at pH 7, 2.06 at pH 5, 1.71 at pH 7, and 1.32 at pH 9. The compound undergoes degradation in the environment and has no potential to accumulate in aquatic organisms (FASS.sesalmeterol).

## Action limits

As the PEC &lt; 0.01 μg/l and the logKow &lt;4.5, it can be assumed according to EMA guideline on the ERA of medicinal products for human use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00).that the medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

## Budesonide

## Phase I

## Calculation of the Predicted Environment Concentration (PEC)

The environmental exposure assessment was estimated according to the formula for the calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

DILUTION

WASTEW

F DOSE ⋅ pen ai

PEC

⋅

=

inhab

SURFACE WATER

The following values were used for the calculation:

DOSE ai =

0.600 (mg patient -1 d -1 )

F pen =   0.01 (patient inh -1

)

WASTEW inhab =

200 (L inh -1 d -1 )

DILUTION =

10 (-)

PECsurfacewater is 0.003 µg/L.

The PECsurfacewater is below 0.01 μg/L, and thus a phase II assessment is not necessary.

## Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient

Budesonide  is  a  well-known  substance  used  as  inhaled  anti-inflammatory  drug  for  respiratory affections, and as such ample information on its (physicochemical) properties is available. Experimentally measured values for the Octanol/Water partition coefficient (logKow) are less than 3.5. Values of 2.55 (Green J and Gommeren E, 2004) and 3.2 (Lin H et al., 2005, and Product Information, Pulmicort 2006) have been reported. Also according to the ERA of budesonide available on the Swedish

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medicine  Agency  (MPA)  website  (FASS.se-Budesonide),  based  on  a  number  of  study  reports,  the logKow  =  3.3  (experimentally  determined  by  \"shake  flask  method\"  United  States  Pharmacopoeia (USP)).

## Action limits

As the PEC &lt;0.01 μg/l and the logKow &lt;4.5, it can be assumed according to EMA guideline on the ERA of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (CPMP/SWP/4447/00).that the medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The combination of the ICS budesonide with the LABA salmeterol is in line with treatment guidelines for  asthma  treatment  in  patients  with  reversible  airway  obstruction  who  continue  to  experience symptoms despite treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent such as an ICS.

The pharmacology of budesonide and salmeterol is well-known hence no further pharmacology studies are deemed necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One new inhalation toxicokinetic study in dogs has been provided by the Applicant with the fixed-dose combination  of  salmeterol  and  budesonide.  Overall,  Tmax  did  not  differ  when  budesonide  and salmeterol were given as single compound and when they were given in combination. For maximum concentrations and systemic exposure, values were lower in the low concentration combination group compared to the budesonide and salmeterol only groups after both single and repeated dosing. This could be explained by the difference in exposure time (1 minute vs. 5 minutes). The Cmax and AUC values  were  not  a  factor  5  lower  in  the  low  concentration  combination  group  though,  as  would  be expected by the assumption that exposure increases equally over time. Since clinical pharmacokinetic data do not indicate pharmacokinetic interactions between budesonide and salmeterol, overall it can be considered that the pharmacokinetic parameters of salmeterol and budesonide are not altered when given in combination.

Based on information  provided  for  budesonide  and  salmeterol  as  single  compounds,  it  is  suggested that  both  compounds  of  Labazenit  have  a  large  volume  of  distribution  since  both  salmeterol  and budesonide are widely distributed when given alone. No new studies were submitted by the Applicant on  the  distribution  of  salmeterol  and  budesonide  when  both  compounds  are  administered  in combination.  Based  on  the  present  knowledge  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  both  compounds  and considering the fact that systemic concentrations are low for both compounds, no influence is expected on the distribution when salmeterol and budesonide are given in combination compared to given alone.

Both compounds are metabolized by CYP3A4. As such, salmeterol and budesonide may interact with each other at the level of metabolizing enzymes. CYP3A4/5 is also present in lung tissue and as both compounds  will  reach  the  lungs  first  before  entering  the  systemic  circulation,  metabolism  of  both compounds may occur in the lungs. Clinically, there are no indications that interactions between the two compounds occur.

The  major  excretion  route  for  salmeterol  and  budesonide  in  human  is  different  -  respectively  via faeces  and  urine  -  no  major  interactions  are  expected.  Also,  no  differences  are  observed  in  kinetic parameters  when  given  both  compounds  alone  compared  to  given  in  combination  by  inhalation. Therefore,  no  clinically  relevant  alterations  are  expected  regarding  the  excretion  of  salmeterol  and budesonide.

Systemic exposure to budesonide and salmeterol will not be very high since both compounds will be inhaled (Cmax was ~3 ng/mL for salmeterol and ~15 ng/mL for budesonide at dosages of 10.4 mg/m 3 salmeterol  and  112  mg/m 3 budesonide  for  5  minutes).  CYP  induction  and  inhibition  potentials  and other  drug-drug  interactions  as  found  for  both  substances  individually  are  also  included  in  the proposed Labazenit SmPC in section 4.5.

Since all three toxicology studies indicate that toxic effects are not aggravated by the combination and toxicokinetics in dogs as well as pharmacokinetics in humans indicate no relevant interaction between budesonide and salmeterol, the present data can be regarded sufficient. In the combination studies, mainly effects were observed that could be ascribed to budesonide: decreased body weight gain (rat), decreased lymphocytes and depletion of lymphoid tissues, increases of transaminases (dog), increased glucose and triglycerides (rat) and atrophy of the zona fasciculata in the adrenals (dog). In the 2-week dog  study,  tachycardia  and  decreased  potassium  were  observed  as  effects  caused  by  salmeterol. Neither  budesonide  nor  salmeterol  effects  were  aggravated  due  to  the  combination.  The  maximum exposure to budesonide and salmeterol was sufficient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding interspecies comparison it was noted that plasma protein binding differed across species for budesonide (85-92%), with the free fraction in humans (86% plasma protein binding) approximately twice as large as in rats (92%). For salmeterol the plasma protein binding was approximately the same (~95%)  across  the  non-clinical  species  and  in  humans.  The  metabolic  patterns  of  salmeterol  and budesonide are more (salmeterol) or less (budesonide) different across species, including the human situation.  The  3-catechol  sulphate  metabolite  found  in  dog  bile  after  metabolism  of  salmeterol  is expected to be a species-specific metabolite, and due to the resemblances with a major endogenous component  in  bile  assumed  to  react  with  bile  salts.  The  excretion  of  salmeterol  occurs  mainly  via elimination in feces in all species. For budesonide however, excretion is via bile and faeces in rat and dog, via both urine and feces in rabbit, and via urine in humans.

There  is  considerable  clinical  experience  with  budesonide  during  pregnancy  hence  further  peri-  and postnatal development studies with budesonide seem not necessary.

Immunotoxicity  of  salmeterol  can  be  considered  not  relevant  at  therapeutic  dose  levels.  Effects  of budesonide  on  the  immune  system  were  caused  by  its  pharmacological  actions  and  were  not aggravated  by  the  combination  with  salmeterol  in  combination  studies  in  rats  and  dogs.  Additional immunotoxicity studies were not necessary.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Overall, the non-clinical developmental plan of the combination salmeterol/budesonide was limited to necessary studies. This is considered acceptable. The available non-clinical data including the results obtained  from  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  with  the  FDC  salmeterol/budesonide  and  the environmental risk assessment did not identify any new safety issues. The non-clinical safety profile of salmeterol/budesonide appears to be consistent with those established for salmeterol and budesonide when used as monotherapy. Based on the available non-clinical safety data with the two monotherapy compounds, salmeterol and budesonide, it is concluded that the FDC should be well tolerated when used in human at the proposed dosage.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The Applicant is seeking a Marketing Authorisation for salmeterol/budesonide inhalation powder in hard capsules  for  the  regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  where  use  of  a  fixed  combination  medicinal product  (inhaled  corticosteroid  and  long-acting  β2-agonist)  is  appropriate:  patients  not  adequately controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short  acting  β2-agonists  or  patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists.

The recommended dose in adults patients is one inhalation of Labazenit 120 micrograms/20 micrograms twice daily, or one inhalation of Labazenit 240 micrograms /20 micrograms  twice  daily.  No  dose  adjustment  is  required  in  patients  with  renal  and/or  hepatic impairment.

The clinical development program of Labazenit was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of salmeterol/budesonide  as  FDC  in  patients  with  asthma.  No  dedicated  studies  with  salmeterol  or budesonide  as  monotherapy  were  conducted.  The  pharmacokinetics,  safety,  and  efficacy  profiles  of salmeterol  and  budesonide  as  monotherapy  are  well  known.  The  clinical  development  programs  for salmeterol/budesonide is presented in the three tables below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Scientific advice was provided by the CHMP in January 2010 on the non-clinical and clinical aspects of the  development  program.  The  CHMP  highlighted  that  the  clinical  program  as  proposed  by  the Applicant might not be sufficient since the phase III studies faced issues with regard to the strengths and the lack of assay sensitivity in phase II and III studies.

## GCP

According to the applicant the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Union were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards provided for under Directive 2001/20/EC.

A  triggered  GCP  inspection  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  in  the  light  of  concerns  related  to  data reporting and analyses that were highlighted during the assessment. A GCP inspection was conducted which focused on studies BUSAL SS071 and BUSAL III-02-01. Critical findings concerning monitoring for study BUSAL SS071 were identified during the inspection but it was considered that these findings had no consequences for the reported data. In contrast, the conduct of trial BUSAL III-02-01 was not conducted in compliance with GCP due to deficiencies identified in data management of the secondary efficacy  parameters FEV1 and FVC. The integrated inspection report recommended the data for FVC and  FEV1  from  all  sites  should  not  be  accepted  by  the  CHMP  to  support  this  initial  MAA.  It  was highlifghted during the inspection that the data seems to have been well recorded in the CRF despite some issues about the position of the comma in the CRF that would also been in line with the study protocol.  The  deviation  should  not  impact  the  overall  results  as  the  values  used  were  derived  from three reproducible spirometric measurement, which should not differ by &gt; 5% or by 0.1 L, whichever is the greatest. The inspection's outcome recommended that the Applicant should perform a statistical reanalysis  of  the  FVC  and  FEV1  parameters  with  the  highest  values  recorded  in  the  CRF  for  study BUSAL-III-02-1. As requested, a statistical reanalysis of the highest FEV1, and FVC for week 12 was submitted  by  the  Applicant  during  the  evaluation  as  were  the  spirometric  values  measured  in  the safety phase of the study from week 12 to week 24.The difference with the originally presented values were small. No statistically significant differences were seen for FEV1 and FEV1 % of predicted and FVC between the two strengths of Labazenit.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

Only limited data on the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol are available. This lack of information is most likely  due  to  the  very  low  plasma  concentration  obtained  after  inhalation  of  therapeutic  doses  of salmeterol. Indeed, salmeterol is rapidly absorbed from the lung after inhalation and only a few part of the  administered  dose  reached  the  systemic  circulation.  Furthermore,  due  to  these  low  salmeterol plasma concentration, developing an analytical method that is sensitive enough to determine these low concentrations  was  difficult.  Salmeterol  exerts  its  therapeutic  effects  through  local  action  on  β2 receptors in the lung. Hence, plasma levels of the drug have no bearing on the therapeutic efficacy of salmeterol.  Previous  studies  reviewed  by  Van  Eenoo et  al .  have  demonstrated  that  patients  have  a Cmax at the first sampling point (5 min). Therefore as most of the subsequent concentration values obtained were close to LOQ, no pharmacokinetic parameters were calculable due to assay limitations.

Budesonide consists of a one-to-one mixture of epimers with 22R and 22S configuration - also referred to as epimer A and B, respectively. Both epimers seem to have the same qualitative pharmacological effects.  The  fraction  deposited  in  the  oral  cavity  is  relatively  poorly  absorbed  into  the  systemic circulation. In addition, the amount of budesonide that penetrates the air/blood barrier is low.

## Analytical methods

Concentrations  of  budesonide  (epimers  A  and  B)  and  salmeterol  in  human  plasma  were  measured using  specific  LC/MS/MS  method.  The  method  was  4  times  optimised  but  the  LLOQ  levels  for  the budesonide  enantiomers  22.5-50  pg/ml  and  15  pg/ml  for  salmeterol  remained  relatively  high compared  to  the  plasma  concentrations  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol.  For  Labazenit  150/25  µg strength, Cmax for budesonide and salmeterol were less than 10x the LLOQ in studies BUSAL-SS032, BUSAL-SD033,  BUSAL-SS071  and  busal-SD101.  Therefore,  AUC  levels  could  not  be  determined accurately for budesonide when Labazenit or the respectively mono-products were administered at the lowest  therapeutic  dose  in  these  studies.  In  study  BUSAL-DP102  (dose  proportionality)  and  study BUSAL-SD111 (lung deposition PK), submitted by the Applicant with the responses to the D120 LOQ, the analytical assay was improved and evaluation of the low strength of Labazenit was possible.

As many of the salmeterol data fell below the LLOQ, the Applicant omitted the salmeterol data from the study reports. This is an important omission as, arguably, the delivery of salmeterol is as important as  that  of  budesonide  in  terms  of  clinical  safety  and  efficacy.  With  the  D120  LOQ  responses,  the Applicant  submitted  a  new  PK  study,  study  BUSAL-SD121,  with  a  more  robust  analytical  method, comparing the bioavailability of salmeterol between Labazenit and Serevent Diskus following a higher than recommended dose to increase the salmeterol plasma concentrations. As a result, ccomparison of pharmacokinetics of salmeterol between Labazenit and salmeterol mono compound will only be based on the results from  study BUSAL-SD121.  There  were  some  irregularities observed  with the pharmacokinetic  analysis.  Subjects  were  excluded  from  PK  and/or  statistical  analysis  seemingly arbitrarily.  Criteria  for  exclusion  of  subjects  from  PK  or  statistical  analysis  were  not  defined  in  the protocol and not adequately discussed in the study reports. In addition, in the multiple dose studies Cmin  plasma  concentrations  above  the  LLOQ  were  calculated  as  being  at  the  level  of  LLOQ.  An additional  correct  analysis  with  plasma  concentrations  below  the  LLOQ  treated  as  missing  data  was submitted by the Applicant with their responses to the D120 LOQ. In the studies initially submitted with  this  initial  MAA,  removal  of  subjects  from  pharmacokinetic  analysis  has  not  been  adequately defined.  This  may  have  led  to  inconsistent  removal  of  subjects  from  the  analysis  but  this  occurred mainly  when  budesonide plasma  concentration  curve  could  not  be  fully  characterised  when  the  low budesonide  dose  was  administered.  Therefore,  AUC  values  from  studies  BUSAL-SS071  and  BUSAL-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SD033 with the low Labazenit strength were considered very cautiously. Data on the high Labazenit strength  were  assessed  using  data  from  all  studies.  In  studies  BUSAL-SD111  and  BUSAL-SD121 (submitted  during  the  evaluation),  removal  from  pharmacokinetic  analysis  has  been  adequately defined in the protocol. Sufficient data with respect to budesonide PK was obtained from remaining PK studies using the highest strength or using an improved  analytical method  to  evaluate  the pharmacokinetics of budesonide in Labazenit.

In-vitro comparison of budesonide from Labazenit Axahaler 150/25 μg versus Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 μg at optimal airflow

In  order  to  allow  a  statistically  reliable  comparison  between  Labazenit  Axahaler  150/25  μg  and Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 μg, 5 batches of Labazenit were used among which 4 batches used in clinical trials and one is an industrial batch. For Pulmicort Turbuhaler also 5 batches were used. All the batches of Pulmicort Turbuhaler used for the comparison were within the product specification for UDD and show approximately the expected and published value FPD (± 30 % of the nominal dose) for this marketed product.

In-vitro comparison of budesonide from Labazenit AxahalerR 150/25 μg versus Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4.5 μg at different airflows

Since most of the clinical  and/or  validation  batches  of  test  and  reference products  presented  above were expired, and that the OIP guideline recommends three different batches for this comparison, it was decided to analyse and compare the following batches:

- For  Labazenit  a  clinical  batch  and  the  first  two  industrial  batches  (Labazenit  150/25  g)  and (Labazenit 300/25 g with a dose correction)
- For  Symbicord  Turbohaler  the  clinical  batch  used  in  the  recent  pharmacokinetic  study  SMBBUSAL-SD-111  and 2 commercial batches recently purchased by the Applicant
- For Pulmicort Turbohaler three commercial batches recently purchased by the applicant

In-vitro dose-response of budesonide between Labazenit Axahaler 150/25 μg and LabazenitT Axahaler 300/25 μg

In  order  to  assess  the dose-response of budesonide between the two proposed dosage strengths of LABAZENIT, in-vitro comparison were performed with the same methodology as previously described. 5 batches of LabazenitT 150/25 μg were compared (4 clinical batches and an industrial batch) to 5 batches of Labazenit 300/25 μg (4 clinical batches and an industrial batch).

If  dose  linearity  is  demonstrated in-vitro it  may  be  sufficient  to  establish  therapeutic  equivalence clinically with only one strength of the active substance as per the OIP guideline (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98  rev.1).  Dose  linearity  was  evaluated  by  comparison  of  the  average delivered dose and FPD. Statistical analysis of the amounts of budesonide recovered from each stage of the MLI needs to be submitted. Furthermore, flow rate dependency of both strengths was compared at 100, 80, 60 and 30 L/min. As shown in the figures below, there is no significant influence of the airflow  on  the  deposition  of  salmeterol  and  budesonide  between  80  L/min  and  100  L/min.  Below 80L/min, the deposition decreases slightly, while it declines significantly at 30 L/min, reaching about half of the pulmonary deposition at the optimal flow. The flow rate dependency of FPD was comparable for  Labazenit  300/25  µg  and  Labazenit  150/25  µg.  Based  on  the  provided  FPD  data  and  flow dependency the two strengths are dose proportional.

## Bioavailability

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol  is  rapidly  absorbed  after  inhalation  with  Tmax  5  min  in  more  than  80%  of  subjects. Salmeterol  and  its  counter  ion,  xinaphoic  acid,  dissociate  in  solution  and  are  absorbed,  distributed, metabolised and eliminated separately. In patients with asthma receiving salmeterol 50 μg twice daily, peak salmeterol concentrations of 150 ng/l were detected in plasma 5 to 10 minutes after inhalation and  a  second  peak  concentration  of  115  ng/l  occurred  in  plasma  approximately  45  minutes  after inhalation,  probably  as  the  result  of  absorption  of  swallowed  drug.  Larger  inhaled  doses  give approximately proportionally increased blood concentrations. Plasma salmeterol concentrations of 0.1 to 0.2 and 1 to 2 μg/L have been attained in healthy volunteers about 5 to 15 minutes after inhalation of a single dose of 50 and 400 μg, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Budesonide

The  oral  availability  of  budesonide  is  low.  In  the  original  review  by  Clissold  SP  and  Heel  RC,  the systemic bioavailability of budesonide following oral administration was 10.7%. Since 73% of the dose reaching the lung was systemically available, extensive first-pass metabolism was suggested.

After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6-13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systematically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide delivered from Pulmicort  Flexhaler  in  adults  asthma  (n=39)  occurred  at  approximately  10  minutes  post-dose  and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180μg once daily and 360μg twice daily, respectively.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

In three studies (studies SMB-BUSAL-SS032, SMB-BUSAL-SS071 and SMB-BUSAL-SD033) bioavailability  following  Labazenit  inhalation  was  compared  with  that  of  the  reference  products Pulmicort Turbuhaler and Serevent DiskusS. The first study, study SMB-Busal-SS032 was a multiple dose,  steady  state,  3  way,  cross-over  study  to  compare  the  bioavailability  of  budesonide  and salmeterol  of  Labazenit  300/25  with  the  respective  single  agent  reference  products  Pulmicort Turbuhaler  and  Serevent  DiskusS.  In  the  second  study  SMB-Busal-SS071,  pharmacokinetics  of Labazenit 150/25 µg was compared to the combination of Pulmicort Turbuhlaer and Serevent Diskus in a multiple dose, steady state, 2 way, cross-over study. The dose administration in the multiple dose studies is in line with the dose recommendation for Labazenit. Finally, in study SMB-Busal-SD033, a single dose of Labazenit 300/25 and Labazenit 150/25 were compared with one single dose of 2 puffs of Pulmicort Turbuhaler, no comparison with Serevent was made.

## Study SMB-Busal-SS032 (300/25)

Study  SMB-Busal-SS032  was  a  comparative  multiple  dose,  three-treatments,  three-periods,  sixsequences,  randomised,  crossover  study  in  24  healthy  volunteers,  with  at  least  7  days  wash-out between each period. This study was conducted in Poland in 2003.

The  fixed  dose  combination  of  budesonide/salmeterol  300/25µg  or  the  budesonide  reference  drug product (2 inhalations of PULMICORT 200µg) or salmeterol reference drug product (Serevent 50µg) were administered during the seven first days of each period twice a day.

## Results

As  demonstrated  in  the  table  and  figure  below,  budesonide  (epimer  A  and  epimer  B)  of  Labazenit 300/25µg and Pulmicort 2*200µg showed comparable bioavailability after multiple-dose administrations.

Due to the rapid elimination of budesonide and salmeterol, 12 h after the inhalation, most of plasma budesonide and salmeterol concentrations were below the limit of quantification. Therefore, no Cmin and swing could be determined for both agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  plasma  levels  of  salmeterol  were  low  for  all  the  subjects  and  full  characterization  of  the pharmacokinetic profile including 5 points in the absorption phase and 5 points in the elimination phase was  not  possible  for  most  subjects.  Therefore,  the  values  given  for  the  main  pharmacokinetic parameters are aimed to roughly describe the pharmacokinetic profile of each product but no statistical analysis could be performed.

## Study SMB-Busal-SS071 (150/25)

In  study  SMB-Busal-SS071,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Labazenit  150/25  µg  was  compared  to  the combination of Pulmicort Turbuhaler and Serevent Diskus at steady state.

Day  1  to  day  6:  one  capsule  by  inhalation  twice  a  day  containing  150  µg  budesonide  and  25  µg salmeterol or one inhalation twice a day containing 200 µg of budesonide followed immediately after by  one  inhalation  containing  50  µg  of  salmeterol  twice  a  day.  On  Day  7  one  capsule  by  inhalation containing 150 µg budesonide and 25 µg salmeterol or one inhalation containing 200 µg of budesonide followed immediately after by one inhalation containing 50 µg of salmeterol were administered.

Venous blood samples for PK at Day 7 were collected at -00:35 pre-dose for steady state control and at the following timepoints: 00:05, 00:10, 00:15, 00:20, 00:25, 00:30, 00:45, 01:00, 01:30, 02:00, 02:30, 03:00, 04:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 24:00 hours post-dose.

## Results

The  bioavailability  of  budesonide  in  study  SMB-Busal-SS071  was  almost  2-fold  higher  for  Labazenit 150/25µg  than  for  the  combination  of  Pulmicort  Turbuhaler  200µg+  Serevent  Diskus.  It  should  be noted that the LLOQ for budesonide was ~40 pg/ml and as a result almost all samples were below the LLOQ 4-6 hours after inhalation.

According  to  the  Applicant  the  higher  bioavailability  following  Labazenit  inhalation  is  most  likely  be explained by the very high variability of the delivery of budesonide from the Turbuhaler device. The Turbuhaler is a reservoir based device, and if the delivery of one dose is not complete, the following dose  will  deliver  more  drug  than  scheduled.  In  this  study  only  1  inhalation  was  taken,  thus  if  the delivery of the dose was not complete, no compensation with a following dose could be achieved.

No results for salmeterol were reported.

## Study SMB-Busal-SD033 (300/25 and 150/25)

Study  SMB-Busal-SD033  was  a  cross-over  bioequivalence  study.  One  single  dose  of  Labazenit 300/25µg was compared to one single dose of Labazenit 150/25µg and to one single dose of 2 puff Pulmicort Turbuhaler   200 µg.

This study was a comparative, single dose, three-treatment, three-period, six-sequence, randomized, crossover study in 24 healthy volunteers. This study was conducted in Poland in 2003.

Venous blood samples were collected at -0.35 pre-dose and at the following timepoints: 00:05, 00:10, 00:15, 00:20, 00:25, 00: 30, 00:45, 01:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 24:00 hours post-dose.

## Results

The  variability  of  the  systemic  absorption  after  inhalation  was  very  high  as  demonstrated  for budesonide  by  calculating  the  inter-  and  intra-variability  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (CV &gt;30%). The budesonide-epimer A showed a point estimate of 104.2 and 111.09 for AUCt and Cmax respectively and 90% CI of 84-130 and 92-134 respectively. Regarding the budesonide-epimer B, the point  estimates  were  of  106.7  and  125.0  for  AUCt  and  Cmax  respectively.  The  statistical  analyses performed on the total of the two epimers, point estimates were 1.08 (0.87-1.33) and 1.16 (0.941.42) for AUCt and Cmax, respectively. This demonstrates that administration of 1 dose of Labazenit 300/25 and 2 doses of Pulmicort 200 mg result in comparable budesonide exposure.

## Bioequivalence

## Salmeterol/budesonide

Dose proportionality of budesonide pharmacokinetics was assessed in two studies, studies SMB-BusalSD033 and SMB-Busal-DP102.

Study SMB-Busal-SD033 was a cross-over bioequivalence study. One single dose of Budesonide/Salmeterol  300/25µg  fixed-dose  combination  was  compared  to  one  single  dose  of Budesonide-Salmeterol 150/25µg fixed-dose combination and to one single dose of 2 puff Pulmicort  Turbuhaler 200  µg.  This  study  was  a  comparative,  single  dose,  three-treatment,  threeperiod,  six-sequence,  randomized,  crossover  study  in  24  healthy  volunteers  (see  also  comparative bioavailability).

Study SMB-Busal-DP102  was  a  single dose, double-blind, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, randomised, crossover study in 40 mild persistent asthmatic patients, with at least 3 days of wash-out to evaluate dose proportionality of Labazenit 300/25 and 150/50. This study was conducted in Bulgaria in 2010. Active charcoal was administered orally in order to prevent any gastro-intestinal absorption of the active ingredients. Venous blood samples were collected at day 1 and 5: at -00h35 for pre-dose sample and at the following timepoints: 00h10, 00h20, 00h30, 00h45, 01h00, 01h15, 01h30, 02h00, 02h30 03h00, 04h00, 05h00, 06h00, 08h00, 10h00, 12h00 and 24h00 hours post-dose.

## Results

The pharmacokinetics was not dose proportional for budesonide in study SMB-Busal-DP102 since the AUCt, and Cmax  of budesonide from Labazenit 300/25 µg were more than twice as high as the one of Labazenit  150/25  µg.  The  ratios  were  1,43  /  1,33  for  AUC  t/dose  and  Cmax/dose  respectively  for Epimer  A,  and  1,58  /  1,48  for  Epimer  B.  This  non-dose  proportionality  may  at  least  in  part  be attributable  to  the  relatively  higher  fraction  of  FPD  in  Labazenit  300/25  in  comparison  to  Labazenit 150/25  143µg  vs  57.5µg  respectively.  When  corrected  for  FPD,  the  pharmacokinetics    between Labazenit 300/25 and Labazenit 150/25 were comparable (see figure below).

Also in study SMB-Busal SD033, where the FPD for the used batches of Busal 300/25 and 150/25 were dose proportional, Cmax of budesonide increased dose proportional. Furthermore, the variability was higher  for  Labazenit  150/25  than  for  Labazenit  300/25  which  may  be  due  to  the  lower  plasma concentrations of budesonide following Labazenit 150/25 inhalation. AUCt may be underestimated for Labazenit 150/25 as budesonide plasma concentrations were readily below the LLOQ of budesonide ~40 pg/ml.

The  plasma  levels  of  salmeterol  were  low  for  most  patients  and  the  full  characterization  of  the pharmacokinetic  profile  was  not  possible.  Therefore,  the  values  given  for  the  main  pharmacokinetic parameters are aimed to roughly describe the pharmacokinetic profile of each product but no statistical analysis  could  have  been  performed.  Pharmacokinetics  of  salmeterol  was  comparable  for  Labazenit 150/25 and Labazenit 300/25 as can be expected as the amount of salmeterol and the FPD was the same in both strengths.

Two additional pharmacokinetic studies were submitted by the Applicant with their responses to the D120  LOQ  to  further  establish  the  comparability  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol  versus  reference products Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4.5 µg and Serevent Dislus 50 µg, respectively.

## Study SMB-BUSAL-SD111

The objectives of this study was to compare the lung deposition of budesonide after a single-dose of Labazenit 150/25 μg versus a single dose of Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4,5 μg.

The study was performed in 40 asthma patients as recommended by the OIP guideline (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 rev.1). Active charcoal was administered to patients to ensure that plasma levels of budesonide measured were due to lung deposition only.

Venous blood samples were collected at day 1 of each period: at -00h35 for pre-dose sample and at the following timepoints: 00h10, 00h20, 00h30, 00h45, 01h00, 01h15, 01h30, 02h00, 02h30, 03h00, 04h00, 05h00, 06h00, 08h00, 10h00, 12h00 and 24h00 hours post-dose.

Symbicort Turbuhlaer160/4,5 μg contains a fixed dose combination of budesonide and formoterol. The dose is expressed as the delivered dose and corresponds to nominal dose of 200 μg of budesonide and 6  μg  of  formoterol.  Consequently,  the  product  theoretically  contains  and  delivers  the  same  dose  of budesonide  than  the  Pulmicort  Turbuhaler  200  μg.  This  comparator  has  been  chosen  instead  of Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 μg because the in vitro testing has demonstrated a lower intra and interbatch variability of the delivered dose and the Fine Particle Dose (FPD) for Symbicort Turbuhaler. The decreased variability of Symbicort Turbuhaler versus Pulmicort Turbuhlaer is expected on the basis of the respective formulations.

Test product: Labazenit 150/25 μg Axahaler

FPD 58.5 µg budesonide (beginning PK study) and 51.9 µg (end PK study)

Reference product: Symbicort Turbuhlaer160/4.5

FPD 76.4 µg budesonide (beginning PK study) and 62.2 µg (end PK study)

Similar results were obtained when corrected for FPD at end of the PK study.

The  bioavailability  of  budesonide  was  slightly  higher  following  inhalation  of  Symbicort  Turbuhaler compared to the bioavailability of budesonide following inhalation of Busal 150/25 μg. This difference is mainly due to the differences in in-vitro deposition profile (FPD values) of the bio-batches used which however are in the acceptable norms for both products.

When  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are  corrected  for  the  FPD  values,  the  bioavailability  is comparable  and  within  the  bioequivalence  criteria  between  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4.5 µg.

## Study BUSAL-SD121

This study was a comparative study of the bioavailability of salmeterol after single inhalation in healthy volunteers:  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  DPI  Capsules  150/25  μg  delivered  by  the  Axahaler  versus Serevent Diskus 50 μg. This was a randomised, single dose, 2-way, crossover study.

The  goal  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  plasma  levels  of  salmeterol  after  a  single-dose administration of two capsules of Labazenit 150/25 μg versus two puffs of Serevent Diskus 50 μg in 32 healthy volunteers.

Venous  blood  samples  were  collected  at  day  1  of  each  period:  at  pre-dose  and  at  the  following timepoints: 00:10, 00:15, 00:20, 00:30, 00:45, 01:00, 01:15, 01:30, 02:00, 02:30, 03:00, 04:00, 06:00, 08:00, 10:00, 12:00 post-dose.

Test product:   Busal 150/25:

Delivered salmeterol dose: 20.2 µg,  FPD: 10.9 µg

Reference product: Serevent Diskus

Delivered salmeterol dose: 44.1 µg,  FPD 12.6 µg

<!-- image -->

Busal  150/25μg  fixed-dose  combination  demonstrated  similar  pharmacokinetic  profile  as  Serevent Diskus 50 μg for the analyte salmeterol.

However, the 90 % confidence interval for salmeterol was not in the predetermined norms of 80-125 %  for  AUCt  and  Cmax.  Indeed,  point  estimates  are  respectively  1.17  and  1.31  for  the  following pharmacokinetic parameters: AUCt and Cmax. There was no significant difference between the Tmax of both treatments.

The  bioavailability  (AUC  and  Cmax)  of  salmeterol  is  somewhat  higher  for  Busal  150/25  μg  than  for Sereven Diskus 50 μg.

## Distribution

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol  is  94  to  98%  bound  to  human  plasma  proteins  in-vitro  to  both  albumin  and  α-  9-  acid glycoprotein.  Salmeterol  xinafoate,  as  an  ionic  salt,  dissociates  in  solution  to  salmeterol  and  to  1hydroxy-2-naphtoic  acid  (xinafoate)  moiety.  These  two  compounds  are  then  absorbed,  distributed, metabolised and excreted independently.

## Budesonide

The volume of distribution of unchanged budesonide was reported as 301 L with distribution of the more hydrophobic epimer 22R (424L) being greater than of epimer 22S 245 L. Findings were similar in children  with  asthma:  volume  of  distribution  of  epimers  22R  and  22S  was  4.8  and  3.1  L/lg, respectively. Budesonide is 88 % bound to plasma proteins, which is similar to other glucocorticoids.

## Metabolism

## Salmeterol

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 3A4 is responsible for aliphatic oxidation of salmeterol base, which is extensively metabolised by hydroxylation.

## Budesonide

Budesonide is inactivated predominantly in the liver. Budesonide is not biotransformed in the lung or gastrointestinal tract. In the liver, budesonide is metabolised primarily via oxidative and, to a much lesser extent, via reductive pathways to six metabolites, primarily 16a-hydroxy-prednisolone and 6bhydroxy-budesonide.  These  metabolites  are  products  of  the  inducible  form  of  cytochrome  P450, CYP3A4, and have similar half-lives to the parent compound but are relatively inactive.

Metabolism of budesonide occurred 2 to 4 times faster than the metabolism of beclomethasone 17αpropionate (the active metabolite of beclomethasone 17α, 21 dipropionate) and 2 to 3 times faster than triamcinolone acetonide in human liver homogenate in vitro.

Additionally, the drug is pharmacokinetically characterised by a large volume of distribution and a high hepatic  clearance.  The  extensive  liver  biotransformation  contributes  to the  favourable  ratio  between local and systemic glucocorticoid effects shown for the compound.

In  addition,  formation  of  the  budesonide  metabolites  was  inhibited  by  antibodies  against  the  CYP3A subfamily  or  control  immunoglobulin  G.  The  formation  of  16-  αhydroxyprednisolone  and  6  βhydroxybudesonide from budesonide is catalysed by isoenzymes within the CYP3A subfamily.

## Elimination

## Salmeterol

The major metabolite, alpha-hydroxysalmeterol, is predominantly eliminated in the faeces. It has been demonstrated  that  57.4%  of  administered  radioactivity  is  recovered  in  the  faeces  and  23%  in  the urine;  most  is  recovered  between  24  and  72  hours  after  administration.  Unchanged  salmeterol accounts for &lt;5 % of the excreted dose in the urine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Budesonide

The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4L/min vs 1.0L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was  independent  of  dose.  Budesonide  was  excreted  in  urine  and  feces  in  the  form  of  metabolites. Approximately  60% of  an  intravenous  radiolabeled  dose  was  recovered  in  the  urine.  No  unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine.

## Special populations

## Salmeterol

## Pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic and renal failure

Since salmeterol is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, liver function impairment may lead to accumulation of salmeterol in plasma. Patients with hepatic impairment receiving the drug should be closely monitored.

Unfortunately the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol base have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

Similarly, information on the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol base in patients with renal dysfunction is limited. Following oral administration of a 500 μg (225 μg of 1-Hydroxy, 2-naphtoic acid) single dose of salmeterol xinafoate, AUC, t halfβ and total CLP were 11.4mg*h/L, 30 days and 10.8ml/h respectively, in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  The  same pharmacokinetic parameters were 4.4mg*h/L, 15 days and 18.6ml/h, respectively, in healthy volunteers. Plasma Cmax however, was lower in patients with impaired renal function than in healthy individuals.

## Pharmacokinetics in elderly patients

To our knowledge the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol base have not been studied in elderly patients to date.  Furthermore,  no  particular  contraindication  is  suggested  in  the  SmPC  of  the  Serevent  Diskus which states that 'there is no need to adjust the dose of salmeterol in elderly patient'.

## Budesonide

## Pharmacokinetics in hepatic and renal failure

Compromised liver function may decrease the rate of glucocorticosteroid elimination.

Hepatic impairment increased the systematic availability of budesonide 2-fold after oral ingestion in adults  with  cirrhosis.  However,  after  intravenous  administration,  the  pharmacokinetic  of  budesonide was similar in patients with cirrhosis and healthy adults.

## Pharmacokinetics in elderly patients

No differences in the pharmacokinetics of budesonide inhalation suspension related to race, gender, or advanced-age have been identified.

A  subanalysis  of  the  Symbicort  Maintenance  and  Reliever  Therapy  (EuroSMART)  showed  that budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy is effective and safe for elderly patients with asthma who are symptomatic despite daily use of ICS with or without LABAs.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## Salmeterol

When administered concurrently, inhaled glucocorticoids and cromolyn sodium did not alter the safety profile of salmeterol oral inhalation.

The effect of salmeterol on the vascular system may be potentiated in patients receiving concomitant therapy with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.

Since  the  therapeutic  dose  of  salmeterol  is  very  low,  it  is  unlikely  that  any  clinically  relevant interactions will be observed as a consequence of the coadministration of salmeterol and other drugs, such as fluticasone propionate, that are metabolised by CYP3A.

## Budesonide

Ketoconazole  has  been  found  to  bind  to  the  glucocorticoid  receptor  and  thereby  to  function  as  a glucocorticoid antagonist in cultured cell preparations.  By that mechanism ketoconazole may reduce the pharmacological effect of budesonide.

When budesonide (10 μM) was incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of compounds known  to  interact  with  different  isoforms  and  subfamilies  of  CYP,  ketonazole  was  found  to  be  the strongest inhibitor of budesonide metabolism (IC50: approximately 0.1 μM) followed by troleandomycin (IC50: approximately 0.1 μM), erythromycin, and cyclosporin, all substances known to interact with CYP3A  isoenzymes. Substances known  to interact with CYP2C  (sulfophenazole, mephetynoin, and tolbutalide) and with CYP2D6 (bufuralol and quinidine) did not specifically inhibit the metabolism of budesonide.

Furthermore,  the  proposed  SmPC  of  the  new  Budesonide/Salmeterol  fixed-dose  combination  states that the concomitant use of inhibitors of these CYP3A isoenzymes, e.g. ketoconazole and itraconazole, can increase systemic exposure to budesonide and are therefore not recommended.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

Although both salmeterol and budesonide are primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, the low doses and low plasma  concentrations  make  it  is  unlikely  that  any  clinically  relevant  ginteractions  following  coadministration of salmeterol or budesonide occur. Nevertheless, a pharmacokinetic study following a single  dose  administration  of  the  budesonide/salmeterol  FDC,  study  SMB-BUSAL-SD101,    was performed to assess whether any interaction occurs between the active ingredients of the combination versus each substance taken alone and versus the co-administration of both substances administered with  the  same  pharmaceutical  formulation  and  the  same  inhaler  device.  Inhouse  Laboratoire  SMB Budesonide 300 µg and SMB Salmeterol 25 µg products were used and compared to Labazenit 300/25.

This study was a comparative, single dose, 4-treatment, 4-period, 4-sequence, randomised, crossover study,  with  at  least  3  days  wash-out  in  40  healthy  volunteers  following  2  puffs  of  each  product (2x300/25, 2x300, 2x25, 2x(300+25).

Venous blood samples were collected at day 1: at -00:35 for pre-dose sample and at the following timepoints: 00:10, 00:20, 00:30, 00:45, 01:00, 01:15, 01:30, 02:00, 02:30, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00, 06:00, 08:00, 12:00 and 24:00 hours post-dose.

This study was conducted in Belgoium in 2010.

The  results  are  summarised  in  the  table  below.  The  results  showed  that  there  is  no  evidence  of pharmacokinetic interaction  between  budesonide  and  salmeterol  and  there  is  no  difference  between budesonide and salmeterol administered separately together and Labazenit 300/25µg FDC.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

## Salmeterol

β2-Adrenergic agonists produce their effects through interaction with specific β2-adrenergic receptors present  in  high  concentration  in  lung  tissue.  All  β2-agonists  exert  their  biological  and  therapeutic effects  through  cell-surface  β2-adrenoceptors,  which  are  members  of  the  7-transmembrane,  Gprotein-coupled receptor family. The major adverse effects of β-adrenergic agonists occur as a result of excessive activation of β-adrenergic receptors.

Salmeterol  is  a  selective  long-acting  β2-adrenoceptor  agonist  with  a  long  side  chain  that  reversibly binds to an active site on the β2-receptor and irreversibly to the exosite of the receptor. In vitro and in vivo  pharmacologic  studies  indicate  that  the  selectivity  of  salmeterol  for  β2-  versus  β1-adrenergic receptors is greater than that of other β-adrenergic agonists.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Salmeterol results from a modification of salbutamol to obtain a drug with much greater affinity for its receptors which translates in increased exoreceptor binding and a prolonged action (12 hours). The following  figures  show  a  chemical  structure  of  salmeterol  and  salbutamol  a  close  member  of the  βadrenoceptors family.

## Budesonide

Budesonide is a non-halogenated glucocorticosteroid structurally related to 16α- hydroxyprednisolone that possesses a strong local anti-inflammatory action, with a lower incidence and severity of adverse effects than those seen with oral corticosteroids.

Corticosteroids modulate the action of numerous inter- and intracellular mediators and influence the transcription  of  target  genes  that  regulate  the  production  of  cytokines,  receptors,  and  enzymes. Budesonide  inhibits  multiple  airway  inflammatory  cells  involved  in  the  asthma  response.  After therapeutic  use  of  orally  inhaled  budesonide  delivered  via  dry  powder  inhaler,  improvement  in  lung function has been shown to occur within 2 days of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved after up to 4 weeks.

The pharmacodynamic properties of glucocorticosteroids can be described by the binding of the drug to its  glucocorticoid  receptor.  Glucocorticoid  receptors are  very  widely  distributed  outside the  lungs,  so systemic  side  effects  on  bone,  growth,  skin,  skeletal  muscles,  and  blood  vessels  are  common;  this provides the rationale for  the  use  of  inhaled  glucocorticosteroids  to  reduce  systemic  exposure.  Also budesonide possesses a good degree of topical potency (local anti-inflammatory activity) compared to systemic effects as discussed below.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Salmeterol

## Bronchodilating effect

The  principal  action  of  β2-agonists  is  to  relax  airway  smooth  muscle  by  stimulating  β2-  adrenergic receptors. This increases the intracellular messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that is responsible  for  the  control  of  smooth  muscle  tone.  Thus,  activation  of  the  β2-adrenergic  receptor results directly in bronchodilation. β2-agonists interact with β2 receptors (β2R) to activate coupling of the  stimulatory  G  protein  (Gs)  with  adenylcyclase  (AC).  This  leads  to  enhanced  production  of  cAMP which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and results in smooth muscle relaxation. β2-adrenergic receptor agonists  may  also  attenuate  cholinergic  neurotransmission  due  to  stimulation  of  β2-adrenergic receptors on parasympathetic ganglia.

Salmeterol produces a longer duration of bronchodilation, lasting for at least 12 hours, than equipotent doses of a conventional short-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist such as salbutamol with no differences in cardiovascular effect or skeletal muscle tremor. This represents a therapeutic advantage compared to salbutamol, particularly in patients with nocturnal asthma.

The  delayed  onset  and  prolonged  duration  of  action  of  salmeterol  may  result  from  its  slow  cellular uptake and/or membrane translocation to the β2 receptor, lipophilicity, and protracted binding at the β2 receptor. Other groups suggest that the sustaining bronchodilating effect of salmeterol is related to slow dissociation from the receptor or to the turnover of the occupied β2-adrenergic receptor protein. The long duration of action of salmeterol may be of value in the treatment of asthma, particularly in those patients with nocturnal symptoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Anti-inflammatory effect

In  addition  to  its  bronchial  smooth  muscle  relaxation,  salmeterol  inhibits  the  release  of  proinflammatory mediators including histamine, leukotrienes C4 and D4, and prostaglandin D2 associated with early phase inflammatory response to allergen challenge in human lung tissue and may thereby attenuate early-and late phase associated bronchoconstriction as observed in asthma.

## Systemic effect

It has been demonstrated that the systemic effects of salmeterol are more likely to occur with higher doses,  which  lead  to  approximately  proportionally  increase  blood  concentrations  (Cazzola  M  et  al., 2002). Some of the major adverse effects of β- adrenergic agonists in the treatment of asthma are caused  by  stimulation  of  β-adrenergic  receptors  in  the  heart.  The  coexistence  of  β1  and  β2adrenoceptors in the heart clearly indicates that β2-agonists do have some effect on the heart, even when they are highly selective. It should also be taken into account that the β2-agonists utilised in clinical  practice  have  differing  selectivities  and  potencies.  However  at  the  recommended  doses  of salmeterol, systemic concentrations are low or even undetectable.

## Effect on lung function

Salmeterol demonstrated significant improvement in lung function. A review by Tashkin DP and Fabbri LM (2010) found that improvements in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ranged from 50-90 mL compared with placebo.

Those improvements in lung function were sustained in studies of 3 months to 3 years' duration when twice-daily  LABAs  were  used  as  maintenance  therapy.  In  the  same  review  some  studies  suggested there may be a decline in bronchodilator efficacy over time with salmeterol as with salbutamol; over 6 months, significant declines in peak forced vital capacity (FVC) relative to placebo (-83 mL, p &lt; 0.05), but not FEV1 (-12 mL), were observed with salmeterol. Other studies have also suggested a partial loss of bronchodilator efficacy of formoterol over time.

## Budesonide

## Topical and systemic glucocorticoid activity

In  animals  budesonide  has  a  high  ratio  of  topical  to  systematic  activity  compared  with  5  reference corticosteroids including beclomethasone dipropionate, flunisolide and triamcinolone acetonide. Similar observation is made in human, where budesonide is shown to have 1.6 to 3 times greater local antiinflammatory activity using a skin vasoconstriction assay, and between 2 and 4 times less systemic activity than beclomethasone dipropionate.

Trials  in  patients  with  asthma  have  not  revealed  any  significant  differences  between  conventional doses of budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate.

The systemic glucocorticoid activity of budesonide, as determined by changes in plasma cortisol and total  or  differential  white  blood  cell  count  in  healthy  volunteers,  was  2-4  times  less  than  that  of beclomethasone  dipropionate  following  oral  administration,  and  it  was  also  significantly  less  active after inhalation.

## Effect on haematological parameters

Systemic prednisolone produces an increase in blood neutrophils and a decrease in blood basophils, eosinophils  and  lymphocytes  within  4-8  hours  of  intravenous  administration  to  healthy  volunteers. These effects have generally returned to, or are returning to normal within 24 hours, and a similar transient lymphopenia has been noted following oral administration of prednisone to steroid-dependent asthmatic patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Likewise  in  healthy  patients,  single  doses  (200,  800  and  3200  μg)  of  inhaled  budesonide  and beclomethasone dipropionate decreased the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils and increased the number  of  neutrophils  without  significantly  affecting  the  number  of  monocytes.  When  given  orally, beclomethasone had a significantly greater effect on the white cell response than did budesonide.

However, in contrast to these findings in volunteers, treatment with aerosol budesonide (200 μg twice daily)  for  4  weeks  did  not  significantly  alter  any  of  the  haematological  parameters  measured  in patients with chronic asthma.

## Effect on adrenal function

The potential for systemic effects of inhaled glucocorticosteroids is often evaluated using measurements  of  adrenal  function.  The  two  most  sensitive  methods  involve  the  measurement  of plasma cortisol concentrations at regular intervals over 20 to 24h or of free urinary cortisol over 24h. In  practice,  usual  doses  of  inhaled  or  intranasal  budesonide  have  caused  only  minimal  changes  in hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal  (HPA)  function,  although  a  dose  response  relationship  with  plasma cortisol  concentrations  have  been  documented.  When  inhaled  therapy  was  substituted  for  oral prednisolone  there  was  a  gradual  increase  in  plasma  cortisol  concentrations,  highlighting  the  lower adrenal suppressive activity of budesonide compared with oral steroid. Literature data in most studies performed in patients with asthma show that suppression of the HPA axis did not occur as long as doses did not exceed 800 μg of budesonide twice daily.

## Effect on antigen induced reactions

It has been noted that as long as pre-treatment was sufficiently long, inhaled budesonide inhibits both the immediate and late reactions provoked by bronchial allergen challenge.

Similarly, intranasal budesonide inhibits the type 1-mediated immediate nasal reaction and this may be related to suppression of histamine release in nasal biopsy sample in vitro.

## Effect on bronchial and nasal mucosa

Long term application of potent topical corticosteroid on the skin may cause dermal atrophy and the question  arises  whether  similar  changes  occur  in  respiratory  mucosa  following  prolonged  aerosol  or intranasal administration of these substances. Following intranasal administration of budesonide for up to  1  year  in  patients  with  rhinitis,  no  adverse  morphological  changes  in  the  nasal  mucosa  such  as metaplasia  or  atrophy  occurred.  There  is  only  little  data  on  the  histological  characteristics  of  the bronchial mucosa after inhaled budesonide in asthma patients. In a prospective study, measurement of a  9.00  a.m.  basal  serum  cortisol  and  biopsies  of  the  inferior  turbinate  mucosa  were  taken  from  40 patients using topical nasal corticosteroid (budesonide) continuously for months or years. No systemic adverse effects and no histopathological changes of significance were found. The authors concluded that these findings do not suggest that topically corticosteroids are harmful to the nasal mucosa and do not produce systemic effects. It should be noted that during the three repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in rat and dog with the salmeterol-budesonide combination, a thorough examination of the respiratory  tract  was  performed  and  did  not  reveal  any  particularity  with  the  exception  of  slight inflammatory signs occasionally seen in the respiratory tract but not considered of importance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute dose-response studies

Inhaled budesonide has been shown to offer an effective alternative to oral ICS in the management of asthma  and  rhinitis.  In  studies  performed  by  the  Applicant  with  ICS  (study  BUSAL-III-02-1),  no significant  dose-response  relationship  was  observed,  which  in  agreement  with  recent  report  (GINA, 2010). However in a much earlier study comparing 3 doses of inhaled budesonide (100, 400 and 1600 μg) with oral budesonide (1600 μg) and oral prednisolone (40 mg) over a 12-hour period, all inhaled doses of budesonide produced a significantly greater increase in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) than did oral budesonide and when the areas under the PEFR times curves (AUCs) were calculated, a doseresponse relationship was established.

## Salmeterol/budesonide

An  evaluation  of  the  systemic  effects  on  the  HPA  axis  by  the  course  of  plasma  cortisol  and  urine cortisol was performed as required in the OIP guideline (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 rev.1).

## Study BUSAL II-10-2

This study was a Phase II , randomized, partially-blinded, cross over study to evaluate the systemic effect  of  two  doses  of  the  SMB  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  DPI  FIXEDDOSE  combination  capsule (300/25 µg BID AND 150/25 µg BID) delivered by the Axahaler versus Pulmicort Turbuhaler 400 µg BID + Serevent Diskus 50 µg BID versus PLACEBO in mild persistent asthmatic patients.

## Methods

## Design

BUSAL II-10-2 is randomized, cross-over, partially-blinded study. Patients received each treatment for 10 days separated by wash-out periods of at least 21 days.

In order to reach the steady state of the ICS systemic effects, the study treatments were administered during 10 days for each period. Maximal cortisol suppression occurs after 7 days of glucocorticosteroids treatment.

The duration of the wash-out period is based on the studies published in the literature.

All patients were from one Bulgarian centre, included between October 2010 and November 2010.

## Objectives

The study's objectives were the following:

- To compare the systemic effect of two doses of SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol DPI capsule (300/25 µg BID and 150/25 µg BID) versus Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg BID + Serevent Diskus 50 µg BID versus placebo by the measurement of 24-hour plasma and urinary cortisol.

- To assess and compare the safety of the tests versus reference products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study participants

Male and female patients 18 to 70 years old, with a diagnosis of mild persistent asthma for a minimum of  3  months  with  FEV1  &lt;80%  predicted,  at  least  12%  and  200  ml  FEV1  reversibility  to  4  puffs  of Salbutamol 100 µg were recruited in the study. Patients should be corticosteroid naïve and should not have received oral, parenteral or inhaled steroids in the preceding 3 months.

The study was performed in mild persistent asthmatic corticosteroid naïve patients as they have to sustain a withdrawal of inhaled glucocorticosteroids during the run-in and wash-out periods.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint:

Change from baseline in the area under the  curve (AUC) of 24-hour plasma cortisol (mean change from baseline to day 11 of each period).

Plasma cortisol was collected over 24 hours on the 1st day (before administration of the study drug) and on the 11th day of each of the 4 periods.  Blood  were  collected over  24  hours  at  8h00,  9h00, 10h00, 12h00, 14h00, 16h00, 18h00, 20h00, 22h00, 24h00, 2h00, 4h00, 6h00, 7h00 and 8h00.

Other safety parameters:

- -Change from baseline in the Cmax of 24-hour plasma cortisol (mean change from baseline to day 11 of each period)
- -Change from baseline in the concentration of urinary cortisol over 24 hours (mean change from baseline to day 11 of each period), collected over 24 hours
- -Adverse events (including asthma exacerbations)
- -Physical examination
- -Vital signs
- -Laboratory data
- -12-lead ECG data
- -Withdrawals or drop-out rate

## Statistical methods

## PRIMARY OUTCOME

The null hypothesis was that Labazenit 300/25 µg BID and Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg BID + with SereventDiskus 50 µg BID were not equivalent regarding the decrease in the 24-hour AUC of plasma cortisol after a 10-day treatment. If the difference in the decrease of 24-hour AUC of plasma cortisol between Labazenit 300/25 µg BID and Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg BID + with Serevent Diskus 50 µg BID was included in the range [-20%; + 20%] the two drugs were to be considered as equivalent regarding their impact of the 24-hour AUC of plasma cortisol.

AUC0-24h values were calculated using the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration using the actual recorded  collection  times.  A  mixed  model  with  treatment,  period  and  predosing  baseline  as  fixed effects and patient as random effect was built. No interaction terms was added in the model. The carry over effect was not tested given that the wash out time between each treatment period was 21 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Contrasts were calculated between each treatment:

- Labazenit 300/25 µg vs. Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg + with Serevent Diskus 50 µg
- Labazenit 150/25 µg vs. Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg + with Serevent Diskus 50 µg
- Labazenit 300/25 µg vs. placebo
- Labazenit 150/25 µg vs. placebo
- Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg + with Serevent Diskus 50 µg vs. placebo
- Labazenit 300/25 µg vs. Labazenit 150/25 µg

Tests were two-sided. The global α risk was set at 0.05. To deal with the inflation of the risk due to multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni inequality was applied to adjust the α risk which was therefore reduced  to  0.0085  for  each  of  the  6  pair-wise  comparisons.  Pair-wise  differences  along  with  the 99.15% confidence interval were computed with the 'estimate' function of the SAS mixed procedure. For  the  main  analysis  the  limit  of  the  99.15%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  compared  to  the equivalence margins, concluding to equivalence if the bounds of the CI were included in the interval [20%; +20%]. For secondary analyses of the main criterion, comparisons were computed the same way for descriptive purposes.

## Results

## Participant flow

49 patients were screened and 40 patients randomised.

Safety analysis set: all randomized patients who used the trial medication at least once were included in the safety analysis set: 40 patients in all groups

Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set: all randomized patients who used the trial medication at least once and who had a value of 24-hour plasma cortisol both at baseline and at day 11 for at least one period were included in the ITT analysis set: In Labazenit 300/25 µg 39 patients, in Labazenit 150/25 µg 39 patients, in placebo 38 patients and in Pulmicort Turbohaler + Serevent Diskus 39 patients.

Per protocol (PP) analysis set: all  patients  were included in the PP analysis set who were in the ITT analysis set and were not major protocol violators. In the PP subset, 2 patients were excluded from the analysis in the Labazenit 150/25 µg group and 1 patient was excluded in the placebo group.

Major protocol violations were no treatment dispensation on period 2.

## Baseline data

Patients,  all  Caucasians,  were  aged  46.02±12.88  years,  61.22%  of  women  and  38.78%  of  men. Patients  were  suffering  from  mild  persistent  asthma  for  4.4±7.0  years.  Mean  FEV1  was  2.55±0.58 L/sec  i.e.  83.80±2.89  %  of  predicted.  FEV1  reversibility  was  0.64±0.31  L  i.e.  25.08±9.33%  after inhalation of 4*100 µg salbutamol.

## Outcomes and estimations

Primary endpoint: Mean change from baseline in AUC0-24h for plasma cortisol

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All active treatments led to a decrease in the mean change from baseline to day 11 in the AUC of 24hour plasma cortisol (see table below):

- Labazenit 300/25 µg: -13.67±3.05 % (Lsmeans±SE)
- Labazenit 150/25 µg: -6.49±3.09 % (Lsmeans±SE)
- Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg and Serevent Diskus 50 µg: -7.45±3.09 % (Lsmeans±SE).

* Missing values correspond to patient #34 who had no available values of plasma cortisol at D1 for the period under Pulmicort+Serevent

** Missing values correspond to patient #21 who had too many missing values of plasma cortisol at D1 to allow the calculation of a relevant AUC for the period under Labazenit 150/25 μg.

A  higher  decrease  was  observed  with  Labazenit  300/25  µg  leading  to  a  significant  decrease  from baseline to D11 when compared to placebo (p=0.0001). The comparison to placebo was not significant for the other treatments.

When  comparing  the  active  treatments  together,  Labazenit  300/25  µg  and  Labazenit  150/25  µg showed to be both equivalent to the association of Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg and Serevent Diskus 50 µg. Effect sizes were respectively -6.22±4.14 % (p=0.14) with a 99.15% confidence interval (CI) of [-17.31% ; 4.87%] included in the [-20% ; +20%] equivalence margin defined in the protocol for Labazenit  300/25  µg  and  0.95±4.16%  (p=0.82)  with  a  CI  of  [-10.21%  ;  12.11%]  for  Labazenit 150/25 µg.

Moreover, Labazenit 300/25 µg and Labazenit 150/25 µg were equivalent in decreasing the AUC of 24hour plasma cortisol (effect size -7.17±4.14%, CI [-18.29%; 3.94%]) (see table below).

Only the Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg+ Serevent Diskus µg treatment led to a decrease in the relative change versus baseline (-16.48±9.51 %  (Lsmeans±SE)). This change was nevertheless not statistically  significant  (p=0.0125)  when  compared  to  the  0.0085  threshold  due  to  the  multiple comparisons.

Pair-wise comparisons of the treatments did not show any statistical difference between:

- Labazenit 300/25 µg (and 150/25 µg) and Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg+ SereventDiskus 50 µg,
- Labazenit 300/25 µg (and 150/25 µg) and the placebo treatment,
- Labazenit 300/25 µg and Labazenit 150/25 µg.

## Secondary outcome: Mean change from baseline in Cmax for plasma cortisol

Cmax for  plasma  cortisol  did  not  significantly  evolve  from  baseline  to  D11  in  any  treatment  group during the study. There was no difference on relative changes between groups.

## Conclusion

24-hour AUC for plasma cortisol remained stable in the placebo group while it decreased in all active treatment  groups.  Effect  size  was  significant  for  Labazenit  300/25  µg  (p=0.0001).  Equivalence  in cortisol  suppression  has  been  demonstrated  between  all  active  treatments:  the  99.15%  CI  was included  in  the  [-20%;+20%]  equivalence  margin  defined  in  the  protocol  for  all  three  pair-wise comparisons. Equivalence was also demonstrated between the two doses of Labazenit (300/25 µg and 150/25 µg). 24-hour urinary cortisol decreased with Pulmicort Turbohaler 40 µg+Serevent Diskus 50 µg only but without reaching significance (p=0.0125) when compared to the 0.0085 threshold due to the multiple comparisons. Based on the evaluation of 24-hour urinary cortisol, no significant difference has been observed. Cortisol Cmax at D11 was unchanged in all groups when compared to baseline. All these results were confirmed by the PP analysis.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

Labazenit is a new fixed combination of salmeterol/budesonide. As the fine particle dose (FPD) fraction is higher for Labazenit a lower nominal dose in both active ingredients is used than in the reference monotherapies  Pulmicort  and  Serevent  Diskus  to  obtain  a  similar  lung  deposition  of  each  active ingredient.  The  Applicant  conducted  in  total  7  pharmacokinetics  study  to  evaluate  the  potential interaction between salmeterol and budesonide and to demonstrate the same anti-inflammatory effect of  budesonide with Labazenit as with the reference product by establishing comparable exposure of budesonide  following inhalation with Labazenit or Pulmicort/Symbicort. Support  for  the  same bronchodilation effect of salmeterol in Labazenit as with Serevent was established in a phase II study (discussed under section Main studies).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analytical methods

Concentrations  of  budesonide  (epimers  A  and  B)  and  salmeterol  in  human  plasma  were  measured using LC/MS/MS methods. The method was 4 times optimised but the LLOQ levels for the budesonide enantiomers  22.5-50  pg/ml  and  15  pg/ml  for  salmeterol  remained  relatively  high  compared  to  the plasma  concentrations  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol.  For  Labazenit  150/25  µg  strength,  Cmax  for budesonide  and  salmeterol  were  less  than  10x  the  LLOQ.  Therefore,  AUC  levels  could  not  be determined  accurately  for  budesonide  and  salmeterol  when  Labazenit  or  the  respectively  reference products  were  administered  at  the  lowest  therapeutic  dose.  Therefore,  no  reliable  comparison  of bioavailability between test and reference product could be made for the lowest strength.

There were some irregularities observed with the pharmacokinetic analysis.  Subjects were excluded from PK and/or statistical analysis seemingly arbitrarily. Criteria for exclusion of subjects from PK or statistical analysis were not defined in the protocol and not  adequately discussed in study reports. In addition, in the mulitple dose studies Cmin plasma concentrations&lt; LLOQ were calculated as being at the level of LLOQ.

## In vitro comparison of Labazenit with reference products and between Labazenit strengths

Because of higher lung deposition of fine particle dose with the use of a patented 75/25 mixture of lactose anhydrate (main carrier) and lactose monohydrate (carrier of small particles) in the formulation and because of the lower airflow resistance of the inhaler device Axahaler compared to the Diskus and Turbohaler  devices  (used  for  the  reference  products  Serevent  and  Pulmicort),  lower  doses  of salmeterol  and  budesonide  were  used  in  Labazenit.  Development  studies  with  the  multistage  liquid impinger demonstrated that Labazenit 25 µg salmeterol and 150 µg budesonide has a comparable fine particle dose deposition as 50 µg salmeterol of the reference product Serevent Diskus and as 200 µg budesonide of the reference product Pulmicort Turbohaler. However, the extent of the in-vitro data was considered too limited to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence by the CHMP.

The  Applicant with their responses  to the D120  LOQ  argued  that  the  mean  ratio  for  FPD (test/reference) was of 0.95 with 90% confidence interval of 0.89-1.02. Furthermore, the mean ratio and 90% CI was calculated for each size range for the five following groups : &lt;2 μm, 2-3 μm, 3-4 μm, 4-5 μm and &gt; 5 μm and the results obtained support the overall similarity between the test and the reference products. Moreover, the influence of the inhalation airflow on the FPD of budesonide from Labazenit  has  been  assessed  and  compared  to  the  influence  of  airflow  on  FPD  observed  with  the reference product. Globally,  Labazenit  shows  a  more  reproducible  FPD  than  TURBOHALER  when the airflow is sub-optimal (60 to 80% of optimal airflow). In addition, the Applicant argued that a complete in-vitro  comparison has been performed to definitely establish the dose linearity of the particle size distribution profile of budesonide from Labazenit 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg. The dose proportionality of budesonide  in-vitro  was  demonstrated  since  the  mean  ratio  for  the  FPD  between  both  dosage strengths  (corrected  for  the  dose)  is  of  0.89  with  a  90%  CI  of  0.84-0.93.  The  comparison  of  each particle  size  range,  from  the  impactor  (as  described  above)  confirms  this  linearity  of  budesonide between  Labazenit  150/25  μg  and  Labazenit  300/25μg.  Furthermore,  as  expected,  the  deposition profile of salmeterol is the same for Labazenit 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP concluded that the in vitro comparisons of Labazenit with the reference products and with the two strengths of Labazenit have been adequately performed by the Applicant in line with the OIP Guideline  (CHMP/EWP/4151/00/rev.  1)  and  the  method  described  in  the  Ph  Eur  Monograph.  As explained  above  the  two  Labazenit  strenghts  contain  less  active  substance  to  achieve  fine  particle doses comparable to the comparator products (salmeterol 25 µg versus 50 µg and budesonide 150 µg versus  200  µg).  Except  for  the  group  &lt;  2  µm,  distribution  of  salmeterol  fine  particles  is  similar  at 100% and 80% of optimal flow between test and reference product. The distribution of budesonide fine particles of the proposed product does not comply with the reference product at any flow. Except for the group &lt;2 µm, the distribution of budesonide fine particles is dose proportional for both product strengths (150 µg versus 300 µg). The distribution of salmeterol fine particles is equivalent for both product strengths.

## Bioavailability studies

In  studies  SMB-Busal-SS032 and SMB-Busal-SD033 not all PK parameters for budesonide fell within the 80-125% norm for comparison of Labazenit 300/25 µg with Pulmicort Turbohaler 2x200 µg but point estimate of all parameters were close to unity: at steady-state ratio and 90% CI for AUC τ was 0.94 (0.79-1.12) and for Cmax 1.02 (0.90-1.15). Following single dose administration the variability of the systemic absorption after inhalation was high resulting in wide 90% confidence intervals AUCt 1.08 (0.87-1.33)  and  Cmax  1.16  (0.94-1.42).  These  results  indicate  that  the  systemic  exposure  to budesonide  is  comparable  after  single  dose  and  multiple  dose  inhalation  of  the  reference  product Pulmicort  Turbohaler  2x200 μg and the new Labazenit 300/25 µg combination.  However, in studies SMB-Busal-SS032 (and also in study SMB-Busal-SS071), LLOQ values were reported as Cmin when plasma concentrations were below the LLOQ which is not acceptable.

In the multiple dose study SMB-Busal-SS071 the bioavailability of budesonide was almost 2-fold higher for Labazenit 150/25µg than for the combination of Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200µg+ Serevent Diskus. It should be noted that LLOQ for budesonide was ~40-50 pg/ml and as a result almost all samples were below  LLOQ  4-6  hours  after  inhalation.  The  difference  can  not  be  explained  by  a  difference  in  FPD between the 2 products. The Applicant discussed that the difference may be due to the Turbuhaler being  a  reservoir  based  device.  If  the  delivery  of  one  dose  is  not  complete,  the  following  dose  will deliver more drug than scheduled. This may have contributed to a lower exposure following inhalation with the Turbuhaler. On the other hand the exposure following Labazenit 150/25 µg seemed higher compared to other studies. For epimer B, two subjects were not included in the analysis because for one subject all plasma concentrations were&lt;LLOQ and the other subject had only two samples&gt; LLOQ. For epimer A, one subject was included who had only one sample&gt; LLOQ, this subject had sufficient samples of epimer B values&gt; LLOQ.

Active charcoal to block the gastrointestinal absorption has not been used in the comparison between Labazenit  with  Pulmicort.  The  Applicant  justified  this  by  the  low  ±10%  (Clissold  et  al.,  1984)  oral bioavailability  of  budesonide.  Indeed,  comparison  of  availability  with/without  charcoal  following inhalation with the Turbuhaler, indicated that intestinal absorption of budesonide contributed ~15% to the systemic availability after inhalation. As the initial budesonide plasma concentrations are mainly due to absorption through the lung and no remarkable differences were observed in plasma ct curves between Labazenit and Pulmicort, no additional studies with charcoal are required.

In study SMB-Busal-SS032, no analysis for salmeterol was made because many of the plasma levels of salmeterol were below LLOQ and the full characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile including 5 points  in  the  absorption  phase  and  5  points  in  the  elimination  phase  was  not  possible  for  most subjects. It is unfortunate that in study SMB-Busal-SS071 a single puff was administered of test and reference  products  while  knowing  that  salmeterol  and  budesonide  evaluation  was  limited  by  the analytical method.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, results from studies SMB-Busal SS032 and SMB-Busal-SD033 suggest that the systemic exposure  to  budesonide  is  comparable  following  inhalation  of  the  reference  product  Pulmicort Turbohaler 2x200 µg and the new combination Labazenit 300/25 µg.

For salmeterol, no comparative data are available as the LLOQ of the analytical method was not low enough to estimate systemic exposure reliably. Instead, the Applicant aimed to show equivalence of the salmeterol compound  of  the  new  fixed  dose  combination  based  on  in-vitro studies  and bronchodilating studies.

## Bioequivalence studies

In study SMB-BUSAL-DP102, FPD of salmeterol were comparable for batches of Labazenit 300/25 µg and 125/25 µg: 13.4 and 13.1 µg, respectively, whereas the FPD for budesonide was relatively higher for  the  300/25  µg    strength  143  µg  vs  57.5  µg  for  the  125/25  µg  strength.  Although  the  precise relation between FPD and PK is not well-defined, the difference in FPD of the batches was reflected in the pharmacokinetics of budesonide and salmeterol. Salmeterol pharmacokinetics was comparable for the 300/25 µg and the 150/25 µg strengths whereas the budesonide exposure was relatively higher in the 300/25 µg strength compared to the 150/25 µg strength. Taking into account the difference in FPD between  Labazenit  300/25  µg  and  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  considering  that  AUCt  may  be underestimated  for  Labazenit  150/25  µg  as  more  budesonide  plasma  concentrations  were  &lt;  LLOQ, there  is  no  indication  for  non-dose  proportionality.  This  is  also  supported  by  the  dose  proportional increase  in  Cmax  of  budesonide  in  study  SMB-BUSAL-SD033.  AUC values seemed to increase more than proportional in this study but this is probably due to the higher LLOQ of budesonide 40-50 pg/ml in this study resulting in an underestimation of AUC in the lower strength.

Budesonide exposure was considerably higher in study SMB-BUSAL-SD033 compared to SMB-BUSALDP102. This may be due to difference in population studied healthy volunteers vs asthmatic patients. In study SMB-Busal-DP102 intestinal absorption of budesonide was blocked by charcoal administration. However, as the difference in exposure was already apparent immediately following inhalation, it is unlikely  that  the  difference  in  exposure  is  due  to  intestinal  absorption  of  budesonide.  Moreover literature  data  indicate  that  oral  absorption  contributes  only  for  10-15%  to  the  overall  systemic exposure following inhalation. For the two strengths the quantity and quality of the excipients are the same, the active substances constituent &lt;5% of the formulation. The specifications of delivered dose and FPD are dose proportional and the flow rate dependency of both strengths is similar. Therefore, results obtained with Labazenit 300/25 µg can be extrapolated to Labazenit 150/25 µg.

In study SMB-BUSAL-SD111, charcoal was administered to evaluate the lung deposition of budesonide. The first sample was taken 10 min following inhalation and several subjects had Cmax of budesonide at the  first  time  point.  Although  the  addition  of  an  earlier  time  point  would  have  been  preferred  to determine  Cmax  more  optimally,  based  on  previous  studies  with  median  Tmax  of  10-20  min,  the determination of Cmax at 10 min is acceptable. The low budesonide plasma concentrations compared to the LLOQ may have contributed to the high variability in AUC determination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Budesonide lung deposition was 15-23% lower following Labazenit 150/25 µg compared to Symbicort 160/4.5 µg. Lung deposition is dependent on the FPD although the precise relation between FPD and PK is not well-defined, in general the higher the FPD fraction, the higher the lung deposition is for an orally  inhaled  product.  FPD  of  both  batches  were  within  the  acceptable  specification  range  of  the products but there was a more than 20% difference in FPD of the Labazenit batch (58.5 µg) and the Symbicort batch (76.4 µg) used in the PK study. When the PK parameters were corrected for FPD, the lung  deposition  of  Labazenit  and  Symbicort  was  comparable.  However  this  is  not  acceptable  as  the correction based on FPD was not pre-specified in the study protocol and adjustment/correction by FPD of  the  PK  parameters  cannot  be  accepted  unless  a  clear  in  vitro/in  vivo  correlation  has  been established.  The  test  and  reference  products  batches  should  be  as  similar  as  possible  in  all  their  in vitro parameters to avoid the need for correction by FPD.

In study BSM-BUSAL-SD121,  2  inhalations of Labazenit 150/25 and Serevent Diskus were administered to increase the salmeterol plasma concentration and the analytical method was modified to reduce the matrix effect. Here plasma concentrations of salmeterol could be adequately determined over  the  time  period  of  12  hours  and  salmeterol  plasma  concentrations  following  inhalation  of Labazenit  and  Serevent  Diskus  could  be  compared.  LLOQ  salmeterol  15  pg/ml.  PK  and  statistical evaluation were standard. Both test and reference products were acceptable, DD and FPD was within specification range of the products. Although the addition of an earlier time point than 10 min would have  been  preferred  to  determine  Cmax  more  optimally,  the  plasma  ct  curves  could  be  determine adequately. The bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of salmeterol is higher for Labazenit 150/25 μg than for Serevent Diskus 50 μg: point estimates are respectively 1.17 and 1. 31. Differences in FPD fraction of both products can not explain the difference in PK parameters of the two products.

Therefore based on the submitted studies, bioequivalence of budesonide between Labazenit and the comparator  Pulmicort  and  of  salmeterol  between  Labazenit  and  the  comparator  Serevent  have  not been demonstrated.

## ADME

Plasma protein binding is approximately 90% and the volume of distribution is 3 L/kg for budesonide. Budesonide  undergoes  an  extensive  degree  (approx.  90%)  of  biotransformation  on  first  passage through the liver to metabolites of low glucocorticosteroid activity. The glucocorticosteroid activity of the major metabolites, 6-beta-hydroxy-budesonide and 16-alfa-hydroxy-prednisolone, is less than 1% of  that  of  budesonide.  There  are  no  indications  of  any  metabolic  interactions  or  any  displacement reactions between salmeterol and budesonide.

Budesonide is eliminated via metabolism mainly catalysed by the enzyme CYP3A4. The metabolites of budesonide  are  eliminated  in  urine  as  such  or  in  conjugated  form.  Only  negligible  amounts  of unchanged budesonide have been detected in the urine. Budesonide has a  high systemic clearance (approximately  1.2 L/min)  and  the  plasma  elimination  half-life  after  intravenous  dosing  averages  4 hours.

Salmeterol  acts  locally  in  the  lung.  In  addition  there  are  only  limited  data  available  on  the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol because of the technical difficulty of assaying the active substance in plasma due to the very low plasma concentrations (approximately 200 pg/ml or less) achieved after inhaled dosing.

The  pharmacokinetics  of  budesonide  or  salmeterol  in  patients  with  renal  failure  is  unknown.  The exposure to budesonide and salmeterol may be increased in patients with liver disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interaction study

Study SMB-BUSAL-SD101 was conducted to assess whether any interaction occurs between the two active  substances  of  the  FDC  versus  each  substance  administered  alone  and  versus  both  active substances  administered  with  the  same  device.  In  house  SMB  salmeterol  and  SMB  budesonide products  were  used  in  order  to  be  able  to  use  the  same  inhaler  device  as  is  being  used  for  the Labazenit FDC. FPD for budesonide and salmeterol of the SMB in house products was comparable to the FPD of Labazenit 300/25 µg. The study design was in line with the guideline on fixed combination medicinal product (CHMP/EWP/240/95/Rev. 1).

As the first sample was taken 10 min following inhalation, almost all subjects had Cmax of salmeterol at  the  first  time  point.  As  a  result  Cmax  could  not  be  determined  accurately  but  time  course  of pharmacokinetics of salmeterol and budesonide could be determined sufficiently accurately. The first evaluation showed that there is no difference in pharmacokinetics of budesonide and salmeterol when administered separately compared to Labazenit 300/25 FDC. The latter evaluation showed that there is no difference when the two substances are administered together compared to after each other. These results indicate that there is no pharmacokinetic interaction between salmeterol and budesonide.

## Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism of action, primary and secondary pharmacology of both salmeterol and budesonide are well known.

As  required  in  the  OIP  guideline,  a  safety  pharmacodynamics  study,  study  BUSAL  II-10-2,  was conducted to evaluate the systemic effect on the HPA-axis by the course of plasma cortisol and urine cortisol in Labazenit DPI 300/25 µg BID and 150/25 µg BID compared to Pulmicort Turbuhaler 400 µg BID and Serevent Diskus 50 µg BID and compared to placebo in mild persistent asthmatic patients. The highest recommended dose was used. The primary endpoint considering, 24-hour AUC for plasma cortisol  remained  stable  in  the  placebo  group  while  it  decreased  in  all  active  treatment  groups. Labazenit 300/25 µg appeared to decrease serum cortisol (AUC0-12 h) more than Labazenit 150/25 µg and  Pulmicort  Turbohaler  400  µg+  Serevent  Diskus  50  µg.  However,  when  assessing  equivalence between  the  different  treatment  groups  cortisol  suppression  could  be  considered  being  equivalent because the 99.15% CI was included in the predefined [-20%;+20%] equivalence margin, which was supported by bibliographical data. The 24-hour urinary cortisol observations supported the finding of the primary endpoint.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The mechanism of action, primary and secondary pharmacology of both salmeterol and budesonide are well  known.  Evaluating  the  systemic effect  on  the HPA-axis  it  was  shown  that  the  24-hour  AUC  for plasma cortisol remained stable in the placebo group while it decreased in all active treatment groups. Labazenit 300/25 µg appeared to decrease serum cortisol (AUC0-12 h) more than Labazenit 150/25 µg and  the  active  comparator,  but  the  difference  is  within  the  predefined  equivalence  margins.  These findings  were  supported  by  the  24-hour  urinary  cortisol  observations.  Pharmacokinetic  data  and  in vitro data support the dose proportionality with respect to budesonide between Labazenit 300/25 μg and  Labazenit  150/25  μg.  The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  salmeterol  was  the  same  for  Labazenit 150/25  μg  and  300/25  μg  in  study  BUSAL-DP102.  The  absence  of  a  pharmacokinetic  interaction between budesonide and salmeterol was confirmed by results from study SMB-BUSAL-SD101.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In three pharmacokinetic studies budesonide exposure following inhalation of Labazenit was compared with  a  budesonide  active  comparator  (either  Pulmicort  or  Symbicort).  Two  studies  (SMB-BUSALSD032, SMB-BUSAL-SD033) showed point estimates for Cmax and AUC that were reasonably close to unity  but  the  individual  studies  did  not  formally  demonstrate  bioequivalence  for  both  parameters  of budesonide based on a 90% confidence interval of 80-125%. The third study (SMB-BUSAL- SD111) showed around 20% lower lung deposition for budesonide when comparing Labazenit with Pulmicort. The difference in Fine particle Dose (FPD) has potentially contributed to the differences observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters. By adjusting for FPD, the results fell within the bioequivalence margins. However this is not considered appropriate since the FPD correction was not pre-specified in the study protocol and such correction of the pharmacokinetic parameters cannot be accepted unless a clear in vitro/in vivo correlation has been established. Therefore the pharmacokinetic data do not sufficiently support  a  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  by  budesonide  between  Labazenit  and  the  antiinflammatory control of budesonide has to be established in the clinical studies.

The  pharmacokinetic  study  BUSAL-SD21  in  healthy  volunteers  showed  that  systemic  bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of salmeterol was higher following inhalation of Labazenit 150/25 µg compared to Serevent Diskus 50 µg (salmeterol). The higher systemic exposure to salmeterol did not result in more severe extra pulmonary side effects. Comparative efficacy and safety of salmeterol is to be established in the clinical studies.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

Two phase II  studies  and  four  phase  III  studies  were  submitted  to  provide  evidence  regarding  the efficacy and safety. The aim of the clinical development program to support the two claimed indications (step up and substitution) was the following:

- To demonstrate a higher efficacy of Labazenit compared with budesonide monotherapy (stepup indication)
- To  demonstrate  similar  efficacy  and  safety  of  salmeterol  in  Labazenit  as  compared  with  the reference salmeterol product (substitution indication)
- To demonstrate similar efficacy and safety of budesonide in Labazenit as compared with the reference budesonide product (substitution indication)
- To demonstrate a dose response between the two strengths of Labazenit
- To compare the efficacy and safety of Labazenit with other FDC of an ICS and a LABA

## 2.5.1. Dose response studies

No dose responses study has been performed and this is justified since the efficacy for both substances is well established.

## 2.5.2. Main studies

## Demonstration of the bronchodilation effect of salmeterol

The Applicant conducted two phase II bronchodilation studies (BUSAL II-03-1 and BUSAL II-10-1) after single dose. These two phase II studies intend to provide evidence for efficacy and safety with respect to the salmeterol component.

## Study BUSAL-II-10-1

This study was a randomized, single dose, cross-over, partially blinded study to compare the efficacy of a fixed-dose combination of budesonide-salmeterol DPI capsule 150/25 µg, budesonide-salmeterol DPI capsule 150/12.5 µg, budesonide-salmeterol dpi capsule 150/6.25 µg delivered by the Axahaler versus Serevent Diskus 50 µg, versus Serevent Evohaler 25 µg, versus Serevent Evohaler 25 µg (2 doses) in moderate to severe persistent asthmatic patients.

Patients  were treated  in 4  centers  in  Macedonia.  The  study  period  was  from  the  25 th of  September 2010 to the 22 nd  of November 2010.

## Methods

## Design

This was a cross-over, single dose, partially blinded, 6-treatment study with a washout period of at least 3 days and up to 5 days between each visit. Equal numbers of patients were randomly assigned to each sequence.

Table 23. Basic design of the cross-over study BUSAL II-10-1

|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Visit 1 (screening) | Visit 2    | Visit 3    | Visit 4    | Visit 5    | Visit 6    | Visit 7    |
| N=68                | Treatment1 | Treatment2 | Treatment3 | Treatment4 | Treatment5 | Treatment6 |
| N=68                | Treatment2 | Treatment3 | Treatment4 | Treatment5 | Treatment6 | Treatment1 |
| N=68                | Treatment3 | Treatment4 | Treatment5 | Treatment6 | Treatment1 | Treatment2 |
| N=68                | Treatment4 | Treatment5 | Treatment6 | Treatment1 | Treatment2 | Treatment3 |

| N=68                | Treatment6 | Treatment1 | Treatment2 | Treatment3 | Treatment4 | Treatment5 |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A wash-out period of 3 days was enough because salmeterol, a selective beta-2 agonist, has a duration of action of up to 12 hours following a single dose inhalation of 50 µg.

Baseline  of  FEV1  measured  at  each  visit  was  to  be  within  -20%  and  +10%  of  the  baseline  value obtained  at  randomisation  visit.  Furthermore,  FEV1  was  to  be  no  more  than  15%  higher  than  the baseline FEV1 of the preceding study visit. If this criterion was not met, the patients were allowed to return for another attempt the day after (only one retest per visit was allowed by the protocol).

Patients were required to visit the clinic 7 times.

Visit 1 was the screening visit performed within 2 weeks prior to the randomization visit (Visit 2).

From Visit 2 to Visit 7, there were 6 periods of one day during which the patients inhaled a single dose of either Labazenit 150/25 µg or Labazenit 150/12.5 µg or Labazenit 150/6.25 µg or Serevent Diskus 50 µg or Serevent Evohaler 25 µg or Serevent Evohaler 2x25 µg. Each of the 6 periods was separated by a wash-out period of at least 3 days and the last period was followed up by a phone call one week after the final study visit.

## Treatments

Test product:

- BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL DPI 150/25 μg, one capsule via the Axahaler,
- BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL DPI 150/12.5 µg, one capsule via the Axahaler
- BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL DPI 150/6.25 µg, one capsule via the Axahaler

Reference product:

- Serevent Diskus 50μg, one inhalation via the Diskus
- Serevent Evohaler 25μg, one inhalation via the Evohaler
- Serevent Evohaler 50μg, two inhalations via the Evohaler

## Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the dose-response of the 3 doses (150/25 µg, 150/12.5 µg and 150/6.25 µg) of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of Budesonide-Salmeterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) by measuring the bronchodilatating effect.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoint: mean change from baseline in FEV1 max.

Secondary efficacy endpoint: secondary efficacy variables were the mean changes from baseline in:

- FEV1 at 12 hours post dose (L/sec and %), FEV1 max (%),
- PEFR max (L/sec), PEFR at 12 hours post-dose (L/sec),
- FVC max (L), FVC at 12 hours post-dose (L).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other secondary efficacy variables included: area under the curve (AUC) of FEV1 (L/sec and %), PEFR and FVC (%) respectively  from  0 to  12  hours  post-dose  (L/sec  and  %),  Tmax  for  FEV1  and  safety parameters: adverse events, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG data, tremor assessment.

## Sample size

Calculation was based on the equivalence design of analysis that required a larger sample size than the superiority  one.  Moreover  in  a  William's  design  the  number  of  patients  must  be  a  multiple  of  the number  of  tested  treatments  (and  therefore  of  the  number  of  periods).  The  required  number  of patients was the maximum value of 14, 24, and 38.

Therefore  42  patients  were  to  be  treated  over  the  6  periods  of  the  cross  over  study  to  obtain  38 completed patients with a drop-out rate of 10%.

## Randomisation

At  the  baseline/randomization  visit  (visit  2),  after  confirmation  that  the  patient  met  all  eligibility criteria for the study, the patient was randomized and assigned a randomization number.

## Blinding (masking)

This was a partly blinded study. Indeed, as the double blind was not feasible due to the impossibility to obtain placebo from the reference products, the blind was maintained only for the three doses of the salmeterol/budesonide combination. The randomization procedure was applied in the study design to minimize bias possibility as the investigator was not able to predict the next treatment option for the sequential patient randomization in the trial.

## Statistical methods

The main criteria of analysis are known to be normally distributed. The normality of the distribution has not been tested.

Change from baseline has been calculated for each period. The analysis has been made using a mixed model for the serially  balanced  complete  block  cross-over  design.  Terms  of  the  model  were  period, treatment and baseline of each period as fixed-effect. No interaction term was added in the model. The main  criteria  for  efficacy  involved  both  dose  response  for  Budesonide-Salmeterol  and  equivalence testing  between  Budesonide-Salmeterol  150/25  µg  and  Serevent  Diskus  50  µg  (and  respectively Serevent Evohaler 2*25 µg). The analyses were conducted independently.

Contrasts were calculated between the 3 dosages of Budesonide-Salmeterol. To deal with inflation of type  I  error  risk  due  to  multiple  comparisons,  the  α-risk  was  reduced  to  0.0167  according  to  the Bonferroni  inequality.  The  two-sided  98.33%  confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  difference  of  LSmeans (least squares adjusted means derived from mixed model) was calculated.

In  addition  a  contrast  between  Budesonide-Salmeterol  150/25  µg  and  Serevent  Diskus  50  µg  (and respectively with Serevent Evohaler 2*25 µg) was calculated using the same model as above. As these factors  were  face  to  face  comparisons  of  two  pairs  of  products,  the  Bonferroni  correction  was  not applied. The two-sided 95% CI of the difference of LSmeans was calculated. The limit of the 95% CI was compared to the equivalence margin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analyses  of  secondary  criteria  were  conducted  as  for  the  main  criterion.  Descriptive  statistics  were used for the safety analysis.

## Results

## Participant flow

Twenty-two  (22)  out  of  the  70  selected  patients  (31.43%)  were  screening  failures  and  were  not randomized  in  the  trial:  16  patient  did  not  met  inclusion  criteria,  1  patient  did  not  met  exclusion criteria, I patents was patients decision, and 4 patients had other reasons.

Each of the 48 randomised patients received each of the 6 treatments of the cross-over study.

## Conduct of the study

There were no protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol.

## Baseline data

All patients, were of Caucasian race, were aged 47.1±11.3 years with no patient aged more than 70 years at enrolment. Women were in a majority (54.17%).

At the screening visit, patients were suffering from moderate to severe persistent asthma for 3.2±3.6 years.  In  reference  to  GINA  criteria  for  asthma  control,  all  patients  were  partly  controlled  or uncontrolled.

| Exacerbation                                 | N (%) | 27 (56.25%)           |

All  patients  had  a  FEV1%  between  50%  and  80%  (66.37  ±  8.04)  and  all  patients  demonstrated reversibility (0.56 ± 0.35 L, 26.31±12.82%) and dose-response as per the inclusion criteria.

93.75%  of  the  patients  have  never  smoked  while  6.25%  were  current  smokers.  Smokers'  tobacco consumption was 4.3±1.2 cigarettes per day.

ECG was normal for all patients at screening visit. At randomization visit, one patient presented with left axis deviation and one patient presented with a mild sinus bradycardia. Both abnormalities were judged  not  clinically  significant  by  the  investigator.  QTc  measurements  (msec):  (N=48):  m  ±  SD 398.50 ± 23.16 msec; min - max- 360 - 446 msec; med 400.50 msec.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Numbers analysed

All randomised patients received at least one treatment intake and had one assessable FEV1 max for at  least  one  study  period  after  having  taken  study  medication  (safety  set,  Intent-To-Treat  (ITT) analysis set):

- 48 patients were included in the safety analysis subset and in the ITT analysis subset
- 48 patients were included in the PP subset analysis
- o 46 patients in the Labazenit 150/12.5 µg period,
- o 47 patients in the Labazenit 150/25 µg period,
- o 47 patients in the Labazenit 150/6.25 µg period,
- o 48 patients in the SER Diskus 50 µg period
- o 47 patients in the SER Evohaler 25 µg period
- o 47 patients in the SER Evohaler 2*25 µg period

Major  protocol  deviations  were:  baseline  of  FEV1  out  of  range  (4),  delay  last  intake  of  short  beta agonist and spirometry (1).

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint: mean change in FEV1max

Mean maximum FEV1 value was 2.68±0.86 L/sec for Labazenit 150/25 µg and 2.66±0.70 L/sec for Serevent Diskus 50 µg . There was no statistically significant difference between treatments (p=0.780) but the related 95% CI (-0.16; 0.12) was marginally outside the predefined equivalence limits (-0.15; +0.15L) (see table below).

It appeared that results were robust but that the great variability in bronchodilatory response resulted in a 95% CI of the effect size that was larger than expected.

There was no clear dose-response relationship between the 3 doses of Labazenit concerning the postdose FEV1 max. From a statistical point of view, Labazenit 150/12.5 µg gave better improvement of FEV1  than  Labazenit  150/6.25  µg  (p=0.01),  however  there  was  no  significant  difference  between Labazenit 150/12.5 µg and Labazenit 150/25 µg (see table below).

In addition, no dose-response was observed between the two dosages of Serevent Evohaler (p=0.96).

A trend for the higher doses to have longer duration of action was outlined.

This was confirmed in a post-hoc analysis of AUC between 8 and 12 hours post-dose (AUC8-12) which demonstrated a significant dose-response between Labazenit 150/25 µg and Labazenit 150/6.25 µg (p = 0.008) (see tables below).

Difficulties in establishing dose-response have been encountered also in other well-controlled studies. Indeed, dose-response assessments of topical bronchodilatators are challenging due to the variability and to the low signal to noise ratio in FEV1, the standard measure of bronchodilatation.

## Study BUSAL II-03-1

This  study  was  a  randomised,  single-blind,  cross-over  study  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  DPI  capsule  150-25  µg  delivered  by  the  Miat  Monodose  Inhaler  and Serevent Diskus 50 µg in chronic moderate asthmatic patients.

Patients were treated in once centre in Poland. The study period was from 19 th  of May 2004 to 26 th of July 2004.

## Methods

## Treatments

Placebo : the placebo capsules were used at the screening to check the ability of the patient to use the Miat Monodose Inhaler. 5 inhalations were made at the screening.

Test product : BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg DPI inhaled via the Miat Monodose Inhaler. Each capsule contains 150 µg of budesonide and 25 µg of salmeterol.

Reference product : Serevent 50 µg Diskus. 1 inhalation via the Diskus contains 50 µg of salmeterol.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the equivalence of a single dose of BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL DPI capsule 150-25 g with a single dose of Serevent Diskus.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoint: Peak bronchodilatory effect (FEV1 max)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary efficacy endpoint:

- Area under the curve (AUC) of FEV1 from 0 to 12 hours post dosing
- Tmax of FEV1
- FEV1 at 12 hours post dose
- PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) max
- FVC (forced vital capacity) max
- PEFR at 12 hours post dose
- PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) at the different time points
- FVC (forced vital capacity) at the different time points
- Number of bronchodilator (salbutamol) rescue inhalations.

## Sample size

For the sample size calculation a true difference of zero was used. Using an estimate of within patient standard deviation of the treatment difference of 0.277 and 80% power, 32 evaluable patients were needed to show the equivalence of BUDESONIDESALMETEROL DPI and Serevent Diskus.

## Randomisation

Patients received a randomisation number and were assigned to the treatment sequence according to the randomisation list.

## Blinding (masking)

The  patients  were  aware  that  they  had  been  taking  either  the  reference  treatment  or  the  test treatment but they were instructed not to discuss or reveal their study medications at any time with the person conducting their pulmonary function tests, as that person was blind to the treatment arm to which the patient was assigned.

## Statistical methods

Summaries and analyses of secondary efficacy parameters were performed on the ITT and on the PP analysis sets.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary efficacy parameter was the maximum FEV1 attained post dosing (peak bronchodilatory effect). The statistical comparison was based on a 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatments  (BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  DPI-Serevent  Diskus),  concluding  equivalence  if  the  lower bound of the confidence interval was not lower than -0.15 L and the upper bound were not greater than +0.15 L. The 95% confidence interval was calculated as the difference in least squares means between the two treatment groups using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.

## Results

## Participant flow

Thirty-seven  patients  were  screened  for  the  study  and  thirty-five  were  randomized.  Three  patients were randomized being treated by a prohibited drug were replaced by three other patients (105, 106, and  107).  These  patients  were  considered  in  the  ITT  analysis  but  excluded  from  the  per  protocol analysis.

## Conduct of the study

There were no protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol.

## Baseline data

23 females and 12 males were enrolled in the study. They were white Caucasians from 21 to 68 years old. 4 males were smokers. These patients were not used to smoke and did not smoke not more than 10 cigarettes per day. No female was smoking.

The 35 patients included in the study had a history of chronic moderate asthma for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit .

Descriptive  statistics  on  lung  function  tests  measured  at  screening  are  given  in  the  table  below.  All patient  enrolled  into  the  clinical  trial  had  at  minimum  3  month  history  of  chronic  moderate  asthma prior to the screening visit.

All the patients had reversibility of at least 12 % in FEV1 following inhalation of 400 µ g salbutamol at screening.  All  patients  had  FEV1  values  of  more  than  50%  and  lower  than  85%  of  predicted  at screening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All the values reported in the table below completely satisfied with the inclusion criteria regarding the spirometry testing.

## Numbers analysed

Thirty seven patients (37) were screened based on established inclusion and exlusion criteria.

Two patients (S10 and S36) were not enrolled into the study.

Patient (S10) was not included into the study because he presented at the screening visit the following findings:  ALT  =  137  U/l  (UNL=31),  AST  =  147  U/l  (UNL=32)  and  a  positive  HCV  Ab  test.  As these values and findings were considered as clinically significant by the investigator, the patient was not randomised.

Patient (S36) was screened but not randomized because the clinical site had already randomized the 32 scheduled patients.

Thirty-five  (35)  patients  were  randomised  into  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  intent-to  treat analysis set.

## Outcomes and estimation

Primary endpoint: Peak bronchodilatory effect of FEV1

Mean  FEV1  max  values reached 2,72 ±0,79 l/sec (mean  ±SD)  and  2,69±0,81  l/sec after administration of BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL and Serevent Diskus respectively (see figure below).

The  difference  of  0,03  l/sec  between  test  and  reference  treatments  was  not  statistically  significant (p=0.8650).  The  related  95%  CI  (-0.0339:  0.1025)  was  entirely  inside  the  predefined  equivalence limits  (-0.15:  +0.15  l),  demonstrating  equivalence  between  the  two  treatments  with  respect  to  the peak of bronchodilatory effect of FEV1 for the ITT population.

Secondary efficacy parameter: area under the curve of FEV1

The  mean  (±SD)  AUC0-12h  of  FEV1  values  were  29.93±8.85  L.h  for  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and 29.87±9.25  L.h  for  Serevent  Diskus  50  µg,  with  no  statistically  significant  difference  between treatments (p=0.865).

## Other secondary efficacy parameter

Also several other efficacy secondary parameters were included a.o. FEV1 at 12h post dose, number of bronchodilator  (salbutamol)  rescue  medication.  These  secondary  parameters  showed  no  statistically significant difference between treatments.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg b.i.d. versus BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 300-25 µg b.i.d. versus Pulmicort Turbuhaler 2 x 200 µg b.i.d. (reference), in patients with chronic moderate asthma.

The  secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  b.i.d.  and  to compare it to the safety profile of the reference product (PulmicortTurbuhaler 2 x 200 µg).

The safety variables were adverse events (AEs), withdrawals or drop-out rate, physical examination, vital  signs,  laboratory  data,  pulmonary  function  test  and  24h  urinary  and  morning  plasma  cortisol levels in subgroup of 45 patients (15 patients per study arm).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in morning PEF (mean change over the weeks from 0 to 12).

The secondary efficacy variables were the mean change from baseline in evening PEF, FEV1, asthma symptoms score change from baseline averaged over the weeks from 0 to 12, sleep disturbance score (subset of the asthma symptom score) change from baseline averaged over the weeks from 0 to 12, change from baseline in FVC and the number of bronchodilator rescue inhalations.

Data  for  PM  PEF,  asthma  symptom  score/total  asthma  symptoms  score,  sleep  disturbance  score, number of bronchodilator ( β 2 -agonist) rescue inhalations were collected from the diary cards.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

With 100 evaluable patients per treatment group, and the standard deviation of 50 L/min in morning PEF, it is estimated that a difference in change in morning PEF of 15 L/min could be found with 80% power at the 5% significance level using pair-wise comparison.

Assuming  a  20%  screening  failure  rate  and  a  20%  withdrawal  rate  a  total  of  432  patients  will  be required in order to achieve 100 evaluable per group.

## Randomisation

Patients received a randomization number and were assigned to the treatment sequence according to the randomization list. The patients were selected from 21 centers in two countries. The numbers were allocated  sequentially  in  the  order  in  which  the  patients  were  enrolled  independently  of  the  study centre where they were randomized.

## Blinding (masking)

The efficacy phase was an open-label part preceded by a single blind screening run-in phase where patients received a placebo.

The efficacy phase could not have been blinded because of the significant difference in the appearance of  the  investigational  and  reference  devices  while  a  double-dummy  design  could  not  be  performed because of the technical impossibility to manufacture placebo devices of the reference product.

At  visit  6  (end  of  the  efficacy  phase),  all  patients  treated  with  the  reference  product  underwent  a second  randomization  and  were  assigned  to  either  treatment  with  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  DPI 150-25  µg  or  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  300-25  µg  for  the  rest  of  the  study  (safety  phase).  A complete double-blind scheme was used as to which treatment they were receiving.

The  patient  and  doctor  were  instructed  to  not  speak  about  their  treatments  to  the  technician responsible  of  the  measurement  of  the  pulmonary  function  tests.  Furthermore,  a  complete  doubleblind design was maintained between both investigational drugs during the efficacy and safety phase.

## Statistical methods

The primary analysis was an intent-to-treat analysis, including all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication except for patients withdrawn after few days of treatment. Such patients could be withdrawn from the final analysis and the reason had to be reported. The primary efficacy  variable  was  morning  PEF  as  recorded  by  the  patients  in  diary  cards.  Averages  of  existing values were calculated for morning PEF for the last 5 days of the run-in period and for the whole of the treatment period. All hypothesis testing was made using two-sided alternatives.

The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.

During the efficacy phase:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  changes  from  baseline  of  the  mean  weekly  values  and  of  the  endpoint  were  analyzed  with  an ANCOVA model using as co-variable the baseline value. Superiority was addressed by calculating the 95% CIs for the mean difference between each formulation and was concluded if the two-sided 95 % CI for the treatment difference measured using the morning PEF (l/min) exceeded 0 L/min. A test to demonstrate  if  the  difference  exceeded  15  L/min  was  also  performed.  All  3  pair-wise  comparisons between the 3 groups ('Labazenit 150/25 µg', 'Labazenit 300/25 µg' and 'Pulmicort 2x200 µg') were done.

Within-group comparisons were done per timepoint and per treatment group by means of a paired ttest.

During the safety phase:

Between-group comparisons were done for the efficacy variables by means of an ANCOVA model with baseline as covariate on the changes from baseline for 'Labazenit 150-25 µg after reference' versus 'Labazenit 300-25 µg after reference'. Between-group comparisons by means of an ANCOVA model with baseline as covariate were done on the actual values for 'Labazenit 150-25 µg' at baseline week 12 versus 'Labazenit 150-25 µg after reference' at endpoint week 24 and for 'Labazenit 150-25 µg' versus 'Labazenit 150-25 µg after reference' at endpoint week 24 (similar for 'Labazenit 300-25 µg'). Within-group comparisons  were  done  for  the  efficacy  variables  by  means  of  paired  t-tests  for 'Labazenit 150-25 µg after reference' on the changes from baseline (similar for 'Labazenit 300-25 µg after reference'); and for 'Labazenit 150-25 µg' from week 12 till week 24 and at endpoint week 24 on the changes from baseline week 12 (similar for 'Labazenit 300-25 µg').

During the whole treatment period:

Between-group comparison was done for the groups 'Labazenit 150-25 µg' and 'Labazenit 300-25 µg' on the changes from initial baseline by means of an ANCOVA model with baseline value as covariate. Within-group comparison was done on the changes from initial baseline over the whole 24 weeks by means  of  a  paired  t-test  for  the  groups  'Labazenit  150-25  µg'  and  'Labazenit  300-25  µg'.  The secondary variables evening PEF, PFTs, asthma symptoms score, β2agonist use and sleep disturbance score  were  analyzed  in  a  manner  similar  to  that  for  the  primary  variable,  without  the  test  if  the difference between treatments exceeded 15L/min.

## Results

## Participant flow

The actual number of patients selected was 478 screened, 375 randomized and 342 terminated.

One patient assigned to BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 300-25 µg b.i.d. treatment was excluded from the ITT population (374 patients) as recorded FEV1 values after screening were missing for this patient. Major protocol deviations were reported for 43 patients, resulting in a PP population of 331 patients (see table below).

Compliance based on the mean number of inhalations and the mean number of PEF tests performed was at least 97% in any analysis phase for any treatment group.

## Conduct of the study

There was one protocol amendment to the original clinical trial protocol: the highest FEV1 and FVC do not  need  to  come  from  the  same  curve.  As  both  parameters  are  secondary  efficacy  variables  the highest  values  of  both  parameters  revealed  during  spirometry  should  be  recorded  for  analysis.  In previous version those two values must come from the same curve.

Other protocol amendments were made (of editorial nature) and were in relation to the addition of sites in Ukraine.These amendments were considered not influencing the study results.

## Baseline demographics

At  baseline,  demographic  parameters  and  severity  of  the  disease  were  similar  between  treatment groups (see table below).

Homogeneous distribution of patients over the three treatments groups was demonstrated for morning PEF,  evening  PEF,  FEV1  and  FVC,  as  no  statistically  significant  differences  were  seen  for  these parameters.  Statistically  significant  difference  was  noted  for  reversibility  after  inhalation  of  400  µg Salbutamol at screening (p=0.045); mean (± SE) reversibility at screening was 23.5, 25.2 and 27.9 %, in the BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg, BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 300-25 µg and reference groups,  respectively.  Overall,  patients  had  a  mean  reversibility  (±  SE)  at  screening  of  25.5%  (± 0.73%).

At week 12, the start of the safety phase, no differences between the subdivision of patients who were on reference treatment during the efficacy phase  were noted with respect to morning PEF, evening PEF, FEV1 and FVC.

Baseline  disease  characteristics  for  the  PP  and  ITT  populations  were  similar  as  for  the  Safety  'all patients' population.

The results of the test on superiority revealed that treatment with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg  after  reference  was  similar  to  treatment  with  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  300-25  µg  after reference, with respect to the mean changes from week 12 in morning PEF values to week18 and 24 (p=0.207 and 0.255 at weeks 18 and 24, respectively.

## Mean change in morning PEF during the whole study period

Statistically significant increases from baseline to week 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 in mean morning PEF values were observed within both test treatment groups (p&lt;0.001).

Under BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg and 300-25 µg treatments, mean morning PEF values increased after baseline and had increased by 55.1 ± 6.35 L/min and 60.4 ± 6.21 L/min, respectively, after 24 weeks of treatment.

24-week treatment with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg was similar to 24-week treatment with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  300-25  µg,  with  respect  to  the  change  from  baseline  in  morning  PEF (p&lt;0.321). Indeed, the two-sided 95% CIs for the treatment difference contained 0 L/min at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24.

## Secondary parameters

## FEV1: Mean change in FEV1 during the efficacy phase

Statistically  significant  increases  from  baseline  to  week  2,  4,  8  and  12  in  mean  FEV1  values  were observed within the 3 treatment groups (p&lt;0.001; see table below).

Across the 3 treatment groups, mean FEV1 values increased from baseline to week 2 and remained stable thereafter. At week 12, mean increases from baseline in FEV1 were 0.42 ± 0.043 L/s, 0.41 ± 0.039  L/s  and  0.29  ±  0.044  L/s  in  the  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  150-25  µg,  BUDESONIDESALMETEROL 300-25 µg and reference treatment groups, respectively.

## Mean change in FEV1 during the safety phase

Statistically significant increases in FEV1 from week 12 to week 18 and 24 were observed within the group receiving BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg after 12-week reference treatment (p≤0.030). No statistically significant changes in mean FEV1 values from week 12 to week 18 and 24 on the other hand, were observed in the group treated with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 300-25 µg after 12-week reference  treatment  (p≥0.067).  These  results  indicate  that  the  switch  from  reference  treatment  to BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg or 300-25 µg treatment did not notably affect FEV1 values.

The results of the superiority test revealed that treatment with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg after  reference  was  similar  to  treatment  with  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 300-25 µg after reference with respect to the mean changes in FEV1 from baseline to week 18 and 24 (p=0.790 and 0.984 at week 18 and 24, respectively) (see table below).

## Mean change in FEV1 during the whole study

Statistically significant increases from baseline to week 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 in mean FEV1 values were observed within the both test treatment groups (p&lt;0.001). In the BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg and 300-25 µg treatment groups, mean FEV1 values increased from baseline to week 2 and remained stable thereafter. At week 24, a mean increase in FEV1 versus baseline of 0.40 ± 0.043 and 0.43 ± 0.041 L/s was observed in the BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg and the BUDESONIDESALMETEROL 300-25 µg treatment groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

24-week treatment with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 150-25 µg was similar to 24-week treatment with BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL 300-25 µg with respect to change in FEV1 from baseline (p≥0.322). The two-sided 95% CIs for the treatment difference contained 0 L/s at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24.

A graphical presentation of the actual mean FEV1 values, for the 4 treatment groups during the 24week treatment period, is shown in the figure below for the ITT population.

## Other secondary parameters

As for the primary efficacy parameter, no significant differences were found between both BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL dose regimens regarding the secondary efficacy parameters.

Similar results were obtained regarding increases from baseline in evening PEF and PFT measurements (FEV1 and FEV1% of predicted normal) and regarding decreases from baseline in asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, worst and total symptom scores), sleep disturbance score and the use of rescue medication (daily number of inhalations and number of days with rescue treatment).

## Clinical studies in special populations

No clinical studies in special populations were performed with the FDC salmeterol/budesonide. This was considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP  based  on  the  well  know  efficacy  of  salmeterol  and  budesonide monocompounds.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No pooled analysis or meta-analysis was performed with the FDC salmeterol/budesonide which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Supportive studies

## Study BUSAL III-05-1

This was a phase III, randomized, parallel group study to compare the therapeutic efficacy of Labazenit 300/25 µg BID delivered by the AxahalerR versus Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg (Fluticasone Propionate 500 µg/Salmeterol 50 µg) BID over 12 weeks and to evaluate the safety of Labazenit 300/25 µg over an additional period of 12 weeks in moderate to severe persistent asthmatic patients.

This was a randomized, non-inferiority, parallel group, open-label, multicenter study with 2-week runin  phase with inhaled beclometasone dipropionate 200 µg twice daily plus placebo, 12-weeks active treatment: Labazenit 300/25 µg (75% of patients), or Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg (25% of patients).

Patients attended the clinic for interim visits after 3 weeks (Visit 3) and 6 weeks (Visit 4) of treatment.

Patients  in  the  Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg  group  completed  the  study  at  Week  12.  Patients  in  the Labazenit  300/25  µg  group  continued  the  study  for  a  further  12  weeks  treatment  and  safety assessments. They attended the clinic for an interim visit 18 weeks after randomization (Visit 6) and completed the study after 24 weeks treatment (Visit 7).

## Methods

## Study participants

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

Male  and  female  patients  aged  18  to  70  years,  with  a  diagnosis  of  moderate  to  severe  persistent asthma for a minimum of 3 months duration, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) range of 50-80% of predicted, at least 12% FEV1 reversibility to 4 puffs of salbutamol 100 µg. Patients were excluded if they received oral or parenteral steroids in the previous 8 weeks or were hospitalized for a related disorder in the previous 3 months.

## Objectives

The objectives of the study were the following:

-  to  compare  the  therapeutic  efficacy,  in  a  non-inferiority  model,  of  a  12-week  course  of  Labazenit 300/25 µg, taken twice daily,  versus  Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg  taken  twice  daily  by  inhalation,  in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- to compare the safety of Labazenit 300/25 µg taken twice daily by inhalation versus SeretideDiskus 500/50 µg taken twice daily by inhalation in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma over 12 weeks.

- to evaluate the safety of a 24-week course of Labazenit 300/25 µg taken twice daily by inhalation, in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy variable:

- -Mean change from baseline to Week 12 in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF).

## Secondary efficacy variables:

- -Mean  change  over  the  weeks  from  baseline  to  Week  12  in  LFO:  evening  PEF,  FEV1,  FEV1%  of predicted and FVC.
- -Change from baseline in symptomatic parameters averaged over the weeks from baseline to Week 12: asthma symptoms score, sleep disturbance score (subset of the asthma symptom score)
- -Number of asthma exacerbations.
- -Number of doses (inhalations) of bronchodilator rescue medication.

## Safety variables:

- -Adverse events
- -Physical examination, Vital signs.
- -Laboratory data.
- -Withdrawals or drop-out rate.

## Statistical methods: randomisation, blinding and statistical plan

For the primary efficacy variable, mean change in morning PEF from baseline to Week 12 was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with fixed factors of treatment, center within country, age and gender  and  using  baseline  mean  morning  PEF  as  covariates.  To  estimate  the  treatment  effect,  the mean difference between treatments and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Non-inferiority could be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than -15 L/min for both the PP and ITT populations.

FEV1 (highest FEV1 and FEV1 percent of predicted normal), and FVC values were log-transformed at each visit and analyzed by ANCOVA with the log-transformed baseline value used as covariate.

Weekly asthma symptoms score and weekly sleep disturbance score from baseline to Week 12 were analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] statistic with rank-scores and center as stratification factor.

Other efficacy  variables  and  safety  data  were  summarized  using  appropriate  summary  statistics.  All data were listed.

## Results

## Participant flow

Run In: 584 patients

Randomized: 372 patients in the Labazenit 300/25 µg group and 117 patients in the Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg group were randomized and took study medication:

Competed 12-week efficacy phase: 351 (94.4%) patients in the Labazenit 300/25 µg group and 109 (94.0%) patients

## Conduct of the study

The following amendments were made to the initial study protocol:

- -Change of the inclusion criterion wit respect to FEV1: one measure of more than or equal to 50% (upper limit 80%) is acceptable (the best achievable value) in stead of all.
- -Change of dates of Visit 6 and Visit 7 to allow the patients randomised to Labazenit 300/25μg arm to  continue  in  the  study  for  two  more  weeks  in  order  to  arrange  smooth  shift  and  enrolment  of hundred and twenty patients in Poland to continue in the extension protocol (BUSAL III-06-1)
- -a definition of PEF compliance is added
- -a description for representative selection of FEV1 is added.

## Baseline data

Mean age was approximately 46.5 years and ranged between 18 and 69 years in both groups. There were  more  females  than  males:  220  (61.6%)  females  in  the  Labazenit  300/25  µg  group  and  75 (64.7%) females in the Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg group. All patients were Caucasian.

## Outcomes

## Primary efficacy parameter

The  mean change (± SD) in morning PEF from baseline to Week 12 was 39.0 ± 52.4 L/min in the Labazenit  300/25  µg  group  and  40.4±  56.5 L/min  in  the  Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg  group.  These increases were statistically significant within the 2 treatment groups (p&lt;0.001) (see table below).

The mean difference between the groups at Week 12 was -2.5 L/min and the 95% CI was [-13.4; 8.5] L/min  (p=0.660).  The  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  was  greater  than  -15 L/min,  therefore  noninferiority was demonstrated between Labazenit 300/25 µg and Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg.

The lower limit of the 95% CI for the mean difference between the groups in mean morning PEF values was above -15 L/min at each post-baseline visit. Moreover, the mean morning PEF values were similar in both treatment groups between baseline and each post-baseline visit.

- *Asthma symptoms score: defined as the sum of cough, wheezing and shortness of breath symptoms scores.

The  mean  change  (±SD)  in  FEV1  from  baseline  to  Week  12  was  0.44±0.45  L/s  for  the  Labazenit 300/25 µg group and 0.50±0.50 L/s for the Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg group. These increases were similar and statistically significant within the 2 treatment groups (p&lt;0.001). The ratio of means was 0.98 (95% CI: [0.95;1.02]) and the mean difference between the groups was -0.02 (95%CI: [-0.06 ; 0.01]). This was not statistically significant (p=0.259).

No significant  differences  were  found  between  Labazenit  300/25  µg  and  Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg regarding the primary and the secondary efficacy parameters.

For almost all secondary parameters for both Labazenit 300/25 µg and Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg the changes compared to baseline were statistically significant.

Sleep  disturbance  score  values  were  lower  on  treatment  compared  with  baseline,  and  were significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower than baseline in both treatment groups at every post-baseline visit in the Labazenit  300/25  µg  group  only.  In  the  Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg  group,  mean  sleep  disturbance scores were not statistically significantly different from baseline at Weeks 1-5 and 8 (p&gt;0.05) but were statistically significantly different at Weeks 6, 7 and 9-12 (p&lt;0.05).

Use  of  rescue  medication  at  baseline  was  (median  [range])  5.0  (0-64)  inhalations/week  in  the Labazenit 300/25 .g group and 5.0 (0-59) inhalations/week in the Seretide DikusS 500/50 µg group. Use of rescue medication was lower on treatment compared with baseline throughout the study. The median (range) change from baseline to Week 12 in number of puffs of rescue medication was -2.0 (54-23) inhalations/week in the Labazenit 300/25 µg group and -3.0 (-40-19) inhalations/week in the Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg  group.  The  medians  (distribution  free  CIs)  for  the  differences  were  0.0 [0.0;1.0] in both treatment groups and was not statistically significant (p=0.191).

## Exacerbations

Exacerbations  were  defined  as  an  efficacy  parameter  and  recorded  as  when  the  patient  presented clinical features of an exacerbation.

8 patients reported asthma exacerbations during the efficacy phase of the study: 7 (2.0%) patients in the  Labazenit  300/25  µg  group  and  1  (0.9%)  patient  in  the  Seretide  Diskus  500/50  µg  group.  Six (1.7%) additional patients in the Labazenit 300/25 µg group reported asthma exacerbations during the safety phase of the study.

The  results  of  the  PP  population  were  similar  to  the  results  of  the  ITT  population  for  the  above parameters.

Labazenit 300/25 µg is non-inferior to Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg in terms of morning PEF in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma.

For  the  secondary  efficacy  variables:  evening  PEF,  FEV1,  FEV1  percent  of  predicted,  FVC,  asthma symptoms  scores  and  use  of  rescue  medication,  treatment  with  Labazenit  300/25  µg  and  Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg both similarly improved the symptoms of asthma throughout the study. There were no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  two  treatments  for  any  of  the  secondary  efficacy variables.

## Study BUSAL III-08-1

This was a phase III, randomized, parallel group, open study to compare the therapeutic efficacy and safety  of  SMB  Budesonide-Salmeterol  DPI  capsule  150/25  µg  BID  delivered  by  the  Axahaler  versus Symbicort  Turbuhaler  200/12  µg  BID  over  12  weeks  in  moderate  to  severe  persistent  asthmatic patients.

The planned duration was 14 weeks:

- a  2-week  screening/run-in  period  during  which  patients  were  all  treated  with  Budesonide (Pulmicort Turbuhaler, 800 µg/d) and placebo via Axahaler
- a  12-week  open-label  treatment  period  during  which  patients  were  treated  either  with  SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol DPI capsule 150/25 µg BID or Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg BID.

Inhaled Salbutamol (max. 1600 µg/d) was permitted as rescue medication at any time of the study but at least 6 hours prior to performing the pulmonary function test.

26 out of the 26 centres were active and selected at least one patient (7 in Bulgaria, 9 in Romania, 4 in Macedonia and 6 in Serbia). 24 of these 26 centres enrolled at least one patient: 7 in Bulgaria, 7 in Romania, 4 in Macedonia and 6 in Serbia.

5 visits were planned for each patient:

V1 - Screening visit (W-2)

V2 - Randomization (W1±2 days)

V3 - 3 weeks (21 days) after randomization (±3 days)

V4 - 6 weeks (42 days) after randomization (±3 days)

V5 - Final visit, 12 weeks (84 days) after randomization (±3 days)

## Methods

## Study participants

Men  or  women,  aged  from  18  to  65  years  old,  with  a  diagnosis  of  moderate  to  severe  persistent asthma for a minimum of 6 months duration with FEV1 range of 50-80 % predicted at screening and baseline, at least 12 % in FEV1 and 200 ml reversibility to 4 puffs of Salbutamol 100 µg and having asthma symptoms partly controlled or uncontrolled according to the GINA guidelines.

Patients were excluded from participating in the study if they received oral or parental corticosteroids in the past 8 weeks or were hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation or a related disorder in the past 3 months beore screening visit.

## Treatment

2-week run-in period: Budesonide (Pulmicort Turbuhaler, 800 µg/day) and placebo (Axahaler).

12-week  open-label  treatment  period:  Budesonide-Salmeterol  DPI  150/25  µg  BID  or  Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg BID.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

The study objectives were the following:

- to  compare  the  therapeutic  efficacy  in  a  non-inferiority  model  of  12  weeks  course  of  SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol  DPI  capsule  150/25  µg  delivered  by  Axahaler,  taken  BID,  versus Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg BID, taken by inhalation, in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma.
- to compare the safety of SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol DPI capsule 150/25 µg taken BID versus Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg BID taken by inhalation, in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma over 12 weeks.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy assessment : Mean change over the weeks from baseline to W12 in morning pre-dose peak expiratory flow (PEF).

Secondary efficacy assessment: (Note: Pulmonary Function Test was performed at each visit before study drug intake at least 12 hours after the previous dose):

- -Mean  change  over  the  weeks  from  baseline  to  W12  in  evening  pre-dose  PEF,  FEV1,  FEV1  %  of predicted, and FVC

Symptomatic parameters

- -Mean change over the weeks from baseline to W12 in asthma symptoms score, sleep disturbance score (subset of the asthma symptom score),
- -Number of asthma exacerbations
- -Number of bronchodilator rescue inhalations

## Safety assessment:

- -Adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals or drop-out rate due to AEs
- -Physical examination and vital signs
- -12-lead ECG
- -Laboratory data

## Statistical methods: randomisation, blinding and statistical plan

Handling of missing data: missing efficacy data were replaced using the LOCF method

## Definitions:

Baseline value: for parameters assessed every day, baseline was defined as the mean of the 5 last days with available results  within  10  days  before  randomization;  for  FEV1,  FEV1%  of  predicted  and FVC parameters, the baseline was defined as the value at randomization visit (V2).

Endpoint value: for parameters assessed every day, week 12 was defined as the mean of the 5 last days with available results within 10 days before Visit 5 (week12); for FEV1, FEV1% of predicted and FVC parameters, the endpoint value was defined as the value at Visit 5 (week12). Same rules were applied for calculation of W3 and W6 values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy analysis:

Given the non-inferiority design, both the PP and the ITT sets were used for a robust interpretation of the efficacy analysis.

The  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  with  factors  for  treatment,  site  within  country,  age,  sex,  and baseline  value  was  used  on  efficacy  parameters  to  compare  the  two  treatments  (BudesonideSalmeterol 150/25 µg vs. Symbicort 100/6 µg, significance level p&lt;0.05). Two-sided 95% adjusted confidence interval (CI)  was calculated for the mean difference of LSmeans between treatments for each efficacy parameter between baseline and W12. To demonstrate the non-inferiority, CI had to be above the non-inferiority margin, - 20 L/min, for both the PP and the ITT analysis set.

## Safety analysis:

The number and frequency of patients experiencing a specific adverse event and the number of AEs were tabulated by group, system organ class, and preferred term.

Evolution of vital signs and ECGs during the efficacy period (from V2 to V5) was analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measurements.

Laboratory data were described at V1, V3, V4 and V5 per treatment group. For each parameter and for each treatment group, change from baseline to V5 was provided. A Student's t-test for paired series was  performed  in  order  to  test  if  the  change  observed  between  V5  and  baseline  was  significantly different from 0 (= no change) in each treatment group. Moreover, an analysis of covariance adjusted on baseline was performed to test the difference at V5 between treatment groups.

## Results

## Participant flow

One  hundred  (100)  out  of  the  329  selected  patients  (30.40  %)  were  screening  failures,  mostly referring  to  non-compliance  with  inclusion  criteria,  non  compliance  with  the  protocol,  or  referred  to patient's decision.

229 patients were randomized: 115 patients in the SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol 150/25 µg group and 114 patients in the Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg group.

Safety  analysis  (treated  patients):  229  patients  (115  patients  in  the  SMB  Budesonide-Salmeterol 150/25 µg group and 114 patients in the Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg group).

ITT efficacy analysis: 222 patients (113 patients in the SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol 150/25 µg group and 109 patients in the Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg group).

In  this  ITT  population  6  patients  presented  a  major  protocol  violation  and/or  did  not  complete  the study (from ITT) ( * 5 patients with 2 major deviations ):

- FEV1&lt;50% or &gt;80% at V1: N=1
- Forbidden concomitant therapy: N=1
- Compliance V2-V5&lt;70% on e-PEF diary: N=5
- Compliance V2-V5&lt;70% on study drug: N=4

PP analysis: 216 patients (109 patients in the SMB Budesonide-Salmeterol 150/25 µg group and 107 patients in the Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conduct of the study

One amendment (dated 19 th  of December 2008) was made to the initial study protocol. The purpose of the amendment was neither to enter new procedures nor to amend the protocol selection criteria but to clarify few protocol text sections. This amendment performed during the study is not considered as influencing the study results.

## Demographics and disease characteristics

Treated patients, all of Caucasian race, were aged 45.2±11.6 years with no patient aged more than 65 years at enrolment. Women were in a majority (62.01%).

No difference was observed between groups neither in demographics nor in biometrics.

ITT: Asthma was diagnosed 8.14±8.47 years before entry in the study. In reference to GINA criteria for asthma control, all patients presented with a partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma despite being treated with inhaled corticosteroids. 95.95% of patients reported symptoms of asthma during daytime and 75.68% during nighttime. 89.64% required rescue medications. 44.14% reported exacerbations of asthma.

At  baseline  (W0),  mean  peak  expiratory  flow  (PEF)  measurement  was  342.96±121.32  L/min  in  the morning and 350.98±125.41 L/min in the evening. The spirometry test performed at W0 showed a mean FVC of 3.19±0.92 L, a mean FEV1 of 2.09±0.54 L/sec and reversibility in FEV1 (measured 15 minutes after inhalation of 4*100μg Salbutamol) of 570±337 ml or 28.50±16.51%. No difference was observed at baseline between the randomization groups.

## Outcomes

No significant differences were found between Labazenit 150/25 µg and Symbicort Turbuhaler   200/12 µg regarding the primary and the secondary efficacy parameters.

## Primary efficacy parameter

The mean change (± SD) in morning PEF from baseline to Week 12 was 36.03±54.55 L/min in the Labazenit  150/25  µg  group  and  20.99±66.38 L/min  in  the  Symbicort  Turbuhaler 200/12  µg  group; these  increases  were  statistically  significant  within  the  2  treatment  groups  (p&lt;0.001)  (see  table below).

* difference between baseline and week 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean difference between the groups for morning PEF at Week 12 was 12.19 L/min and the 95% CI  was  [-2.93;  27.32] L/min  (p=0.11).  The  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  was  greater  than  20 L/min; therefore  non-inferiority was  demonstrated  between  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  Symbicort  Turbuhaler 200/12 µg.

The  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  mean  difference  between  both  groups  in  mean  morning  PEF values was above -20 L/min at each post-baseline visit. However, the mean morning PEF values of the Labazenit  150/25  µg  group  significantly  increased  after  3  weeks  of  treatment  (mean  change  of 32.02±51.98 L/min at W3, p&lt;0.0001) while 6 weeks of treatment were necessary in patients treated with Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg to observe a significant increase in morning PEF (mean change of 24.62±60.95 L/min at W6, p&lt;0.0001).

Therefore, the between groups difference was significant at W3 with an effect size of 22.84 L/min in favour of Budesonide-Salmeterol (p=0.001).

Results obtained with the PP subset confirmed those observed with the ITT subset. The lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval was -3.21 L/min far upper of the no inferiority limit defined by the protocol as -20 L/min.

Therefore as ITT analysis and PP analysis give consistent results, Budesonide-Salmeterol 150/25 µg can be regarded as non inferior to Symbicort 200/12 µg regarding the mean change from baseline in morning PEF.

## Secondary efficacy variables

## Spirometry variables

No differences between both treatments were observed regarding increases from baseline in evening PEF and other PFT measurements (FEV1, FEV1% of predicted and FVC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* difference between baseline and week 12

**Asthma  symptoms  score:  defined  as  the  sum  of  cough,  wheezing  and  shortness  of  breath symptoms scores.

All these increases were statistically significant within the 2 treatment groups (p&lt;0.0001).

## Other secondary efficacy parameters

No differences between both treatments were observed regarding decreases from baseline in asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and total symptom scores), sleep disturbance score and the use of rescue medication.

## Exacerbations

Exacerbations  were  defined  as  an  efficacy  parameter:  in  addition  to  the  clinical  features  of  an exacerbation, the protocol definition also took into account decreases in asthma control (20% decrease in morning PEF versus baseline or an additional need for rescue medication on two consecutive days).

Fifty-five  asthma  exacerbations  occurred  during  the  treatment  period:  10  patients  treated  with Labazenit 150/25 µg reported 17 exacerbations -all of mild intensity- and  15 patients treated with Symbicort reported 38 exacerbations -36 of mild intensity and 2 of moderate intensity.

## Conclusions

The results of this study demonstrate that a 12-week administration of Labazenit 150/25 µg is noninferior  to  Symbicort  Turbuhaler  200/12  µg  in  terms  of  morning  PEF  in  patients  with  moderate  to severe  persistent  asthma.  Both  treatments  similarly  improved  the  PFTs  (PEF,  FEV1,  FEV1%  of predicted, FVC), the asthma symptoms and the use of rescue medications.

## Study BUSAL III-06-1

This was an open-label phase III extension study to evaluate the safety of BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL DPI capsule 300/25 µg BID delivered by the Axahaler over 28 weeks in moderate to severe persistent asthmatic  patients  selected  from  the  BUSAL  III-05-1  study  and  already  taking  BUDESONIDESALMETEROL DPI capsule 300/25 µg BID for 24 weeks.

## Methods

## Study participants

Male and female patients, 18-75 years , who presented with moderate to severe persistent asthma, and selected from the BUSAL III-05-1 study and already taking Labazenit 300/25μg BID for 24 weeks and willing to continue in the new one were included.

Patients  should  not  have  received  oral  or  parenteral  steroids  in  the  preceding  8  weeks  or  being hospitalized for a related disorder in the past 3 months.

## Objectives

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety of an additional 28 weeks course of Labazenit 300/25  µg  twice  daily  (BID),  taken  by  inhalation,  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  persistent asthma  selected  from  the  BUSAL  III-05-1  study  and  having  taken  BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL  DPI capsule 300/25 µg BID for 24 weeks in order to obtain, by combining the data from the both studies, the assessment of safety over 1 year.

For 2 patients the deviation was considered to be major. Since the primary objective of this extension study was to collect long-term safety data, the data from all patients enrolled, including patients with major protocol deviations, were included in the Safety Analysis Set.

The patients will visit the clinic 3 times according to the following: V7 in BUSAL III-05-1, 98 days (14 weeks) and 196 days (28 weeks)

## Conduct of the study

The  following  changes  from  the  analyses  planned  in  the  protocol  (dated  15  February  2007)  were made:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In addition to 95% CIs for efficacy parameters (mean of morning PEF, mean of evening PEF, FEV1, highest  FEV1  and  FEV1  %  of  predicted  normal,  FVC,  wheezing,  cough,  shortness  of  breath,  weekly asthma symptoms score, weekly sleep disturbance score and weekly total asthma symptoms score), baseline was compared to other timepoints using paired t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test.

- In the protocol, efficacy parameters were planned to be derived using 4-week intervals.

This was modified for use of the same principles as were used in the initial study (BUSAL III-05-1). Derivation in the initial study was based on the last 5 days within each diary week (i.e. Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 6 and Day 7). Derivation was done at each visit over the two studies (combined).

## Baseline data

## Demography

Mean  age  of  the  study  population  at  the  start  of  this  extension  study  was  44.8  years  and  ranged between 18 and 69 years. There were more females 66 (versus 60.0). All patients were Caucasian.

## Medical history

Medical history was recorded for 76 (69.1%) patients.

39 [35.5%] patients had allergic rhinitis (undefined allergic rhinitis, SAR, PAR, nasal polyps) and 28 [25.5%] patients) had vascular disorders of which hypertension (21 [19.1%] patients).

90.9% of patients had moderate persistent asthma. The remainder had severe persistent asthma. No patients  had  mild  asthma,  in  accordance  with  the  protocol.  Mean  duration  of  asthma  was  117.6 months. The minimum duration of asthma (4 months) was also in accordance with the inclusion criteria for study BUSAL III-05-1.

Two  (1.8%)  patients  were  current  smokers  at  the  start  of  this  extension  study  and  25  (22.7%) patients were previous smokers. The remaining patients were non-smokers.

## Measurement of treatment compliance

Overall, patients were compliant both with the study medication and with PEF measurements. Over the combined study periods of 52 weeks, mean (SD) compliance with study medication was 99.5 (2.0)% and mean (SD) compliance with PEF was 99.3 (1.9)%.

107  (97.3%)  patients  were  compliant  with  study  medication,  i.e.  80-120%  (inclusive)  compliant throughout the combined 52-week study periods.

## Efficacy conclusions

The improvements in pulmonary functions and in asthma symptoms that were measured during study BUSAL III-05-1 were sustained throughout this 6-month extension study.

## PFT

- mean morning PEF values at week s 38 and 52 were 44.4 L/min and 44.8 L/min, resp., higher than the baseline value of 341.5 L/min (p&lt;0.001 for the changes from baseline).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Median highest FEV1 values at weeks 38 and 52 were 0.30 L/sec and 0.28 L/sec, resp., higher than the  baseline  value  of  2.06  L/sec.  Similarly,  median  FEV1  percent  of  predicted  normal  values  were 11.30% at week 38 and 10.00% at week 52 higher than the baseline value of 65.70%. Median highest FVC values at weeks 38 and 52 were 0.33 L and 0.32 L, resp., higher than the baseline value of 2.97 L. The changes from baseline were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

## Symptomatic endpoints

-  Median  weekly  asthma  symptom  scores  at  Weeks  38  and  52  were  0.3  points  and  0.4  points, respectively, lower than the baseline value of 1.6 points (p&lt;0.001 for the changes from baseline).

-  Median  sleep  disturbance  score  was  zero  at  baseline.  Statistically  significant  reductions  in  sleep disturbance scores occurred at Week 52 (p=0.003) but not at Week 38 (p=0.271).

- Median weekly total scores were 1.8 points at baseline. At Weeks 38 and 52, median weekly total scores were 0.3 points and 0.5 points, respectively, lower than at baseline.

Median weekly wheezing scores were 0.0 points and 0.1 points at Weeks 38 and 52, resp., different from the baseline value of 0.3 points. Median weekly shortness of breath scores were both 0.1 points lower  at  Weeks  38  and  52  than  the  baseline  value  of  0.8  points.  The  differences  were  statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). Median weekly cough scores were 0.4 points at baseline. At Weeks 38 and 52, median weekly cough scores were 0.0 points and 0.1 points, respectively, lower than at baseline and the differences were statistically significant (p=0.019 at Week 38; p&lt;0.001 at Week 52).

-  At  Weeks  38  and  52,  median  weekly  inhalations  of  rescue  medication  were  2  inhalations  and  4 inhalations, respectively lower than the baseline value of 7 inhalations (p&lt;0.001 for the changes from baseline).

## Asthma exacerbations

A total of 13 (11.8%) patients reported asthma exacerbations over the entire 12-month study period. 8  (7.3%)  patients  each  reported  one  exacerbation  during  months  6-9  and  3  (2.7%)  patients  each reported one exacerbation during months 9-12. 3 patients had exacerbations of asthma both during the first 6-month period and during the second 6-month period.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Step-up indication

Demonstration that both strengths of Labazenit result in a higher efficacy of budesonide than an ICS monotherapy i.e. Pulmicort, is needed to support the step-up indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the pivotal phase III study BUSAL III-02-1, three study arms were included: Labazenit 150 µg/25 µg bid, Labazebit 300 µg/25 µg bid and Pulmicort 400 µg bid. The study design makes a comparison of a FDC with a considered lower dose of ICS dose (Labazenit 150 µg/25 µg) with a doubled dose of ICS (Pulmicort 400 µg). For the primary endpoint, PEF, both Labazenit 150/25 µg and Labazenit 300/25 µg treatments were superior to Pulmicort 400 µg after 12 weeks of treatment (Labazenit 150/25 µg vs. Pulmicort:  p&lt;0.001;  Labazenit  300/25  µg  vs.  Pulmicort:  p=0.004).  Even,  when  adjusting  for performing 3 comparisons, the (non)-significance of the comparisons would remain the same i.e. the Labazenit formulations are still superior to Pulmicort by at least 15 L/min. It was also demonstrated that the switch from Pulmicort, the reference treatment, after 12 weeks to Labazenit 150 µg/25 µg or Labazenit 300/25 µg resulted in statistically significant increases in morning PEF values from week 12 to week 18 and 24 within both treatment groups (p&lt;0.001). For PEF neither at week 12 nor at week 24 the difference between the two Labazenit strengths (150/25 µg and 300/25 µg) was statistically significant. Therefore, a dose response was not demonstrated between the two doses of Labazenit.

## Dose response inhaled corticosteroids

In study BUSAL III-02-1, as only a comparison with one dose of reference ICS budesonide (Pulmicort 400 µg) was made, the study design is not sensitive to conclusively demonstrate the equivalence/noninferiority regarding inflammatory control. The results of this study therefore do not provide evidence regarding  the  therapeutic  equivalence  regarding  the  ICS  doses.  As  no  difference  between  the  two strengths of Labazenit were observed (no dose response), the CHMP raised that the study design was not sensitive to conclusively assess comparability of the anti-inflammatory control.

## Comparable anti-inflammatory treatment

FEV1  also  increased  after  12  weeks  with  both  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  Labazenit  300/25  µg  with differences in increases in FEV1 compared to Pulmicort of 130 ml and 120 ml respectively. The As per CHMP's  request  the  Applicant  provided  post-hoc  analysis  regarding  the  primary  and  secondary endpoints  conducted  with  a  Bonferroni  correction  as  3  simultaneous  comparisons  were  made.  The superiority of the two strengths of Labazenit over the comparator Pulmicort was demonstrated for the primary endpoint PEF even after the Bonferroni correction.

Between  the  end  of  the  efficacy  phase  and  the  start  of  the  safety  phase  in  the  group  PulmicortLabazenit 150/25 µg, FEV1 already improved and in the group Pulmicort-Labazenit 300/25 µg, FEV1 already  decreased explaining that after  the  switch  a  similar  improvement  was  found  and  explaining that no statistical difference was found in difference of improvement at 24 weeks while at week 24 the FEV1 differs. According to the Applicant, an almost significant difference at the end of the 24 weeks treatment  was  demonstrated  in  patients  receiving  Labazenit  300/25  µg  continuously  and  those previously  on  Pulmicort.  However  the  Applicant  did  not  discuss  why  patients  switched  to  Labazenit 300/25 µg and did not demonstrate the same PEF improvement as observed at week 12.

Actual mean FEV1 values at the end of the study (week 24) were higher after 24-week treatment with Labazenit 150/25 µg or Labazenit 300/25 µg treatment compared to 12-week treatment with Labazenit 150/25 µg or Labazenit 300/25 µg preceded by 12-week reference treatment. The Applicant explained that the mean FEV1 value for the patient group receiving Pulmicort during the first 12 weeks and who switched to Labazenit 150/25 µg was higher than for the patients group who switched to Labazenit 300/25 µg (2.41 versus 2.20) because the randomization did not balance treatment groups among the covariate levels. This explanation was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During  the  GCP  inspection,  it  was  noticed  that  the  secondary  parameter  spirometric  values  (FEV1, FEV1 % predicted and FVC) were not analyzed as specified in the study protocol. The protocol specified to  use  the  highest  spirometric  values  of  three  satisfactory  and  reproducible  spirometry  maneuvers, while in the database and in the clinical study report as filed, the lowest values of three satisfactory and reproducible spirometry maneuvers have been used. Therefore it is not know whether the highest of  the  lowest  of  the  three  reproducible  measurements  were  being  used.  The  Applicant  provided  as requested re-analysis for the two secondary efficacy parameters with the highest values recorded in the CRF. The difference with the originally presented values were small.

The fact that in the clinical studies the results of PEF and FEV1, after only 12 hours withdrawal of study treatment, and the symptom scores, are influenced by both budesonide and salmeterol was raised by the  CHMP  during  the  evaluation.  A  difference  in  anti-inflammattory  effect  of  budesonide  could  be masked by the broncholidation effect of salmeterol. The Applicant justified that PEF and FEV1 can be used to demonstrate the same anti inflammatory effect between treatments in line with the asthma guidelines and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. However, the obtained results must be univocal  and  represent  the  underlying  pathophysiological  mechanism  of  what  is  being  studied:  the same  anti-inflammatory  effect.  The  design  of  the  study  BUSAL-III-02-1  can  not  be  used  to demonstrate that  Labazenit  provides  a  similar  anti-inflammatory  control  than  the  reference  product PulmicortThe  Applicant  was  requested  to  provide  further  proof  for  similar  inflammation  control. Exacerbation  numbers  or  rates,  especially  of  severe  exacerbations  could  have  been  used  as  the parameter  to  demonstrated  equivalent  anti-inflammatory  control  between  Labazenit  and  Pulmicort, provided that the numbers are large enough. However, in the Phase III studies , this was not the case: the numbers of exacerbations were too small to detect a potential statistically significant difference. Moreover, exacerbations were not homogeneously defined in the different Phase III studies: in study BUSAL III-02-1 as a safety parameter and in studies BUSAL III-05-1, BUSAL III-08-1 and BUSAL III06-1 as an efficacy parameter. In the study BUSAL III-08-1 the definition of exacerbation was more strict.  The  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  Phase  III  studies  were  not  designed  to  demonstrate differences in exacerbations and that longer studies duration would have been needed.

The open label study BUSAL III-06-1 evaluated the long term effect of Labazenit 300/25 µg BID on the improvement of lung function and asthma control symptoms. In this one dose study, improvements obtained  during  the  blind  part  of  the  study  were  sustained  during  the  extension  phase  .  For  the primary  efficacy  parameter  at  weeks  38  and  52,  morning  PEF  was  44.4  L/min  and  44.8  L/min, respectively, higher than the baseline value of 341.5 L/min (p&lt;0.001 for the changes from baseline) compare to 382.9 and 377.7 at week 12 and 24 respectively. For FEV1 a small, clinically not relevant difference is seen with the end of the blind phase. All asthma symptoms were more improved at the end of study BUSAL III-06-1. However, for this study patients were recruited from the one way blind study BUSAL III-05-1. Therefore, selection bias might be present assuming that the patient with best efficacy  and/or  best  safety  would  be  more  willing  to  continue  than  others.  As  a  consequence  the Applicant was requested to include exacerbations as an important identified risk in the proposed RMP.

## Substitution indication

Demonstration of similar bronchodilation, asthma control and asthma inflammation with the reference need to be established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Salmeterol

Study BUSAL II-10-1 is the main study to demonstrate similar bronchodilation of salmeterol between Labazenit  and  the  reference  product  Serevent.  BUSAL  II-10-1  was  a  single  dose,  cross-over bronchodilation  studiy  in  48  patients  with  persistent  asthma  with  a  lung  function  limitation  with reversibility.  Study  BUSAL  II-10-1  was  designed  to  prove  bronchodilation  equivalence  between Labazenit and Serevent: patients were symptomatic according to GINA criteria and different dosages of Labazenit  with  respect  to  salmeterol  were  used  (25,  12.5  and  6.25  µg)  and  compared  to  different dosages of Serevent administered as DPI or MDI.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  mean  change  in  FEV1,max  (L)  the  mean  change  for  Labazenit 150/25 µg was 0.64 ± 0.46 L, while this was 0.66 ± 0.39 L for Seretide Diskus. The p value between treatments is 0.776 and the 98.33 % CI is -0.16 - 0.12 just outside the predefined limit of equivalence (0.15). With a wider margin set at 0.2L, therapeutical equivalence would have been demonstrated (the 98.33%  CI  would  have  been  within  the  acceptance  range).  As  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in safety parametes was observed in this study, the CHMP was able to conclude on the non-inferiority of the salmeterol component based on the totality of evidence available despite the CI found. The mean change FEV1 over 12 h was comparable between the two groups: Labazenit 150/25 µg 7.03 ± 18.28 L, Serevent  Discus  8.30  ±  16.31,  difference  -0.92  ±  2.81  95%  CI  -6.46  -  4.62  p=0.74.  Also  various other secondary efficacy endpoints, FEV1 AUC 8-12 h, PEF and FVC, were not statistically different.

Only  one  dose  of  the  reference  salmeterol  was  included  because  lower  doses  of  salmeterol  are  not commercially available. No comparisons between doses of Labazenit could be made. However, as the study had a cross over design, the observed differences are corrected for differences between patients and reflect the differences within patients. Therefore, the observed differences are most likely to be attributed to the different dosages.

In the clinical study BUSAL-II-10-1, no clinically relevant differences were seen in clinically important parameters, like heart rate, blood pressure and potassium. Additional safety information with respect to  potassium and blood glucose was provided by the Applicant during the evaluation which was reassuring. The safety of Labazenit was further confirmed in the phase III studies including the extension study BUSAL-III-06-1 and the long term safety study. No unexpected adverse events were reported (see clinical safety section).

The Applicant submitted during the evaluation extensive literature data to support the dose related duration of salmeterol's bronchodilating effect observed in study BUSAL-II-10-1.  As demonstrated in the BUSAL -II-10-1 study and in the literature, the peak response is similar in the range of 25-50 µg salmeterol.  However,  differences  of  the  duration  of  bronchodilation  effect  between  doses  become apparent after 6 h of dosing, especially after the 12 h observation period. The 12 h observation period was  not  included  in  the  BUSAL  II-10-1  study.  In  the  literature,  the  bronchodilating  effect  and  its duration with the 6.25 mcg salmeterol dose, the lowest dose used in the BUSAL II-10-I study, have not been described.

The dose related duration of bronchodilation is not specific for salmeterol. The dose related duration of bronchodilation is also described for salmeterol´s main comparator, formoterol. Formoterol showed a dose related duration of response, with formoterol 6 µg being the lowest effective dose. Bronchodilation is observed for at least 8 hours after formoterol 6 µg, and for 12 hours after formoterol 12 µg and 24 µg. The time course of bronchodilation observed with formoterol 6 µg is most variable, with sustained bronchodilation being observed for periods varying from 8-12 hours. The observed dose related  duration  of  bronchodilation  seems  therefore  being  a  class  characteristic,  which  supports  the observed difference in AUC FEV1 8-12 h between the different doses of salmeterol in study BUSAL-II10-1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  together  the  data  provide  evidence  that  the  bronchodilatory  effect  of  BUSAL  150/25  µg  is comparable to Serevent Diskus 50 µg and no clinically important differences are apparent.

In study BUSAL II-03-1, administration of a single dose of Labazenit and Serevent Diskus resulted in similar  broncholilator  effects  of  salmeterol  and  the  difference  was  within  the  predefine  equivalence range.  The  study  design  is  not  sensitive  to  conclusively  assess  comparability  of  the  bronchodilation effect  of  salmeterol  because  only  one  dose  of  the  test  and  the  comparator  was  used,  comparability cannot be claimed as it is not known whether the studies were sensitive enough to pick up differences if  present.  A  conclusion  on  equivalence  of  broncholilation  effect  between  Labazenit  and  Serevent therefore cannot be drawn from this study.

## Budesonide

The same results and conclusions are applicable as for the step-up indication (see above). Equivalence with regards to the number of exacerbations has not been demonstrated.

## Comparison of Labazenit with other approved LABA/ICS fixed combinations

For this purpose two supportive studies, studies BUSAL III-08-1 and BUSAL III-05-1, were performed. In  study  BUSAL  III-05-1  the  higher  Labazenit  dose  (300/25  µg)  showed  a  similar  improvement  in morning PEF as Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg. Fluticasone is a stronger ICS and for a comparable dose less  fluticasone  was  expected  to  be  used.  For  both  morning  PEF  and  FEV1,  and  the  symptomatic secondary efficacy variables treatment with Labazenit 300/25 µg and Seretide Diskus 500/50 µg did not show statistically significant differences. The improvements in PEF and FEV1 are clinically relevant. However, only one dose of both Labazenit (300/50 µg) and Seretide (500/50 µg) was used and the study design not sensitive to conclusively asses comparability of the anti-inflammatory control. Noninferiority was therefore not proven. In study BUSAL III-08-1, the lower Labazenit dose (150/25 µg) was compared with Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/12 µg BID. Both treatments similarly improved PEF and FEv1, the asthma symptoms and the use of rescue medications. The improvements in PEF and FEV1 are  clinically  relevant,  although  morning  PEF  improvement  is  marginally  above  clinical  relevant difference of 20 L/min as defined for the non-inferiority margin. The improvement in FEV1 is clinically relevant.  However,  also  in  this  study  only  one  dose  of  both  Labazenit  (300/50  µg)  and  Symbicort (300/25 µg) was tested hence employing a design not sensitive to conclusively assess comparability of the anti-inflammatory effect of budesonide.

## Persistence of efficacy

For  demonstration  of  the  long  term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Labazenit,  study  BUSAL  III-05-01  was continued open label for up to 24 weeks as study BUSAL III-06-01. This extension phase could support the step up and substitution indication.

Post hoc analyses demonstrated that there was no difference between groups in demographics, FEV1, PEF asthma control and adverse events. The amount of treatment related events was higher for those patients who were not included. An important inclusion criterion for study BUSAL III-06-01 was that patients had not experienced a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation in the preceding 8 weeks. It was shown that an experienced exacerbation did not introduce a bias. The results of the long term safety/efficacy regarding the exacerbation rate are difficult to interpret. Also, study BUSAL III-06-01 lacks a comparison with a currently approved comparable asthma treatment, which makes it difficult determine  the  comparative  benefit.  This  is  an  issue  considering  The  observed  higher  incidence  of exacerbations  with  Labazenit  in  study  BUSAL  III-05-01  questions  the  long  term  anti-inflammatory effect of budesonide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

## Step-up indication

The results of study BUSAL III-02-01 demonstrated superiority of both doses of Labazenit versus the budesonide active comparator alone (Pulmicort 400 µg) for the primary efficacy variable morning PEF, and for FEV1 % predicted. However, a dose response between the two different strengths of Labazenit was  not  shown.  For  this  reason  study  BUSAL  III-02-1  is  not  considered  sensitive  to  demonstrate comparable anti-inflammatory control of budesonide between Labazenit and the comparator.

## Substitution indication

The PD study BUSAL II-10-1 was designed to prove bronchodilation comparability between Labazenit and the  salmeterol  active  comparator  alone  (Serevent).The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  mean change in FEV1,max (L). The 98.33% confidence interval is -0.16 - 0.12 just outside the predefined limit of equivalence (150mL). As no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters was observed in this study, the CHMP was able to conclude on the non-inferiority of the salmeterol component based on the totality  of  evidence  available  despite  the  CI  found.  A  dose  response  for  Labazenit  was  seen  for  the duration of the response as expressed with FEV1AUC8-12h.

As for the step-up indication a comparable anti-inflammatory effect of budesonide between Labazenit and the budesonide active comparator would have needed to be established which is not the case.

In  the  supportive  studies  BUSAL  III-05-1  and  BUSAL  III-08-1  comparing  Labazenit  with  other  fixed combinations of a LABA and an ICS (budesonide), the responses of the lung function parameters and the  clinical  parameters  were  comparable  to  the  responses  in  the  pivotal  study  BUSAL  III-02-1. However, only one dose of both Labazenit and the budesonide active comparator was used in both studies and therefore the study design was not sensitive to conclusively assess comparability of the budesonide anti-inflammatory control.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

One  of  the  key  safety  objectives  of  the  phase  III  clinical  development  program  for  the  Labazenit 300/25 and 150/25 µg fixed combination was to assess the safety and tolerability by evaluating the incidence of AEs and laboratory abnormalities and to identify any potential new AEs.

The main safety concerns for ICS/LABA combinations include local AEs such as cough, dysphonia and oral candidiasis, systemic AEs including adrenal suppression, decreased bone mineral density, growth suppression,  cataract  and  glaucoma,  hypokalemia,  hyperglycemia  and  also  tachycardia  as  well  as possible paradoxical bronchospasm.

The safety of Labazenit was compared to the budesonide monotherapy group and to the two marketed ICS-LABA combinations, fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol, over 12 weeks in Phase III studies. The safety of the two doses of the Labazenit was compared across the controlled and medium term exposed cohorts. The long term safety was assessed in the long-term exposed cohort with 1 year exposure to  the  study  drug.  According  to  these  objectives,  the  analysis  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  of Labazenit  from  the  4  phase  III  clinical  trials  has  been  performed  on  the  pooled  safety  data  and  is presented separately for the three defined cohorts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from phase III clinical trials were pooled in three different analysis cohorts:

- The \"controlled cohort' included all data from patients exposed to the study treatment for 12 weeks.  This  applied  to  the  12-week  efficacy  controlled  phases  of  studies  BUSAL  III-02-1, BUSAL  III-05-1  and  BUSAL  III-08-1.  Data  collected  from  week  12  to  week  24  with  the Labazenit  combination  after  the  efficacy  period  under  Budesonide  in  study  BUSAL  III-02-1 were also included in this cohort.
- The \"medium-term exposed cohort' included all data from patients exposed for 24 weeks (6 months) to the two dosages (300/25 µg and 150/25 µg) of the Labazenit combination (study BUSAL III-02-1 and BUSAL III-05-1).
- The \"long-term exposed cohort' included all data from patients exposed for 52 weeks (1 year) to the highest dosage (300/25 µg) of the Labazenit combination (study BUSAL III-06-1).

The presentation of the pooled safety data rather than the results of each individual study is justified since the phase III have similar designs.

A fourth population comes from subjects or patients exposed in phase I and II studies that were not included  in  the  pooled  analysis.  Data  from  these  studies  will  be  presented  when  appropriate  to underline specific safety issues.

## Patient exposure

During phase III:

- 301 patients were exposed to at least one dose of Labazenit 150/25µg, 109 (36%) of them being exposed for at least 24 weeks
- 553 patients were exposed to at least one dose of Labazenit 300/25µg, 406 (73%) patients were exposed for 24 weeks and 101 (18%) patients were exposed for 1 year

Labazenit= Fixed-dose combination Budesonide/Salmeterol. Sources: SMB-BUSAL-SD033, SMB-BUSAL-SS032, SMB-BUSAL-SS071, SMB-BUSAL-SD101, SMB-BUSAL-DP102, BUSAL II-03-1, BUSAL II-101 and BUSAL II-10-2 CSRs.

Both  salmeterol  and  budesonide  are  well  known  substances  and  have  been  used  for  a  long  and extensive  way.  The  Applicant  performed  three  studies  wherein  406  patients  were  exposed  for  24 weeks to the highest dose and a long-term study wherein 101 patients were exposed for more than one year. This is considered sufficient by the CHMP.

## Adverse events

## Phase III studies

In the 12-week controlled cohort, 283 (23.41%) patients reported 465 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Across the treatment groups, the percentage of patients with a TEAE in the controlled cohort was around 20% except in the Symbicort group with 46.49% of TEAEs.

In BUSAL III-08-1 a higher rate of patients had TEAEs both with Symbicort and with Labazenit 150/25 µg. This rate of TEAEs nevertheless did not result in a higher percentage of drug-related TEAEs in this group (4.39%).

Across all treatment groups, most events were considered mild or moderate in intensity.

## Controlled cohort

The most frequently reported TEAEs with both Labazenit doses (300/25µg and 150/25µg) irrespective of  causality  were  nasopharyngitis  (16  patients,  2.89%  and  8  patients,  2.66%  respectively),  viral infection  (7  patients,  1.27%  and 5 patients, 1.66% respectively) and dysphonia (6 patients, 1.08% and 4 patients, 1.33% respectively).

The other most frequently reported TEAEs with:

- Labazenit 300/25µg were pharyngitis (13 patients, 2.35%) and upper respiratory tract infection (6 patients, 1.08%)

-  Labazenit  150/25µg  were  headache  (8  patients,  2.66%)  and  asthma  exacerbation  (6  patients, 1.99%).  These  two  AEs  were  the  most  commonly  reported  with  Symbicort  (13.16%  and  11.40% respectively)  in  study  BUSAL  III-08-1  comparing  both  treatments.  The  incidence  of  those  AEs  with Labazenit 150/25µg was lower than with Symbicort.

The  most  frequently  reported  AE  with  Labazenit  (300/25µg  and  150/25µg)  assessed  by  the investigator as having at least a possible relationship to Labazenit (&gt;1% MedDRA preferred term) was dysphonia (1.08% and 1.33% respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  generally  low  (&lt;3%  in  the  Labazenit  groups)  and  no  significant difference  in  intensity  and/or  frequency  was  observed  between  the  new  fixed  combination  and  the reference groups, except for the incidence of headache (13.16%) and asthma exacerbation (11.40%) which was higher in the Symbicort group.

## Medium-term exposed cohort

The most common TEAEs experienced by patients were in the same main classes as in the controlled cohort (12-week exposure).

The most frequently reported AEs with Labazenit irrespective of causality were:

- nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis (23 patients (4.63%)) with Labazenit 300/25µg
- nasopharyngitis, viral infection and cough (4 patients (3.17%)) with Labazenit 150/25µg.

No difference between the two doses of the Labazenit could be noted from the incidence of the most common TEAEs after 24-week exposure to the treatment.

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  having  at  least  a  possible relationship  to  Labazenit  (&gt;1%  MedDRA  preferred  term)  was  dysphonia  (2.01%  and  1.59%  with Labazenit 300/25µg and 150/25µg respectively) .

The  results  observed  in  the  controlled  cohort  (over  12  weeks  of  treatment)  were  confirmed  in  the medium-term exposed cohort (up to 24 weeks of treatment). The incidence of AEs remains generally low (&lt;5%) and no significant difference in intensity and/or frequency was observed between the two doses of the Labazenit.

## Long-term exposed cohort

The data over long-term exposure (up to 52 weeks) to the highest dosage of Labazenit (300/25µg BID)  confirmed  the  data  observed  over  shorter  periods  (12  and  24-weeks):  the  more  frequently reported  AE  was  nasopharyngitis  (14  patients,  12.73%).  Pharyngitis  (6  patients,  5.45%),  viral infection  (6  patients,  5.45%)  and  bronchitis  (5  patients,  4.55%)  complete  the  picture  of  the  most commonly reported events.

No drug-related AE was reported with an incidence over 1% after 52 weeks of exposure to Labazenit 300/25 µg.

The incidence of AEs in the long-term exposed cohort was higher than in the two other cohorts (see table below).

## Phase I and phase II studies

No new AEs were identified in the phase I and II trials and the frequency and intensity of AEs observed was comparable to those of the reference products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In BUSAL II-03-1 a total of 17 adverse events were reported during the whole study. After intake of BUDESONIDE-SALMETEROL, 9 patients reported 14 adverse events and 3 patients reported 3 adverse events after intake of Serevent Diskus.

The  most  common  adverse  events  reported  were  cough  and  hoarseness.  They  were  related  to  the study medication at possible or probable grade. They have been resolved spontaneously without any medication or therapy.

In BUSAL II-10-1 twenty-five (25) emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported. All emergent AEs were of mild to moderate intensity.

The most frequent adverse event reported was headache. Eight (8) episodes were reported, 1 in the Labazenit 150/6.25 µg group, 2 in the Labazenit 150/12.5 µg group, 1 in the Serevent Diskus 50 µg group and 4 in the Serevent Evohaler 2*25 µg group. 5 out of them were of mild intensity and 3 were of moderate intensity.

Two AEs were judged related to the study treatment: one episode of moderate tremor which occurred during the Labazenit 150/12.5 µg treatment period and one episode of hypokaliemia (mild intensity) which occurred during the Serevent Evohaler 2*25 µg treatment periods. Other emergent AEs were infrequent and unspecific, all of mild to moderate intensity.

In  BUSAL  II-10-2  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  were  hypertension  (19  episodes, 42.22% of emergent events) and headache (16 episodes, 35.56% of emergent AEs).

Hypertension  and  headache  were  also  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  assessed  as  related  to  the study treatment (respectively 18 episodes and 10 episodes).

One AE not related to  study  treatment  led  to  patient  withdrawal  in  the  Labazenit  300/25  µg  group (acute viral infection). All emergent AEs were of mild to moderate intensity.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Asthma exacerbations

The information collected in the different studies on asthma exacerbation was not homogeneous.

None of the exacerbations was considered to be SAEs and none led to withdrawal of the patient.

The  definition  of  asthma  exacerbation  was  not  homogeneous  in  the  different  studies.  Moreover, severity of asthma exacerbation was not defined besides in BUSAL III-08-1. Asthma exacerbations are considered as an parameter of asthma control i.e. inflammation control and are therefore discussed under  efficacy.  In  the  medium  term  exposed  cohort  and  long-term  exposed  cohort  patientns  only received Labazenit.

## Cardiac AEs and ECG abnormalities

## Cardiac AEs

## Controlled cohort

Eight  patients  had  cardiac  arrhythmias  during  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Half  of  them  were taking Labazenit 150/25µg.

All  events  were  of  mild  intensity.  All  were  assessed  as  treatment  related  except  an  episode  of palpitations reported by a patient taking Labazenit 300/25 µg.

None of these events were serious or led to withdrawal of a patient. All patients recovered without requiring any treatment.

## Medium exposed cohort

In addition to the events reported in the controlled cohort, a patient taking Labazenit 300/25 µg had an  episode  of  atrial  fibrillation  of  moderate  intensity.  This  event  was  assessed  as  unrelated  to  the treatment, not serious and did not require any corrective treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Long term exposed cohort

There were no reports of cardiac arrhythmia in patients exposed to Labazenit 300/25 µg for up to one year of treatment.

## ECG abnormalities

The incidence of ECG abnormalities was low in every treatment group (see table below). All events were  of  mild  intensity.  All  patients  recovered  from  these  events  and  none  resulted  in  permanent discontinuation of treatment. All events except the ECG T-wave inversion were reported as related to the study treatment.

In the medium exposed group, the incidence of ECG abnormalities was still low with a slightly higher percentage of abnormalities for longer duration of exposure to the treatment.

Four  AEs  were  reported  by  4  patients.  Two  events  came  from  the  controlled  cohort.  In  addition, myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation were reported with Labazenit 300/25µg.

The  event  of  atrial  fibrillation  of  moderate  intensity  was  considered  as  not  related  to  the  study treatment.

The heart rate corrected QTc intervals, using Bazett's correction method, were analysed. The number and percentages of significant delta QTc versus baseline values and of borderline and prolonged QTc values are presented in the table below. None of these findings were considered as clinically significant by the investigator and no AEs were reported in relation to these QTc values. No patients with such QTc values (or without) reported torsade de pointe during the Labazenit development.

Labazenit = Budesonide-Salmeterol Fixed-dose combination.

* Serevent 50µg taken with the Diskus or the Evohaler

Source: BUSAL II-03-1, BUSAL II-10-1, BUSAL II-10-2 and BUSAL III-08-1 CSRs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In BUSAL II-03-1 it seems that the two drugs are comparable regarding the ECG results and do not raise  significant  concerns.  This  is  quite  expected  after  a  single  dose.  Indeed,  previous  data  on salmeterol indicate that only large doses of inhaled salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias.

In BUSAL II-10-1 ECGs were taken at 60 minutes and 12 hours post dosing. QTc, QRS, RR and PQ levels remained unchanged in all groups within 12 hours after treatment intake (respectively: p=0.26, 0.11, 0.49 and 0.56).

In BUSAL II-10-2 QTc, QRS, RR and PQ remained unchanged during the study. No patients presented delta QTc &gt; 30 msec (between baseline and D14 of each period) or borderline or prolonged QTc.

Some patients presented non clinically significant findings on their ECG: all cases were either judged as normal or as clinically irrelevant by the investigator:

No  unexpected  safety  signals  were  present.  All  cardiac  events  (ECG)  were  in  line  of  expectation (BUSAL II-10-1, BUSAL II-10-2, BUSAL III-08-1).

## Paradoxical bronchospasms

There were no reports of paradoxical bronchospasm in patients with Labazenit at all.

## Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

No patients died during the course of any clinical trial performed with Labazenit.

## Serious AEs in the controlled cohort

A total of 5 patients had at least one SAE: 2 (0.36%) patients in the Labazenit 300/25 µg group and 1 (0.8%) patient in each reference group. No patient in the Labazenit 150/25µg group had a SAE.

None of these SAEs was considered related to treatment by the investigator.

## Serious AEs in the medium-term exposed cohort

Seven (1.12%) patients had at least one SAE: 4 patients with the higher dose and 3 patients with the lower dose of the fixed combination.

## Serious AEs in the long-term exposed cohort

Two  (1.82%)  patients  had  one  SAE  after  long-term  treatment  with  Labazenit  300/25µg.  None  was related to the treatment.

No SAEs were experienced by more than 1 patient in any treatment group in any cohort. A review of the frequency and types of events, as well as an assessment of potential relationships between the events and study medication, suggested that there was no trend for any SAE in any treatment group that could raise a particular new safety concern.

## Phase I and phase II studies

Only 1 SAE was observed with Labazenit 300/25 µg during the phase I and II trials, i.e. pyelonephritis in study SMB-BUSAL-DP102. This event was considered as not related to the study treatment by the investigator.

No  trend  for  any  SAE  in  any  treatment  group  is  observed  that  could  raise  a  particular  new  safety concern.  Only  bronchitis  in  Labazenit  150/25µg  group  is  been  assessed  as  possibly  related  to treatment.

## Laboratory findings

## Cortisol

Cortisol was measured in two studies:

- Study BUSAL III-02-1 with the assessment of morning plasma cortisol and 24h urinary cortisol in 15 patients per group after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment in a parallel design
- Study BUSAL II-10-2 with the assessment of both plasma and urinary cortisol over 24h in 40 patients in a cross-over design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the BUSAL III-02-1, no statistically significant changes from baseline to week 12 were observed in serum or urine cortisol levels within any of the treatment groups.

Over the whole study, from baseline to week 24, urinary cortisol levels were significantly increased during treatment with Labazenit 300/25µg (p=0.005) (see table below).

However, no definite conclusions can be drawn due to the low sample size of the groups in this study.

BUSAL  II-10-2  was  specifically  designed  and  had  more  power  to  detect  an  effect  of  the  Labazenit combination  on  cortisol  levels.  As  a  conclusion,  the  cortisol  suppression  observed  with  Labazenit 150/25µg and 300/25µg is similar to Pulmicort  400µg  and  is  weak  on  a  clinical  point  of  view.  The values  in  plasma  and  urinary  cortisol  are  in  line  with  the  literature  data  available  for  inhaled Budesonide.

## Potassium

Hypokalemia is a metabolic side effect expected with an ICS-LABA combination.

In  the  pharmacodynamic  single  dose  study  BUSAL  II-10-01  potassium  is  measured  properly: recommended dose is one capsule containing 25 µg salmeterol BID.

At the clinically important time T60 minutes no difference is been seen between Labazenit 150/25 µg and  Serevent  Diskus.  The  difference  with  baseline  was  for  Labazenit  150/25  µg  0.03±0.30  and  for Serevent Diskus 0.11±0.38.  No clinical difference was noted between baseline and 12-hour post-dose measurement.

In conclusion no differences are seen between Labazenit and Serevent Diskus. The level of potassium remained steady within 12 hours of study drug intake in all treatment groups (p=0.20 at 60-minute post-dose and p=0.88 at 12-hour post-dose measurement).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No clinical difference was noted between baseline and 60 minutes or 12-hour post-dose measurement.

There were very few patients with clinically significant potassium values during the Labazenit clinical development:  2  patients  with  Labazenit  300/25µg,  3  patients  with  Labazenit  150/25µg,  1  with Pulmicort, 1 with Symbicort and 1 patient with Serevent 50µg.

In  all  patients,  these  events  were  of  mild  intensity  and  related  to  the  study  drug  intake  (see  table below).

## Glucose

Hyperglycemia is a metabolic side effect expected with an ICS-LABA combination.

There were no significant changes in the controlled cohort with no noticeable differences between the different treatment groups.

The changes observed over 12 weeks in the Labazenit groups remained the same over longer periods (24 and 52 weeks).

In  all  studies  there  were very  few  patients  with  clinically  significant  (CS)  increase  of  glucose  values during treatment with Labazenit: 4 patients with Labazenit 300/25µg and 2 patients with Labazenit 150/25µg and 2 patients with Serevent 50µg (see table below).

Three of the five patients from the phase III studies had diabetes mellitus, which would explain their high glucose levels.

## Study BUSAL II-10-1

In  study  BUSAL II-10-1 evolution of glucose level at 60-minute post-dose was significantly different between groups (p=0.005).

The  increase  in  glucose  levels  observed  at  60  minutes  was  transient  as  no  more  differences  were present at 12-hour post-dose.

Glucose  level  remained  steady  between  baseline  and  12-hour  post-dose  measurement,  without difference between groups (p=0.92).

No clinical difference was noted between baseline and 12-hour post-dose measurement.

## Study BUSAL II-10-2

In study BUSAL II-10-2 the evolution of glucose level appeared to be statistically different between the treatment  groups.  However,  the  most  important  change  in  glucose  level  from  baseline  to  D11  was observed  during  treatment  with  placebo  (LSmeans  0.41±0.15  mmol/L).  The  statistical  difference between the treatment groups was therefore not clinically relevant.

## Safety in special populations

The  global  safety  profile  has  additionally  been  assessed  in  several  sub-populations  of  patients: according to demographic data: gender (male and female), age (≤55 years of age, &gt;55 and ≤65 years of age, and &gt;65 years of age) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (&gt;18 and ≤25 kg/m 2 , &gt;25 and ≤30 kg/m 2 and  &gt;  30  kg/m 2 at  baseline),  or  at  higher  risk  for  an  AE  related  to  their  asthma  severity  (FEV1% ≤60%, &gt;60 and ≤80% and &gt; 80%)) and their smoking status (smoking or not).The two tables below give an overview of AEs in each subgroup versus the global population of patients for the medium term exposed cohort. This provides indication of the AE onset, causality, intensity and seriousness in the subgroups compared to the global population.  The results show that there are no notable differences between the subgroups and the global population.

No specific AE appears to be significantly increased in any age subpopulation.

No difference in the most commonly reported AEs was observed between males and females. It was also the same as in the global population of patients.

The frequency of TEAEs increases with asthma severity; from 26.79% in patients with baseline FEV1% between  60  and  80%  to  34.21%  in  patients  with  baseline  FEV1%  below  60%.  No  difference  was observed on drug-related TEAEs (4.39% and 4.77% respectively).

The population of patients with FEV1% above 80% is not representative as there are only 6 patients. This is expected because of the study inclusion criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nasopharyngitis  was  most  commonly  reported  in  patients  with  baseline  FEV1%  between  60%  and 80%,  which  is  the  largest  population  of  patients.  On  the  other  side,  viral  infections  were  most commonly reported in patients with baseline FEV1% below 60%.

No  specific  AEs  appear  to  be  significantly  increased  in  any  subpopulation  based  on  the  patient's smoking status.

## Safety related drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug interactions of Labazenit are the same as for the marketed forms of budesonide and salmeterol.

Interactions  with  Cytochrome  P  (CYP)3A4  inhibitors  (like  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  ritonavir)  is described. In addition, the following drugs may interact with the salmeterol component: β-adrenergic blockers, xanthine derivatives, steroids and diuretics, quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, phenothiazines, antihistamines (terfenadine), monoamine  oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, L-Dopa, L-thyroxine, oxytocin, halogenated hydrocarbons and digitalis glycosides.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In total, 13 (1.08%) patients discontinued the study due to an AE in the controlled cohort: 7 (1.27%) in  the  Labazenit  300/25µg  group,  1  (0.33%)  in  the  Labazenit  150/25µg  group,  2  (1.61%)  in  the Pulmicort group and 3 (2.63%) in the Symbicort group.

Four  (4)  patients  had  AEs  considered  related  to  study  medication  by  the  investigators:  3  (0.54%) patients in the Labazenit 300/25µg group and 1 (0.88%) patient in the Symbicort group.

The AEs reported during Labazenit intake are expected following treatment with an ICS and/or LABA. There is therefore no particular safety concern raised from data on AEs leading to discontinuation in the controlled cohort.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Budesonide and salmeterol have been in therapeutic use, alone, and in combination for many years. Moreover they are recognized  as  high  uptake  products  to  treat  a  common  disease  and  their  safety profile is well known. Although not currently approved as fixed combination the separate components are readily available and have presumably been used in combination by co-administration.

During the phase III studies, 301patients, of which 109 (36%) exposed for at least 24 weeks were exposed to Labazenit 150/25µg and 553 patients, of which 406 (73%) were exposed for 24 weeks and 101 (18%) exposed for 1 year to Labazenit 300/25µg. However, no long term safety data (52 weeks) of the lower dose of Labazenit 150/25 were provided. According to the ICH E1A guideline 'Population exposure:  the  extent  of  population  exposure  to  assess  clinical  safety',  the  Applicant  provided  12 months safety data for the highest strength of Labazenit (300 µg/25 µg) which is considered sufficient. Long term use is included as important missing information in the proposed RMP.

One of the specific AEs of interest is asthma exacerbation. The exacerbations were similar with the active comparators in study BUSAL III-05-1, whereas more patients using Labazenit  300/25 µg (n=7, 2%)  than  using  Seretide  (n=1,  0.9%)  experienced  an  exacerbation.  The  number  of  observed exacerbations is small, and the observation period is too short to be conclusive. Asthma exacerbations is  included in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC and as an important identified risk in the proposed RMP.

Other specific AEs of interest regarding the LABA component are the cardiac events, regarding which no unexpected safety signals were present. All cardiac events (i.e ECG deviations) were in line with the expectations.  Also  no  increased  cases  of  hypokalaemia  or  hyperglycaemia  were  noticed,  although muscle cramps and headache were more frequently reported. However, the reported number of events is  low.  No  trend  for  any  SAE  in  any  treatment  group  is  observed  that  could  raise  a  particular  new safety concern. None of these SAEs was considered related to treatment. No trends for withdrawals were observed. The majority have been assessed as unrelated or unlikely to be related to treatment. Hypokaliema, hyperglycaemia, QTc prolongation and adrenergic cardiac effects are included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the proposed SmPC and as important identified risks in the proposed RMP.

It  is  known  that  cortisol  can  be  suppressed  by  a  synthetic  glucocorticosteroid  like  budesonide,  even when inhaled. Labazenit  300/25 µg appears to decrease serum cortisol (AUC0-12 h) stronger than Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  Pulmicort  Turbohaler  400  µg+  Serevent  Diskus  50  µg.  According  to  the predefined equivalence margin (-20% ; 20% of 99.15 CI of the difference in relative change serum cortisol (AUC0-12 h)) equivalence is established. The observed results are in line with previous results published in literature and the 20 % safety margin is justified by bibliographical data. Systemic effects of  glucocorticosteroid  treatment  are  included in  sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  proposed  SmPC  and  as important identified risk in the proposed RMP.

The number of elderly patients included in the clinical development program was quite low (67 patients in  total  so  less  than  5  %  and  no  patient  over  75  years  of  age  was  included).  A  statement recommending  caution  when  treating  elederly  patients  due  to  the  limited  data  available  has  been included  in  section  4.2  of  the  proposed  SmPC  and  use  in  patients  over  65  years  old  is  included  as important missing information in the proposed RMP.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Budesonide and salmeterol are well known substances used in the treatment of asthma. Although not currently approved as fixed combination the separate components are licensed and have presumably been used in combination by co-administration of LABA and ICS according to treatment guidelines.

In the clinical studies, both Labazenit 300/25 µg and Labazenit 300/25 µg were safe and well tolerated over a treatment period of up to one year.There were no differences in adverse events after short-term exposure  and  longterm  exposure.  The  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  are  comparable  with comparator  products.  No  new  safety  issue  emerged.  No  specific  AE  appears  to  be  significantly increased in any subpopulation.

In the PK studies a higher Cmax was observed for salmeterol. A high Cmax can be related to an increase of  AEs  like  tremor,  increased  glucose,  hypokalaemia  or  muscle  cramps.  The  observed  incidence  of these  events  was  low  in  the  controlled  cohort  and  long  term  cohort,  indicating  that  the  clinical relevance of the findings is probably limited.

For cardiac events, no  unexpected  safety  signals were  present.  All  cardiac  events  and  ECG abnormalities were in line with expectation. Regarding the effect on serum cortisol Labazenit 300/25 µg  appears  to  induce  a  stronger  decrease  than  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  the  active  comparator (budesonide+salmeterol), but the difference is within the predefined equivalence margins.

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  Labazenit  is  considered  as  sufficiently  characterized  and  can  be satisfactorily managed in clinical practice.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between budesonide and salmeterol was confirmed by results from study BUSAL-SD101.

Comparable budesonide exposure following inhalation of Labazenit 300/25 µg and Pulmicort Turbohaler 2x200  µg  was  shown  in  studies  BUSAL-SS032  and  BUSAL  SS033  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  lung deposition of budesonide in asthma patients was demonstrated to be ~20% lower for Labazenit 150/25 µg than for Symbicort Turbohaler 160/4.5 µg in study SD111 but the FPD of the batches used in the PK study differed significantly. After correction for FPD, the exposure to budesonide was comparable for Labazenit and Symbicort/Turbohaler..However this is not acceptable as the correction based on FPD was not pre-specified in the study protocol and adjustment/correction by FPD of the PK parameters cannot be accepted unless a clear in vitro/in vivo correlation has been established.

PK  data  and in  vitro data  support  the  dose  proportionality  with  respect  to  budesonide  between Labazenit 300/25 and Labazenit 150/25. The pharmacokinetic profile of salmeterol was the same for Labazenit 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg in study BUSAL-DP102.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based  on  the  results  in  study  BUSAL-SD121  in  healthy  volunteers,  systemic  bioavailability  of salmeterol was higher following inhalation of Labazenit 150/25 µg compared to Serevent Diskus 50 µg.

## Pharmacodynamic

In Study BUSAL II-3-1 no significant difference was observed in the mean change in FEV1max between Labazenit 150/25 µg and Serevent 25 µg. Labazenit 150/25 had a  2.72 ± 0.79 L (mean ±SD) abd Serevent  2.69 ± 0.81 L, resulting in that the 95 % CI (-0.0339: 0.1025) was within the range of equivalence (-0.15: 0.15).

In Study BUSAL II-10-1 several strengths of Labazenit, i.e. 150/6.25 µg, 150/6.25 µg, 150/12.5 µg and 150/25 µg respectively, were compared with the comparators Salmeterol Diskus 50 µg, Serevent Evohaler 25 µg and Serevent Evohaler 50 µg. The mean increase in FEV1max was comparable between Labazenit 150/25 µg (mean ± sd) (2.68 ± 0.86 L) and Serevent Diskus 50 µg (2.66 ± 0.70 L). A dose response  regarding  the  duration  of  the  bronchodilatory  AUC  FEV1  8-12  h  effect  was  observed  for Labazenit  150/6.25  µg  (LS  mean  ±  SE  8,50  ±  2,49  L/s*h)  and  150/25  µg  (8,92  ±  0,93  L/s*h) (p=0.01). This effect is supported by a dose response of glucose and potassium after 60 minutes post dose.

## Cortisol

In  study  BUSAL  II-10-2  both  strengths  of  Labazenit  were  compared  to  Pulmicort  Turbohaler  + Serevent Diskus and Placebo. The decrease in plasma cortisol was highest in Labazenit 300/25 µg, but the 95% CI for the difference was within the prespecified margin of ± 20%. The chosen limits were justified by literature. Equivalence with respect to cortisol influence is established.

## Clinical studies

## Step up indication

In study BUSAL III-02-1, three study arms were included: Labazenit 150/25 µg bid, Labazenit 300/25 µg  bid  and  Pulmicort  400  µg  bid.  The  study  demonstrated  a  significantly  higher    increase  of  the primary efficacy parameter morning PEF of both doses of Labazenit over Pulmicort at week 12. This was supported by FEV1 % predicted (Labazenit 150/25 µg 12,51 ±13,33%, Labazenit 300/25 12,49 ±12,10 µg %, Pulmicort 400 µg  8,45±13,26%) and improvement in asthma symptom scores.

## Substitution indication

Besides comparability of bronchodilation by salmeterol (pharmacodynamics)  and  inflammatory control/asthma  control  by  budesonide  (step-up  indication)  clinical  studies  comparing  Labazenit  with other fixed dose combinations were also performed (BUSAL III-05-01 and Study BUSAL III-08-01).

In order to support the substitution indication the Applicant provided two studies comparing Labazenit 150/25 µg with Symbicort 200/12 µg (BUSAL III-08-1) and the high dose of Labazenit 300/25 µg with Seretide 500/50 µg (BUSAL III-05-1). Both studies demonstrated no difference in morning PEF, FEV1 and  symptomatic  asthma  control  between  treatments  supporting  comparability  of  other  fixed combination with Labazenit.

## Persistence of efficacy

In  study  BUSAL  III-02-1  persistence  of  efficacy  was  demonstrated  for  Labazenit  300/25  µg  and Labazenit 150/25 µg, which was confirmed by the results from study BUSAL III-06-01 for Labazenit 300/25 µg. The improvements in pulmonary functions and in asthma symptoms that were measured during study BUSAL III-05-1 were sustained throughout this 6-month extension study BUSAL III-06-1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

## Pharmacokinetics

Comparable  exposure  of  budesonide  for  the  highest  Labazenit  strength  (300/25  µg)  and  the comparator product Pulmicort Turbohaler 2x200 µg was indicated by results from studies SMB-BUSALSS033 and SMB-BUSAL-SD032 following single and multiple dose inhalation. However, the variability was high and the 90% CI fell outside the 80-125% range. For the lowest strength, budesonide lung deposition was 15-23% lower following Labazenit 150/25 µg as compared to Symbicort 160/4.5 µg in study BUSAL-SD111.

In  vitro  comparison  of  several  batches  demonstrated  a  similar  mean  FPD  for  Labazenit  as  for Pulmicort.  FDP  fraction  correlates  linearly  with  whole-lung  deposition.  When  correcting  the  PK parameters  by  FPD  of  the  Labazenit  and  Symbicort  batches  used,  the  lung  deposition  of  Labazenit 150/25 µg and Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4.5 µg was comparable. However this is not acceptable as the correction based on FPD was not pre-specified in the study protocol and adjustment/correction by FPD  of  the  PK  parameters  cannot  be  accepted  unless  a  clear  in  vitro/in  vivo  correlation  has  been established.  The  test  and  reference  products  batches  should  be  as  similar  as  possible  in  all  their  in vitro  parameters  to  avoid  the  need  for  correction  by  FPD.  Combining  all  3  PK  studies  together,  a comparable  inflammation  control  by  budesonide  in  Labazenit  as  with  the  reference  product  can  be expected but has not been demonstrated.

For  salmeterol  bioavailability  between  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  Serevent  Diskus  50  µg  was  only compared in one study with adequate salmeterol bioanalysis. In this study comparable bioavailability could  not  be  demonstrated.  Dose  proportionality  of  budesonide  was  demonstrated in  vitro for  FPD between both dosage strengths but the size range of particles &lt;2 μm was slightly higher for Labazenit 300/25  compared  to  Labazenit  150/25.  PK  data  showed  dose  proportionality  with  respect  to budesonide  between  Labazenit  300/25  and  Labazenit  150/25  when  correction  for  FPD  was  applied. However  this  is  not  acceptable  as  the  correction  based  on  FPD  was  not  pre-specified  in  the  study protocol and adjustment/correction by FPD of the PK parameters cannot be accepted unless a clear in vitro/in  vivo  correlation  has  been  established.  .  The  plasma  profile  of  salmeterol  was  the  same  for Labazenit  150/25 μg and 300/25 μg in study DP102.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Substitution indication

In  study  BUSAL  II-03-1  only  one  dose  of  Labazenit  and  Serevent  were  tested.  Therefore,  no conclusions  regarding  comparability  can  be  drawn  as  the  design  was  not  sensitive  to  conclusively assess comparability. In Study BUSAL II-10-1 the mean increase in FEV1max was comparable between Labazenit  150/25  and  Serevent  Diskus  50,  but  the  95%  CI  (-0.16:  0.12  L)  was  just  outside  the predefined margin of (-0.15: 0.15 L). With a wider equivalence limit of 0.2 L, the 98.33 % CI would have been within acceptance. The CHMP was able to conclude on the non-inferiority of the salmeterol component based on the totality of evidence available despite the CI found. Therefore, comparability of broncholidation effect between salmeterol in Labazenit and salmeterol in Serevent Diskus is considered to  be  established.  Furthermore,  in  this  study  a  dose  response  between  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and Serevent  Diskus  was  not  observed  in  the  primary  efficacy  variable  mean  change  from  FEV1  max. However, a post hoc analysis demonstrated a dose response in the AUC FEV1 8-12 h for Labazenit that was further substantiated with literature.  No predefined margins for equivalence for the 95% CI were set.  No  dose  response  was  observed  for  the  comparator,  probably  because  the  higher  doses  of Serevent were used (Labazenit 6.25-25 µg vs. Serevent 25-50 µg).  The dose response was confirmed in the extra pulmonary side effects, but no margins for equivalence for the 95% confidence intervals were defined.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical

## Step-up indication

In  studies  BUSAL  III-02-01,  the  morning  PEF  was  used  as  primary  parameter  A  clinical  significant improvement in mean change in FEV1 at week 12 was achieved for all treatments: Labazenit 150/25 mcg (mean ± SD) 0.40 ± 0.44 L, Labazenit 300/25 mcg 0.39 ± 0.38 L, Pulmicort 400 mcg 0.28 ±0.44 L  but  with  no  statistical  difference  between  treatments.  A  statistically  significant  effect  in  FEV1  % predicted was observed. The FEV1 % predicted is a more precise measurement as this is corrected for age, gender and height. The difference between the two doses of Labazenit was statistically significant with Pulmicort (p≤0.03, both doses)), but the numerical difference was not provided. The estimated difference  was  less  than  the  clinically  relevant  difference  (5%  -8%).  With  FEV1  a  clinical  relevant difference is seen, but which was not statistically significant.

The spirometric data (FEV1, FEV % predicted, FVC) were reanalysed following a GCP inspection. The above data are based on the highest of three producible values.

The study design used was not sensitive to conlusively assess comparability of the budesonide antiinflammatory  control  in  Labazenit  and  in  Pulmicort.  This  was  the  result  of  the  absence  of    a  dose response  between  the  two  strengths  of  Labazenit.  i.e.  the  difference  in  FEV1  between  Labazenit 150/25 and Labazenit 300/25 mcg was 0.01 L (p-value = 1.000).

Furthermore,  FEV1  and  PEF  were  measured  12  h  after  inhalation,  when  salmeterol  provides  still  a bronchodilatory  effect.  Therefore,  a  combined  effect  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol  can  not  be excluded.  Under  these  conditions,    a  sound  comparison  between  the  budesonide  components  of Labazenit and Pulmicort is not possible.

## Substitution indication

In  the  supportive  studies  BUSAL  III-05-1  and  BUSAL  III-08-1    the  repsonses  of  the  lung  function parameters and the clinical parameters were comparable to the responses in the pivotal study BUSAL III-02-1. However, as only one dose of both Labazenit and of the comparator was tested the study design  was  not  sensitive  to  conclusively  assess  comparability  of  te  budesonide  anti-inflammatory control. Also in these studies FEV1 and PEF were measured 12 h after inhalation.

## Long term efficacy

In  study  BUSAL  III-06-01  patients  were  recruited  from  study  BUSAL  III-05-01.  An  analysis  of  the characteristics  of  the  included  patients  compared  to  the  patients  who  were  not,  revealed  similar demographics, lung  function  parameters  and  asthma  control.  Also  the  experience  of  a  moderate  or severe exacerbation in the preceding eight weeks did not lead to bias. Less treatment related adverse related  events  were  observed  in  the  patients  participating  in  study  BUSAL  III-06-01,  although  the amount of adverse events was similar. No active comparator was included.  Also no long term data of the lower dose of Labazenit 150/25 µg has been provided. The long term (1 year) efficacy data have been obtained from a limited  number  of  patients  (n=110).  Long  term  use  is  included  as  important missing information in the proposed RMP.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Budesonide  and  salmeterol  are  well  known  substances  used  in  the  treatment  of  asthma.  A  lower nominal dose is applied in Labazenit. Comparable efficacy and safety should be demonstrated for the new fixed combination compared with already existing products. The clinical studies were not sensitive to  demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory control provided by the ICS compound of the fixed dose combination  was  comparable  to  current  asthma  treatment.  The  demonstration  of  equivalence regarding the anti-inflammatory control has to be derived from the PK studies. Dose proportionality between  the  two  strengths  is  considered  demonstrated.  In  the  lung  deposition  study  exposure  to budesonide was ~20 % lower following inhalation of Labazenit compared to Symbicort, while in two other PK studies budesonide exposure was comparable for Labazenit and Pulmicort. Based on the lung deposition  study  only,  a  slightly  lower  anti-inflammatory  control  provided  by  budesonide  in  the Labazenit fixed combination comparable to current asthma  treatment can not be excluded. Furthermore,  comparable  exposure  of  salmeterol  between  Labazenit  and  Serevent  Diskus  was  only demonstrated  if  a  wider  margein  set  a  0.2L  was  used.As  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  afety parameters was observed in this study, the CHMP was able to conclude on the non-inferiority of the salmeterol component based on the totality of evidence available despite the CI found.

## Pharmacodynamic

In the pharmacodynamics studies the observed differences in extra pulmonary side effects , such as glucose  and  potassium  were  small,  but  a  formal  predefined  95%  CI  limits  for  demonstrating equivalence was not provided. However, the 95% CI and the potency ratio's were reassuring.

## Clinical

During  the  observation  period  no  new  safety  effects  become  apparent.  Nasopharyngitis  and  viral infections were most commonly reported. In study BUSAL III-05-01 more exacerbations were observed with  Labazenit  (n=7;  2%)  compared  with  Seretide  (n=1;  0.9%).  Exacerbations  is  included  in  the proposed SmPC and as important identified risk in the RMP.

Known adverse events related to exposure to salmeterol are tremor, hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia.  These  AEs    were  more  frequently  (3  patients  versus  1  patient)  reported  with Labazenit  although  the  incidence  was  &lt;1%.  Hypokaliema  and  hyperglycaemia  are  included  in  the proposed SmPC and as important identified risk in the RMP.

All cardiac events (including ECG) as observed in the studies BUSAL II-10-1, BUSAL II-10-2, BUSAL III-08-1were in line expectations. QTc prolongation and adrenergic cardiac effects are included in the proposed SmPC and as important identified risk in the RMP.

The  safety  and  efficacy  data  in  elderly  patients  is  limited  (n=110).  This  has  been  reflected  in  the proposed SmPC and use in patients over 65 is included as important missing information in the RMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

For measuring inflammation control by exacerbations, the phase III studies were relatively short (12 weeks).  This  study  duration  is  usually  considered  to  be  too  short  to  demonstrate  differences  in exacerbation  rate.  More  exacerbations  were  observed  with  Labazenit  (n=7;  2%)  compared  with Seretide  (n=1;  0.9%)  in  study  BUSAL  III-05-1.  However,  the  observed  numbers  are  low  and  a imbalance may have occurred due to the short duration of the study.

More side effects related to the use of β2-agonists were observed with the use of Labazenit compared with the salmeterol active comparator. However, more patients were exposed to Labazenit (Labazenit 300/25 µg 553 patients; Labazenit 150/25 µg 301 patients), than to the comparators (Pulmicort 400 µg 124 patients, Seretide 500/50 µg 117 patients and Symbicort 200/12 µg 114 patients), making the AEs more likely to occur. Also the incidence of these events between the doses of Labazenit differs, although they harbour the same amount of salmeterol. No head to head comparison with Seretide was performed and this makes it more difficult to assess a reliable comparison in AE incidence.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Labazenit contains a lower nominal dose to achieve comparable FDP with the comparator products.

Therefore, comparability regarding the bronchodilatory effects of salmeterol and the anti-inflammatory control  by  budesonide  between  Labazenit  and  the  respective  reference  products  needs  to  be demonstrated.

The  comparability  of  the  broncholidation  effect  of  salmeterol  in  Labazenit  and  Serevent  Diskus  is established in the clinical studies. The 98.33% CI (-0.16: 0.12) was just outside the predefined margin of  (-0.15:  0.15  L),  but  with  a  wider  limit  of  0.2  L,  bioequivalence  would  be  demonstrated.  As  no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters was observed in this study, the CHMP was able to conclude on the non-inferiority margin of the salmeterol component based on the totality of evidence available despite the CI found.

The comparability of the broncholidation effect of salmeterol is supported by study BUSAL II-03-1 and the small differences seen in the responses. A dose response was seen with FEV1AUC8-12 hours and confirmed with the extra pulmonary parameters potassium and glucose.

The small differences in the extra pulmonary parameters, i.e. potassium and glucose were small. For the  safety  of  salmeterol  this  is  considered  to  be  assuring,  since  the  95%  CI  of  the  differences  and potency ratio's were assuring

For the step-up indication,  superiority of Labazenit versus budesonide alone is proven with PEF and FEV1% in the pivotal study. However, for both the substitution indication and the step-up indication comparability in inflammation control should also be established. As a dose response was not observed between  the  two  different  strengths  of  Labazenit  the  comparability  of  inflammation  control  is  not established. Support for the two strengths was obtained from in vitro and PK data. Pharmacokinetics showed a 20% lower lung deposition of budesonide for Labazenit compared to Symbicort.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-risk balance

## Step-up indication

## Evidence for equivalence of anti-inflammatory effect (inhaled corticosteroids)

The clinical studies demonstrated soundly that the addition of a LABA to an ICS provided more clinical control  of  asthma  and  improved  lung  function  than  ICS  alone,  even  with  a  lower  amount  of  ICS (Labazenit 150/25 µg compared with Pulmicort 400 µg). However, due to the known flat dose response curve of ICS the pivotal study design was not sensitive to demonstate a dose response between the two strengths. Therefore, the study did no allow for a conclusion on comparability of budesonide antiinflammatory effect between Labazenit and the budesonide active comparator (Pulmicort).

Further evidence for comparability could not be derived form exacerbations&gt; In study BUSAL III-05-1 slightly more exacerbations were observed with Labazenit (n=7; 2%) than with Seretide (n=1; 0.9%). However, the numbers are small and the study duration was too short to be conclusive.

To support the comparability of anti-inflammatory control, bioavailability of budesonide was compared in  three  PK  studies  between  Labazenit  and  Pulmicort/Symbicort.  Formal  bioequivalence  with  90%CI between 80-125% could not be demonstrated considering the three PK studies individually. Of concern is  the  ~20  %  lower  lung  deposition  following  inhalation  of  Labazenit  compared  to  Symbicort.  FPD fraction  correlates  linear  with  whole-lung  deposition.  Therefore,  the  FPD  of  the  batches  used  in  PK studies at time of the PK study should be taken into consideration when interpreting the PK data.

The  uniformity  of  delivered  dose  release  specifications  are  set  between  75  to  125%  for  Labazenit, which is in accordance with the European pharmacopoeia (instead of the usual specifications seen with oral dosage forms usually between 95% to 105%), the variability in the results of the PK studies is in the same range as the product specifications.

Overall,  Labazenit  demonstrated  superiority  over  Pulmicort  even  with  a  lower  dose  of  budesonide. However, the data was not compelling to prove comparability for budesonide between Labazenit and Pulmicort.  Based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  and  clinical  data,  comparability  for  budesonide  between Labazenit and Pulmicort was not demonstrated.

## Substitution indication

## Evidence for equivalence of bronchodilatory effect (salmeterol)

In the pharmacodynamic study to support the equivalence of salmeterol between Labazenit 150/25 μg and  Serevent  Diskus  50  μg,  the  95%  CI  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  just  outside  the predefined  margin.  However,  with  a  wider  limit  of  0.2  L,  equivalence  would  be  demonstrated.  The CHMP was able to conclude on the non-inferiority of the salmeterol component based on the totality of evidence available despite the CI found.

A dose response regarding the duration of bronchodilatory response with FEV1,AUC8-12 h was only observed between Labazenit 150/6.25 and 150/25 μg.

Pharmacokinetic  data  comparing  salmeterol  pharmacokinetics  of  Labazenit  with  Serevent  Diskus indicated  a  31%  higher  Cmax  and  17%  higher  AUC  of  salmeterol  for  Labazenit.  This  may  have implications on the safety of salmeterol. In the pharmacodynamics studies the differences between the extra pulmonary side effects of Labazenit 150/25 μg and Serevent Diskus 50 μg were small and the 95%  CI  reassuring.  In  the  clinical  safety  data  obtained  from  the  clinical  studies,  the  data  do  not provide evidence of an increased incidence of AEs related to LABA use, but the incidence is low and long term-data are sparse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Altogether,  the  pharmacodynamic  study  BUSAL  10-02-1  demonstrated  similar  bronchodilation  for salmeterol between Labazenit and Serevent Diskus. The measurement of a higher systemic exposure in the PK study did not give rise to differences in the clinical safety.

As for the step-up indication, evidence of comparable anti-inflammatory effect of budesonide should be demonstrated.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

## Step-up indication

The results of study BUSAL III-02-01 demonstrated that the addition ofa  LABA to an ICS increased lung function and decreased asthma symptoms, even with a lower dose of ICS as compared to ICS given  alone,  supporting  the  step  up  indication.  However,  besides  superiority,  comparability  of inflammation control as efficacy of budesonide still remains to be established. As there was no dose response between the two different doses of Labazenit, the study design was not sensitive enough to conclusively assess comparability.

To overcome the clinical conclusion that comparability was not demonstrated,  PK studies could have been  an  alternative  for  showing  comparability.  With  the  three  PK  studies  individually,  formal bioequivalence  with  a  90%CI  between  80-125%  could  not  be  demonstrated.  However,  the  results together showed no indication for a relevant difference in lung deposition. The variability in the results was in  the  same  range  as  the  product  specifications  for  the  delivered  dose  and  the  FPD.  Based  on these  data,  a  comparable  inflammation  control  by  budesonide  in  Labazenit  as  with  the  reference product can be expected but has not been demonstrated.

Furthermore,  dose  proportionality  of  budesonide  could  be  established  with  pharmacokinetic  data together with in vitro data.

Altogether, the pharmacokinetic and clinical data are showing results that comparability for budesonide between  Labazenit  and  Pulmicort  is  likely  but  has  not  been  demonstrated.  Additionally,  dose proportionality is demonstrated.

## Substitution indication

Evidence of comparability of salmeterol broncholidation effect between Labazenit and Serevent Diskus is  established  based  on  the  pharmacodynamic  study.  The  CHMP  was  able  to  conclude  on  the  noninferiority of the salmeterol component based on the totality of evidence available despite the CI found L.  A  dose  response  for  Labazenit  was  seen  for  the  duration  of  the  response  as  expressed  with FEV1AUC8-12  hThe  higher  systemic  exposure  to  salmeterol  did  not  result  in  more  severe  extra pulmonary side effects. The differences between Labazenit 150/25 µg and Seretide Discus 50 µg were small, while the 95% CI and the potency ratio's were assuring. In the clinical safety data obtained from the  clinical  studies,  the  data  do  not  provide  evidence  of  an  increased  incidence  of  adverse  events related LABA, but the incidence is low.

As for the step-up indication comparability of budesonide anti-inflammatory control in Labazenit and Pulmicort should be established.

The overall benefit/risk balance of Labazenit is at present negative for both proposed indication i.e. step-up and substitution indication, because comparability of the budesonide anti-inflammatory effect between Labazenit and the comparator has not been demonstrated in the pharmacokinetic and clinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Labazenit in the treatment of asthma in adults  where  use  of  a  combination  product  (inhaled  corticosteroid  and  long-acting  β2agonist)  is  appropriate  (patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonists or patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists), the CHMP considers by consensus that the efficacy of the  above  mentioned  medicinal  product  is  not  sufficiently  demonstrated.  Therefore  the  CHMP,  in accordance with Article 12(1) of Regulation 726/2004, recommends the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal product.

The CHMP considers that:

- The comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide has not been adequately demonstrated between Labazenit and the comparator in clinical studies. Study BUSAL III-02-1 is not  considered  sensitive  to  demonstrate  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  of  budesonide between  Labazenit  and  the  comparator  as  there  is  no  difference  in  effect  between  the  two Labazenit doses investigated in the study. The supportive studies BUSAL III-05-1 and BUSAL III08-1 had the limitation that only one dose of both, Labazenit and the comparator, was tested hence employing a design not sensitive to conclusively assess comparability.
- The  available  pharmacokinetic  data  does  not  support  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  by budesonide between Labazenit and the reference product as it showed a lower bioavailability of budesonide  from  Labazenit,  indicating  lower  deposition  of  budesonide  in  the  lungs.  Only  by correcting for Fine Particle Dose (FPD) was it possible to demonstrate comparable bioavailability, but  this  is  not  considered  appropriate  since  the  FPD  correction  was  not  pre-specified  and  such correction  is  not  acceptable  unless  specific  requirements  are  met  (e.g.  clear  in  vitro/in  vivo correlation has to be established).

Therefore, the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for Labazenit.

Due  to  the  aforementioned  concerns  a  satisfactory  summary  of  product  characteristics,  labelling, package leaflet, Pharmacovigilance system, risk management plan and post-authorisation measures to address other concerns cannot be agreed at this stage.

## Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 21 Match 2013

Following the CHMP conclusion that Labazenit was not approvable for the following indication:

Labazenit  is  indicated  in  the  regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  where  use  of  a  combination medicinal product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist) is appropriate:

- -Patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short acting β2-agonists.

or

- -Patients  already  adequately  controlled  on  both  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  long-acting  β2agonists.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the above mentioned grounds for refusal, on 28 April 2013.

Following a request from the Applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an adhoc expert group meeting inviting the experts, including patient representatives, to provide their views on the questions posed by the CHMP, taking into account the Applicant's responses to the grounds for refusal.

The Applicant presented their details grounds for re-examination in writing on 28 April 2013 and at an oral explanation on 24 June 2013.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

## Summary of the Applicant's detailed grounds for re-examination

According to the CHMP, comparability of asthma control and anti-inflammatory control by budesonide has  not  been  adequately  demonstrated  between  Labazenit  and  the  comparators  in  clinical  trials. However, Labazenit is a novel FDC and according to the Applicant it is therefore not appropriate to consider this in terms of bioequivalence with comparator FDCs. The primary purpose of the Labazenit development programme was to demonstrate superiority and not comparability over the ICS alone in asthmatic  patients,  in  line  with  the  guideline  on  FDC  (CHMP/EWP/240/95),  the  OIP  guideline  (new fixed-dose  combination  product  with  no  approved  fixed  combination  reference  product)  and  GINA guidelines. The fact that the Labazenit dossier was primarily based on the superiority versus an ICS monotherapy has been consistent throughout the development programme and was clearly explained to CHMP at all times throughout the development of this new medicine.

The goal of the PK studies for a new FDC is to support the clinical data. This has been the case in the Labazenit  dossier  as  PK  data  demonstrated  that  the  delivery  of  the  active  ingredients  in  Labazenit compared with the reference mono-products resulted in a similar bioavailability. Without correction for FPD only one of four studies comparing the budesonide exposure showed results slightly inferior to the lower bound of the pre-defined accepted margins (0.8 point estimate in budesonide). The other studies did not highlight any inferior exposure to budesonide contained in the Labazenit product compared to budesonide containing reference products. Furthermore, since the variability of the reference product, in  particular  the  Pulmicort  Turbohaler  has  been  extensively  demonstrated  (on  16  batches)  as extremely variable from one puff to another, it seems very challenging to obtain bioequivalence with Labazenit each time. Importantly the lower variability and airflow dependency of the drug delivery and lung  deposition  resulting  from  the  efficiency  of  administration  of  Labazenit  via  the  Axahaler  versus existing device. The development of this new FDC with a device offering a significant advantage over existing  delivery  devices  is  considered  by  the  Applicant  as  a  significant  advantage  of  Labazenit Axahaler versus the marketed products.

The  dose-response  issue  discussed  during Scientific Advice (SA) and  addressed  according  to CHMP/SAWP recommendations (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/14715/2010) came up as unaddressed throughout the assessment of the Labazenit dossier. The additional PK and in-vitro testing recommended by the SA  were  performed  and  clearly  demonstrated  the  dose-response  of  budesonide.  In  the  CHMP assessment report it is clearly noted that the recommendations from the SA were followed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The particular benefit of Labazenit's formulation over similar existing products has not been sufficiently appreciated  during  the  assessment.  The  lower  resistance  of  the  Axahaler  device  versus  marketed devices has been mentioned as a clear advantage for patients with lower inhalation airflow rates by the CHMP during the evaluation, but this advantage does not appear in the assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, while, according to the Applicant, this advantage is of clinical relevance for moderate to severe asthma patients.

## The Applicant addresses specifically the CHMP's initial grounds for refusal:

GROUND 1: The comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide has not been adequately demonstrated between Labazenit and the comparator in clinical studies. Study BUSAL III-02-1 is not considered  sensitive  to  demonstrate  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  of  budesonide  between Labazenit  and  the  comparator  as  there  is  no  difference  in  effect  between  the  two  Labazenit  doses investigated in the study. The supportive studies BUSAL III-05-1 and BUSAL III-08-1 had the limitation that only one dose of both, Labazenit and the comparator, was tested hence employing a design not sensitive to conclusively assess comparability.

## Applicant's position

## 1. Introduction

All  of  the  studies  presented  in  the  dossier  have  been  performed  in  accordance  with  the  available regulations at the time when the studies were carried out.

The  pivotal  study  BUSAL-III-02-1,  was  designed  in  accordance  with  the  'guideline  on  clinical development of an FDC' (CHMP/EWP/240/95) and the note for 'guidance on the clinical investigation of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  asthma'  (CPMP/EWP/2922/01),  and  even  with  the  OIP guideline  (page  18/26)  :'new  fixed-dose  combination  product  with  no  approved  fixed  combination reference  product'  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  FDC  as  compared  to  the  active substance alone (budesonide in Pulmicort 400 μg bid).

The development strategy of the Applicant aimed to demonstrate this superiority in the pivotal study has been consistent throughout the development programme.

The main goals of the global clinical development plan were to establish clearly the efficacy and safety of Labazenit, in agreement with the recommendations of the guideline in force, by demonstrating the following:

Major  efficacy  objective:  Demonstrate  that  both  dosage  strengths  of  Labazenit  result  in  a  higher efficacy  than  an  ICS  monotherapy  (even  at  a  higher  dose)  in  the  intended  population  of  asthmatic patients.

This objective corresponds to the requirement of:

-  the  guideline  on  fixed-dose  combination  which  stipulates  that  an  adequate  justification  of  the development of  a  FDC  should  implicate  an  improvement  of  the  benefit/risk  ratio,  due  to  a  level  of efficacy  above  the  one  achievable  by  a  single  substance  (in  the  present  case,  the  ICS),  with  an acceptable safety profile.

-  the  OIP  guideline  which  stipulates  that  for  fixed-dose  combination  with  no  approved  fixed combination  reference  product,  the  combination  should  be  compared  to  an  ICS  alone  at  the  same dose, or alternatively at a higher dose.

- the GINA guidelines which recommend the use of ICS/LABA combinations in asthmatic patients not adequately controlled with an ICS alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical  endpoints (PEF and FEV1 for lung function assessment, asthma symptom score and the need for rescue medication for the control of asthma), the timing of assessment (12 hours post dose for  a  twice  daily  inhaled  product  and  assessment  in  the  morning  and  evening  to  deal  with  diurnal variations) and the duration of the trial (12 weeks) were also in accordance with relevant guidances, bibliography and CHMP's recent opinion on a similar product for the treatment of asthma.

## 2. Demonstration of superiority

Study  BUSAL  III-02-1  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  Labazenit,  a  novel  FDC,  by comparing the higher dose (Labazenit 300/25 μg bid) to the comparator ICS (Pulmicort 400 μg bid) in chronic moderate asthmatic patients. Two doses of the FDC were studied, with a dose of ICS in the lower strength of the FDC (Labazenit 150/25 μg bid) corresponding to half the dose dispensed in the reference product (Pulmicort 400 μg bid).

It  was  demonstrated  for  the  primary  parameter  PEF  that  both  Labazenit  150/25μg  and  Labazenit 300/25 μg treatments were superior to Pulmicort 400 μg (budesonide) after 12 weeks of treatment (p&lt;0.001  for  both  active  vs  reference  comparisons).  This  was  supported  by  the  results  for  FEV1% predicted (Labazenit 150/25 μg vs. Pulmicort 400 μg: p=0.029; Labazenit 300/25 μg vs. Pulmicort 400 μg: p=0.021).

The  superiority  of  both  dosages  of  Labazenit  over  Pulmicort  was  not  only  demonstrated  on  lung function, but also on the parameters assessing asthma control (asthma symptom scores and use of rescue medication) as required by the guidance for assessing the treatment of asthma (CPMP/EWP/2922/01).  These  data  on  PEF  are  supported  by  the  data  for  FEV1%  predicted  and symptomatic asthma control which provide further evidence that Labazenit will provide better asthma control than monotherapy with ICS.

No  statistical  difference  was  observed  between  the  two  dosages  of  Labazenit  over  the  6-months treatment period, on any parameter.

The superiority of the FDC over an ICS alone was furthermore confirmed on each efficacy endpoint (lung function tests and asthma control parameters) in the following situations:

-  After  the  switch  from  3  months  of  treatment  with  Pulmicort  to  both  doses  of  Labazenit  in  study BUSAL-III-02-1;

- In study BUSAL III-05-1 where a significant improvement in all parameters was recorded after the run-in period under an ICS monotherapy (beclomethasone (Qvar 200 μg bid) alone);

- In study BUSAL III-08-1 where a significant improvement in all parameters was also noted after the run-in period under an ICS monotherapy (budesonide, Pulmicort 400 μg bid) alone.

## 3. Issues raised by the CHMP on the Labazenit clinical dossier

The questions raised by the CHMP following the review of the clinical efficacy data were:

- -PEF and FEV1 values were measured after only 12 hours withdrawal of study treatment when the LABA might still have some effect;
- -The  study  duration  was  considered  too  short  (12  weeks)  to  detect  any  differences  in exacerbation rates.
- -The studies lack of assay sensitivity as only one dose of budesonide was used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1. Measurements 12 hours post dose

With  regards  to  the  comment  on  12-hour  post  dose  measurements:  PEF  and  FEV1  were  indeed measured 12 hours post dose, as expected for a product to be inhaled twice daily in accordance to the study protocol and the requirements laid out in the SmPC: PEF and FEV1 parameters were measured before  the  intake  of  the  next  dose  in  order  to  record  the  improvements  in  those  parameters  after administration. The choice of this endpoint was made in line with the Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for Treatment of Asthma - (CPMP/EWP/2922/01). It is accepted as an  appropriate  endpoint  to  measure  the  effect  of  an  ICS  according  to  the  CHMP  OIP  Guideline (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev.1) and it is advocated as an essential endpoint in asthma studies by a joint expert committee of the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS).

The use of the same surrogate endpoint pre-dose FEV1 is then justified to establish the efficacy of the FDC. Furthermore, the results observed on lung function tests (notably pre-bronchodilation FEV1) over this  period  of  time  are  a strong  independent  predictor  of  risk  for  future  exacerbations,  according  to CHMP during the assessment of a similar FDC, Flutiform).

## 3.2. Study duration

With regards to the study duration, a 12-week duration is considered as an adequate period according to literature data and in the opinion of CHMP raised in the Flutiform Assessment Report, namely that treatment  effects  upon  asthma  control  variables  are  maximal  within  3  months  and  sustained thereafter.

The results observed on lung function tests (notably pre-bronchodilation FEV1) over this period of time are a strong independent predictor of risk for future exacerbations. The effects observed during the 12week comparative periods in the three clinical phase III studies are therefore considered supportive of the effect of the FDC in the treatment of asthma.

In addition, the duration of the trials is in line with the guidance on treatments for asthma and with the literature data. Lasserson et al, 2009 indeed reviewed trials longer than 3 months for the comparison between two FDCs, and concluded that the 12-week period is an adequate time to assess treatment.

In study BUSAL-III-02-1, the persistence of the efficacy up to 6 months was assessed in the two arms of  patients  taking  Labazenit  150/25  μg bid  and  300/25  μg bid.  The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy parameters were similar after 3 and 6 months of treatment, confirming that 3 months treatment time is an adequate duration of study in asthma patients (for pulmonary function tests, asthma symptom score  and  use  of  rescue  medications).  In  other  words,  6  month  duration  studies  do  not  provide additional results compared to 3-month trials and the Applicant considers the duration of the studies performed with Labazenit to be appropriate.

## 3.3. Lack of assay sensitivity

With regards to the lack of assay sensitivity, two doses of Labazenit were initially compared in the pivotal study for up to 6 months and no difference was recorded for either strength used. During the evaluation,  the  CHMP  stated  that  'Superiority  of  both  strengths  of  Labazenit  over  Pulmicort  is established in the pivotal study BUSAL III-02-1, but comparable asthma control by comparability of budesonide  is  not  established  in  the  pivotal  trial.  A  dose  response  between  the  two  strengths  of Labazenit was lacking. Therefore, the study did not show assay sensitivity'. The Applicant questions this statement. Lack of assay sensitivity is the inability to pick up differences in treatment effects at non-placebo dose levels. When the CHMP acknowledges that Labazenit was superior at both strengths to Pulmicort then sensitivity has been proven.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lack of any clinical ICS dose response relationship is well described in the literature with all ICS, including budesonide. Large trials including up to 4-fold difference in ICS administered doses failed to show significant  differences  in  the  efficacy  parameters  measured.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  is  of  the opinion that the demonstration of a clinical dose response is impossible with Labazenit or indeed any other  ICS,  including  budesonide.  In  the  case  of  budesonide,  it  has  been  shown  that  80%  of  the maximum  effect  is  achieved  at  a  dose  range  of  200-400  μg.  Theoretically,  clinically  significant differences in the effectiveness could be observed in the range of 50 - 200 μg/day only when the effect would be not mask by adding a LABA. The Rapporteurs also pointed out in their D180 clinical JAR that: 'it is agreed that budesonide and other ICS show a flat dose response at the doses recommended, a doubling dose of budesonide does not readily show an improved asthma control'.

This issue was already discussed during a Scientific Advice meeting (EMEA/H/SA/1462/1/2009/SME/III) requested by the Applicant in 2009/2010. During this meeting it was advised that the assay sensitivity and dose response relationship between the different ICS doses be indirectly supported with pharmacokinetic and in-vitro studies.

Those  recommendations  were  followed  by  the  Applicant  and  results  -  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  demonstrated  that  'dose  proportionality  was  already  established  between  Labazenit  300/25μg  and Labazenit 150/25μg with combination of pharmacokinetic data and in vitro data. Support for the two strengths of Labazenit is based on dose proportional pharmacokinetic data, and the short term studies providing evidence that a comparable asthma control has been achieved.'

The CHMP endorsed the claimed step-up indication based on a demonstrated superiority over the mono ICS  component  with  an  acceptable  safety  profile  for  Labazenit.  The  flat  dose  response  curve  for efficacy parameters when assessing ICS, such as FEV1 and PEF and clinical parameters like asthma exacerbations and asthma control is also acknowledged.

The  ICS  in  Labazenit  FDC  was  proposed  at  two  different  dosage  strengths  (Budesonide  150μg  and 300μg)  in  order  to  allow  prescribers  flexibility  in  achieving  and  maintaining  adequate  control  of asthma. Furthermore, the GINA recommendations state that when a patient is stabilized with a high ICS  dose,  the  dose  should  be  decreased  to  the  minimum  that  maintains  optimal  asthma  control (GINA).

## 4. Demonstration of anti-inflammatory control

The  clinical  studies  were  not  deemed  sensitive  enough  to  demonstrate  that  the  anti-inflammatory control provided by the ICS compound is sufficient to support either indication. The demonstration of equivalence regarding the anti-inflammatory control should have been supported by the PK and in vitro data.

Exposure  to  budesonide  following  inhalation  of  Labazenit  was  compared  in  four  PK  studies.  The comparator was either Pulmicort or Symbicort which both contain budesonide as the active ICS.

Two studies (SMB-BUSAL-SS032 and SMB-BUSAL-SD033) showed point estimates for Cmax and AUC close  to  unity,  but  the  individual  studies  did  not  formally  demonstrate  bioequivalence  for  both parameters of  budesonide  based  on  a  90%  confidence  interval  of  80-125%.  The  third  study  (SMBBUSAL-SS071) showed around 100% higher lung deposition for budesonide when comparing Labazenit with Pulmicort and the fourth study (SMBBUSAL-SD111) showed around 20% lower lung deposition for budesonide when comparing Labazenit 150/25 μg with Symbicort 160/4.5 μg.

The  above  results  show  that  it  is  not  appropriate  to  use  bioequivalence  for  a  new  FDC  which  is delivered with a different device and using different doses of the comparator ICS (i.e. a capsule-based device versus a reservoir device and a low-resistance device versus a high-resistance device).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, it important to stress that the relative lower bioavailability observed in the single dose study BUSAL-SD111 should be weighed up in perspective with the results of the non inferiority phase III study  BUSAL  III-08-1  comparing  Labazenit  150/25  μg  with  Symbicort  200/12  μg  over  12  weeks  . Indeed, the results of the BUSAL III-08-1 study showed that Labazenit 150/25 μg is non inferior to Symbicort  200/12  μg,  but  also  demonstrated  that  the  improvement  recorded  in  lung  functions  and asthma control is numerically higher with Labazenit. The lower bioavailability obtained with budesonide delivered via the Axahaler as Labazenit, whilst maintain similar clinical effectiveness to the comparator product shows the overall improved therapeutic window for Labazenit.

Additionally, more exacerbations were reported with Symbicort compared with Labazenit. The data are in favour of Labazenit compared with Symbicort.

The relevance of the relatively lower bioavailability of Labazenit versus Symbicort recorded in study BUSAL-SD111 after a single dose of each product should be weighed up in light of the clinical efficacy results  of  a  twice  daily  intake  of  the  same  products  over  12  weeks  PK  data  represent  a  post-event contrary to the results obtained in the daily observations of the clinical effect in the phase III studies.

## 5. Dose-response issue

## 5.1. Clinical dose-response - Literature review

An exhaustive review of the literature on ICS-LABA FDCs has failed to demonstrate a significant doseresponse effect for any marketed and investigated ICS, alone or in an FDC.

Therefore as recommended during the scientific advice the dose response relationship for budesonide exposure between the two proposed dosage strengths was studied in in-vitro and PK studies.

## 5.2. In-vitro dose response of budesonide between Labazenit 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg

In  order  to  assess  the dose-response of budesonide between the two proposed dosage strengths of Labazenit,  in-vitro  comparisons  were  performed  according to  the  recent  OIP guideline.  5 batches  of Labazenit  150/25  μg  were  compared  (4  clinical  batches  and  an  industrial  batch)  to  5  batches  of Labazenit 300/25 μg (4 clinical batches and an industrial batch).

The  results  clearly  demonstrate  the  dose  proportionality  of  the  particle  size  distribution  profile  of budesonide between Labazenit 300/25 μg and 150/25 μg since:

- -The mean ratio of the FPD between both dosage strengths (corrected for the dose) is of 0.89 with a 90% CI of 0.84 - 0.93.
- -The mean ratio for the non respirable fraction (&gt; 5 μm) is of 1.11 with a 90% CI of 1.06 -1.15.
- -The mean ratio of size groups of 4-5 μm, 3-4 μm and 2-3 μm are between 0.90 and 1.05 with all 90% CI lying between 80 - 125%. The mean ratio for the size range inferior to 2 μm is of 0.78 with a 90% CI of 0.71 - 0. 85.

For supportive information, these tests also confirm, as expected, that the deposition of salmeterol on the different stages of the MSLI is equivalent for both product strengths.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Pharmacokinetic dose response assessment of budesonide between Labazenit 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg

Two PK studies (BUSAL-SD033 and BUSAL-DP102) specifically addressed the linearity of budesonide plasma levels between the two proposed dosage strengths of Labazenit. The first study performed in 2003,  BUSAL  SD033,  was  a  single-dose  cross-over  bioequivalence  study,  Labazenit  300/25  μg  was compared to budesonide-salmeterol 150/25 μg and to one single dose of Pulmicort Turbuhaler 2x200 μg budesonide. One of the objectives of this study was to assess the dose proportionality between the two different dosages of Labazenit (300/25 μg vs. 150/25 μg) in 24 healthy volunteers after a single dose administration.

The comparison between Labazenit 300/25 μg and Labazenit 150/25 µg demonstrated a comparable rate  and  extent  of  absorption  when  the  comparison  was  performed  with  a  dose  correction,  which means that the absorption of budesonide is almost dose proportional. The point estimates were 102.7; 80.3 and 99.4 for AUC ∞ , AUCt and Cmax for epimer A and of 91.7; 76.7 and 111.5 for epimer B.

An important reason for the high variability of the PK parameters in this study is the low budesonide plasma  concentrations  obtained  compared  to  the  relative  high  LOQ.  Indeed,  the  PK  profile  of budesonide  could  not  be  fully  characterised  following  inhalation  of  the  lowest  dose  of  Labazenit  as Cmax &lt; 10x LLOQ.  Therefore,  AUC  values  from  study  BUSAL  SD033  with  the  low  BUSAL  strength (150/25μg) should be considered very cautiously.

Therefore, following the recommendations of a scientific advice obtained from the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/1462/1/2009/SME/III) where the Applicant was asked to characterize the dose-response relationship between budesonide-salmeterol 300/25 μg and budesonide-salmeterol 150/25 μg, another PK  study  was  performed  in  order  to  assess  the  bioavailability  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol  in  40 asthmatic patients after  a  single dose  of  either  Labazenit  300  μg/25  μg or  Labazenit  150  μg/25  μg delivered by the Axahaler.

The  design  of  the  study  was  a  comparative  single  dose,  two-treatment,  two-period,  two  sequence, randomised, crossover study, with at least 3 days wash-out. The present study was performed using a blocker  of  the  gastrointestinal  absorption  of  the  active  substance  (Active  charcoal)  to  compare  the amount of study drugs which reaches the plasma via the lung and with asthmatic patients to be in line with the CHMP OIP guideline (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev.1).

Study BUSAL-DP102 demonstrates a clear dose response relationship in the PK of inhaled budesonide. When the inhaled dose increases from 150 to 300 μg, the budesonide plasma levels also increases. As previously  mentioned, patients  in  the  present  study  did take  active  charcoal,  which  means  that  the increase in bioavailability observed  reflects an increase in the lung deposition of the drug. Nevertheless, budesonide exposure was slightly higher for Labazenit 300/25 μg than for 150/25 μg. Indeed, the 90% CI for all the PK parameters normalised by the dose are out of the acceptable margin of 80-125 and the point estimate are from 0.58 to 0.77 in favour to Labazenit 300/25μg. Additionally, as expected, the deposition profile of salmeterol was the same for Labazenit 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg in study DP102.

Given the wide specification limits for the FPD of OIPs and the differences observed between the FPD of the batches used in this study (143 μg for Labazenit 300/25 μg and 57.5 μg for Labazenit 150/25 μg; ratio=0.40),  a  correction  of  the  raw  PK  data  by  the  FPD  was  performed  and  the  corrected  results indicated a dose proportionality between the two test products (see the figure below below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1. Mean concentration values normalized to the dose of 300 μg and corrected with the FPD

<!-- image -->

As  already  discussed,  the  dose  proportionality  was  fully  described  and  demonstrated  in  the  in-vitro studies.

Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  after  a  single-dose  inhalation  (with  active  charcoal)  by  asthmatic patients of Labazenit 300/25 μg and Labazenit 150/25 μg, the bioavailability of budesonide increases in a linear manner, taking into account the in-vitro deposition data of the batches tested. These results are in good agreement with bibliographic data available for budesonide which usually shows a linear dose-response of budesonide through inhalation even if the variability is usually high.

6. Precedent CHMP opinion on Flutiform (fluticasone/formoterol FDC) Article 29 Referral procedure

The Applicant requests that the Labazenit dossier be assessed based on the same scientific reasoning as the ICS/LABA FDC Flutiform since similar objections, in particular with regards to the pharmacokinetic  data,  were  raised  in  the  case  of  Flutiform  and  were  recently  (28th  June  2012) considered without any clinical relevance during CHMP arbitration.

A recent Assessment Report was published on the EMA website on June 28th, 2012 with regards to Flutiform  (EMA/399193/2012,  procedure  EMEA/H/A-29-1326),  another  FDC  containing  fluticasone propionate as the ICS and formoterol fumarate as the LABA to be administered by the inhalation route and for which many similarities with the candidate product Labazenit have been noted.

On day 210 of the Decentralised Procedure which started in March 2010, the same issues on efficacy and bioequivalence were raised by the CHMP, namely that a lower bioavailability measured for the ICS between  the  candidate  product  and  a  reference  could  impair  the  asthma  control  in  patients  and additionally that the bronchodilating effects of the LABA component 12 hours post dose could mask those deficient corticosteroid effects. Those concerns triggered the referral procedure to the CMD(h) and eventually the CHMP arbitration at the end of 2011.

This assessment report is of particular interest as to CHMP views on similar objections raised again in the  Labazenit  dossier  i.e.  that  based  on  pharmacokinetic  data,  comparable  inflammation  control  by budesonide delivered by Labazenit with the reference product could be expected but is not proven.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GROUND  2: The  available  pharmacokinetic  data  does  not  support  comparable  anti-inflammatory control by budesonide between Labazenit and the reference product as it showed a lower bioavailability of  budesonide  from  Labazenit,  indicating  lower  deposition  of  budesonide  in  the  lungs.  Only  by correcting for Fine Particle Dose (FPD) was it possible to demonstrate comparable bioavailability, but this is not considered appropriate since the FPD correction was not pre-specified and such correction is not acceptable unless specific requirements are met (e.g. clear in vitro/in vivo correlation has to be established).

## Applicant's position

## 1. Background on the variability of OIPs

It should be highlighted that it is very challenging to demonstrate a comparable bioavailability between two OIPs because it is well known that the systemic exposure of OIPs is highly variable. This variability is dependent on several factors:

-  Variability  from  different  inhalers  and  between  each  inhalation  from  the  same  device.  A  high variability  in  the  systemic  exposure  is  expected  when  two  inhaled  products  administered  via  two different  devices  are  compared.  Further  evidence  that  the  nature  of  the  device  is  important  for obtaining reproducible plasma levels comes from the results of the interaction study (BUSAL-SD101) where  all  treatments  were  administered  with  the  same  low  resistance  to  airflow  inhaler  device (Axahaler).

Study BUSAL-SD101  is a single dose, 4-treatment, crossover study where four treatments administered  by  the  AXAHALER  device  were  compared:  Labazenit  300/25  μg,  an  inhouse  SMB formulation  of  budesonide  300  μg, an in -house  SMB  formulation  of  salmeterol  25  μg and the co -administration  of  the  budesonide  and  salmeterol.  The  bioequivalence  between  each  treatment  has been demonstrated with a 90 % confidence interval for budesonide within the predetermined norms of 80-125 % for all relevant PK parameters. This study demonstrates that the bioequivalence between orally  inhaled  products  might  be  demonstrated  when  the  same  reliable  and  robust  inhaler  (i.e. presenting a low inter and intrabatches variability device (e.g. the Axahaler) is used in all study arms. However,  the  fact  is  that  the  PK  data  remain  a  post-event  measurement  and  are  not  directly representative of either the residence time or of the activity of the drug in the lungs.

Also the variability between each inhalation from the same device should be considered with this kind of product. Considerable variability was observed and fully described with the Turbuhaler, the device used  in  the  medicine  Pulmicort,  which  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  inhalation  airflow.  This  was confirmed  by  Ball  et  al.,  2002  who  compared  the  lung  deposition  (by  gamma  scintigraphy)  and systemic resorption of budesonide from the Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 μg at two peak inspiratory flow rates (optimal and half of optimal flow rates) versus the same measurements from a formulation of budesonide administered from the Axahaler device (called MIAT Monodose Inhaler at that time). In that study, the observed lung deposition dramatically decreases with the Turbuhaler when the airflow decreased,  whereas  it  was  non  dependent  on  the  airflow  when  using  the  Axahaler  device  used  to administer Labazenit.

The lung deposition from the Turbohaler decreased from 25.1 ± 6.1% to 18.5 ± 6.5% of the nominal dose of budesonide when inhaled at 60 L/minute (optimal airflow) and 30 L/minute respectively. While with the Axahaler, the percentage of budesonide reaching the lungs was similar at the optimal flow (90 L/minute) and even with suboptimal flow (45 L/min) with respectively 21.4 ± 4.3% and 21.4 ± 7.5% of the nominal dose of budesonide quantified in the lungs by gamma scintigraphy.

The impact of the peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) on the deposition of budesonide from the Pulmicort Turbuhaler  was  also  previously  reported  by  Borgström  et  al.,  1994,  who  observed  that  the  lung deposition fell from 27% of the dose at a PIFR of 60 L/min to 14% at a PIFR of 30 L/min.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This variability of the Turbohaler device is clearly acknowledged by regulatory authorities as stated in the US labelling of Pulmicort.

Importantly the Labazenit Axahaler is less dependent on different airflows. In-vitro analysis performed at an optimal airflow showed similar FPD of budesonide between Labazenit Axahaler and the Pulmicort Turbohaler or the Symbicort Turbohaler while at lower airflows, Labazenit Axahaler demonstrated less variability of the FPD. The weak flow dependency of the aerodynamic properties of inhaled particles from the Labazenit Axahaler represents a real advantage for the patient, especially for patients with a significant decrease in their pulmonary function.

## - Inter and intra subject variability

The variability of the OIPs can be increased in relation to the population included in a study. Indeed, the results of the systemic exposure of an OIP can be influenced by the age, and by health status of the  subjects  included  in  a  study  (e.g.  healthy  volunteers,  mild,  moderate  or  severe  asthmatic patients....), by the inhalation airflow of a subject (see previous paragraph) or by the difference from one inhalation to another by the same subject (see previous paragraph).

In  conclusion,  even  with  an  adequate  monitoring  and  instruction  for  the  adequate  use  of  a  device, there is an inter- and intra- patient variability in the handling of the device to obtain an optimal lung deposition, after a single-dose administration of orally inhaled drugs.

## - Inter and intra-batch variability:

The high variability of OIP is well recognized by the European pharmacopoeia, in which the uniformity of delivered dose release specifications are set between 75 to 125%, instead of the usual specifications seen with oral dosage forms which are usually set between 95 to 105% (up to a maximum of 90% to 110%).

The  inter  and  intra-batch  variability  of  budesonide  delivered  with  the  Turbohaler  (Pulmicort  and Symbicort)  is  particularly  high  as  already  demonstrated  in  in-vitro  studies  by  the  Applicant  where several of the batches tested were out of specification. Furthermore, variability is usually observed for the  same  batch  budesonide  when  different  devices  are  used  and  differences  in  drug  delivery,  even from the same device between different actuations, are also observed confirming the high variability of Pulmicort Turbohaler. This variability might be explained by the incomplete disaggregation and possible accumulation of the pelletized micronized particles in the spiral-shaped channels of the mouthpiece of the Turbohaler device, something that cannot happen with the Axahaler.

## - Justification of the Fine Particle Dose (FPD) correction

It is very challenging to find a PK/PD correlation for locally acting OIPs. One reason for this is related to the fact that the site of action in the respiratory tract and the drug residence time in the lungs are not directly correlated with the absorption of the drug from the lungs. PK parameters are 'post events' and therefore do not necessarily constitute a suitable surrogate marker of the efficacy and safety of the inhaled drug. Furthermore, each class of pharmacological agents considered has its specific targets located at different levels in the respiratory tract, which makes establishment of general and reliable PK/PD correlations  very  difficult  for  OIPs.  However,  for  both  ICS  and  LABA,  systemic  bioavailability should be as low as possible to minimise unwanted side effects.

Like  other  ICS,  budesonide  is  believed  to  act  by  binding  to  glucocorticoid  receptors  distributed throughout the airways, with highest receptor concentrations found in the alveoli and bronchial smooth muscle.  However,  there  is  still  controversy  surrounding  the  site  within  the  lungs  to  which  inhaled corticosteroids  should be delivered  with  opinion  differing  as  to  whether  central  airway  deposition  or peripheral airway deposition is more important.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As mentioned above, the PK results are also dependent on the variability between batches of the two products used in any study. This variability is easy to quantify using in-vitro tests and is defined by a key parameter for OIPs: the Fine Particle Dose or Fraction (FPD/FPF). It is defined in the European Pharmacopoeia as the proportion of aerosolised drug particles that are less than a 5 μm aerodynamic diameter and therefore deemed respirable and capable of reaching the lower part of the respiratory tract.

The particle size of inhaled drugs has been identified as one of the critical determinants of both the total  lung  dose  and  their  regional  pulmonary  deposition  pattern.  According  to  the  literature,  studies have  attempted  to  correlate  the  aerodynamic  particle  size  distribution  (APSD)  data  obtained  by cascade  impaction  with  lung  deposition  data  measured  using  gamma  scintigraphy.  Whole-lung deposition correlated significantly with fine particle dose across a range of inhaler devices. FPF defined in terms of particles &lt;3 μm showed closer numerical equivalence to the lung deposition, whereas FPF defined in terms of aerosol &lt;5.8 μm somewhat overestimated the lung deposition. [The FPF of &lt;3 μm and  &lt;5.8  μm  were  (arbitrarily)  chosen  because  they  represent  stages  in  the  Andersen  cascade impactor routinely used for such in vitro studies].

As a benchmark product, Pulmicort Turbohaler has been widely studied and evaluated in numerous in vivo studies where lung deposition was quantified by gamma scintigraphy, a non invasive radionuclide imaging technique.

The pulmonary fraction of the Pulmicort Turbohaler is about 27% which is in agreement with the in vitro fine particle assessment in which the FPD (expressed in %) of budesonide from the Turbohaler device was about 31%.

In another study, Thorsson et al.   assessed the pulmonary availability of budesonide through two PK methods (with or without blocking the gastrointestinal absorption by administration of charcoal). An intravenous infusion of budesonide was used as a reference. The pulmonary availability of budesonide from the Turbohaler device, calculated relative to metered-doses, was 32%.

This supports the results observed from in vivo scintigraphic deposition studies, as well as the in vitro FPD evaluations.

Furthermore, plasma levels of budesonide observed after inhalation mainly result from the absorption through the lung, since the contribution from deposition in the oropharynx and subsequent absorption from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  is  negligible  due  to  extensive  first  pass  metabolism  (85-95%).  As  a consequence, all the PK studies performed can be considered as an indirect measurement of the lung deposition of budesonide, despite all the uncertainties mentioned above (e.g. high variability of inhaled products, inter and intra-batches variability of the products, flow dependence of the reference product etc.).

As  discussed  above,  literature  data  confirm  that  the  FPD  is  an  acceptable  surrogate  marker  of  the amounts  of  budesonide  reaching  the  lungs  as  it  allows  the  inter-batch  variability  to  be  taken  into account.  As  a  consequence,  the  correction  by  FPD  of  the  PK  values  provides  for  more  precise  and reliable data.

Dose proportionality of Labazenit 300/25 μg and Labazenit 150/25 μg was also evaluated in PK studies SD033 and DP102. In study SD033, the plasma concentration curves for Labazenit were similar when normalised  to  dose.  In  study  DP-102,  exposure  to  budesonide  was  relatively  higher  for  Labazenit 300/25. However, the FPD fraction between the Labazenit batches was different 143 μg vs 115 μg. When corrected for FPD, the budesonide pharmacokinetics between Labazenit 300/25 and Labazenit 150/25 were dose proportional in studies SD033 and DP102. Furthermore, as expected in light of the equal  amounts  present  in  the  two  strengths,  the  deposition  profile  of  salmeterol  was  the  same  for LABAZENIT 150/25 μg and 300/25 μg in study DP102.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion,  PK  studies  performed  with  OIPs  are  very  challenging  because  of  numerous  variable parameters which must be considered important when interpreting PK study results.

## 2. Discussion on the PK study results

In the Labazenit dossier, the submitted PK studies (Five single dose and two steady-state studies) are in agreement with the guidelines on FDCs CHMP/EWP/240/95, with the guidelines on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1) and with the guidelines on OIPs (for the studies performed from 2010 onwards). However the Applicant would like to emphasize that in this dossier, the  goal  of  the  PK  studies  for  a  new  FDC  is  not  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence,  but  to  support  the clinical data and to demonstrate that the delivery of the active ingredients versus the reference monoproducts results in a similar or at least non-lower bioavailability.

The budesonide exposure following inhalation of Labazenit and Pulmicort/Symbicort has been assessed and compared in 4 of the 7 studies performed from 2003 to 2011:

- 1 single dose study BUSAL-SD-033, Labazenit 300/25 compared with Pulmicort Turbohaler 2x200 μg

- 2 multiple-dose studies BUSAL-SS-032 using the highest strength 300/25 and study BUSAL-SS071 using the lowest strength 150/25 versus Pulmicort 2*200μg and Pulmicort 200μg respectively.

These three studies were conducted in healthy volunteers without administration of charcoal (but this is without significant effect with budesonide since the gastro-intestinal absorption of the drug is very low and does not impact the overall PK parameters).

- 1 study BUSAL-SD-111, Labazenit 150/25 μg was compared with a less variable product, Symbicort 160/4.5 μg in mild persistent  asthmatic patients  using  charcoal  to  compare  only  lung  deposition  of budesonide. This study was in line with the OIP guideline.

In study BUSAL-SD033 using the highest strength, not all PK parameters for budesonide fell within the 80-125% interval in the comparison of Labazenit 300/25 μg with Pulmicort Turbohaler 2x200 μg, but the point estimate of all parameters were close to unity (0.85 and 1.07 for AUC and 0.95 and 1.12 for Cmax):

The same trend was observed for the multiple dose study, BUSAL SS032. Indeed, point estimate of all parameters were close to unity at steady-state (0.94 and 1.02 for AUC and Cmax respectively) with a 90% CI  obtained  for  the  total  budesonide  was  [0.79-1.12]  for  AUC  and  [0.90-1.15]  for  Cmax.  To support the results of these two studies (BUSAL SD033 and BUSAL SS032), an appropriate the FPD was performed and the corrected results indicated a bioequivalence between the two test products. As already discussed, the bibliography data confirm that the FPD is an acceptable surrogate marker of the amounts of budesonide reaching the lungs since it takes into account the inter-batch variability. As a consequence,  the  correction  by  FPD  of  the  PK  values  provide  for  more  precise  and  reliable  data. Furthermore, the PK profile of budesonide could not be fully characterised following inhalation as Cmax was &lt; 10x LLOQ. Therefore, AUC values from this study should be considered very cautiously and the low plasma concentration observed can be explained by the high variability of the different batches.

The Applicant also states that the 20% of systemic exposure difference observed in this PK study does not  have  any  relevant  clinical  consequence,  particularly  regarding  the  control  of  asthma.  Indeed,  it should be kept in mind that budesonide like all ICS have very flat efficacy dose response curves and it is  generally  considered  that  doubling  the  dose  of  budesonide  does  not  significantly  improve  asthma control, nor does it significantly provide further reductions in asthma exacerbations , whilst a four-fold increase in the dose of budesonide slightly improved asthma control, but results in significantly more adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The absence of any relevant clinical consequence of a lower bioavailability of budesonide delivered as Labazenit was confirmed by the results obtained in the 12-week phase III study comparing Labazenit 150/25 μg and Symbicort 160/4.5 μg.

Furthermore, in the fourth study comparing budesonide bioavailability, BUSAL SS071, the budesonide exposure was almost twice to three times as high following Labazenit 150/25μg compared to Pulmicort Turbohaler  200  μg.  The  point  estimates  were  1.97  and  2.46  for  the  Cmax  for  the  two  epimers  of budesonide.

However,  in  this  study,  the  PK  profile  of  budesonide  could  not  be  fully  characterised  following inhalation  of  the  lowest  dose  as  Cmax  was  &lt;  10x  LLOQ.  Therefore,  AUC  values  from  study  BUSAL SS071  should  be  considered  very  cautiously.  Based  on  this  statement,  the  following  discussion regarding the results from this study will be based only on the Cmax data.

The results obtained in the BUSAL SS071 study reflect the high variability observed with OIP from one study to another. Indeed, in some studies the inter-subject variability of PK parameters is higher for Labazenit  and  in  other  studies  for  Pulmicort.  An  important  reason  for  the  high  variability  in  PK parameters in study BUSAL-SS071 is the low budesonide plasma concentrations obtained compared to the relative high LOQ.

Based  on  the  results  from  these  four  studies,  the  applicant  maintains  that  Labazenit  presents  a comparable budesonide exposure to the reference products (Pulmicort or Symbicort).

Additionally to support the comparability of budesonide systemic exposure between Labazenit and the reference  products  (Pulmicort  and  Symbicort),  the  data  from  the  four  studies,  SMB-BUSAL  SD033, SMB-BUSAL SS032, SMB-BUSAL SS071 and SMBBUSAL SD111 were pooled and an ANOVA analysis was performed. The Applicant is well aware that such a pooling of between different PK studies is not usually recommended, but given the previously explained problems of variability of OIP, this pooling of the full PK data set in the present case allows for an overall idea of the bioavailability of budesonide delivered as Labazenit compared with the reference products (n=125).

Pooled data showed a slightly higher exposure to budesonide delivered from Labazenit than from the reference products. Indeed, not all the PK parameters fell within the 80-125 acceptable margins, but the point estimate are close to unity (1.12 for AUC and 1.18 for Cmax). The data confirm that the budesonide exposure is comparable and at least non-inferior for Labazenit versus reference products.

## 3. Conclusion

Considering all 4 PK studies together (SMB-BUSAL SD033, SMB-BUSAL SS032, SMBBUSAL SS071 and SMB-BUSAL SD111) and considering the known high variability of OIP, the Applicant maintains that Labazenit delivers a comparable and at least a non inferior budesonide exposure as the budesonide reference products (Pulmicort and Symbicort).

Also, considering that in the Labazenit dossier, the goal of the PK studies was not to demonstrate the bioequivalence with the reference products containing budesonide, but to support the clinical data and to demonstrate that the delivery of the active ingredients versus the reference mono-products results in a similar and at least non-inferior bioavailability, the Applicant maintains that the PK data actually support the view that the Labazenit product will deliver sufficient budesonide to the airways and safely to control inflammation and symptoms in a comparable way as budesonide delivered by the reference FDC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Particular benefit of Labazenit's formulation over similar existing products

The applicant's position is that the pharmaceutical development program of Labazenit has demonstrated that the administration of an improved formulation (a patented mixture of budesonide and  salmeterol  blended  with  anhydrous  lactose  (main  carrier)  and  lactose  monohydrate  (carrier  of small particles)) through an optimal delivery system (a low resistance to airflow capsule based device - the Axahaler) results in:

- Improved compliance (ease of use and the possibility to check for the full delivery of the dose).
- Lower  nominal  and  delivered  doses  of  budesonide  than  those  achieved  from  the marketed mono and combo therapies (Pulmicort and Symbicort Turbohaler) leading to a similar lung deposition profile at the optimal flow of each device.
- Lower  airflow  dependency  of  budesonide  from  Labazenit  than  from  the  Turbohaler device, resulting in a higher FPD from Labazenit versus the marketed products at lower inhalation airflows (and therefore possibly a better control of asthma in those patients).
- Lower variability in the delivery of dose of budesonide from Labazenit than from the Turbohaler device.
- Lower  nominal  and  delivered  doses  of  salmeterol  than  those  achieved  from  the marketed monotherapy leading to a similar lung deposition profile at all tested airflows.

In  addition  the  Applicant  brought  forward  observations  regarding  the  assessment  process  and  the evolution of major objections throughout the procedure.

## Additional expert consultation - Report from the ad-hoc expert group meeting held on 11 June 2013

Following a request from the Applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an adhoc expert group meeting inviting the experts, including patient representatives, to provide their views on the questions posed by the CHMP, taking into account the Applicant's response to the grounds for refusal.

## 1. Does the SAG consider the comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide adequately demonstrated between Labazenit and the reference product solely on basis of the PK studies, considering also the scientific arguments in favor and against dose normalisation for Fine particle Dose (FPD)?

There  was  consensus  amongst  the  experts  that  the  Applicant  did  not  demonstrate  comparability  of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide between Labazenit and the reference product on the basis of the PK studies results. In the PK study BUSAL-SD-111 a lower lung deposition and therefore a lower exposure  of  budesonide  with  Labazenit  compared  with  the  active  comparator,  Symbicort,  was observed. Bioequivalence of the budesonide compound between Labazenit and the active comparator could only be demonstrated by the Applicant after correction by FPD. There was consensus amongst the experts that the FPD correction performed by the Applicant is not acceptable. Apart that it was not pre-specified  in  the  study  protocol,  the  FPD  correction  is  not  scientifically  proven  as  being  the  only factor to take into account. Other factors than the particles' size should be taken into account such as the anatomy of the airway and the airflow. Airflow parameters (time and profile) should have been prospectively controlled in the PK studies as well as the particles distribution. The bioequivalence of budesonide in Labazenit therefore remains to be proven.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Does the SAG considers the comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide adequately  demonstrated  between  Labazenit  and  the  comparator  in  clinical  studies taking into consideration the PK data supportively?

The experts were in agreement that superiority of Labazenit over the budesonide comparator has been demonstrated by the Applicant in the clinical studies in terms of mean change from baseline to week 12 in morning PEF. However, the absence of a dose response between the two strengths of Labazenit in study BUSAL- III-02-01 is of concern. One of the reasons for such results could be that the study was not powered sufficiently to observe a dose-response between the two Labazenit strengths or that the  endpoints  selected  were  not  sensitive  enough  to  show  a  difference.  For  instance,  the  results  of study BUSAL-III-02-01 on the morning PEF values were conflicting since the results with the 150/25 dose were better than with the 300/25 dose throughout the study.

Therefore the experts all agreed that comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide has not been  adequately  demonstrated  between  Labazenit  and  the  comparator.  The  clinical  studies'  results cannot compensate for the lack of bioequivalence showed in the PK studies' results.

An expert highlighted that both budesonide and salmeterol are well known compounds with recognized efficacy and well characterized safety profile. In principle a comparable anti-inflammatory control as the budesonide comparator would have been expected with Labazenit if both the dose and the lung deposition could be shown to be comparable with the active comparator treatment.

The patients' representatives stressed that the uncertainty around the dose of Labazenit to be used, taking into account the data presented by the Applicant, was of concern. From a patient's perspective the treatment goal of asthma should be to take the lowest possible dose of medication to obtain the maximal  effect.  The  other  patients'  representative  added  that  combined  medicines  is  a  good development principle as taking two different medications using the same inhaler is more convenient for patients. However the biggest concern remains the safety issue, especially the uncertainty of the doses used to control the disease process.

## Additional information provided by the Applicant

During the Oral Explanation on 24 June 2013, the Applicant proposed to perform a post-authorisation study to confirm that no loss of inflammation control occurs with Labazenit. This study would compare the rate of asthma exacerbations or time to first asthma exacerbation with both dosage strengths of Labazenit versus budesonide alone

## Overall  conclusion  of  the  CHMP  on  the  grounds  for  re-examination  presented  by  the Applicant during the Oral Explanation on 24 June 2013

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the Applicant and considered the views of the advisory expert group meeting held on 11 June 2013.

## CHMP position on ground 1

Labazenit is a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the ICS budenoside and the LABA salmeterol for the  treatment  of  asthma  in  adult  patients  in  a  step-up  and  a  substitution  indication.  The  proposed posology  for  Labazenit  is  one  inhalation  (120  micrograms/20  micrograms  or  240  micrograms  /20 micrograms) twice daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The present application was submitted according to Article 10b) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended (fixed  combination  application).  According  to  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  Clinical  Development  of  Fixed Combination Medicinal Products (CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1) for any individual fixed combination it is necessary to assess the potential advantages in the clinical situation against possible disadvantages, in order to determine whether the product meets the requirements of the standards and protocols with respect to efficacy and safety. Potential advantages of fixed combinations include:

- an improvement of the benefit/risk due to addition or potentiation of therapeutic activities of their substances, which results in e.g. a level of efficacy above the one achievable by a single substance  with  an  acceptable  safety  profile.  This  advantage  can  be  referred  to  the  applied 'step-up indication'.
- a simplification of therapy by decreasing the number of individual dose units to be taken by the patient, which simplifies therapy and may improve patient compliance. This advantage can be referred to the 'substitution indication'.

To  fulfil  the  requirements  according  to  the  Guideline  on  Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combination Medicinal Products, the Applicant submitted four phase III studies:

- Study BUSAL III-02-1, the pivotal study, aimed to demonstrate that both dosage strengths of Labazenit result in a higher efficacy than an ICS mono therapy (even at a higher dose) (stepup indication).
- Studies  BUSAL-III-08-1  and  BUSAL-III-05-1  compared  Labazenit  with  marketed  ICS/LABA combinations.
- 1 year safety follow up study, study BUSAL III-06-1 which was performed to assess the safety of one year treatment with Labazenit 300/25 μg.

In addition, the Applicant submitted 7 PK studies:

- to evaluate if an interaction occurs between budesonide and salmeterol in the budesonide/salmeterol fixed dose combination.
- to evaluate the dose  proportionality of budesonide  between  the  dosage  strengths  of Budesonide/salmeterol (containing respectively 150 and 300 μg of budesonide).
- to support the lower nominal dose by comparative bioavailability between Pulmicort Turbuhaler and Serevent Diskus and Labazenit.

The intention of the study program was to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of the new FDC within the clinical programme carried out in the intended population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In August 2009 the CHMP Guideline on the Requirements for Clinical Documentation for Orally Inhaled Products (OIP) including the Requirements for Demonstration of Therapeutic Equivalence Between Two Inhaled  Products  for  Use  in  the  Treatment  of  Asthma  and  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease (COPD)  in Adults and for Use in the Treatment of Asthma in Children and Adolescents (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) came into force describing a cascade through in vitro development to PK to PD and ultimately to longer-term clinical studies. The guideline further describes in chapter 6.2.3.3 the requirements for developing combination products. Taken into account the specific situation within the  fixed  dose  ICS/LABA  combination,  the  guideline  requires  showing  therapeutic  equivalence specifically for both LABA and the ICS. Taken into account the step-wise approach and in case that for either the LABA or for the ICS components (or for both) equivalence in terms of PK cannot be proven, the  efficacy  of  the  LABA  component  can  be  assessed  following  inhalation  of  a  single  dose  through either  measurement  of  bronchodilatation  over  at  least  80%  of  the  duration  of  action  or  bronchial challenge studies; the efficacy of the ICS component will be assessed through the study of multiple dose inhalations over time.

As part of the SA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/14715/2010) concerning pre-clinical and clinical development, the Applicant  was  advised  by  the  CHMP  that  only  study  BUSAL  III-02-1  'comes  near  to  fulfilling  the required  criteria  for  a  pivotal  efficacy  study'.  The  CHMP  further  acknowledged  that  there  were  no differences in efficacy between the two strengths of the new FDC. Regarding the two efficacy studies BUSAL-III-08-1 and BUSAL-III-05-1 the CHMP noted that 'both lack assay sensitivity and therefore it is  not  certain  whether  the  same  conclusion  might  have  been  drawn  had  different  strengths/dose regimens been compared'. The CHMP concluded that 'considerable additional clinical work is required'.

As supported by the CHMP, the Applicant conducted two further studies:

- Study  SMB-BUSAL-DP102  which  was  a  single  dose,  double-blind,  2-treatment,  2-period,  2sequence, randomised, crossover study in 40 mild persistent asthmatic patients, with at least 3 days  of  wash-out  to  evaluate  dose  proportionality  of  Labazenit  300/25  and  150/50.  Active charcoal  was  administered  orally  in  order  to  prevent  any  gastro-intestinal  absorption  of  the active ingredients. However, PK parameters were not dose proportional for budesonide since exposure was slightly higher for Labazenit 300/25 μg than for 150/25 μg.
- Study BUSAL II-10-2 which was conducted to evaluate the systemic effect on the HPA-axis by the course of plasma cortisol and urine cortisol in Labazenit 300/25 µg BID and 150/25 µg BID compared to Pulmicort Turbuhaler 400 µg BID and Serevent Diskus 50 µg BID and compared to  placebo  in  mild  persistent  asthmatic  patients.  The  highest  recommended  dose  was  used. The  primary  endpoint  considering,  24-hour  AUC  for  plasma  cortisol  remained  stable  in  the placebo group while it decreased in all active treatment groups. Labazenit 300/25 µg appeared to  decrease  serum  cortisol  (AUC0-12  h)  more  than  Labazenit  150/25  µg  and  Pulmicort Turbohaler 400 µg+ Serevent Diskus 50 µg. However, when assessing equivalence between the  different  treatment  groups  cortisol  suppression  could  be  considered  being  equivalent because  the  99.15%  CI  was  included  in  the  predefined  [-20%;+20%]  equivalence  margin, which was supported by bibliographical data.

Two additional PK studies were submitted by the Applicant during the evaluation to further establish the  comparability  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol  versus  reference  products  Symbicort  Turbuhaler 160/4.5 µg (study SMB-BUSAL-SD111) and Serevent Diskus 50 µg (study BUSAL-SD121), respectively, for both claimed indications, by means of showing bioequivalence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study SMB-BUSAL-SD111 compared the lung deposition of budesonide after a single-dose of Labazenit 150/25 μg versus a single dose of Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4,5 μg. The study was performed in 40 asthma patients and active charcoal was administered. The bioavailability of budesonide was higher following  inhalation  of  Symbicort  Turbuhaler  compared  to  the  bioavailability  of  budesonide  following inhalation of Labazenit 150/25 μg [Budenoside Epimer A Ratio test/reference AUC 78 (90%CI 69-89), Cmax 80 (90%CI 70-91); Budenoside Epimer B Ratio test/reference AUC 84 (90%CI 73-96), Cmax 85 (90%CI  77-94)].  Equivalence  for  the  ICS  component  of  the  Labazenit  FDC  to  the  comparator Symbicort  in  terms  of  PK  has  not  been  demonstrated  in  this  study.  The  concern  remains  that  the available  PK  data  does  not  support  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  by  budesonide  between Labazenit and the reference product as it showed a lower bioavailability of budesonide from Labazenit, indicating  lower  deposition  of  budesonide  in  the  lungs.  It  is  agreed,  that  clinical  data  can  overrule differences obtained in PK studies. However, neither study BUSAL III-02-1 for the 'step-up'-indication nor studies BUSAL-III-08-1 and BUSAL-III-05-1 for the 'substitution'-indication are considered to be sufficient as discussed below.

The  Applicant  argues  that  the  PK  studies  were  not  conducted  to  show  bioequivalence  and  that  the differences for the ICS component in terms of PK versus the comparator Symbicort were not relevant. The CHMP does not share the Applicant's view and would like to point out that PK data may be more discriminating than PD or clinical data. However, without having the PK data on hand and even when not following the OIP guidance, the clinical programme would be also insufficient since:

- Studies of at least 6 months duration would be needed according to the Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the treatment of Asthma (step-up-indication and substitution indication).
- Studies having assay sensitivity would be needed according to the Note for Guidance on Choice of Control Group in Clinical Trials (substitution indication).

In study BUSAL III-02-1 both Labazenit 150/25 µg and Labazenit 300/25 µg treatments were superior to Pulmicort after 12 weeks of treatment for the primary parameter PEF. The switch from Pulmicort after  12  weeks  to  Labazenit  150/25  µg  or  Labazenit  300/25  µg  resulted  in  statistically  significant increases  in  morning  PEF  values  from  week  12  to  week  18  and  24  within  both  treatment  groups. However, for PEF neither at week 12 nor at week 24 the difference between Labazenit 150/25 µg and Labazenit 300/25 µg was statistically significant. The mean morning PEF values with the lower dose were even better than with the higher dose at both time points. A clinically dose response difference between the two doses of Labazenit has therefore not been demonstrated. Failure to show a significant difference in clinical effect between both strengths demonstrates a failure to discriminate between the two  dosages  known  to  be  different  and  renders  the  study  inconclusive.  More  knowledge  of  the relationships among dose and clinical response would be needed for the safe and effective use of the combination in individual patients.

The Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the treatment of Asthma requires  clinical  trials  of  at  least  six  month  duration.  But  studies  with  duration  of  8-12  weeks  are considered  only  reliable  by  the  OIP  guideline  for  showing  equivalence  as  a  means  to  compare ICS/LABA combination products. The study duration of study BUSAL-III-02-1 was not questioned by the CHMP during the evaluation. However, since the Applicant claims that the intention of the study programme was not to show equivalence but rather to show superiority against the mono-substances the study duration would have to be a concern and studies of at least 6 months duration would be needed because of the chronic and variable characteristics of asthma (as discussed above).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ICS in Labazenit FDC was proposed at two different dosage strengths (Budesonide 150 μg and 300 μg)  by  the  Applicant  in  order  to  allow  prescribers  flexibility  in  achieving  and  maintaining  adequate control of asthma. However, even doubling the dose of budesonide has no clear impact on the efficacy parameters which questions the suitability of the proposed ICS dose strengths. Further, once asthma control has been achieved guidelines recommend reduction of the dose of treatment necessary. For the comparator Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) the following doses are approved: 80/4,5 µg, 160/4,5 µg, 320/9 µg. They allow titration of the medication much further down than Labazenit 300/25 µg and 150/25 µg, where the lowest dose corresponds with regard to the budesonide component to Pulmicort 200 µg. It remains unclear as to whether lower strengths of the fixed-dose combination budenoside/salmoterol might also be clinically effective.

The Applicant further argued that for no ICS-LABA combinations significant dose-response effect for all marketed  and  investigated  combinations  has  been  demonstrated.  The  dose-response  curve  has traditionally been considered 'flat' for ICS. One of the reason explaining the lack of dose response ins study BUSAL-III-02-01 is that it was performed on the plateau of the dose response curve and not on the  uprising  part  of  the  curve.  However,  dose-response  depends  also  on  the  parameter  being measured and the  severity  of  the  asthma.  One  published  dose-response  study  for  the  budesonideformoterol  combination  was  located  by  the  Applicant  [Aubier  M  et  al  (2010)].  This  was  an  open, randomised,  parallel-group,  6-month  multicentre  study  in  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  asthma who were symptomatic despite daily use of an ICS with or without LABA. A total of 8,424 patients were randomized to budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg, one (1 x 2) or two (2 x 2) inhalations b.i.d. The primary outcome variable was time to first severe asthma exacerbation. In the total study population, the time to first severe asthma exacerbation was prolonged by 18% with 2 x 2 versus 1 x 2 (hazard ratio 0.82; p=0.03). Lung function (peak expiratory flow) was the only statistically significant predictor of a better response to 2 x 2. The mean daily ICS doses were 737 and 463 μg in the 2 x 2 and 1 x 2 groups, respectively. No clinically important differences between the 1 x 2 and 2 x 2 groups were seen in changes in ACQ-5 scores, day- and night-time symptoms or in lung function values.

In  terms  of in  vitro dose  response  of  budesonide  between  Labazenit  150/25 µg  and  300/25  µg the conclusions  of  the  CHMP  cannot  be  reversed  based  upon  no  new  data  been  presented.  The  CHMP review of the points presented by the Applicant does not change its initial conclusions.

PK parameters were nearly dose proportional for budesonide since in the lung deposition study SMBBUSAL-DP102 budesonide exposure was slightly higher for Labazenit 300/25 μg than for 150/25 μg.

On the basis of the PK data, a dose-response can be expected according to the Applicant. However, dose-proportionality  and  dose-response  are  two  different  things.  The  question  remains  why  study BUSAL III-02-1 failed to discriminate between two treatments known to be different in terms of PK data.  The  Applicant  conducted  as  recommended  during  the  SA  a  study,  study  BUSAL-II-10-2,  to evaluate  the  systemic  effects  of  the  two  strengths  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  compared  with placebo through measurement of 24-hour plasma cortisol. But even in this study Labazenit 300/25 µg and Labazenit 150/25 µg were equivalent (and not superior) in decreasing the AUC of 24-hour plasma cortisol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  has  further  conducted  two  studies  comparing  Labazenit  with  the  marketed  ICS/LABA combinations Seretide and Symbicort. Both studies investigated one strength only, study BUSAL III05-1 the highest strength and BUSAL III-08-1 the lowest strength of Labezenit. ICS shows often a flat dose-response  curve  and  demonstration  of  equivalence  in  anti-inflammatory  efficacy  requires  the demonstration  of  a  dose-response  relationsship.  Therefore,  the  OIP-guideline  states  that  the  study design should include two doses in order to show a significant statistical dose response relationsship. Since only one dose was evaluated in studies BUSAL III-05-1 and BUSAL III-08-1 assay sensitivity of these studies is lacking. Thus, it remains unclear, whether the studies are sensitive to show differences between Labazenit and the comparator products. Summarized, non-inferiority in both studies is not proven.

The Applicant requested that the Labazenit dossier should be assessed based on the same scientific reasonings as Flutiform Affilia 50/5, 125/5 and 250/10 micrograms pressurised inhalation, suspension, fixed-dose  combination  products  containing  the  active  drug  substances  fluticasone  propionate  and formoterol fumarate in three strengths. These applications have been submitted according to Directive 2001/83/EC,  Article  10b  through  the  Decentralised  Procedure  and  were  referred  to  the  CHMP (EMEA/H/A-29/1326) since no agreement could be reached within the DC-procedure and within the CMD(h)-Referral.  The  clinical  development  programme  was  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and safety  of  Flutiform  with  its  individual  components  administered  separately,  and  with  its  individual components administered together but inhaled from separate inhalers. Additional supportive studies compared  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Flutiform  with  other  combination  therapies  including  Seretide. Although  the  applications  may  be  in  some  way  comparable,  the  different  study  designs  and  the different package of studies, preclude a direct comparison. Thus, the objections raised in the case of Flutiform cannot simply be extrapolated to this procedure.

The CHMP concludes that the comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide has not been adequately  demonstrated  between  Labazenit  and  the  comparators  in  clinical  studies.  Therefore, Ground 1 of refusal remains unresolved.

## CHMP position on ground 2

The Applicant disputed the validity of using PK data for demonstrating therapeutic equivalence with respect to efficacy. In this respect PK studies, provided that they have been designed and conducted adequately,  have  been  accepted  by  the  CHMP  in  the  OIP  guideline  as  surrogate  for  comparison  of efficacy  even  though  exposure  is  a  'post-event'  (step  2).  Further,  lack  of  PK  equivalence  can  be overruled by PD and /or clinical studies with sufficient assay sensitivity (step 3).

SMB-BUSAL  SD111  has  been  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  bioavailability  of  the  fixed  dose combination  Labazenit  150/25  µg  versus  the  reference  product  Symbicort  Turbuhaler  160/4.5µg administered  with  active  charcoal.  Importantly,  Symbicort  Turbuhaler  160/4.5  μg  has  been  chosen instead of Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 μg because the in vitro testing has demonstrated a lower intra and inter-batch  variability  of  the  delivered  dose  and  the  Fine  Particle  Dose  (FPD).  The  90  %  confidence interval for budesonide (epimer A and epimer B) was not in the predetermined norms of 80-125 % for the for the rate and extent of absorption since the bioavailability of Labazenit 150/25 µg was lower than the bioavailability of Symbicort Turbuhaler 160/4.5 μg. Only when corrected for the FPD value the bioavailability of budesonide from both products was similar.

FPD  correction  may  only  be  considered  acceptable  if  a  clear  IV/IVC  for  FDP  has  been  established previously between the in vitro parameters and the pharmacokinetic parameters (systemic safety and lung deposition) and if the FPD correction has been pre-defined in the study protocol. However, with regard to study SMB-BUSAL SD111 the FPD correction is not acceptable since the adjustment was not pre-specified  in  the  protocol  and  no  in-vitro/in-vivo  correlation  has  been  provided  for  any  of  the products.

The difference in exposure are not relevant according to the Applicant because the difference was in the same order of magnitude as other sources of variance for a given orally inhaled compound.

Several  inhaled  drugs  are  available  with  a  marked  variety  of  devices  from  the  same  MAH.  These products  require  different  inhalation  techniques  and  in  practice  a  patient  is  advised  to  have  all inhalation medication by the same inhalation device (either pMDI of DPI) depending on his/her ability to handle the device. So, it is well recognised that the use of different devices may result in different lung  depositions  and  systemic  exposure  and  are  not  necessarily  interchangeable  without  dose adjustments.

The Applicant considers the intra-subject variability in inhalation of OIP is very high leading to different exposure  on  each  occasion.  Highly  variable  drug  products  (HVDP)  are  those  whose  intra-subject variability  for  a  parameter  is  larger  than  30%.  If  an  Applicant  suspects  that  a  drug  product  can  be considered  as  highly  variable  in  its  rate  and/or  extent  of  absorption,  a  replicate  cross-over  design study can be carried out. Further, those HVDP can be, if justified, assessed with a widened acceptance range  for  Cmax.  The  variability  in  pharmacokinetics  of  budesonide  and  salmeterol  following  oral inhalation is not considered to be an obstacle for demonstration of equivalence.

Variability in fine particle dose between batches is a recognized problem to demonstrate equivalence based on PK, but the Applicant can select the batches used for the comparison and may select test and reference products as similar as possible in all their in vitro parameters.

The  Applicant  presented  newly  pooled  data  from  the  PK  studies  SMB-BUSAL  SD033,  SMB-BUSAL SS032,  SMB-BUSAL  SS071  and  SMB-BUSAL  SD111.  However,  only  study  SMB-BUSAL  SD111  used charcoal  blockage  methodology  and  measured  pulmonary  deposition.  In  contrast  to  that  the  other three PK studies measured systemic exposure and thus, pooling of data is not considered acceptable.

The Axahaler is a mono-dose inhaler having less airflow resistance than comparator devices such as Turbohaler and Diskus. It is agreed that less airflow resistance than the comparator devices may allow special categories of patients with relatively low pulmonary function (e.g. elderly people, patients with severe asthma) to inhale and get an optimal therapeutic dose into the lungs. Further the Applicant claims that the new device improve compliance due to the fact that the device is easy to use and has the  possibility  to  check  for  the  full  delivery  of  the  dose.  However,  this  assumption  has  not  been substantiated by clinical data. On the other hand, since after each usage a new capsule needs to be inserted treatment with the Axahaler may be not very convenient for the patient, especially when used from elderly people or severely ill patients.

The performance of the device (Axahaler) intended for drug administration to the lungs in comparison to the reference device has been taken into account sufficiently by the CHMP and considered adequate with  regards  to  the  therapeutic  outcome  of  the  finished  drug  product  intended  for  marketing authorisation. The quality attributes of Labazenit cannot outweigh the fact that the clinical performance has not been sufficiently demonstrated. The current negative benefit/risk ratio cannot be modified by the device properties. Nonetheless the device properties are an integral part of the clinical performance of  the  finished  drug  product,  which  means  the  good  performance  properties  of  the  device  is appropriately covered in the CHMP AR.

To  conclude  PK  data  did  not  demonstrate  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  by  budesonide between Labazenit and the reference product as it showed a lower bioavailability of budesonide from Labazenit,  indicating  lower  deposition  of  budesonide  in  the  lungs.  Therefore,  Ground  2  of  refusal remains unresolved.

Regarding the point raised by the Applicant about the assessment process it should be noted that the scientific  view  evolves  during  the  procedure.  Also  to  note  that  Rapporteurs'  assessment  reports  are provided to the Applicant for information only; they reflect the position of the Rapporteurs at that time and are not binding on the CHMP.

Overall,  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  detailed  grounds  for  re-examination  submitted  by  the Applicant, the CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk profile of Labazenit remains unfavourable.

## Recommendations following re-examination

Based on the arguments of the Applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy for Labazenit proposed for:

Labazenit  is  indicated  in  the  regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  where  use  of  a  combination medicinal product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist) is appropriate:

- -Patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short acting β2-agonists.

or

- -Patients  already  adequately  controlled  on  both  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  long-acting  β2agonists.

the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion recommends the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for Labazenit. The CHMP considers that:

Whereas

- The comparability of anti-inflammatory control by budesonide has not been adequately demonstrated between Labazenit and the comparator in clinical studies. Study BUSAL III-02-1 is considered  not  sensitive  to  demonstrate  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  of  budesonide between  Labazenit  and  the  comparator  as  there  is  no  difference  in  effect  between  the  two Labazenit doses investigated in the study. The supportive studies BUSAL III-05-1 and BUSAL III08-1 had the limitation that only one dose of both, Labazenit and the comparator, was tested hence employing a design not sensitive to conclusively assess comparability.
- The  available  pharmacokinetic  data  does  not  support  comparable  anti-inflammatory  control  by budesonide between Labazenit and the reference product as it showed a lower bioavailability of budesonide  from  Labazenit,  indicating  lower  deposition  of  budesonide  in  the  lungs.  Only  by correcting for Fine Particle Dose (FPD) was it possible to demonstrate comparable bioavailability, but  this  is  not  considered  appropriate  since  the  FPD  correction  was  not  pre-specified  and  such correction  is  not  acceptable  unless  specific  requirements  are  met  (e.g.  clear  in  vitro/in  vivo correlation has to be established).

The  CHMP remains of the opinion  that  pursuant  to  Article  12  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not properly or sufficiently demonstrated.

Therefore, the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for Labazenit.
