## 1.1. Introduction

Neupro (rotigotine) is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's  disease  (PD)  is  a  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterized  by  a  progressive  loss  of dopaminergic  neurons  in  the  substantia  nigra.  Parkinson's  disease  is  clinically  characterised  by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural reflex impairment. The cause of Parkinson's disease is,  at  present  time,  unknown.  Parkinson's  disease  is  a  slowly  progressive  disease.  Pharmacological intervention  of  Parkinson's  disease  is  symptomatic.  Improvement  of  an  impaired  dopaminergic neurotransmission  is  the  backbone  of  therapy.  About  70%  of  patients  with  PD  will  require symptomatic  therapy  within  2  years  of  disease  onset.  The  choice  between  levodopa+decarboxylase inhibitor or a dopamine-agonist for initial therapy remains controversial. On  the one hand levodopa+decarboxylase inhibitor is more effective  and  better  tolerated  than  dopamine-agonists,  on the other hand there are concerns that it might be toxic to dopaminergic neurons and that it promotes the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.

Rotigotine  (Neupro)  belongs  to  the  group  of  non-ergolinic  dopamine  agonists  and  shows  a  close structural analogy to dopamine and apomorphine. The currently approved formulations are presented as 10 cm 2 ,  20  cm 2 ,  30 cm 2 and 40 cm 2 transdermal patches containing respectively 4.5 mg, 9.0 mg, 13.5 mg and 18.0 mg of rotigotine, and designed to release respectively 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg of rotigotine per 24 hours.

The variation refers to an extension of the therapeutic indication to include 'the treatment of the signs and symptoms of advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course  of  the  disease,  through  to  late  stages  when  the  effect  of  levodopa  wears  off  or  becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or 'on-off' fluctuations).'

Consequential changes were made to relevant sections of the Summary Product Characteristics (SPC). The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  was  updated  accordingly.    In  addition,  contact  details  of  Bulgaria  and Romania local representatives were also included.

## 1.2. Non clinical aspects

The  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  results  from  animal  studies,  supportive  of  the  approved formulations have been previously assessed at the time of the initial application for Neupro. The dose of  18  mg  (40  cm 2 patch  size,  i.e  8  mg/24h),  maximum  therapeutic  dose  observed  for  the  currently approved indication, was used as basis to calculate the safety margins of rotigotine.

This variation application concerns an extension of indication to include the treatment of signs and symptoms  of  advanced  stage  Parkinson  patients  in  combination  with  levodopa.  The  proposed maximum therapeutic dose is 36 mg (i.e 16 mg/24h) and has been used in the pivotal clinical study SP515, conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

Within  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  has  therefore  proposed  to  update  the  calculation  of  the safety margins and revise the product information accordingly.

The  toxicological  safety  margins  were  calculated  for  the  maximum  human  dose  of  36  mg  for  the treatment  of  advanced  stage  of  Parkinson's  disease  based  on  the  mean  maximum  plasma  levels  in patients , achieved during the maintenance phase (i.e. 6.71 ng/mL).

At doses above the NOEL, the most prominent systemic effects, such as restlessness and effects on food/water  consumption  and  body  weight  ,  are  mainly  related  to  the  pharmacodynamic,  dopamine agonistic  effects  in  healthy  animals  and/or  the  well-known  influence  of  dopamine  agonists  on  sex hormone (e.g. prolactin) secretion.

## Safety ratios at Well Tolerated Dose Levels (WTDLs)

Well  tolerated  dose  levels  (WTDLs)  were  defined  by  the  MAH  as  to  show:  no  substance-related deaths;  no  findings  which  are  not  related  to  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  rotigotine;  no irreversible rotigotine-related effects.

Given the results provided by the long-term pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, which were mainly related to pharmacodynamic, dopamine agonistic related-effects, the use of the WTDL is interesting and may reflect a more realistic estimation of the safety margins.

Overall, rotigotine did not result in any target organ toxicity. With respect to the toxicological data and relevant non-clinical findings, the CHMP concluded that the safety ratios compared to the maximum intended dose in advanced Parkinsonian patients (36 mg) were acceptable.

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

The clinical development program to support the extension of indication of Neupro to advanced-stage Parkinson's disease included 3 placebo-controlled studies:

- -1 phase II study (SP511) was conducted in patients with advanced stage Parkinson's disease and evaluated dose-response with the following patches: 9 mg/20 cm 2 , 18mg /40 cm 2 and 27mg /60 cm 2 .
- -2 pivotal phase III studies (SP650 and SP515) , were conducted in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's  disease.  Both  clinical  studies  were  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind  and parallel group design, consisting of a titration period in which the patients were titrated to their optimal dose or up to a maximum dose, followed by a maintenance and de-escalation periods. In study SP515, treatment arm included pramixepole, as an active control and the patients were receiving doses up to 36 mg (i.e 16 mg/24h).

Additional  phase  II/IIIb  open-label  studies  were  conducted  and  mainly  evaluated  the  safety  and tolerability of rotigotine in patients with advanced stage Parkinson's disease. Particularly, two phase IIIb  studies  were  performed,  respectively,  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  overnight  switching  from ropinirole,  pramipexole,  or  cabergoline  to  rotigotine  (SP824)  and  the  effect  of  rotigotine  on  early morning motor impairment and sleep disorders (SP826).

## Clinical Efficacy

- Dose-Response Study

## Study SP511

## METHODS

## Primary objective

The primary objective of this phase II study was to determine the dose group of rotigotine patch that shows efficacy with optimal benefit/risk ratio in subjects with advanced-stage, idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

## Design

SP511  was  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  parallel  study  with  4  arms  respectively placebo, rotigotine at 9mg (20 cm 2 ), 18 mg (40cm 2 ) and 27mg (60cm 2 ).

## Study Participants

Subjects  with  idiopathic  Parkinson's  disease  who  were  required  to  exhibit  the  cardinal  sign  of bradykinesia and at least 1 of the additional signs of advanced-stage disease: resting tremor, rigidity, and/or impairment of postural reflexes. Furthermore, these subjects were not adequately controlled on the levodopa dose (in combination with benserazide or carbidopa), which was judged by the treating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

physician to be optimal. At Baseline, subjects had motor fluctuations with diary confirmation that at least  2.5  hours/day  were  spent  in  the  'off'  state.  Subjects  with  unpredictable  'on'/'off'  fluctuations were excluded from the trial.

## Treatment study arms

In  study  SP511,  the  target  doses  selected  in  patients  with  advanced-stage  Parkinson's  disease  were 9.0mg  (20cm 2 ),  18.0mg  (40cm 2 ),  and  27mg(60cm 2 )  rotigotine.  The  subjects  were  titrated  to  their target doses in weekly increments of 4.5mg (10cm 2 ), starting at 9.0mg/day (20cm 2 ).

Back-titration could be performed once during the entire titration period. Once a back titration was performed, the patient was maintained at the back titrated dose for the remainder of the study period. If  another  dose  reduction  was  necessary,  the  subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.  Different combinations of 4 patches (including placebo, 4.5mg, and 9.0mg patches) were used to titrate subjects weekly  for  5  weeks  to  their  target  doses.  Patients  randomised  to  9mg  (20cm 2 )  and  18.mg  (40cm 2 ) received  placebo  patches  for  4  and  2  weeks,  respectively.  Patients  in  each  treatment  group  were maintained  on  the  target  dose  for  7  weeks.  The  maximum  treatment  exposure  to  rotigotine  was  3 months.

## Primary endpoint

The primary variable was the absolute change from baseline to end of treatment in absolute time spent 'off'.

## RESULTS

A total of 324 subjects were randomised to treatment: 84 to placebo and 240 to rotigotine (of which 2 discontinued  the  trial  prior  to  receiving  randomised  medication).  Of  the  238  remaining  subjects randomised to rotigotine, 15 never received rotigotine because of sham back titrations.

The different treatment groups were well balanced with respect to age, sex, body weight, ethnic origin, and  duration  of  disease  (range  of  7.3  to  7.9  years).  At  baseline,  the  absolute  time  spent  'off'  was similar across treatment groups (range 5.97 - 6.47 hours). The baseline UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) scores (I, II, and III) were well balanced between treatment groups. In addition, subject's  distribution  using  Hoehn  &amp;  Yahr  staging,  levodopa  use  at  baseline,  and  agreement  for training of subjects for completion of subject's diaries were well balanced between treatment groups.

## · Main studies

## Studies SP650 and SP515

## METHODS

## Objectives

The objectives  of  the  2  phase  III  studies  (SP650  and  SP515)  were  to  evaluate  efficacy,  safety  and tolerability of rotigotine transdermal patch as adjuvant to levodopa in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease as compared to placebo and  active control i.e. pramipexole (only SP515).

## Study Design

Studies SP650 and SP515 had a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study design.

## Study Participants

Subjects  with  advanced  idiopathic  Parkinson's  Disease,  who  experienced  wearing-off  type  motor fluctuations on levodopa.

Subjects were included if they had been diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of &gt;3 years in duration, had a Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage II through IV as observed in both the 'on' and 'off' state, were on a stable dose of levodopa of at least 200 mg/day (SP650) or 300 mg/day (SP515) for at least 28 days prior  to  baseline,  were  not  adequately  controlled  on  anti-Parkinson  medication  as  judged  by  the treating investigator to be optimal, had an average of 2.5 hours/day or more spent in the 'off' state at screening; were on a stable dose of all anti-Parkinsonian medications at least 28 days prior to baseline. For the duration of the trial the concurrent anti-Parkinson medication allowed, had to remain stable.

Main exclusion criteria were patients with a history of surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease, serious  concurrent  co-morbidity,  QTc  interval  abnormalities,  orthostatic  hypotension  and  history  of skin sensitivity to adhesives.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment study arms

## Procedure

The run-in  period  was  approximately  28  days.  The  subsequent  dose  escalation  phase  was  5  weeks (SP650) or 7 weeks (SP515).

In study SP650, patients were titrated up to the target dose (18 or 27 mg/day) or maximum tolerated doses.

In  study  SP515,  patients  were  titrated  up  to  the  optimal  dose,  tolerated  dose  or  maximum  dose (36mg/day).

The  maintenance  phase  lasted  24  weeks  (SP650)  or  16  weeks  (SP515).  In  the  maintenance  phase, patients remained on the optimal doses determined. During the first 2 weeks of the maintenance phase L-dopa could be reduced.  At the end of the maintenance phase a blinded de-escalation over 8 days (SP650) or 6 days (SP515) days followed.

## Doses

In study SP650, subjects were randomised to rotigotine transdermal patch 18 mg/day, 27 mg/day or placebo. All patients received  two  10 cm 2 patches (placebo patch  or  4.5 mg rotigotine ) and  two 20 cm 2 patches (placebo or 9.0 mg rotigotine).

Based on the targeted daily dose, the titration schedule is presented in the following table:

od=once daily, tid=3 times daily

## Concomitant treatment

Subjects had to be on a stable dose of levodopa defined as no change in total daily dose and in the treatment regimen for at least 28 days prior to baseline. Subjects were not permitted to adjust their daily  dose  of  L-DOPA  at  any  time  during  the  course  of  the  trial.  In  case  of  adverse  events  due  to excessive dopaminergic stimulation, the physician could reduce the L-DOPA dose but only in the first 2 weeks of the maintenance phase. Thereafter the dose had to remain stable.

Concurrent medication acting on the dopaminergic system other than levodopa was not allowed. Other anti-Parkinson's drugs and/or CNS active drugs were allowed, provided the dose was stable and kept stable during the trial. In study SP650, COMT-inhibitors were not allowed whereas in study SP515 entacapone was allowed.

## Efficacy endpoints

Subjects recorded the time spent 'off', 'on without troublesome dyskinesias', 'on with troublesome dyskinesias',  sleep,  and  time  of  anti-Parkinson  medication.  Before  study  entry,  subjects  were intensively trained to recognise these motor stages and how to complete their diaries. Three diaries had to be completed for 3 consecutive days prior to the next visit. A diary was considered valid if at least 22 of the 24 hours data were completed. Less than 2 valid diaries out of 3 was considered missing.

According to different regulatory recommendations, the primary endpoint was defined differently in Europe (EU) and the United States (US).

In the EU, the primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of responder at the end of treatment. A responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 30% decrease in absolute time spent 'off'. In the US, the primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  absolute  reduction  in  absolute  time  spent  'off'  at  the  end  of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary  outcomes  variables  notably  included  on/off  time  based  variables,  absolute  change  in  on stage  of  UPDRS  II  (ADL),  UPDRS  III  (Motor  score)  and  UPDRS  IV  (impairment),  Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (SP515 only), EuroQoL (SP650 only) and clinical global impression.

## Sample size

## Study SP560

Assuming  the  true  proportions  of  responders  is  60%  and  40%  for  active  treatment  and  placebo respectively,  a    sample  size  of  110  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm  was  needed  to  detect  such difference, ( α =0.05, 1β =0.80).

## Study SP515

The sample size was determined by the active comparison of rotigotine to pramipexole.

Assuming a true responders rate of 50% for both active treatment arms, 180 subjects per active arm was needed to ensure that the lower bound of the two sided CI95% does not exceed the non-inferiority margin of 15% (1β =0.80).

For  the  absolute  reduction  in  absolute  time  spent  'off'  at  the  end  of  treatment,  sample  size  was calculated on the analysis as performed for the EU. For the comparison to placebo, the expected 20% difference  as  given  in  the  responder  endpoint  corresponded  to  1.5  hours  reduction  in  absolute  'off' time  (power  &gt;  0.95,  SD  2.48).    For  the  active  comparison  the  15%  non-inferiority  margin corresponded to a reduction in absolute 'off' time of approximately 1.2 hours (power &gt; 0.95).

Assuming a difference in responder's rate with placebo of 20%, 90 subjects are needed in the placebo arm  to  establish  a  statistical  significant  difference,  if  it  exists  (2-sided  normal  approximation  test, α =0.05, 1β =0.85, 2:2:1 randomization ratio).

## Statistical methods

No interim analyses or data monitoring board meetings were conducted.

The responder status was analyzed using large sample normal approximation. The analysis of absolute change in 'off' time was evaluated by means of an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model with treatment as main effect and geographic region and baseline absolute time spent 'off' as covariates.

The primary analysis concerned the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The Full Analysis Set incorporates all randomized patients receiving trial medication and with a valid baseline visit (4 valid diary cards out of 6) and at least 1 valid post-baseline visit (2 valid diary cards out of 3). For non-inferiority testing (SP650) the FAS data set was also the primary analyses set.

In study SP650, the first comparison was between rotigotine 27 mg/day and placebo ( α =0.025 1-sided) for  superiority  of  rotigotine  responder  rate  to  the  placebo  responder  rate.  If  significant,  the  second comparison was between rotigotine 18 mg/day versus placebo ( α =0.025 1-sided).

In  study  SP515,  the  first  comparison  was  between  placebo  and  rotigotine  ( α =0.05  2-sided)  for superiority  of  rotigotine  responder  rate  to  the  placebo  responder  rate.  If  significant,  the  second comparison  was  between  rotigotine  and  pramipexole  for  non-inferiority  ( α =0.025  1-sided),  if  noninferior  and  the  corresponding  confidence  interval  (CI)  lied  above  0,  then  a  2-sided  p-value  for superiority of rotigotine to pramipexole was to be calculated.

Secondary variables were presented using descriptive statistics only.

## Missing values

Only data from valid visits were used for analyses. A daily diary card was regarded to be valid if at least 22 hours of the 24 hour clock were filled in. The missing hours were imputed according to the proportions 'on/off' of the observed hours. Further, a visit was regarded only valid if for the baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

visit at least 4 diary cards out of the 6 were valid and for the post-baseline visits at least 2 diary cards out of 3 were valid. For missing data the last observation carried forward was used.

The safety data set (SS) included all subjects randomized who have received at least one dose of trial medication.

The  full  analyses  data  set  (FAS)  included  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  treatment  and  having  a  baseline  and  at  least  one  postbaseline measurement for the primary variable.

The per protocol data set (PPS) was a subset of the full analysis set by excluding all subjects with less than 8 weeks of exposure to the trial medication in the maintenance phase or the subjects with a major protocol deviation.

The completer data set (CS) was a subset of the full analysis excluding all subjects without valid end of maintenance visit. n.a: not applicable

## Baseline data

The baseline data (e.g. patient and disease characteristics, use of L-dopa and history of previous antiParkinson  medication)  were  equally  distributed  over  the  treatment  arms.    Especially  the  UPDRS scores at baseline indicates equal disease burden.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

EOM: end of maintenance, CGI: Clinical Global Impression

## · Supportive studies

Two phase IIIb studies were provided, respectively, to evaluate the effect of overnight switching from ropinirole,  pramipexole,  or  cabergoline  to  rotigotine  (SP824)  and  the  effect  of  rotigotine  on  early morning motor impairment and sleep disorders (SP826).

In  study  SP824,  subjects  switched from  an  oral dopamine  agonist  to  rotigotine  transdermal experienced no loss of efficacy or increase in sleeps impairment.

In study SP826, treatment with transdermal rotigotine improved early morning motor impairment and sleep  disorders  in  subjects  who  were  diagnosed  with  idiopathic  Parkinson's  disease  and  who  were titrated  to  an  optimal  dose  of  rotigotine  up  to  36mg/day.  In  addition,  the  CGI  (Clinical  Global Impression), PGI (Patient Global Impression), and PDQ-8 (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, short form) showed consistent improvement. An improved control of motor performance as supported by improvements in tapping Rates,  UPDRS Part III  Score,  nocturnal  akinesia  score,  and  the  standingwalking-turning test was observed. An improved control of sleep disorders was observed as supported by a decreased nocturnal akinesia, decreased nocturnal dystonia, decreased nocturnal cramps, fewer nocturias,  an  improved sleep and nocturnal disability score and an improved sleep without daytime somnolence.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The clinical development program of rotigotine, proposed by the applicant to extend the therapeutic indication  to  advanced  stage  Parkinson's  disease  is  in  accordance  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on Clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (CPMP/EWP/563/95).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  design  and  conduct  of  the  pivotal  studies  did  not  raise  critical  issues.  Especially  the  complex double-dummy  schedule  applied  in  both  pivotal  studies  was  quite  challenging.  Furthermore,  the management of concomitant medication was as expected in those studies performed in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. One point of criticism is the predefined non-inferiority margin in the active  controlled  study  (SP515).  The  predefined  non-inferiority  margin  is  questionable  since  in  the worse case scenario as a loss of effect of 50% would in principle have been accepted.

Rotigotine was effective in reducing 'off' time as compared to placebo, irrespective of whether this was expressed in terms of responders, defined as a subject with a ≥ 30% decrease in absolute time spent 'off', or absolute change in 'off' time.

In  study  SP650,  responder  rates  were  55%,  57%  and  34%  for  rotigotine  27  mg/day,  rotigotine  18 mg/day and placebo respectively. The 'off' time decreased from baseline by 2.1, 2.7 and 0.9 hours for rotigotine 27 mg/day, rotigotine 18 mg/day and placebo respectively.

In  study  SP515,  responder  rates  were  67%,  60%  and  35%  for  pramipexole,  rotigotine  and  placebo respectively.  The  'off'  time  decreased  by  2.5,  2.8  and  0.9  hours  for  rotigotine,  pramipexole  and placebo respectively.

Differences  with  placebo  were  all  highly  significant  and  a  reduction  in  'off'  time  of  2  hours  as compared to placebo was clinically relevant.

Nevertheless, non inferiority has not been demonstrated even wih a predefined non-inferiority margin considered to be set too high. The lower limit of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates exceeded the non-inferiority margin of 15% (CI95%: -16.7%; 2.1%). In contrast, the confidence interval of the difference in the absolute change in the 'off' time between rotigotine and pramipexole was  within  the  predefined  non-inferiority  margin  i.e.  1.2  hrs  (CI 95% :  -0.91;  0.21).  Although  these results appeared controversial, a clinical benefit of rotigotine in the 'on' time without dyskinesia was also observed, as compared to pramipexole.

With respect to the open label and uncontrolled studies SP824 and SP826, results do not allow any conclusions concerning the overall efficacy of rotigotine and efficacy variables such as improvement in sleep (as measured by the Parkinson's disease sleep scale or PDSS, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale or ESS). The limitation of these efficacy results was acknowledged by the MAH as only descriptive statistics were presented.

Overall, the efficacy results from the clinical development program of Neupro are supportive of the applied  extension  of  indication  to  include  the  treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  advanced idiopathic  Parkinson's  disease  in  combination  with  levodopa,  i.e.  over  the  course  of  the  disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or 'on-off' fluctuations).

## Clinical Safety

All  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  trial  medication  (rotigotine  silicone  patch  formulation, pramipexole, or placebo) were included in the safety analyses.

The safety results presented mainly concern the primary analysis set, i.e. all subjects from the pivotal studies SP650 and SP515.

Safety variables included the occurrence of adverse events, changes in vital signs, body weight, ECGs, clinical  laboratory  values,  physical  and  neurological  examination,  Epworth  Sleepiness  Scale  scores and Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (SP515 only).

## · Patient exposure

Overall,  1151  subjects  with  advanced-stage  Parkinson's  disease  were  exposed  to  rotigotine  (see Table 14).

Set AS5 included the same subjects as in set AS4, but only the open-label data were used.

## · Adverse events (AEs)

Aside from those events that are associated with the method of administration (i.e. use of transdermal patch), the reported AEs mainly concern those generally considered as class-related and well-known pharmacodynamic effects  of  dopamine  agonists.  Of  importance,  no  dose  relationship  was  observed between rotigotine dose and the occurrence of the AEs.

The rates of AEs for rotigotine and pramipexole are comparable. Any differences in numerical values are probably due to random variation.

## · Deaths and other serious adverse events

There were 20 reports of deaths. These concerned patients who received rotigotine (n=16), placebo (n=3) and no medication (n=1, the death occurred during the run-in period). The reported deaths under medication were not considered related to study treatment. The causes of death under rotigotine were: cerebrovascular  accident  (n=3),  myocardial  infarction  (n=2),  pneumonia  (n=2),  completed  suicide (n=2),  cardiac  disorder(n=1),  renal  cancer  metastatic(n=1),  unexplained  death(n=1),  road  traffic accident(n=1), bronchial carcinoma(n=1), intestinal obstruction (n=1) and pulmonary embolism(n=1).

Forty-six  (9%),  33  (9%)  and  16  (7.4%)  serious  AEs  were  reported  in  the  rotigotine,  placebo  and pramipexole groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Serious  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  related  to  rotigotine    medication  included:  myocardial ischemia  (0.2%),  atrial  fibrillation  (0.2%),  supraventricular  tachycardia  (0.2%),  nausea  (0.2%), application  and  instillation  site  reactions  (0.5%),  application  site  dermatitis  (0.5%),    Oedema peripheral (0.2%), cellulitis (0.2%), fall (0.2%), dyskinesia (0.2%), vasovagal syncope (0.2%),  and sleep attacks (0.2%). No serious adverse events were reported with respect to hallucination, psychosis, paranoid reaction, or somnolence.

## · Other safety findings

Among all rotigotine-treated subjects there were 514 application and instillation site reactions reported by 334 out of 1151 subjects (29%).

Oedema was reported in 1% of placebo-treated subjects and 9% of rotigotine-treated. Two subjects (&lt;1%) in the  rotigotine  group  had  severe  peripheral  oedema,  one  case  was  reported  as  serious  and resulted  in  discontinuation  of  treatment.  Three  additional  rotigotine-treated  subjects  (&lt;1%  total) discontinued treatment as a result of peripheral oedema.

The rate of oedema was higher in study SP650 (placebo&lt;1%, rotigotine=13%) as compared to study SP515 (placebo=2%, rotigotine=4%, pramipexole=3%).

In clinical studies, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at about 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Adverse  events  lead  to  discontinuation  in  8%  of  the  placebo-treated  subjects  and  13%  of  the rotigotine-treated subjects.

Adverse event terms that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  &gt;1%  of  rotigotine-treated  subjects  included nausea (4%), vomiting (2%), and application and instillation site reactions (2%). Peripheral Oedema lead to discontinuation in the Rotigotine group (0.9%).

Dose  reduction  due  to  AE  occurred  in  3%  of  subjects  receiving  placebo  and  in  5%  of  subjects receiving  rotigotine.  In  the  rotigotine  group,  the  most  frequent  AE  leading  to  dose  reduction  was dyskinesia (3%).

## · Discussion on Clinical Safety

The safety profile of rotigotine in advanced Parkinson's disease is similar to the one observed for a dopamine-agonistic  agent.  Although  the  rotigotine  doses  were  higher  in  this  patient  population,  no dose-response  relationship  with  respect  to  AEs  was  present.  In  addition,  an  increased  frequency  of AEs was observed as compared to monotherapy.

In  studies  SP650  and  SP515, high incidence of application site reactions (31%) has been observed. Although these AEs may counteract the convenience gained by the once dosing schedule, they have similarly been reported in the monotherapy studies and therefore did not raise any new concern. Most application and instillation site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, and most had resolved by the end of double-blind treatment. The incidence of these AEs did not appear to be dose dependent.

Safety  analysis  of  specific  issues  such  as  cardiac  arrythmias,  eye  disorders,  severe  application  site reactions,  oedema,  orthostatic  hypotension,  dyskinesias,  sleep  attacks,  compulsive  behaviour,  and potential  for  QT  prolongation  were  performed  in  patients  with  advanced  stage  Parkinson's  disease from those clinical studies. No concerns were raised. In clinical studies, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at about 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 1.5 Overall Conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  for Neupro  transdermal  patches  indicated  in  ' the  treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  advanced idiopathic  Parkinson's  disease  in  combination  with  levodopa,  i.e.  over  the  course  of  the  disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or 'on-off' fluctuations)' , is favourable and recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation.

A revised risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- -routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
