## 1. Introduction

Yondelis (trabectedin) is an antineoplastic agent that binds to the minor groove of DNA, bending the helix  to  the  major  groove.  This  binding  to  DNA  triggers  a  cascade  of  events  affecting  several transcription factors, DNA binding proteins, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in perturbation of the cell cycle. Trabectedin has been shown to exert antiproliferative in vitro and in vivo activity against a range of human tumour cell lines and experimental tumours, including malignancies such as sarcoma, breast, non-small cell lung, ovarian and melanoma.

Yondelis (trabectedin), formerly known as ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) was granted orphan designation (EU/3/01/039) by the European Commission on 30 May 2001 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Subsequently,  an  orphan  designation  (EU/3/03/171)  was  granted  by  the  European  Commission  for trabectedin for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Yondelis  was  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  in  the  European  Union  on  17  September  2007. Yondelis is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, after failure of anthracyclines and ifosfamide, or who are unsuited to receive these agents. Efficacy data are based mainly on  liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma patients.

This  type  II  variation  concerns  the  addition  of  a  new  indication  of  Yondelis  in  combination  with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, annex II has been updated to include the agreed version 6.0 of the RMP.

## 1.2 Background

Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary is one of the most common gynaecologic malignancies and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death in women, with 50% of all cases occurring in women older than 65  years.  Approximately  5%  to  10%  of  ovarian  cancers  are  familial  and  three  distinct  hereditary patterns have been identified: ovarian cancer alone, ovarian and breast cancers, or ovarian and colon cancers. The most important risk factor for ovarian cancer is a family history of a first-degree relative (e.g., mother, daughter, or sister) with the disease.

Prognosis in ovarian cancer is influenced by several factors, but multivariate analyses suggest that the most important favourable factors include:

-  Younger age.
-  Good performance status.
-  Cell type other than mucinous and clear cell.
-  Lower stage.
-  Well-differentiated tumour.
-  Smaller disease volume prior to any surgical procedure.
-  Absence of ascites.
-  Smaller residual tumour following primary cytoreductive surgery

Management of ovarian carcinoma depends on the extent of disease and prior therapy that the patient has received. The FIGO (Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique) staging system is used to classify the extent of disease and provide the basis for treatment considerations. Patients with newly  diagnosed  Stage  I  or  II  disease  have  limited  ovarian  carcinoma  confined  to  the  ovaries  and pelvis.  Patients  diagnosed  with  Stage  III  or  IV  disease  have  advanced  ovarian  carcinoma  that  is intraperitoneal (IP) or involves distant metastases. Patients whose disease recurs or persists after prior therapy  are  referred  to  as  having  recurrent  or  persistent  disease.  Most  patients  (75%)  present  with disseminated (Stage III or IV) disease; 17% with Stage III disease, 58% with Stage IV.

The standard of care for advanced disease, set forth at a 2004 Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) consensus conference, consists of maximum  attempted surgical cytoreduction, chemotherapy following surgery, and a drug regimen of paclitaxel/carboplatin repeated every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results  with  this  approach  depend  on  the  volume  of  residual  disease.  Those  with  large-volume residual disease (nodules &gt;2 cm in diameter remaining after surgery) will achieve a clinical CR in 40 to 50% of cases and will have a median PFS of 17 months and median survival of 30 months. Those with  small-volume  residual  disease  (no  nodule  &gt;2  cm  in  diameter  after  surgery)  have  a  95% probability of ending initial therapy with no clinical evidence of disease and will exhibit median PFS of 25 months and median survival of 60 months.

For Stage I or II, the general practice is to look at tumour features that predict prognosis and divide patients  according  to  low  and  high  risk  for  recurrence.  Low-risk  patients  are  those  with  low-grade disease  whose  cancer  is  intracystic,  who  have  no  extraovarian  disease,  have  negative  peritoneal cytology, and have no ascites. High-risk patients are those with intermediate- to high-grade disease whose  cancer  is  extracystic  and  who  have  extraovarian  disease,  positive  peritoneal  cytology,  and ascites. Treatment  recommendations  for  limited disease include platinum-based  therapy, total abdominal  hysterectomy-bilateral  salpingo-oophorectomy,  and  careful  surgical  exploration.  Some patients with low-risk limited disease have no further therapy. Those with high-risk disease receive platinum-based therapy; adjunct platinum-based therapy cuts relapse in half. Patients with advanced disease receive surgical cytoreduction and paclitaxel/carboplatin.

Most patients (62%) will not achieve long-term control of the disease and will develop either recurrent or persistent disease. Management of such patients requires that they first be classified as having either chemosensitive  disease  (i.e.,  response  to  first-line  therapy  leading  to  a  treatment-free  interval  of  at least 6 months) or chemoresistant disease (i.e., progression during first-line therapy or best response to first-line therapy: stable disease or recurrence within 6 months of completing first-line therapy). Those with chemosensitive disease are retreated with a platinum-based regimen; the expected RR is &gt;60% and  median  survival  is ≥ 30  months.  Those  with  chemoresistant  disease  are  treated  with  alternative drug therapy; expected RR is 12 to 32% and median survival is ≥ 8 months.

Clinical recurrences that take place within 6 months of completion of a platinum-containing regimen are  considered  platinum-refractory  or  platinum-resistant  recurrences.  Anthracyclines  (particularly when formulated  as  PLD),  taxanes,  topotecan,  and  gemcitabine  are  used  as  single  agents  for  these recurrences based on activity and their favourable therapeutic indices.

Treatment with paclitaxel historically provided the first agent with consistent activity in patients with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant recurrences (Kohn EC, Sarosy G, Bicher A, et al 1994 and Trimble EL, Adams JD, Vena D, et al. 1993). Subsequently, randomized studies have indicated that the  use  of  topotecan  achieved  results  that  were  comparable  to  those  achieved  with  paclitaxel  (ten Bokkel  Huinink  W,  Gore  M,  Carmichael  J,  et  al.  1997).  Topotecan  was  compared  with  pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in a randomized trial of 474 patients and demonstrated similar response rates, PFS, and OS at the time of the initial report, contributed primarily by the platinum-resistant subsets (Gordon AN, Fleagle JT, Guthrie D, et al. 2001).

PLD is marketed in the European Union under the brand name of Caelyx (it is also known as DOXIL). PLD is a liposomal anthracycline with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity including ovarian cancer.  Caelyx  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  after  failure  of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

The application is based primarily on clinical data from one pivotal Phase III study (ET743-OVA301) of Yondelis in combination with Caelyx in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who had failed a first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  In  addition  results  from  3  Phase  II  trials  of  trabectedin  as single agent in a similar patient population are included as supportive efficacy data.

## 1.3 Toxico-pharmacological aspects

An environmental risk assessment was submitted in this application in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  has  estimated  the  partition  coefficient  log  K ow based  on  theoretical  considerations. Although the estimated log K ow is far from the action limit, this approach is not considered acceptable. The MAH should determine the partition coefficient in accordance with the current OECD guidelines, i.e.,  OECD 107 or 117 (the latter method is only applicable for compounds with a log K ow &lt;4). The MAH should submit the study report when available.

The MAH has calculated the PECSW based on the maximum dose per patient adjusted for treatment duration. This approach is not acceptable. In the Phase I environment risk assessment, the calculation of  the  PEC SW  is  based  on  a  screening  model  (snapshot  model)  in  which  the  patient  population  is treated  with  the  product  and  the  maximum  daily  dose  on  a  given  day.  Therefore,  the  MAH's calculation on an average daily dose for one patient is not acceptable. The MAH has provided justified epidemiological  data  published  by  EMEA  (EMEA/COMP/96616/2008,  EMEA/COMP/48649/2008) on the incidence of the target diseases for Yondelis (soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer) within the EU. Using the maximum daily dose of 2.595 mg/day and 1.903 mg/day for soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer, respectively,  and  the  refined  F pen yield  a  PEC SW of approximately 0.0003 µg/L for both indications. Thus, PEC sw values are well below the threshold for a Phase II environmental risk assessment.

The  MAH  commits  to  submit  the  experimental  value  of  log  P  according  to  the  relevant  OECD methods.

## 1.4 Clinical aspects

All  clinical  trials  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  GCP  and  local  requirements  of  individual countries.  All  studies  were  closely  monitored  by  PharmaMar  or  J&amp;JPRD  personnel  or  a  contract research  organisation.  All  protocols  and  amendments  were  submitted  for  approval  to  the  ethics committees and health authorities if required following GCP standards.

The table below summarises the clinical study conducted.

## 1.4.1 Clinical Pharmacology

New pharmacokinetic data have been obtained since the marketing authorisation of Yondelis, mainly in 5 clinical trials (one in monotherapy and four in combination with other drugs). The potential for an interaction between trabectedin and PLD was assessed in patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in the phase  I  study  ET743-USA-11.  Additionally,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  trabectedin  and  doxorubicin (non-liposomal) when given as a combination therapy was characterised in the phase I studies ET743SAR-1001 and ET-A-007-00.

Three phase II studies (ET-B-009-99, ET-B-026-03 and ET743-INT-11) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin given as a single agent in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Data from  studies  ET-B-009-99  and  ET743-INT-11  were  already  included  in  the  initial  marketing authorisation  application  of  Yondelis  in  soft  tissue  sarcoma.  Finally,  a  population  pharmacokinetic analysis  has  been  performed  using  data  from  the  phase  III  study  OVA-301.  The  concentrations  of trabectedin and doxorubicin (given as PLD) were analyzed.

In study ET-B-026-03 all patients received 20 mg of dexamethasone at 30 minutes prior to start of the trabectedin  infusion.  Those  who  received  the  1.3 mg/m 2 dose  were  also  given  4  mg  of  oral dexamethasone at 24 h and 12 h before the start of the trabectedin infusion and 5 more doses every 12 h beginning 24 h after the start of the 3-h infusion. Full pharmacokinetic profiles (up to 6 to 8 days after the end of the 24-h and 3-h infusions) of trabectedin were collected during Cycle 1.

As  expected  much  higher  mean  concentrations  in  plasma  were  observed  just  prior  the  end  of  the infusion when given over 3 h as compared to 24 h (Table 2). The minor differences observed in the mean  CL,Vss,  and  the  terminal  half-life  values  between  the  regimens  were  within  the  degree  of interpatient variability and are not likely to be clinically significance.

The main objective of Study ET-743-USA-11 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of trabectedin when administered in combination with Caelyx (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection). Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  this  combination  of  study  drugs,  to investigate  potential  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  interactions  between  trabectedin  and  Caelyx.  A  sparse pharmacokinetic sampling procedure was used during Cycles 1, 2, and 3. Venous blood samples were collected during the three cycles at the following times: before the start of the intravenous infusion, 10 minutes  before  the  end  of  1-h  intravenous  infusion,  and  2.83 h  and  168 h  after  the  end  of  the infusion. The concentrations of total (encapsulated plus free) doxorubicin in plasma were measured

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  method.  A  population  approach  (non-linear  mixed-effects  model software; NONMEM) was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of total doxorubicin. A total of 234 liposomal doxorubicin plasma concentrations from 30 patients were available for the analysis. An open one-compartment model with linear elimination was used to fit the plasma concentration versus time  data  of  total  (liposomal  encapsulated  and  free)  doxorubicin.  The  model  was  parameterized  in terms  of  systemic  clearance  (CL)  and  volume  of  the  central  compartment (V).  The  interindividual (IIV,  between  patient)  and  interoccasion  (IOV)  variability  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were assumed to follow the log-normal distribution. Residual variability was evaluated using an additive error model.

Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin showed a long terminal half-life (74 h), a slow clearance (0.037 L/h), and a small volume of distribution (3.9 L) in plasma. No evidence of changes in pegylated liposomal doxorubicin clearance appear to occur within the range of trabectedin doses studied.

The primary objective of Study ET743-SAR-1001 was to determine the regimen of the combination of trabectedin and (non-liposomal) doxorubicin for which neutropenia was manageable in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of both drugs was a secondary objective.

The  following  regimens,  each  administered  every  3  weeks,  were  evaluated  in  separate  cohorts: (i) trabectedin  0.9   mg/m 2 and  doxorubicin  60 mg/m2,  (ii)  trabectedin  1.1 mg/m2  and  doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, and (iii) trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. For all treatments, doxorubicin was administered as a 10- to 15-minute infusion and immediately followed by trabectedin as a 3-h infusion.  Both  drugs  were  administered  via  a  central  venous  catheter.  All  patients  received  20 mg intravenous dexamethasone within 1 h before the start of doxorubicin.

Regarding  the  trabectedin  data,  the  relatively  small  sample  sizes  and  between-subject  variability precluded comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the treatment groups. The data are shown below

With respect to the doxorubicin data, maximum plasma concentrations of doxorubicin were generally observed  15 to  20 minutes  after  the  start  of  the  infusion.  The  concentrations  then  declined  in  a multiexponential manner. An increase in the mean plasma Cmax and AUC  values of doxorubicin was observed with increasing coadministered doses of trabectedin despite administration of the same dose of  doxorubicin to all  patients.  However,  minimal differences and  no clear trend are observed when comparing  the  mean  plasma  concentrations  at  each  time  point  between  1.25 h  and  51 h  (inclusive) after the start of the infusions. Thus, the concentration of the first pharmacokinetic sample (0.25 h) for each profile  accounted  for  the  differences  in  the  plasma  C max and  AUC values observed across the dose groups. Minimal differences in the mean t 1/2 values were observed substantiating the absence of an effect of trabectedin on doxorubicin elimination.

The between subject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of doxorubicin is relatively high (37% to 93%). For this reason, and due to the relatively small number of subjects evaluated, a strict assessment of the impact of trabectedin on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin (and doxorubicinol) is not possible.

ET-A-007-00  was  conducted  to  establish  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  and  least  toxic  sequence  of trabectedin and doxorubicin in combinations to patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma and breast

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cancer. In addition, the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between these drugs was assessed as secondary endpoint.

During the Part 1 of the study, patients were randomized to receive doxorubicin (60 mg/m 2 , 5-minute intravenous infusion) either before or after escalating doses of trabectedin (starting dose 0.6 mg/m 2 , as a 3-h infusion) in Cycles 1 and 2. For either sequence, the second drug was started at 1 h after the end of the administration of the first drug. Part 2 of the study was designed to optimize the dose regimens by  evaluating  the  tolerability  of  a  fixed  dose  of  doxorubicin  (50 mg/m 2 or  60  mg/m 2 )  and  various doses  levels  of  trabectedin.  Oral  dexamethasone  (4 mg)  was  given  to  all  patients  at  24 h  before doxorubicin/trabectedin  dosing  on  Day  1  and  again  15  minutes  before  and  7  h  after  the  start  of administration of the combination. Dexamethasone continued to be given twice daily on Days 2 and 3.

Regarding the trabectedin PK data, full pharmacokinetic profiles (up to 71 h after the start of the 3-h infusion) of trabectedin were to be collected during Cycles 1 and 2. Again, samples were collected from most patients during only one cycle.

Finally, the pivotal study included a Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Trabectedin in Patients With Ovarian Cancer. Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic assessment were collected from patients who  enrolled  in  the  study  ET743-OVA-301  at  select  sites  during  Cycles  1  and  2.  The  population analysis included 2074 samples that were collected from 166 patients and analyzed for total (liposomal encapsulated  and  free)  doxorubicin  concentrations  and  963 samples  collected  from  86  patients  that were analyzed for trabectedin concentrations. An additional 361 trabectedin concentrations collected from 142 patients enrolled in ET743-INT-11 were included in this population analysis.

Structural  Model Parameter Estimates: An open 4-compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment adequately characterized the time course of trabectedin plasma concentrations.  Population  pharmacokinetic  parameters  estimates  of  trabectedin  in  patients  with cancer are presented in Table 11. Population values for clearance, central volume of distribution and K12 obtained during the analysis of data from ET743-OVA-301 were significantly lower relative to previous values.

Notably,  these  results  are  not  consistent  with  those  obtained  during  Phase  1  study  ET743-USA-11, which  suggested  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  trabectedin  are  not  influenced  by  the  concomitant administration of PLD.

The effect of dexamethasone on the plasma clearance of trabectedin was reassessed using data from the present and former population analysis (n=831 patients in total). In agreement with the previous results, the plasma clearance of trabectedin was 19% higher in patients who received any concomitant dexamethasone administration relative to those who did not.

The  total  plasma  doxorubicin  concentration-time  data  were  adequately  characterized  with  a  onecompartmental  model.  Patient  body  surface  area  was  an  important  covariate  that  could  explain interpatient variability in clearance and distribution volume. Importantly, the estimated values of these pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  doxorubicin  were  similar  when  PLD  was  coadministered  with trabectedin and when given as a single agent.

All subjects of the studies included in theplotwere taking dexamethasone as a comedication.

The MAH conclusions of Population PK Study Report regarding interactions between trabectedin and Caelyx were as follows:

- 1)  The  ET743-OVA301  parameter  estimates  for  clearance,  central  volume  of  distribution  and  K12

obtained during the analysis of historical trabectedin data combined with INT11 and OVA301 data were significantly lower relative to previous values. The clearance of trabectedin was on average 31% lower, causing a higher exposure when given with Caelyx, relative to administration as a single agent. 2) The plasma clearance of Caelyx was approximately 7% lower when given with trabectedin, relative to administration as a single agent.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

Regarding the PK in ovarian patients, the MAH has submitted three phase II studies and one phase III trial  (pivotal  study).  The  phase  II  clinical  trials  evaluated  the  PK  characteristics  of  trabectedin administered at different regimens in patients with ovarian cancer. In general, the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin in ovarian cancer patients seems to be very similar to that described in previous studies.

Concerning  the  possible  interaction  between  doxorubicin  (pegylated  and  non-pegylated  form)  and trabectedin, several studies have been carried out.  The phase I study ET743-USA-11 showed that the concentrations of liposomal doxorubicin and trabectedin in plasma were not substantially altered when given  in  combination.  Pharmacokinetic  parameter  values  of  each  compound  were  similar  to  those reported  previously  when  each  was  given  as  a  single  agent.  Similar  conclusions  were  drawn  from studies ET-A-007-00 and ET743-SAR-1001 with non-liposomal doxorubicin. However, the conclusions regarding the absence of a PK drug-drug interaction cannot be extrapolated from studies with doxorubicin non pegylated to the combination of trabectedin with PLD.

The PK results of the pivotal study OVA-301 and specifically the population PK study, with data from the OVA-301 pivotal, showed a significant discrepancy between these ones data and those from study ET743-USA-11. Study OVA-301 only included population PK data. However, it cannot be excluded that  the  PK  profile  of  trabectedin  is  changed  with  co-administration  of  pegylated  liposomal doxorubicin. The trabectedin clearance was on average 31% lower, causing a higher exposure when given with PLD, relative to its administration as a single agent. The pivotal study represents the target population of this indication. Therefore the results on these patients could be considered as the most predictable  information  of  the  'real'  characteristics  in  whole  population.  A  decrease  in  the  Cl  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

trabectedin could be expected when it will be co-administered with PLD. The clinical meaning of this fact is for the time being, unknown. Information on PK profile, specifically the interaction between Trabectedin and PLD, is therefore reflected in the section 5.2 of the SPC.

## 1.4.2 Clinical efficacy

The schedule used for trabectedin in the pivotal phase III trial (q3wk 3-h) was supported by results of a phase II randomised trial (ET-B-026-03), which showed that two every-3-week regimens (1.5 mg/m 2 , 24-hour  i.v.  infusion,  and  1.3  mg/m 2 ,  3-hour  i.v.  infusion)  were  similarly  active  in  patients  with relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer; however, a slightly better safety profile was found for the 3-hour  schedule  with  respect  to  myelosuppression  (neutropenia)  and  fatigue,  together  with  a  more convenient  administration  schedule.  Subsequently,  a  phase  I  trial  (ET743-USA-11)  evaluated  the q3wk 3-h regimen of trabectedin in combination with PLD. The recommended doses based on this phase  I  trial  were  trabectedin  1.1  mg/m 2 and  PLD  30  mg/m 2 .  These  were  the  doses  used  in  the randomised study OVA-301 for the investigational combination arm.

## 1.4.2.1 Pivotal study

In  August  2004,  the  applicant  requested  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  to  provide  with CHMP Protocol  Assistance  for  the  pivotal  study  OVA-301.  The  CHMP  feedback  was  received  in December 2004 and March 2005 for the initial and follow-up requests, respectively. In words of the company, the protocol incorporated recommendations received from both the EMEA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

## Methods

OVA-301 was a phase III, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, Caelyx) 30 mg/m 2 followed by trabectedin 1.1 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks compared with the approved standard single-agent PLD 50 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks.

Subjects enrolled were 18 years of age or older with histologically proven epithelial ovarian, epithelial fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer previously treated with only 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and had experienced either recurrence or progression after more than 6 months from the beginning (first dose) of the initial line of platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer to include  subjects  with  platinum-resistant  disease  (platinum-free  interval  from  the  end  of  first-line treatment  less  than  6  months)  and  subjects  with  platinum-sensitive  disease  (platinum-free  interval from the end of first-line treatment ≥ 6  months)  who are not expected to benefit from or who were ineligible for or who were not willing to receive retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.

The primary objective of this study was as follows:

- compare the PFS of the combination of trabectedin + Caelyx with Caelyx monotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer.

Secondary objectives were as follows:

- compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 treatment arms;
- compare the overall objective response rate (ORR) between the 2 treatment arms;
- compare the safety profiles between the 2 treatment arms; and
- characterize the PK of trabectedin and Caelyx in each treatment arm.

Tertiary objectives included:

- evaluation of quality of life (QOL) and pharmacoeconomics; and

-  exploratory  evaluation  of  pharmacogenomic  profiles  and  hypothesis-generating  evaluation  of  the relationship between circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and the response to therapy, disease progression, and OS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Progression  free  survival  (PFS) is  defined  as  the  time  between  the  randomization  and  disease progression or death. Subjects who progressed or died will be considered to have had an event, except if this event occurs after the start of subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer, in which case the subject is censored  at  the  time  of  last  tumor  assessment  (prior  to  or  on  the  first  day  of  the  first  subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer). Subjects who did not progress nor died (lost to follow-up, or still being treated without documented disease progression, or started subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer and still alive) will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment (prior to or on the first day of the first  subsequent  therapy  for  ovarian  cancer).  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  set  is  based  on  the  'All Measurable Subjects'. 'All Measurable Subjects' analysis set is defined as all randomized subjects who  have  measurable  disease  at  baseline  as  assessed  by  the  independent  review  (any  of  the independent radiologist reviewers).

Sample size : Approximately 650 subjects were randomized over 2 years. The primary analysis (PFS) was conducted after at least 415 events (progression or death) were observed. Assuming that Caelyx has a median PFS of 16 weeks and that the combination of trabectedin + Caelyx has a targeted median PFS of 22 weeks, this design would allow the demonstration of a statistically significant difference in PFS  at  a  one-sided  2.5%  significance  level  with  at  least  90%  power.  An  interim  OS  analysis  was performed in conjunction with this PFS analysis. The final OS analysis will be conducted when there are  520  observed  deaths.  Assuming  that  Caelyx  has  a  median  OS  of  62.7  weeks  and  that  the combination of trabectedin + Caelyx has a targeted median OS of 83.4 weeks, this design would allow for  the  demonstration of the statistically significant difference in OS at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level  with  at  least  90%  power.  It  was  anticipated  that  the  final  OS  analysis  would  be  performed  at approximately 4.5 years from the start of randomization.

## Results

##  Participant flow and Recruitment

Nine  subjects  did  not  receive  study  drug  (6  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm  and  3  in  the trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm)  as  shown  in  the  table  below.  The  remaining  663  randomized  subjects received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  (trabectedin  +  Caelyx,  334;  Caelyx  alone,  329)  and comprise the All-Treated Subjects safety analysis population. One subject was randomly assigned to trabectedin + Caelyx but received only 1 dose of Caelyx, she opted to discontinue treatment without receiving trabectedin. This subject is included in the Caelyx monotherapy arm only for safety analysis.

The first subject was randomly assigned on 20 April 2005. The last subject was randomly assigned on 29 May 2007.

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics for patients were similar between the two treatment arms and consistent with those of the planned study population described in the study protocol. The median age of the study population was 57 years (range, 26-87 years), 78% were white and 63% had a baseline performance status of 0. Serous histology (68%) was the most prevalent subtype and 52% had grade  3  tumours.  Sites  of  involvement  at  baseline  (median  of  2  lesions)  included  abdomen  (74%), pelvis  (69%),  liver  (29%)  and  lungs  (18%).  The  vast  majority  (99%)  had  previously  undergone surgery for their cancer and 2% had received prior radiotherapy.

Consistent with the eligibility requirements, all patients had previously received at least one course of platinum-based  chemotherapy,  with  64%  having  platinum-sensitive  disease  (i.e.,  with  PFI  6 months). The median number of agents used for prior chemotherapy was 2 (range, 1 to 7), including taxanes in approximately 80% of patients.

## Secondary analyses

## Overall survival

In the initial variation application, the MAH submitted an analysis of OS data with the clinical cut-off date of 15 May 2008 established to achieve a pre-specified (415) number of PFS events. A total of 300 deaths (145 in the combination arm and 155 in the PLD alone arm) had occurred at cut-off date (55% censored data). Median OS was 20.5 months (95% CI, 18.7-24.2) in the combination arm and 19.4 months (95% CI, 17.3-21.7) in the PLD alone arm.

Further to the request of the CHMP to further justify the efficacy of the combination, on the basis of the  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  of  6-8  weeks,  the  MAH  conducted  an ad  hoc interim  analysis  of  the secondary endpoint OS with a prospectively established cut-off date of 31 May 2009.

At the 31 May 2009 cut-off, a total of 419 death events (215 in the PLD monotherapy arm and 204 in the trabectedin + PLD combination arm) had occurred. This represents 81% of the 520 death events required for the final OS analysis, or 62% of the 672 randomised population. Current follow-up ranges from April 2005 to May 2009.

The trabectedin + PLD combination resulted in a 15% decrease in the risk of death compared with PLD alone [HR=0.85 (95% CI, 0.70-1.03); p=0.0920]. The  median  OS  was  19.5 months  (95%  CI, 17.4-22.1) in the PLD monotherapy arm and 22.4 months (95% CI, 19.4-25.1) in the combination arm (Table 14 and Figure 5).

As shown above, with 419 death events (38% censored data) and an additional year of follow-up, the observed  favourable  trend  for  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  arm  was  maintained,  with  an identical HR=0.85 and a narrower 95% CI.  Due to the larger number of events, the p value is now

0.0920. Median OS was identical at 19.5 months in PLD monotherapy arm, but is now 22.4 months, i.e., a 3-month difference with the combination arm.

## Others secondary endpoints

The median duration of response for the independent radiologist review in the Caelyx monotherapy arm was 7.7 months (range; 6.5 to 9.0 months) compared with the trabectedin + Caelyx arm which was 7.9 months (range; 7.4 to 9.2 months). The hazard ratio was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.62;1.46)

The Caelyx monotherapy arm showed a lower CA-125 CR rate than in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm (20% CR versus 30% CR). The Caelyx monotherapy arm showed a lower CA-125 PR rate than in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm (13% PR compared with 18% PR)

No statistically significant differences were found between treatment arms in global measures of QoL. Only minor, sporadic differences in the  fatigue  symptom  scale  were  found  in  cycles  3  and  9,  with some worsening of fatigue for subjects in the combination arm. Mixed-effects models predicting the score at baseline and follow-up scores as a function of treatment, days after baseline, and interaction between treatment  and  days  after  baseline  showed  no  significant  differences  between  arms  for  any QoL measure.

## Supportive analyses

Progression-free survival analyses were repeated using platinum sensitivity as a stratification factor. Using  the  stratified  log-rank  test,  a  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  all analyses.  Due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  with  an  ECOG  performance  status  score  of  2,  these analyses were not carried out using ECOG performance status score as a stratification factor.

Based  on  the  Investigator's  assignment  of  platinum  sensitivity,  a  subgroup  analysis  was  conducted using the updated survival data. The effect of trabectedin + PLD combination was more pronounced in platinum-sensitive patients (Figure 7) than in those with platinum-resistant disease (Figure 8), although in the resistant stratum both the HR=0.90 and median values (14.2 vs. 12.4 months) still favour the combination arm.

As  an  exploratory  analysis,  the  therapeutic  effects  of  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination vs. PLD alone have been compared in the subset of patients with intermediate platinum-sensitivity, i.e., those with platinum-free interval (PFI) 6-12 months. The OS of this subset is shown in Figure 9. This is a subpopulation where there is a high medical need for new agents, and where single agent PLD is most often  recommended,  as  indicated  by  the  National  Institute  for  Clinical  Excellence  (NICE)  and  the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.

In  this  subpopulation  with  intermediate  platinum  sensitivity  (PFI  6-12  month)  of  OVA-301,  with relatively mature data (~70% events), trabectedin + PLD induced a highly significant 41% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.59; p=0.0015), with a 6-months advantage in median survival relative to single-agent PLD.

Figure 10 outlines a summary of the main and sensitivity analyses for the updated OS data. This figure illustrates  again  the  consistency  of  the  survival  benefit  obtained  with  the  trabectedin  +  PLD combination. The favourable and consistent OS findings in this study strongly support the role of PFS as an appropriate surrogate for survival in this patient population.

## Multivariate analyses

Cox  proportional  hazard  models  were  used  to  compare  the  2  treatment  arms  and  included  the following  baseline  covariates:  ECOG  performance  status  score  (0  or  &gt;0),  platinum  sensitivity (platinum sensitive or platinum resistant), race (white or non-white), CA-125 (&lt;2 times ULN or ≥ 2 times ULN), age (&lt;65 years or ≥ 65 years of age), liver or lung involvement (yes or no), and prior taxane use (yes or no). Race, age,  and prior taxane use were not considered in the reduced model, which excluded variables at a 0.15 significance level (p values for these covariates are 0.30, 0.42, and 0.86, respectively). Age &lt;65 years and ≥ 65 years did not have a statistically significant effect on the outcome. The remainder of the covariates were included in the final mode. The interaction between treatment  arms  and  platinum  sensitivity  was  not  statistically  significant.  Subjects  with  an  ECOG performance  status  score  of  0  or  who  were  platinum-sensitive  were  at  a  lower  risk  of  disease progression. The hazard ratio for the treatment effect is 0.763 (95% CI: 0.59;0.99), which represents a 24%  reduction  in  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  after  adjustment  for  potential  confounding factors. Similar results were obtained from oncologist and investigators reviews.

The importance of the imbalanced prognostic factors observed (Age, ECOG and ascites) on the PFS and OS was uncertain. In order to correctly show the effect of the imbalanced prognostic factors, the MAH was requested to submit further analyses of univariate results for treatment effect, multivariate approach  for  main  effects  and  multivariate  approach  for  evaluation  of  interaction  effects.  Each analysis included at least the variable (treatment group, ECOG PS, Platinum sensitivity, Ascite and Bulky disease), hazard ratio, 95% CI &amp; p-value. These data reinforced the overall conclusion that the combination  trabectedin  +  PLD  arm  has  a  significant  effect  independent  from  the  effect  of  the covariates and, in consequence, the results have not been influenced by the imbalances observed in some baseline patient characteristics. Moreover, the results of the additional analyses on the impact of ascites  (yes  vs.  no),  together  with  an  exploratory  multivariate  analysis  addressing  the  combined potential influence of baseline ascites and platinum-free interval, do not suggest a negative impact of these  prognostic  factors  on  the  treatment  effects  favouring  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  in OVA-301.

## 1.4.2.2. Supportive studies

OVA-301 results are supported by data from trabectedin administered as a single-agent using three different regimens (two every-3-week schedules, q3wk 3-h and q3wk 24-h, and one weekly schedule, qwk 3-h) in three phase II clinical trials: ET-B-026-03, ET-B-009-99 and ET743-INT-11. The efficacy results for these three phase II trials are summarised in next table.

nr, not reached; ORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression-free survival; q3wk 3-h, every 3 weeks (Day 1

Study  ET-B-026-03  was  a  multicentre,  two-arm,  randomised,  controlled,  phase  II  clinical  trial evaluating  two  schedules  of  trabectedin  administered  to  a  relapsed,  platinum-sensitive,  advanced ovarian cancer population. The primary objective was to determine the optimal regimen of trabectedin when infused over a 24-hour or 3-hour infusion in an every-3-weeks schedule by evaluating objective response rate. As of February 2007, 107 (100 evaluable patients planned) were treated and randomly assigned to either a q3wk 24-h regimen at 1.5 mg/m2 (Arm A, n=54) or a q3wk 3-h regimen at 1.3 mg/m2 (Arm B, n=53).

In the ITT primary analysis, which included all randomised patients, the ORR was 38.9% (95% CI, 25.9-53.1%) in Arm A and 35.8% (95% CI, 23.1-50.2%) in Arm B. Whilst not powered statistically in its design to compare efficacy outcomes in either arm, an exploratory analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between treatment arms with respect to ORR (p=0.8422). Twelve patients (6 in each treatment arm) achieved complete response and 28 patients (15 patients in Arm A and 13 patients in Arm B) achieved partial response.

In an exploratory analysis, no statistically significant differences were seen between treatment arms for any of the secondary time-to-event endpoints, which included duration of response, TTP and PFS. Observed  toxicities  were  similar  as  well,  with  the  3-hour  infusion  having  a  slightly  lower  rate  of myelosuppression (55 vs. 37% of grade 3/4 neutropenia) and less fatigue, thus resulting the 3-hour infusion schedule more convenient for patients.

Based  on  these  results,  no  additional  comparisons  between  these  two  trabectedin  every-3-week schedules were deemed warranted. Trabectedin infusion every three weeks had promising activity in advanced ovarian cancer patients previously treated with a platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen.

Study  ET-B-009-99 was  a  multicentre,  single-arm,  open-label,  two-step  phase  II  trial.  The  primary objective was to determine the antitumour activity (in terms of ORR) of trabectedin administered as a 3-hour i.v.  infusion  (q3wk 3-h regimen) as a salvage therapy in ovarian cancer patients failing one platinum-taxane containing regimen. Patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer were eligible. As required by the protocol, all patients had received therapy with platinum- and taxane-containing regimens. Refractory patients were defined in this study as those with progression on chemotherapy or within 6 months from the discontinuation of previous chemotherapy. Relapsed patients were defined as those having relapsed following an objective response to platinum-taxane chemotherapy, with an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interval  6  months  between  the  last  dose  received  and  the  documentation  of  relapse.  Fifty-nine patients were enrolled overall: 29 patients in the relapsing group and 30 in the refractory group, of whom  51  were  evaluable  for  efficacy.  The  first  six  patients  received  a  higher  initial  dose  (1.65 mg/m2). Due to the poor tolerance of this dose, the study was amended to include a lower starting dose. The remaining patients received trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, which was well tolerated. However, 12 patients received an initial dose of 1.5 mg/m2.

ORR (per RECIST and peer-review evaluated) was 43.5% (95% CI, 23.3-65.5%) for the relapsing patient group (with one complete response and nine partial responses) and 7.1% (95% CI, 0.9-23.5%) for  the  refractory  patient  group,  TTP  for  relapsed  patient  group  was  6.7  months  (95%  CI,  5.0-7.9 months).

Study ET743-INT-11 was a multicentre, single-arm, open-label phase II trial. Trabectedin 0.58 mg/m2 was administered as a 3-hour infusion weekly (qwk 3-h) for the first 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. A total of 147 patients were accrued and treated, including 51 patients with platinum-sensitive disease and 62 patients with platinum-resistant disease in the primary efficacy analysis.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the ORR in patients with platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer after treatment with trabectedin, administered as a 3-hour infusion at the starting dose of 0.58 mg/m2 every week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. Patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma had disease progression &gt; 6 months after cessation of platinumbased chemotherapy, whereas patients with platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma were defined in this study  as  those  with  disease  progression  during  treatment  or  disease  relapse  at  6  months  after cessation of platinum-based chemotherapy.

The ORR was 29.4% (95% CI, 17.5-43.8%) for the platinum-sensitive cohort and 4.8% (95% CI, 1.013.5%) for the platinum-resistant cohort. Median PFS and OS for the platinum-sensitive cohort were 5.3  months  (95%  CI,  3.1-6.4  months)  and  17.1  months  (95%  CI;  14.3  months-upper  level  not reached), respectively.

## 1.4.2.3. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Integrated  analysis  of  PFS  data  from  all  three  phase  II  trials  evaluating  trabectedin  as  single-agent treatment in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer is shown in next table. Median PFS of the integrated q3wk regimens for the 3-hour or the 24-hour i.v. infusions were very similar: 5.5 months (range, 4.66.9) for the 3-hour infusion and 6.0 months (range, 4.6-8.6) for the 24-hour infusion. In contrast, PFS for the qwk 3-hour treatment regimen was shorter, with a median of 2.8 months (range, 2.0-3.8).

## 1.4.2.4. Discussion on clinical efficacy

ET743-OVA-301 was a well-conducted phase III trial comparing Caelyx with Caelyx/trabectedin in 663 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint PFS showed a clear advantage for the combination therapy whichever dataset was used. With the most conservative assessment a 21% risk

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduction for the PFS endpoint could be considered evidence of activity of trabectedin (this is also supported by phase II data). However, the absolute magnitude of PFS prolongation (about 1.5 months) is  not  impressive  considering  that  there  is  no  clear  support  of  overall  survival  prolongation.  Final overall  survival  analysis  is  pending,  since  it  only  will  performed  when  520  deaths  are  observed. Whereas  PFS  may  be  a  valid  surrogate  for  the  OS  endpoint  in  first-line  treatment  (chemo-naïve patients) this correlation may not be well substantiated in later-line therapy situations and that is the main weakness of the application dossier.

The  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  (6-8  weeks)  and  the  HR  (0.72-0.79)  in  favour  of  the  combination  of trabectedin  +  PLD  observed  in  the  OVA-301  trial  do  not  differ  from  efficacy  results  of  other randomised  trials  in  comparable  populations  of  women  with  ovarian  carcinoma.  A  number  of sensitivity  analyses  support  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  endpoint.  At  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  the importance of the imbalanced prognostic factors observed (Age, ECOG and ascites) on the PFS and OS  has  been  further  analysed.  In  summary,  these  data  reinforce  the  overall  conclusion  that  the combination  trabectedin  +  PLD  arm  has  a  significant  effect  independent  from  the  effect  of  the covariates and, in consequence, the results have not been influenced by the imbalances observed in some baseline patient characteristics. Moreover, the results of the additional analyses on the impact of ascites  (yes  vs.  no),  together  with  an  exploratory  multivariate  analysis  addressing  the  combined potential influence of baseline ascites  and platinum-free interval, do not suggest a negative impact of these  prognostic  factors  on  the  treatment  effects  favouring  the  trabectedin  +  PLD  combination  in OVA-301.

Moreover, the difference in PLD dosing schedule was of concern. In the combination arm, PLD is given every three weeks, compared to every four weeks in the monotherapy arm, raising doubts on whether  the  effect  seen  in  the  combination  arm  is  actually  an  effect  of  treating  with  PLD  more frequently.  Thus,  the  actual  benefit  of  adding  Yondelis  to  PLD  could  be  less  than  1.5  months  PFS gain. The two parameters better correlated with the efficacy of PLD are dose intensity and C max . Both were  substantially  greater  in  the  control  arm  than  in  the  combination  arm,  favouring  an  enhanced efficacy of PLD in the control arm. Thus, the more frequent administration of PLD at lower doses in the  combination  arm  is  an  unlikely  explanation  for  the  improved  outcomes  demonstrated  with trabectedin + PLD in OVA-301. Therefore, such superior outcomes with the combination support the contribution of trabectedin, an agent with proven single agent activity in advanced relapsed ovarian cancer.

As previously  stated  there  is  clear  evidence  of  antitumour  activity  of  the  combination  of  PLD  and trabectedin and provided that a significant improvement in overall survival support the PFS endpoint this would be considered sufficient evidence of benefit in terms of efficacy.

Further  reassurance  on  the  maturity  of  the  OS  data  was  needed.  The  protocol-specified  interim analysis of overall survival (OS) was carried out with 300 events, and even though the data are clearly immature,  a  favourable  trend  appears  for  the  combination  (HR=0.85)  and  survival  curves  remain separated throughout the entire observation period. The MAH conducted an ad hoc interim analysis with approximately 80% death events (416 of the required 520 deaths at the cut-off date of 31 May 2009 when a total of 419 death events (215 in the PLD monotherapy arm and 204 in the trabectedin + PLD combination arm) had occurred). This represents 81% of the 520 death events required for the final OS analysis, or 62% of the 672 randomised population. Due to the larger number of events, the p value is now 0.0920. Median OS was identical at 19.5 months in PLD monotherapy arm, but is now 22.4 months, i.e., a 3-month difference with the combination arm.

The  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS  prolongation  appeared  more  evident  in  the  subset  of  patients  with platinum-sensitive disease as compared to patients with platinum-resistant disease. This finding does not in itself have a negative impact of the overall conclusion on clinical efficacy but the population with platinum-resistant disease has the highest medical need whereas patients with platinum-sensitive disease may have a second treatment cycle with tumour response. However, Study OVA 301 was not powered  to  detect  differences  in  outcome  according  to  platinum-resistance  status.  The  result  of  a multivariate  analysis  indicates  that  treatment  effect  and  platinum  sensitivity  acted  as  independent factors with influence on PFS. Although a long platinum-free interval points to a better outcome in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

terms of PFS as compared to a short interval (platinum-resistance), the CHMP agree that the benefit in the platinum-resistant subset cannot be ruled out.

The fact that patients with platinum sensitive disease (as measured by a long platinum-free interval) still  have  the  option  to  be  retreated  with  a  platinum-containing  regimen  should  not  per  se  be  an obstacle for approving the combination of PLD and trabectedin. PLD was approved for 'treatment of advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  who  have  failed  a  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy regimen '.  The  registration  study  for  PLD  with  topotecan  as  comparator  also  included  patients  with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease. However, it is unfortunate that the performance of trabectedin + PLD against common practice (retreatment with platinum) is unknown. Superiority against the approved PLD has been demonstrated. Based on the Investigator's assignment of platinum sensitivity, a subgroup analysis was conducted using the updated survival data. The effect of trabectedin + PLD combination was more pronounced in platinum-sensitive patients than in those with platinum-resistant disease, although in the resistant stratum both the HR=0.90 and median values (14.2 vs. 12.4 months) still favour the combination arm.

## 1.4.3. Clinical Safety

## 1.4.3.1. Patient exposure

Safety data from Study ET743-OVA-301 comprise the principal information supporting the safety of trabectedin  in  combination  with  Caelyx  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  ovarian  cancer.  Safety information from the 3 Phase 2 studies in subjects with relapsed ovarian cancer with trabectedin as a single agent provide the primary supporting data for the safety of trabectedin in this population.

Thus, the main analyses of safety in this document are based on the following 3 safety analysis sets, which are derived from data from completed Phase 3 and Phase 2 studies:

-  Study ET743-OVA-301 safety analysis set (N=663)
-  Integrated Phase 2 ovarian safety analysis set (N=295): Pooled data from the Phase 2 Studies ET743-INT-11, ET-B-026-03, and ET-B-009-99 of trabectedin as a  single  agent  in  women with  relapsed  ovarian  cancer.  Data  are  categorized  according  to  the  trabectedin  dosing schedule and starting dosage: 1.3 mg/m2 q3wk 3-h, 1.5 mg/m2 q3wk 24-h, and 0.58 mg/m2 qwk 3-h.
-  Integrated Phase 2 safety analysis set (N=1,132): Pooled data from the 19 Phase 2 studies of trabectedin as a single agent in various tumour types, including 3 Phase 2 studies in relapsed ovarian cancer analysed separately in group 2, and 16 Phase 2 studies in non-ovarian solid tumours.  Data  are  categorized  according  to  the  trabectedin  dosing  schedule  and  starting dosage: 1.3 mg/m2 q3wk 3-h, 1.5 mg/m2 q3wk 24-h, and 0.58 mg/m2 qwk 3-h.

The integrated safety analysis was based on data from 19 Phase 2 studies completed up to April 2008, and is presented as a full revised analysis.

qwk = once weekly; q3wk = once every 3 weeks; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event

Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in each group as denominator.

Note: Incidence is based on the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 adverse event, not the number of events.

Note: All adverse events with toxicity Grade 1-5 and unknown toxicity grades are included in the analysis.

Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events in Study ET743-OVA-301. While the  overall  incidence  of  these  disorders  were  similar  for  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  (83%)  and trabectedin  +  Caelyx  (89%)  arms,  the  frequencies  for  certain  of  these  events  differed  by  10% between  the  2 treatment  arms.  Specifically,  nausea  (42%  for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  74%  for trabectedin  +  Caelyx)  and  vomiting  (30%  for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  56%  for  trabectedin  + Caelyx)  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm,  while  stomatitis  (33%  for Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  20%  for  trabectedin  +  Caelyx)  was  more  frequent  in  the  Caelyx monotherapy arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported less frequently in the Caelyx monotherapy arm (55%) than in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm (88%). This was mainly due to a higher incidence for the trabectedin + Caelyx arm for neutropenia (38% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 77% for trabectedin + Caelyx),  leukopenia  (26%  for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  48%  for  trabectedin  +  Caelyx),  anaemia (25% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 48% for trabectedin + Caelyx), and thrombocytopenia (8% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 36% for trabectedin + Caelyx).

Compared with the Caelyx monotherapy arm, the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had higher rates for ALT increased (9% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 55% for trabectedin + Caelyx), AST increased (10% for Caelyx monotherapy versus 40% for trabectedin + Caelyx), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (8% for  Caelyx  monotherapy  versus  23%  for  trabectedin  +  Caelyx),  and  hyperbilirubinemia  (7%  for Caelyx monotherapy versus 16% for trabectedin + Caelyx).

Hand-foot  syndrome,  was  reported  by  more  than  one-half  (54%)  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx monotherapy arm but occurred at a lower rate (24%) in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm.

Note: Adverse events reported any time from the first treatment dose to within 30 days of last treatment dose are included.

Note: Incidence is based on the number of subjects, not the number of events.

Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in each group as denominator.

Regarding  the  discontinuations  due  to  the  adverse  events  in  the  pivotal  study,  the  percentage  of subjects experiencing an adverse event that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment was 15% in the Caelyx monotherapy arm and 23% in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm. Drug-related adverse events that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  were  reported  for  9%  and  17%  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx monotherapy and trabectedin + Caelyx arms, respectively.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

A total of 19 subjects died during treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study medication, including 8 (2%) subjects in the Caelyx monotherapy arm and 11 (3%) subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx  arm.  Twelve  (63%)  of  these  deaths  (6  in  each  treatment  arm)  were  the  result  of  disease progression. Deaths associated with adverse events occurred in 1 subject in the Caelyx monotherapy arm  (drug-related)  and  5 subjects  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  (3  drug  related).  In  the  Caelyx monotherapy arm, the adverse event resulting in death was sepsis. The adverse events resulting in the death in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm were acute renal failure and neutropenic sepsis; pancytopenia and  sepsis;  thrombocytopenia  and  febrile  neutropenia;  pulmonary  embolism;  and  general  health deterioration.

In  Study  ET743-OVA-301,  31%  of  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm  and  39%  in  the trabectedin + Caelyx arm experienced at least 1 serious adverse event from the time of the first dose of study  medication  through  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  Treatment  with  trabectedin  + Caelyx was associated with higher frequencies of serious blood and lymphatic disorders, vomiting, nausea,  ALT  increased,  and  AST  increased  compared  with  treatment  with  Caelyx  monotherapy. Neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  were  the  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  with trabectedin + Caelyx, reported by 8% and 6%, respectively. In the Caelyx monotherapy arm, intestinal obstruction and abdominal pain were the most frequent serious adverse events, each reported in 3% of subjects.

Grade 4 serious adverse events reported for  1% of subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm included neutropenia (n=22, 7%), thrombocytopenia (n=14, 4%), leukopenia (n=10, 3%), pulmonary embolism (n=7, 2%), febrile neutropenia (n=3, 1%), and anaemia (n=3, 1%). In the Caelyx monotherapy arm, Grade  4  serious  adverse  events  reported  for  1%  or  more  of  subjects  were  neutropenia  (n=4,  1%), intestinal obstruction (n=3, 1%), leukopenia (n=3, 1%), and pulmonary embolism (n=2, 1%).

Toxicity Grade: NCI common toxicity criteria, version 3.0 (CTC, v3.0). NS=not specified

The MAH has identified the following safety topics for special consideration concerning the treatment with the trabectedin + Caelyx combination because of their potential for clinical importance: hepatic toxicity,  haematologic  toxicity  neutropenia  and  infection,  thrombocytopenia  and  bleeding  events, abdominal  pain,  CPK  elevations  and  rhabdomyolysis,  cardiac  safety,  renal  and  urinary  disorders, myelodysplasia  and  acute  myeloid  leukaemia,  extravasation,  respiratory  disorders,  other  events  ototoxicity, neuropathy, and hypersensitivity.

## Hepatic toxicity

Trabectedin therapy frequently causes liver function test abnormalities, mainly in the form of elevated serum transaminases. Transaminase elevations of any grade were experienced by &gt;80% of subjects receiving trabectedin in clinical studies (alone or in combination with Caelyx). The MAH states that transaminase elevations in subjects receiving trabectedin + Caelyx followed a predictable pattern of rapid onset and reversibility and decreasing severity with succeeding cycles. There was no indication of cumulative toxicity.  Transaminase elevations with trabectedin were managed with dose delays or reductions,  using  guidelines  outlined  in  the  study  protocols.  In  the  pivotal  study,  no  subject  was withdrawn from treatment with the trabectedin + Caelyx combination due to increased ALT or AST,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported  as  an  adverse  event,  and  5%  subjects  receiving  the  combination  treatment  had  a  dose reduction or cycle delay as a result of increased ALT or AST.

In the main study most subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had an elevation (Grade 1 to 4) in ALT (96%) or AST (89%) at some  point  during  the  study,  although  only  5%  and  2%  of  subjects receiving trabectedin + Caelyx had Grade 4 ALT or AST elevation, respectively. Elevations in ALT and AST were seen in 36% and 43% of subjects in the Caelyx monotherapy arm. Additionally, in this study, Hy's Law criteria were used to predict hepatotoxicity.

As seem in the above table, in the trabectedin +Caelyx arm, 3 subjects met the criteria. Two hundred forty-four subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had an elevated ALT or AST level that was ≥ 3 times  ULN  and  had  an  ALP  value ≤ 2  times  ULN.  Three  (1%)  of  these  subjects  had  an  increased bilirubin that was ≥ 2 times ULN. Of the 3 subjects who met the criteria for Hy's law, none developed serious hepatotoxicity. Two had subsequent therapy and died from disease progression, and 1 subject is still in the follow-up phase of the study.

## Haematologic toxicity neutropenia and infection

Neutropenia was the most common haematological laboratory abnormality. The incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia cases evaluated as drug-related AEs (63%) was higher in the trabectedin plus PLD arm compared with PLD alone (22%). In OVA-301, nadir grade 3 or 4 neutrophil values typically occurred within two weeks of dosing and were resolved among patients receiving trabectedin plus PLD.  The MAH states that this pattern was similar regardless of cycle, indicating a lack of cumulative toxicity (see  figure  below)  Compared  with  PLD alone,  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  developed  earlier  in  the combination arm (Day 15 vs. Day 22) but could had a similar duration (eight days in both study arms). Neutropenia  was  managed  with  dose  delays  and  reductions,  using  guidelines  outlined  in  the  study protocol.  Antibiotics  were  given  as  concomitant  therapy  in  20%  of  patients  for  both  study  arms. Growth  factors  were  given  in  OVA-301  prophylactically  according  to  ASCO  guidelines,  and  they were used more frequently in the combination arm (42% of patients/26% of cycles) than in the PLD alone arm (17% of patients/8% of cycles). The use of growth factors varied substantially according to the geographical area, with the lowest percentage in the European countries (26% of patients/12% of cycles)  compared  with  the  United  States  of  America  where  these  factors  are  more  frequently administered in clinical practice (47% of patients/35% of cycles). Drug-related febrile neutropenia was experienced by 7% and 2% of patients in the combination arm and in the PLD alone arm, respectively. Sepsis, septic shock or sepsis syndrome were reported in 2 patients (&lt;1%) in the combination arm and in 4 patients (1%) in the PLD alone arm. 4% of patients with drug-related neutropenia discontinued the study due to this AE.

## Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding Events

In  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  Grade  3  or  4  platelet  count abnormalities was 4% in Cycle 1 and increased to 7% in Cycle 2 where it remained stable through Cycle 8 (5% to 7%). For Grade 4 platelet counts in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm, the median time to first  occurrence  was  57  days  (range:  11,  294)  and  the  median  duration  was  7  days  (range:  2,  27). Bleeding-related adverse events ere reported in a similar percent of subjects in the Caelyx (8%) and trabectedin + Caelyx (9%) arms of Study ET743-OVA-301. 2 subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm (0.6%; none in Caelyx arm) had a drug-related Grade 3 or 4 bleeding-related adverse event.

In  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  had  Grade  3  or  4  laboratory abnormalities  in  Cycles  1  to  6  ranged  from  0  to  2%  for  platelet  counts  and  from  1%  to  3%  for haemoglobin.  Of  the  27  subjects  in  the  Caelyx  monotherapy  arm  with  Grade  3  or  4  haemoglobin abnormalities, the percentage of subjects who received treatment with blood or blood related products (n=7, 26%), blood transfusions (n=5, 19%), or other antianaemic drugs (n=1, 4%) was lower than in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm. Among subjects receiving the trabectedin + Caelyx combination, cycle delays  due  to  thrombocytopenia  reported  as  an  adverse  event  were  more  common  (13%)  than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment withdrawals (3%) or dose reductions (5%). One percent or less of subjects in the Caelyx monotherapy arm had a cycle delay, dose reduction, or treatment discontinued due to thrombocytopenia reported as an adverse event.

## CPK Elevations/Rhabdomyolysis

In the early phase II studies with single-agent trabectedin treatment, rhabdomyolysis and/or elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (grade 1-4) were associated with death in three patients (studies ETB-008-98  and  ET-B-005-98,  269  patients  treated,  1%),  commonly  as  a  component  of  a  syndrome which  included  neutropenia,  sepsis,  renal  failure  and  elevated  liver  enzymes.  Thereafter,  strict monitoring of liver function tests and CPK levels and dose adjustment guidelines were implemented in all  ongoing  and  subsequently  initiated  clinical  studies,  including  OVA-301.  Rhabdomyolysis  is  a known risk discussed in several sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics of trabectedin. In OVA-301, grade 3/4 CPK elevations were uncommon: 2% for the trabectedin plus PLD arm of OVA301  (0%  in  the  PLD  arm)  and  3%  for  the  integrated  phase  II  ovarian  safety  analysis  set.  In  the trabectedin + Caelyx arm, 1 subject (&lt;1%) had a dose reduction and 4 subjects (1%) had a cycle delay as a result of increased CPK. Two subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had treatment discontinued as a result of increased CPK

## Cardiac Safety

In Study ET743-OVA-301, MUGA scans or 2-D echocardiograms were performed in 369 subjects at screening  and  at  the  end  of  treatment  termination.  There  was  no  indication  that  the  addition  of trabectedin increased the known cardiac safety profile of Caelyx in the Phase 3 study ET743-OVA301 or the Phase 1 Study ET743-USA-11.

## Extravasation-Related Adverse Events

Extravasation-related adverse events following injection of trabectedin were uncommon in all 3 safety analysis sets, reported for 1% of subjects receiving trabectedin + Caelyx in Study ET743-OVA-301 and 4 to 6% of subjects receiving single-agent trabectedin in the Phase 2 integrated safety analysis sets

## Respiratory Disorders

Serious respiratory-related disorders were reported for 5% to 7% of trabectedin-treated subjects in the Study  ET743-OVA-301  safety  analysis  set  and  the  integrated  Phase  2  safety  analysis  set.  Most  of these serious respiratory-related disorders were assessed by the investigator as not drug related

## Myelodysplasia and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia

No subject treated in Study ET743-OVA-301 developed treatment-emergent acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplasia within 30 days of the last dose of study medication. Subject 280065 in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm was discontinued due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 2 weeks later, the  subject  underwent  a  bone  marrow  biopsy  due  to  persistent  hematological  abnormalities,  which revealed acute myeloid leukaemia. The subject died approximately 99 days after the last dose of study drug  and  the  cause  of  death  were  pneumonia,  neutropenia,  and  acute  myeloid  leukaemia.  A  second subject  (140005)  who  received  13  cycles  of  Caelyx  monotherapy  was  diagnosed  with  acute  myeloid leukaemia 95 days after the last dose of study drug. The subject died 3 months and 12 days later due to disease progression

## Laboratory findings

In Study ET743-OVA-301, compared with the Caelyx monotherapy arm, a higher proportion of subjects in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm had abnormal neutrophil counts (74% versus 92%, respectively), platelet counts (27% versus 64%, respectively), and WBC counts (82% versus 95%, respectively).

White blood cell count abnormalities were frequent in all 3 safety analysis sets. In Study ET743-OVA301,  62%  of  subjects  in  the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm  had  Grade  3  or  4  WBC  count  abnormalities, compared with 20% of subjects in the Caelyx monotherapy arm. The incidence rate of Grade 3 or 4 WBC count abnormalities was also higher for the trabectedin + Caelyx arm of Study ET743-OVA-301 compared with trabectedin as a single agent in the q3wk 3-h treatment arm of the integrated Phase 2 ovarian safety analysis set (29%) and the integrated Phase 2 safety analysis set (30%). The incidence of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade 3 or 4 WBC count abnormalities in the q3wk 24-h arm of the integrated Phase 2 safety analysis set was 49%.

In  the  pivotal  study,  the  incidence  rates  of  mineral/electrolyte  non-haematologic  abnormalities  were similar in the trabectedin + Caelyx and Caelyx monotherapy arms, with the exception of low potassium, which was higher in the combination arm (42% versus 28%, respectively).

Grade  3  or  4  mineral/electrolyte  non-haematologic  abnormalities  in  Study  ET743-OVA-301  were equally infrequent in both treatment arms; the most common were low sodium (9%) and low potassium (8%) for the trabectedin + Caelyx arm and low sodium (9%) and elevated potassium (6%) for the Caelyx monotherapy arm.

## 1.4.3.3. Discussion on clinical safety

Almost all patients experienced drug related AEs. The safety profile of the combination treatment is characterised  by  the  high  percentage  of  adverse  events  (99%),  which  includes  as  more  relevant neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, AST/ALT increases, hyperbilirubinemia, CPK elevations and rhabdomyolysis. The percentages of adverse events observed in the trabectedin group were sometimes as much as 2 times higher than in the trabectedin/Caelyx group. The most common AEs observed in all the patients were the gastrointestinal disorders, with the highest percentage of nausea and vomiting in the trabectedin group.

All the effects mentioned above have been already described in the initial marketing authorisation for soft tissue sarcoma. No new relevant data has been shown. It is acknowledged that the majority of the serious  AEs,  such  as  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anemia  and  AST/ALT  increases,  can  be managed  with  the  appropriate  dose  reduction  and/or  delays  in  the  cycles.  However,  the  laboratory findings appear to be consistent with relevant clinical implications, such as increased risk of febrile neutropenia.

The rate of drug related AEs, serious adverse events, deaths, AEs leading to the discontinuation, and laboratory values, are without a doubt higher in the trabectedin/Caelyx group.

A  higher  incidence  observed  in  drug-related  grade  3  or  4  AEs,  SAEs  and  drug-related  SAEs (especially within the Blood and Lymphatic system) for the non-white population (Asian race) was observed. This is reflected in section 4.8 of the SPC.

The overall clinical safety assessment of the proposed combination of  trabectedin + Caelyx does not cause any major concern per se since the toxicity profile is predictable from the known safety profiles for both substances and such toxicity is routine management  in oncology centers. The most important additive toxicity is neutropenia and infection-related adverse events due to neutropenia with increasing frequency and severity with the combination as compared to both agents used as monotherapy. Any potential safety concern of the combination should be evaluated in the context of risk/benefit.

## 1.5. Risk Management Plan

An updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted in this variation application. The EU-RMP version 6.0 follows the guideline and has included the updated information regarding trabectedin use. The addition of safety data from the use of trabectedin in combination with PLD has revealed a higher risk of bone marrow suppression and a higher need for concomitant anti-emetic treatment. A summary of the RMP is provided in the table below.

| CPK elevations/ Rhabdo-myolysis | SPC Section 4.2: Posology and method of administration Patients must meet specific criteria on CPK values (  2.5 x ULN) to start and continue treatment with Yondelis. Weekly CPK monitoring is required during first 2 cycles and at least once between subsequent cycles. Any grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction requires dose reduction. Section 4.4: Special warning and precautions for use Trabectedin must not be used in patients with CPK > 2.5 ULN (see section 4.2). Rhabdomyolysis has been uncommonly reported, usually in association with myelotoxicity, severe liver function test abnormalities and/or renal or multiorgan failure. Therefore, CPK should be closely monitored whenever a patient may be experiencing any of these toxicities, muscle weakness or muscle pain. If rhabdomyolysis occurs, supportive measures such as parenteral hydration, urine alkalinisation and dialysis should be promptly established, as indicated. Treatment with Yondelis should be discontinued until the patient fully recovers. Caution should be taken if medicinal products associated with rhabdomyolysis (e.g. statins), are administered concomitantly with trabectedin, since the risk of rhabdomyolysis may be increased.

| Foetal exposure to trabectedin through parental exposure | SPC Section 4.3: Contraindications Contraindicated when breast-feeding . Section 4.4: Special warning and precautions for use Men in fertile age and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and 3 months thereafter for women and immediately inform the treating physician if a pregnancy occurs, and 5 months after treatment for men. Section 4.6: Pregnancy and lactation No sufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. However based on its known mechanism of action, trabectedin may cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Trabectedin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If it is used, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus (see Section 5.3 ) and be monitored carefully. If trabectedin is used at the end of pregnancy, potential adverse reactions should be monitored carefully in the newborns Men in fertile age and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and 3 months thereafter for women and immediately inform the treating physician if a pregnancy occurs (see Section 5.3 ) and 5 months after treatment for men (see Section 4.4 ). Trabectedin can have genotoxic effects. Advice on conservation of sperm should be sought prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Yondelis. If pregnancy occurs during treatment the possibility of genetic counselling should be considered. Genetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy. It is not known whether trabectedin is excreted in human milk. […] Breast-feeding is contraindicated during treatment and 3 months thereafter |
| Patients with severe renal impairment                    | SPC Section 4.2: Posology and method of administration Patients must meet specific criteria on creatinine clearance  30 ml/min (monotherapy), serum creatinine  1.5 mg/dl (  132.6 μ mol/l) or creatinine clearance  60 ml/min (combination therapy) to start and continue treatment with Yondelis. Weekly monitoring of creatinine is required during first 2 cycles and at least once between subsequent cycles. Studies including patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min for the monotherapy, and < 60 ml/min for the combination regime) have not been conducted and therefore Yondelis must not be used in this patient population (see Section 4.4 ) […] Section 4.4: Special warning and precautions for use Creatinine clearance must be monitored prior to and during treatment. Yondelis monotherapy and combination regimes must not be used in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min and < 60 ml/min respectively (see Section 4.2 ).

However, special caution is advised and dose adjustments may be necessary in these patients since systemic exposure is probably increased and the risk of hepatotoxicity might be increased. Patients with elevated bilirubin must not be treated with Yondelis (see Section 4.4 ). Section 4.4: Special warning and precautions for use Patients must meet specific criteria on hepatic function parameters to start treatment with Yondelis. Since systemic exposure to trabectedin is probably increased due to hepatic impairment and therefore the risk of hepatotoxicity might be increased, patients with clinically relevant liver diseases, such as active chronic hepatitis, must be closely monitored and the dose adjusted if needed. Patients with elevated bilirubin must not be treated with trabectedin (see Section 4.2 ).

| Potential risk of interactions          |                     | SPC Section 4.4: Special warning and precautions for use Co-administration of Yondelis with potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP3A4 should be avoided (see Section 4.5 ). If this is not possible, close monitoring of toxicities are required and dose reductions of trabectedin should be considered. Caution should be taken if medicinal products associated with hepatotoxicity are administered concomitantly with trabectedin, since the risk of hepatotoxicity may be increased. Concomitant use of trabectedin with phenytoin may reduce phenytoin absorption leading to an exacerbation of convulsions. Combination of trabectedin with phenytoin or live attenuated vaccines is not recommended and with yellow fever vaccine is specifically contraindicated (see Sections 4.3 and 4.5 ). The concomitant use of trabectedin with alcohol must be avoided (see Section 4.5 ). Caution should be taken if medicinal products associated with rhabdomyolysis (e.g. statins), are administered concomitantly with trabectedin, since the risk of rhabdomyolysis may be increased. Section 4.5: Interaction with other medicinal products In vivo interaction studies have not been performed. Since trabectedin is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4, co-administration of substances that inhibit this isoenzyme e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole ritonavir or clarithromycin could decrease metabolism and increase trabectedin concentrations. If such combinations are needed, close monitoring of toxicities is required (see Section 4.4 ). Likewise co-administration with potent inducers of this enzyme (e.g. rifampicin, phenorbarbital, Saint John's Wort) may decrease the systemic exposure to trabectedin. Alcohol consumption must be avoided during treatment with trabectedin due to the hepatotoxicity of the medicinal product (see Section 4.4 ). Preclinical data have demonstrated that trabectedin is a substrate to P-gp. Concomitant administration of inhibitors of Pgp, e.g. cyclosporine and verapamil, may alter trabectedin distribution and/or elimination. The relevance of this interaction e.g. CNS toxicity has not been established. Caution should be taken in such situations.

## 1.6. Benefit-risk assessment

## Benefits

In  a  well-conducted  phase  III  trial  (OVA-301)  comparing  Caelyx  with  Caelyx/trabectedin  in  663 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, the primary efficacy endpoint PFS showed a clear advantage for the  combination  therapy  whichever  dataset  was  used.  With  the  most  conservative  assessment (independent  radiologist  in  patients  with  measurable  disease)  a  21%  risk  reduction  for  the  PFS endpoint could be considered evidence of activity of trabectedin (this is also supported by phase II data). However, the absolute magnitude of PFS prolongation (about 1.5 months) from 5.8 months to 7.3 months is not impressive considering that there is no clear support of overall survival prolongation. Final  overall  survival  analysis  is  pending,  since  it  will  only  be  performed  when  520  deaths  are observed. The increase in PFS is not linked to an improvement in QoL. The QoL data neither support nor  challenge  the  efficacy/safety  assessment.  The  pivotal  study  was  not  blinded  and  QoL  data  are often not very sensitive. However, the addition of trabectedin does not seem to worsen the QoL.

The  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  (6-8  weeks)  and  the  HR  (0.72-0.79)  in  favour  of  the  combination  of trabectedin  +  PLD  observed  in  the  OVA-301  trial  do  not  differ  from  efficacy  results  of  other randomised  trials  in  comparable  populations  of  women  with  ovarian  carcinoma.  A  number  of sensitivity  analyses  support  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  endpoint.  However,  the  importance  of  the imbalanced  prognostic  factors  observed  (Age,  ECOG  and  ascites)  on  the  PFS  and  OS  was  further analysed.  Results  seem  to  be  robust  in  the  sense  that  the  imbalances  do  not  affect  the  global  PFS results.

As previously  stated  there  is  clear  evidence  of  antitumour  activity  of  the  combination  of  PLD  and trabectedin and provided that a significant improvement in overall survival support the PFS endpoint this would be considered sufficient evidence of benefit in terms of efficacy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thus, further reassurance on the maturity of the OS data was needed. The protocol-specified interim analysis of overall survival (OS) was carried out with 300 events, and even though the data are clearly immature,  a  favourable  trend  appears  for  the  combination  (HR=0.85)  and  survival  curves  remain separated throughout the entire observation period. The MAH conducted an ad hoc interim analysis of the secondary endpoint OS with a prospectively established cutoff date of 31 May 2009 when a total of 419 death events (215 in the PLD monotherapy arm and 204 in the trabectedin + PLD combination arm) had occurred. This represents 81% of the 520 death events required for the final OS analysis, or 62% of the 672 randomised population. Current follow-up ranges from April 2005 to May 2009. The trabectedin + PLD combination resulted in a 15% decrease in the risk of death compared with PLD alone [HR=0.85 (95% CI, 0.70-1.03); p=0.0920]. The median OS was 19.5 months (95% CI, 17.422.1) in the PLD monotherapy arm and 22.4 months (95% CI, 19.4-25.1) in the combination arm

The  study  OVA  301  was  not  powered  to  detect  differences  in  outcome  according  to  platinumresistance  status.  The  results  of  a  multivariate  analysis  indicate  that  treatment  effect  and  platinum sensitivity acted as independent factors with influence on PFS. Although a long platinum-free interval points to a better outcome in terms of PFS as compared to a short interval (platinum-resistance) the CHMP agree that the benefit in the platinum-resistant subset cannot be ruled out.

The fact that patients with platinum sensitive disease (as measured by a long platinum-free interval) still  have  the  option  to  be  retreated  with  a  platinum-containing  regimen  should  not  per  se  be  an obstacle for approving the combination of PLD and trabectedin. PLD was approved for ' treatment of advanced  ovarian  cancer  in  women  who  have  failed  a  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy regimen '.  The  registration  study  for  PLD  with  topotecan  as  comparator  also  included  patients  with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease. However, it is unfortunate that the performance of trabectedin + PLD against common practice (retreatment with platinum) is unknown. Superiority against the approved PLD has been demonstrated. The design and inclusion criteria of the pivotal  trial  OVA-302  have  been  sufficiently  detailed  in  section  5.1  of  the  SPC.  In  the  updated analysis the survival benefit appears enhanced in the stratum of platinum-sensitive patients, where PFS HR was 0.73 (p=0.0170) and OS HR was 0.82 (p=0.1259) in the updated analysis. Of interest, in the subpopulation  of  patients  with  intermediate  platinum-sensitivity  (PFI  6-12  months),  an  exploratory analysis  shows  the  largest  differential  effect  favouring  the  trabectedin  combination  with  a  41% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.59; p=0.0015) and a 6 month increase in median survival.

## Risks

No new or unexpected serious adverse events were seen with the trabectedin + Caelyx combination relative to administration of Caelyx monotherapy or trabectedin alone.

The overall clinical safety assessment of the proposed combination of trabectedin + Caelyx does not cause any major concern per se since the toxicity profile is predictable from the known safety profiles of both substances and such toxicity is routine management in oncology centres. The most important additive toxicity is neutropenia and infection-related adverse events due to neutropenia with increasing frequency and severity with the combination as compared to both agents used as monotherapy. Any potential  safety  concern  of  the  combination  should  be  evaluated  in  the  context  of  risk/benefit.  Two percent (2%) of subjects in the Caelyx arm developed Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia versus 8% in the  trabectedin  +  Caelyx  arm.  Sepsis,  septic  shock,  or  sepsis  syndrome  were  reported  in  4  subjects (1.2%) in the Caelyx monotherapy arm and 2 subjects (0.6%) in the trabectedin + Caelyx arm.

Other concerns are more thrombocytopenia with the combination, more elevations in liver transaminases and more elevations in CPK (and rhabdomyolysis in rare cases) due to the toxicity of trabectedin. These aspects have been sufficiently addressed in the RMP and the SPC.

## Balance

The  magnitude  of  PFS  gain  (6-8  weeks)  and  the  HR  (0.72-0.79)  in  favour  of  the  combination  of trabectedin  +  PLD  observed  in  the  OVA-301  trial  do  not  differ  from  efficacy  results  of  other randomised  trials  in  comparable  populations  of  women  with  ovarian  carcinoma.  A  number  of sensitivity  analyses  support  the  robustness  of  the  PFS  endpoint.  As  previously  stated  there  is  clear evidence  of  antitumour  activity  of  the  combination  of  PLD  and  trabectedin.  The  updated ad  hoc interim analysis on overall survival provided further reassurance on the validity of the PFS endpoint. Further, the MAH has made a commitment to provide the final results from the ongoing study OVA301 for review by CHMP when available.

It  is  agreed  that  although  toxicity  of  the  two-drug  combination  is  more  pronounced  than  with  PLD alone it is  not  very  different  from  the  toxicity  seen  after  other  two-drug  combinations  for  the  same therapeutic indication. The safety profile of trabectedin and the combination is by no means unusual or frightening considering the therapeutic indication.

The benefit-risk balance of Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer , is considered positive. As a consequence, sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1,  5.2  and  6.6  of  the  SPC  have  been  updated.  The Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  Further,  annex  II  has  been  updated  to  include  the agreed version 6.0 of the RMP.

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  and  justifications  submitted  by  the  MAH  taking  into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, and taking into account the provisions  of  the  ' Guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant  clinical  benefit  in comparison  with  existing  therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an extended (11-year) marketing protection period (November 2007) ', and did not consider that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. (EMEA note: This refers to the extension of the marketing protection but has no impact on the orphan status and its incentives, which is reviewed by the COMP.)
