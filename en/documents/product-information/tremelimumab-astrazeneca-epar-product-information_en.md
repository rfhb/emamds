a For Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, metastatic NSCLC patients with a body weight of 34 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to 1 mg/kg of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca until the weight improves to greater than 34 kg. For durvalumab, patients with a body weight of 30 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to durvalumab 20 mg/kg until the weight improves to greater than 30 kg. b When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is administered in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for durvalumab for dosing information. c When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is administered in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the SmPC for nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed and carboplatin or cisplatin for dosing information. d Consider maintenance administration of pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous tumours who received treatment with pemetrexed and carboplatin/cisplatin during the platinum-based chemotherapy stage. e In the case of dose delay(s), a fifth dose of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca can be given after Week 16, alongside durvalumab. f If patients receive fewer than 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, the remaining cycles of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca (up to a total of 5) should be given during the post-platinum chemotherapy phase. Dose escalation or reduction is not recommended for Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab. Dose withholding or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and tolerability, see Table 2. Guidelines for management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are described in Table 2 (see section 4.4). Refer also to the SmPC for durvalumab. Table 2.

a  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal; BLV: baseline value. b  Upon improvement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is worsening or no improvement. c After withholding, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and/or durvalumab can be resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions improved to ≤ Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab should be permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 adverse reactions, as applicable. d For patients with alternative cause follow the recommendations for AST or ALT increases without concurrent bilirubin elevations. e If no improvement within 2 to 3 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive therapy. Upon resolution (&lt; Grade 1), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. f Permanently discontinue Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab if the adverse reaction does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency. g Includes immune thrombocytopenia and pancreatitis. h With the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to discontinue should be based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude alternate aetiologies.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment for dosing recommendations (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Data from patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited. Due to minor involvement of hepatic processes in the clearance of tremelimumab, no dose adjustment of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment as no difference in exposure is expected (see section 5.2).

Immune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended in section 4.2.

Method of administration Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is for intravenous use, it is administered as an intravenous infusion after dilution, over 1 hour. When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given first, followed by durvalumab and then platinumbased chemotherapy on the day of dosing. When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given as a fifth dose in combination with durvalumab and pemetrexed maintenance therapy at week 16, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given first, followed by durvalumab and then pemetrexed maintenance therapy on the day of dosing. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, durvalumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as separate intravenous infusions. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab are each given over 1 hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. For pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the SmPCfor administration information. Separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion should be used. During cycle 1, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is to be followed by durvalumab starting approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca infusion. Platinum-based chemotherapy infusion should start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the durvalumab infusion. If there are no clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the physician's discretion, subsequent cycles of durvalumab can be given immediately after Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and the time period between the end of the durvalumab infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.

or durvalumab. In the absence of data, tremelimumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting tremelimumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4). No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with tremelimumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of tremelimumab. Pregnancy There are no data on the use of tremelimumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, tremelimumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or any effects on maintenance of pregnancy or embryofoetal development (see section 5.3). Human IgG2 is known to cross the placental barrier. Tremelimumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Breast-feeding There is no information regarding the presence of tremelimumab in human milk, the absorption and effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG2 is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions from tremelimumab in breast-fed infants, breastfeeding women are advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Tremelimumabis associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of tremelimumab. The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions are based on 2 280 patients who received tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks or 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Details for the significant adverse reactions for tremelimumab when given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison to tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in section 4.4. Immune-mediated pneumonitis In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 86 (3.8%) patients, including Grade 3 in 30 (1.3%) patients, Grade 4 in 1 (&lt; 0.1%) patient, and Grade 5 (fatal) in 7 (0.3%) patients. The median time to onset was 57 days (range: 8 - 912 days). All patients received systemic corticosteroids and 79 of the 86 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Seven patients also received other immunosuppressants. Treatment was discontinued in 39 patients. Resolution occurred in 51 patients. Immune-mediated hepatitis In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 80 (3.5%) patients, including Grade 3 in 48 (2.1%) patients, Grade 4 in 8 (0.4%) patients and Grade 5 (fatal) in 2 (&lt; 0.1%) patients. The median time to onset was 36 days (range: 1 - 533 days). All patients received systemic corticosteroids and 68 of the 80 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Eight patients also received other immunosuppressants. Treatment was discontinued in 27 patients. Resolution occurred in 47 patients. Immune-mediated colitis In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea occurred in 167 (7.3%) patients, including Grade 3 in 76 (3.3%) patients and Grade 4 in 3 (0.1%) patients. The median time to onset was 57 days (range: 3 - 906 days). All patients received systemic corticosteroids and 151 of the 167 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Twenty-two patients also received other immunosuppressants. Treatment was discontinued in 54 patients. Resolution occurred in 141 patients. Intestinal perforation and large intestine perforation were uncommonly reported in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. Immune-mediated endocrinopathies Immune-mediated hypothyroidism Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immunemediated hypothyroidism occurred in 209 (9.2%) patients, including Grade 3 in 6 (0.3%) patients. The median time to onset was 85 days (range: 1 - 624 days). Thirteen patients received systemic corticosteroids and 8 of the 13 received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Treatment discontinued in 3 patients. Resolution occurred in 52 patients.

Immune-mediated hypothyroidism was preceded by immune-mediated hyperthyroidism in 25 patients or immune-mediated thyroiditis in 2 patients.

## Immune-mediated hyperthyroidism

In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immunemediated hyperthyroidism occurred in 62 (2.7%) patients, including Grade 3 in 5 (0.2%) patients. The median time to onset was 33 days (range: 4 - 176 days). Eighteen patients received systemic coticosteroids, and 11 of the 18 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Fifty-three patients required other therapy (thiamazole, carbimazole, propylthiouracil, perchlorate, calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker), One patient discontinued treatment due to hyperthyroidism. Resolution occurred in 47 patients. Immune-mediated thyroiditis In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immunemediated thyroiditis occurred in 15 (0.7%) patients, including Grade 3 in 1 (&lt; 0.1%) patient. The median time to onset was 57 days (range: 22 - 141 days). Five patients received systemic corticosteroids and 2 of the 5 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Thirteen patients required other therapy including, hormone replacement therapy, thiamazole, carbimazole, propylthiouracil, perchlorate, calcium channel blocker, or beta-blocker. No patients discontinued treatment due to immune-mediated thyroiditis. Resolution occurred in 5 patients. Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immunemediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 33 (1.4%) patients, including Grade 3 in 16 (0.7%) patients and Grade 4 in 1 (&lt; 0.1%) patient. The median time to onset was 105 days (range: 20-428 days). Thirty-two patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 10 of the 32 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Treatment was discontinued in one patient. Resolution occurred in 11 patients. Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immunemediated type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in 6 (0.3%) patients, including Grade 3 in 1 (&lt; 0.1%) patient and Grade 4 in 2 (&lt; 0.1%) patients. The median time to onset was 58 days (range: 7 - 220 days). All patients required insulin. Treatment was discontinued for 1 patient. Resolution occurred in 1 patient.

## Immune-mediated rash

In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, immunemediated rash or dermatitis (including pemphigoid) occurred in 112 (4.9%) patients, including Grade 3 in 17 (0.7%) patients. The median time to onset was 35 days (range: 1 - 778 days). All patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 57 of the 112 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Treatment was discontinued in 10 patients. Resolution occurred in 65 patients.

Infusion-related reactions In the combined safety database with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, infusion-related reactions occurred in 45 (2.0%) patients, including Grade 3 in 2 (&lt; 0.1%) patients. There were no Grade 4 or 5 events. Laboratory abnormalities In patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 6.2% for alanine aminotransferase increased, 5.2% for aspartate aminotransferase increased, 4.0% for blood creatinine increased, 9.4% for amylase increased and 13.6% for lipase increased. The proportion of patients who experienced a TSH shift from baseline that was ≤ ULN to &gt; ULN was 24.8% and a TSH shift from baseline that was ≥ LLN to &lt; LLN was 32.9%. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 1337 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg or 1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). One-hundred forty-three patients (10.7%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 8.9% (119/1337) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not impact tremelimumab pharmacokinetics and there was no apparent effect on safety. In the POSEIDON study, of the 278 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg in combination with durvalumab 1 500 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy and evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 38 (13.7%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 11.2% (31/278) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety. Elderly In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of age or older are limited to a total of 74 patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuation of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 years of age or older treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older who received platinum-based chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no information on overdose with tremelimumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates. ATC code: L01FX20 Mechanism of action Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) is primarily expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, limits effector T-cell activation, through a number of potential mechanisms, but primarily by limiting co-stimulatory signalling through CD28. Tremelimumab is a selective, fully human IgG2 antibody that blocks CTLA-4 interaction with CD80 and CD86, thus enhancing T-cell activation and proliferation, resulting in increased T-cell diversity and enhanced anti-tumour activity. The combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor and durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor results in improved anti-tumour responses in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. In murine syngeneic tumour models, dual blockade of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 resulted in enhanced anti-tumour activity. Clinical efficacy and safety NSCLC - POSEIDON study POSEIDON was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. POSEIDON was a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in 1013 metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC were eligible for enrolment. Patients had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 status confirmed by using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay. Patients had a World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca or durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and/or durvalumab (see section 4.4).

Randomisation was stratified by tumour cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% vs. TC &lt; 50%), disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB, per the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer), and histology (non-squamous vs. squamous).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:

-  Arm 1: Tremelimumab AstraZeneca 75 mg with durvalumab 1 500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy. A fifth dose of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca 75 mg was given at Week 16 alongside durvalumab dose 6.

The study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). Tremelimumab AstraZeneca + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The results are summarised below.

 Arm 2: Durvalumab 1 500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy.  Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients could receive 2 additional cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomisation), as clinically indicated, at Investigator's discretion. Patients received one of the following platinum-based chemotherapy regimens:  Non-squamous NSCLC  Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. Unless contraindicated by the investigator, pemetrexed maintenance could be given.  Squamous NSCLC  Gemcitabine 1 000 or 1 250 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.  Non-squamous or squamous NSCLC  Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca was given up to a maximum of 5 doses unless there was disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Durvalumab and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance therapy (when applicable) was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted every 2 months following treatment discontinuation. The dual primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 2) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). The key secondary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for Tremelimumab AstraZeneca + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) and platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). PFS, ORR, and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between study arms. Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (76.0%), age ≥ 65 years (47.1%), age ≥ 75 years (11.3%) median age 64 years (range: 27 to 87 years), White (55.9%), Asian (34.6%), Black or African American (2.0%) other (7.6%), non-Hispanic or Latino (84.2%), current smoker or past-smoker (78.0%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (33.4%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (66.5%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IVA (50.0%), Stage IVB (49.6%), histological sub-groups of squamous (36.9%), non-squamous (62.9%), brain metastases (10.5%) PD-L1 expression TC ≥ 50% (28.8%), PD-L1 expression TC &lt; 50% (71.1%).

The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 750 mg (or 10 mg/kg) administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy. PK exposure increased dose-proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady-state was achieved at approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the dose range of  ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the geometric mean steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) was 6.33 L. Tremelimumab clearance (CL) decreased over time in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy resulting in a geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) of 0.309 L/day; the decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean terminal

Elderly population A total of 75 patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (n=35) and platinum-based chemotherapy only (n=40) arms of the POSEIDON study. An exploratory HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was observed for Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy within this study subgroup. Due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn, but caution is suggested when considering this regimen for elderly patients. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant neoplasms (except central nervous system tumours, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms). See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy.

half-life was approximately 14.2 days. The primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.

## Special populations

## Age, gender, race

Age (22 - 97 years), body weight (34 - 149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. Renal impairment Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown; the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to influence tremelimumab exposure. Hepatic impairment Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN or bilirubin &gt; 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown; the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is not expected to influence tremelimumab exposure. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Animal toxicology In the chronic 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with tremelimumab was associated with dose-related incidence in persistent diarrhoea and skin rash, scabs and open sores, which were dose-limiting. These clinical signs were also associated with decreased appetite and body weight and swollen peripheral lymph nodes. Histopathological findings correlating with the observed clinical signs included reversible chronic inflammation in the cecum and colon, mononuclear cell infiltration in the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. A dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of mononuclear cell infiltration with or without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the salivary gland, pancreas (acinar), thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, heart, esophagus, tongue, periportal liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular muscles), and choroid plexus of the brain. No NOAEL was found in this study with animals treated with the lowest dose of 5 mg/kg/week requiring supportive care. This dose provided an exposure-based safety margin of 3 to clinical relevant exposure (taking species difference in potency into account). Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of tremelimumab has not been evaluated.

## Reproductive toxicology

Mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat dose toxicity studies. Since animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab, the clinical relevance of these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

findings for fertility is unknown. In reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or effects pregnancy losses, foetal weights, or external, visceral, skeletal abnormalities or weights of selected foetal organs.
