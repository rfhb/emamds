## 1. Introduction

On 28 Aug 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Rixubis (nonacog gamma), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.

A Clinical Addendum Overview (Module 2), a Clinical Study Report with Appendices and an Erratum (all Module 5) are provided for study 251602.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1.  Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study 251602 (study title: Phase IV Multi-center, Prospective, Interventional, Post-marketing Study in Hemophilia B Patients in India receiving RIXUBIS as On-demand or Prophylaxis Under Standard Clinical Practice) is a stand alone study.

## 2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

RIXUBIS is a coagulation factor IX (FIX) product. It is a purified protein produced utilizing recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology. It has a primary amino acid sequence that is identical to the Ala-148 allelic form of plasma-derived FIX, and its structural and functional characteristics are comparable to endogenous FIX. Factor IX is activated by factor VIIa/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway and by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated FIX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, and a clot can be formed.

RIXUBIS contains the active substance nonacog gamma and is a coagulation FIX product that is produced by recombinant technology, ie, by using modern gene replication technologies. RIXUBIS is synthesized by a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.

RIXUBIS has been approved for the treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B (congenital FIX deficiency), routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B, and perioperative management of bleeding in patients with hemophilia B in 21 countries/regions (approved via centralized procedure in the European Union [EU]) as of 30 Jun 2022.

The product is available as powder and solvent for solution for injection in the following strengths: 250 international units (IU), 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU. The strengths and indications for use of RIXUBIS may vary in different countries. RIXUBIS is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white or off-white, lyophilized powder and solvent for solution for intravenous injection and is stabilized with a mixture of sugars and salts. Dosage and duration of treatment with RIXUBIS depend on the severity of the FIX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, the patient's clinical condition and age, and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of FIX, such as incremental recovery (IR) and half-life.

## 2.3.1.  Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for: Study 251602: Phase IV Multi-center, Prospective, Interventional, Post-marketing Study in Hemophilia B Patients in India receiving RIXUBIS as Ondemand or Prophylaxis Under Standard Clinical Practice

## 2.3.2.  Clinical study

## Study 251602: Phase IV Multi-center, Prospective, Interventional, Postmarketing Study in Hemophilia B Patients in India receiving RIXUBIS as On-demand or Prophylaxis Under Standard Clinical

Study Period:

| Study Initiated (first subject enrolled):   | 07 Dec 2018   |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Study Completed (last subject completed):   | 11 Aug 2021   |
| Date of the Report:                         | 27 Jul 2022   |

## Description

This was a Phase IV multi-center, prospective, interventional, post-marketing study in hemophilia B previously treated patients (PTPs) in India receiving RIXUBIS under standard clinical practice. The physician was expected to follow standard clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of RIXUBIS under standard clinical practice was evaluated in a total of 25 evaluable hemophilia B subjects. All study subjects were included in the assessments of safety and hemostatic effectiveness.

The purpose of this addendum is to summarize results from completed Study 251602, a Phase 4, multicenter, prospective, interventional, postmarketing study in hemophilia B previously treated patients (PTPs) in India receiving RIXUBIS under standard clinical practice.

The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of RIXUBIS based on serious adverse events (SAEs) (including FIX inhibitors). Secondary safety objectives included the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), changes in laboratory parameters, and immunogenicity (excluding FIX inhibitors). Secondary efficacy objectives included the assessment of the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with RIXUBIS and efficacy of RIXUBIS in the control of bleeding episodes.

The safety and efficacy of RIXUBIS under standard clinical practice were evaluated in a total of 25 evaluable hemophilia B subjects. All study subjects were included in the assessments of safety (safety analysis set [SAS]) and hemostatic effectiveness (effectiveness full analysis set [EFAS]). Out of the 25 subjects, 23 (92%) subjects received at least 3 months of prophylactic treatment in the study and were included in the efficacy analysis. No on-demand subjects were enrolled.

Overall, RIXUBIS was found to be safe and effective in hemophilia B PTPs who received RIXUBIS treatment under standard clinical practice in India. Although there was a high percentage of protocol deviations reported during the study, these deviations did not compromise subjects' safety or efficacy, nor were there any concerns pertaining to study validity. Results from this study are consistent with previous real-world evidence and clinical trial data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The total of 23/25 prophylaxis subjects in India who completed the study provide sufficient evidence for safety and efficacy of RIXUBIS in hemophilia B PTPs treated under standard clinical practice in India. The results of Study 261502 did not change the positive benefit-risk profile of RIXUBIS.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Inclusion Criteria

Each subject had to meet all the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

1. Subject or legally authorized representative (LAR) (in case of study participants &lt;18 years of age) gave written informed consent to participate in the study.

The treatment with RIXUBIS was administered at the discretion of the investigator and consisted of either prophylaxis or on-demand. As discussed in the RIXUBIS Product Label for India, incremental recovery (IR) is used for the dosing calculation for the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes. In this study no on-demand subject was enrolled, therefore IR was not calculated.

Following reconstitution, RIXUBIS was administered at room temperature and within 3 hours of reconstitution. Plastic syringes provided by the sponsor were used with this product since proteins such as RIXUBIS tend to stick to the surface of glass syringes. The infusions were administered by intravenous infusion at a maximum infusion rate of 10 mL/minute. It was recommended that the first dose of RIXUBIS was infused in the clinic.

RIXUBIS is formulated as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder of concentrated rFIX for intravenous injection and is provided in a single-dose vial labeled with the rFIX activity expressed in international unit (IU). Subjects used the commercial material for this study. RIXUBIS was infused intravenously after reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI). The infusions were administered by intravenous infusion at a maximum infusion rate of 10 mL/minute. It was recommended to infuse the first dose of RIXUBIS in the clinic. All subjects enrolled in the study were treated as per standard clinical practice. In all cases, the treatment with RIXUBIS was at the discretion of the investigator and consisted of either a prophylactic or on-demand treatment as per the RIXUBIS Product Label for India.

## Duration of Treatment:

The overall duration of the study was 36 months from study initiation (ie, first subject enrolled) to study completion (ie, last subject last visit).

The follow-up period for each enrolled subject was up to 6 months from baseline while on treatment. The following visits were performed: Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Subjects were discontinued from the study after they had been in the study for 6 months, irrespective of the RIXUBIS EDs they had received during that 6-month treatment period.

## Objective(s)

## Primary Objective

The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of RIXUBIS based on serious adverse events (SAEs) (including FIX inhibitors).

## Secondary Objectives

Safety:

- To determine the safety of RIXUBIS based on adverse events (AEs)
- To determine the safety of RIXUBIS based on changes in laboratory parameters
- To determine the immunogenicity of RIXUBIS (excluding FIX inhibitors)

## Efficacy

- To assess the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with RIXUBIS
- To assess the efficacy of RIXUBIS in the control of bleeding episodes

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Outcome Measure

The number of possibly or probably related SAEs (including FIX inhibitors) as well as the number of subjects with possibly or probably related SAEs (including FIX inhibitors) that occurred during or after first RIXUBIS infusion will be summarized.

## Secondary Outcome Measures

## Safety:

The number of possibly or probably related adverse events as well as the number of subjects with possibly or probably related adverse events that occurred during or after first RIXUBIS infusion will be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

summarized.

Shift tables will be presented for the results of clinical laboratory data.

Subjects developing binding IgG or IgM antibodies to FIX or antibodies to CHO proteins or rFurin will be summarized.

Efficacy:

Summary statistics will be provided for the rate of success of RIXUBIS for treatment of bleeding episodes as well as for the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) with prophylactic use of RIXUBIS. These tables will be also presented by bleeding site, cause and severity.

## Sample size

Based on data from the WFH from 1998-2006, the mean prevalence of hemophilia B in India was 0.19 per 100,000 male. In the WFH Report on the Annual Global Survey 2014, there were a total of 14,450 cases of hemophilia and 2,281 confirmed cases of hemophilia B in India in 2014. Due to the low prevalence of hemophilia B and difficulty in switching patient from current therapy, an estimated study size of 25 subjects will be recruited.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable as study 251602 was an open-label single arm study.

## Statistical Methods

Data handling will be conducted by the contract research organization. The data will be inspected for inconsistencies by performing validation checks.

Statistical analysis for this study will be descriptive in nature. All details regarding the statistical analysis and the preparation of tables, listings, and figures will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) prepared by the contract research organization and approved by the sponsor before database lock.

## Planned Interim Analysis of the Study

No interim analyses are planned for this study.

## Changes in the Conduct of the Study

The study protocol was amended twice: Amendment 1 dated 15 Sept 2016 and Amendment 2 dated 27 Sep 2017.

Summary of Changes from Amendment 1 to Amendment 2 is provided below:

Description of Change: The earlier version (Protocol Amendment 1, dated 15 Sep 2016) used the PostMarketing Surveillance (PMS) study protocol template. An Interventional study protocol template was used for this amendment. These 2 protocol templates (PMS study protocol template and Interventional study protocol template) are very different and almost all sections were changed as a result.

Purpose for Change: Since we were providing IP free of cost and since we were doing a mandatory inhibitor testing as per the recommendation from the Indian Health Authority, this study was considered an Interventional study.

## Changes in the Planned Analyses

The original SAP dated 22 Nov 2019 was amended once on 29 Sep 2021. All the changes were made to align with the dry run analysis.

The details of changes in planned analysis are presented below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Visit windows were not derived. Assessments were assigned to visits based on the information reported in the completed eCRF page at each planned visit.
- Analysis of ABR with prophylactic use of RIXUBIS were clarified: Zero was considered as a possible number of unique bleeds. All subjects on prophylaxis treatment for at least 3 months were included in the summary of ABR.
- For analysis of FIX Nijmegen, negative result was defined as any value &lt;0.6 BU.
- COVID-19 related protocol deviations were summarized.

## Hemophilia B Treatment History

The mean (SD) average ABR based on previous 3 to 6 months was 19.2 (28.88) bleeds per year. A total of 3 (12.0%) subjects had received on-demand FIX replacement therapies within the 6 months prior to enrolling in the study (2 subjects received Immunine/Baxalta and 1 subject received Leflunomide/Baxalta). Each bleeding episode required 1 treatment. The mean (min, max) average dose required to treat bleeding episodes was 410.0 (329.09) IU/kg. All subjects had 'Good' to 'Moderate' response to treatment. The mean (SD) duration of on -demand treatment was 217.7 (39.19) months.

## Number analysed

A total of 25 hemophilia B subjects were planned and enrolled in this study, of which:

- 25 subjects were included in the Effectiveness Full Analysis Set (EFAS) which comprised of all subjects for whom all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were met. This dataset was used for the efficacy analyses.
- 25 subjects were included in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS) which consisted of all subjects having received RIXUBIS at any time during the study.

## Efficacy results

## Bleeding Episodes

A total of 8 (32.0%) subjects experienced any bleeding episodes during the study. The mean (SD) number of unique bleeding episodes per subject (who experienced any bleeding episodes during the study) was 1.6 (0.74). The total number of unique bleeding episodes was 13 (3 of these unique bleeding episodes occurred prior to starting prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment). Out of 13 unique bleeding episodes, 6 (42.6%) unique bleeding episodes were treated with additional RIXUBIS (1 of the 6 unique bleeding episodes occurred prior to starting prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment). Two (15.4%) subjects received a hemostatic product other than RIXUBIS to treat a bleeding episode and 1 (7.7%) subject received analgesics to treat a bleeding episode.

## Success rate by Treatment Regimen

All included subjects (n=25) received prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment, and no subjects received ondemand RIXUBIS treatment. Out of the 25 subjects receiving prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment, 8 subjects experienced 13 unique bleeding episodes during the study. Six out of the 13 unique bleeding episodes required additional RIXUBIS treatment and were rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to RIXUBIS treatment was rated as 'Excellent' for 3 (50.0%) bleeding episodes, and 'Good' for 3 (50.0%) bleeding episodes. The rate of success (95% CI) of RIXUBIS treatment was 100% (95% CI: 54.1, 100.0).

## Success Rate by Bleeding Site

Out of the 25 subjects receiving prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment, 8 (32%) subjects experienced 12 unique bleeding episodes in joints during the study. Six out of the 12 unique bleeding episodes in joints required additional RIXUBIS treatment and were rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to RIXUBIS treatment was rated as 'Excellent' for 3 (50.0%) bleeding episodes and 'Good' for 3 (50.0%) bleeding episodes. The rate of success (95% CI) of RIXUBIS treatment was 100% (95% CI: 54.1, 100.0). Also, there was 1 (4.0%) subject who experienced 1 unique bleeding episode in mucosa, which required additional RIXUBIS treatment, was rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to RIXUBIS treatment was rated as 'Excellent' and rate of success was 100% (95% CI: 2.5, 100.0). Moreover, there was 1 (4.0%) subject who experienced 1 unique bleeding episode in other site (left toe), which did not require additional RIXUBIS treatment and was not rated for hemostatic effectiveness.

## Success Rate by Bleeding Cause

Out of the 25 subjects receiving prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment, 6 (24%) subjects experienced 11 unique bleeding episodes, for spontaneous cause, during the study. Five out of the 11 unique bleeding episodes required additional RIXUBIS treatment and were rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to RIXUBIS treatment was rated as 'Excellent' for 2 (40.0%) bleeding episodes and 'Good' for 3 (60.0%) bleeding episodes. The rate of success (95% CI) of RIXUBIS treatment was 100% (95% CI: 47.8, 100.0).

Two (8.0%) subjects experienced 2 unique bleeding episodes with unknown cause during the study. One out of the 2 unique bleeding episodes required additional RIXUBIS treatment and was rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to RIXUBIS treatment was rated as 'Excellent' for that bleeding episode. The rate of success (95% CI) of RIXUBIS treatment was 100% (95% CI: 2.5, 100.0).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Success Rate by Bleeding Severity

Out of 25 subjects receiving prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment, 6 (24%) subjects experienced 8 unique bleeding episodes of minor severity during the study. There were no subjects with bleeding episodes of major severity or bleeding episodes with life/limb threatening severity. Three out of 8 unique bleeding episodes required additional RIXUBIS treatment and were rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to RIXUBIS treatment was rated as 'Excellent' for 2 (66.7%) bleeding episodes and 'Good' for 1 (33.3%) bleeding episode. The rate of success (95% CI) of RIXUBIS treatment was 100% (95% CI: 29.2, 100.0).

Also, 3 (12%) subjects experienced 5 unique bleeding episodes of moderate severity during the study. Three out of the 5 unique bleeding episodes required additional RIXUBIS treatment and were rated for hemostatic effectiveness. The response to treatment was rated as 'Excellent' for 1 (33.3%) bleeding episode and 'Good' for 2 (66.7%) bleeding episodes. The rate of success (95% CI) of RIXUBIS treatment was 100% (95% CI: 29.2, 100.0).

## Prophylaxis Efficacy Rating

At an unscheduled visit between the screening visit and Visit 1, only 1 subject received prophylaxis treatment with RIXUBIS and the efficacy rating performed by the investigator was 'Excellent'.

At Visit 1, all 25 subjects received prophylaxis treatment with RIXUBIS and efficacy ratings were performed in 19 (76.0%) subjects. Most subjects had a 'Good' efficacy rating (n=12 [of 19], 63.2%) followed by 'Excellent' (n=6 [of 19], 31.6%) and 'Moderate' (n=1 [of 19], 5.3%). At an unscheduled visit, between Visit 1 and Visit 2, 1 subject received prophylaxis treatment for which an efficacy rating was not performed.

At Visit 2, 23 (92.0%) subjects received prophylaxis treatment with RIXUBIS and efficacy ratings were performed in 21 (91.3%) subjects. Most subjects had an 'Excellent' efficacy rating (n=12 [of 21], 57.1%) followed by 'Good' (n=8 [of 21], 38.1%) and 'Moderate' (n=1 [of 21], 4.8%).

At the EOT visit, 23 (92.0%) subjects received prophylaxis treatment with RIXUBIS and efficacy ratings were performed in 22 (95.7%) subjects. Most subjects had an 'Excellent' efficacy rating (n=14 [of 22], 63.6%) followed by 'Good' (n=7 [of 22], 31.8%) and 'Moderate' (n=1 [of 22], 4.5%).

No subjects reported a change in prophylaxis treatment or a modification in prophylaxis treatment regimen during the study.

## Annualized Bleeding Rate

A total of 10 unique bleeding episodes were reported during prophylaxis (few bleeding episodes occurred prior to prophylaxis treatment). The mean (SD) number of unique bleeds per subject (with a minimum of 3 months prophylactic exposure) was 0.4 (0.79) with a mean treatment duration for prophylactic RIXUBIS treatment of 179.5 (9.08) days. Overall, the mean (SD) ABR in subjects with 3 months prophylaxis RIXUBIS treatment was 0.914 (1.6896).

## Vital Signs

The mean (SD) values for diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rates, and temperature at EOT were comparable to those observed at baseline.

## Postmarketing Safety Experience

RIXUBIS has been approved for the treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B (congenital FIX deficiency), routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B, and perioperative management of bleeding in patients with hemophilia B in 21 countries/regions (approved via centralized procedure in the EU) as of 30 Jun 2022. In India, initial approval of RIXUBIS was granted to Baxter India Pvt. Ltd. on 19 Jan 2015. Approval was then transferred and reissued to Baxalta Bioscience India Pvt. Ltd. on 21 Mar 2016.

Cumulatively from 01 Oct 2013 to 30 Jun 2022, approximately 10,696,000 IU of RIXUBIS were sold in India with an estimated 3,056 patient treatments (mean of 5 patients/year) on prophylaxis and estimated 2,453 patient treatments (mean of 19 patients/year) on-demand therapies. From 01 Jul 2021 to 30 Jun 2022, approximately 7,327,750 IU of RIXUBIS were sold in India with an estimated 2,094 patient treatments (20 patients/year) on prophylaxis and estimated 1,680 patient treatments (84 patients/year) on-demand therapies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 251602 was a Phase 4, multicenter, prospective, interventional, postmarketing study in hemophilia B PTPs in India receiving RIXUBIS under standard clinical practice. The safety results of this study suggest that RIXUBIS is safe in hemophilia B PTPs treated under standard clinical practice in India. Results from this study are consistent with previous real-world evidence in a South Korean population (Choi et al. 2020) and Phase 1/3 clinical trial (Windyga et al. 2014). The total of 23/25 prophylaxis subjects in India who completed the study provides sufficient evidence for safety and efficacy of RIXUBIS in hemophilia B PTPs treated under standard clinical practice in India. The results of Study 261502 did not impact the benefit-risk profile of RIXUBIS.

## Postmarketing Safety Surveillance Planning and Risk Management

RIXUBIS has been shown to be efficacious for routine prophylactic treatment and control of bleeding episodes (on-demand treatment) in PTPs in adults and pediatrics with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B. RIXUBIS has also been shown to be efficacious in surgical hemostasis in adult patients with hemophilia B.

RIXUBIS is generally well tolerated. Important identified risks include hypersensitivity reactions (including reactions/antibodies to CHO protein). Important potential risks include inhibitor formation, lack of effect, thromboembolic events (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis), and nephrotic syndrome following attempted immune tolerance induction in hemophilia B patients with FIX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions. These risks continue to be monitored as a part of routine pharmacovigilance activities, and detailed AE information on reports of inhibitor formation are collected via a FIX inhibitor AE questionnaire.

## 2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH submitted the clinical study report of study 251602, as required in Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 due to the inclusion of paediatric subjects, while acknowledging the failure to do so within the specified time frame of six months after completion of last subject (Study Completed: 11 Aug 2021; Date of the Report: 27 Jul 2022). Upon request the Applicant clarified that the delayed submission was due to insufficient detail in the internal procedure for handling the requirements of Article 46 submissions and that actions are in place to prevent future submissions to be delayed. The explanation is acknowledged, but the delayed submission is critically noted.

Trial 251602 was a single-arm, open-label, phase IV, multi-centre, prospective, interventional, postmarketing study in haemophilia B patients in India receiving Rixubis as on-demand or prophylaxis under standard clinical practice. The duration of the study was 36 months from enrolment of the first subject, to study completion of the last subject on 11 th  of August 2021. In total, 25 subjects were planned and enrolled, of which 23 completed the study. Reasons for the two study discontinuations can be followed (one each for non compliance with study protocol and due to criminal record). All 25 patients were included in the effectiveness full analysis set (EFAS) and safety analysis set (SAS). The mean (SD) age of included patients was 24.6 (8.29) years, 5 patients were between 12 to 18 years old. All subjects received Rixubis in the prophylactic setting for a total duration of three months after enrolment. No concerns derive from the two protocol amendments and reported protocol deviations (vast majority related to IP compliance).

The primary outcome was number of possibly or probably related SAEs (including FIX inhibitors) and number and percentage of subjects with possibly or probably related SAEs (including FIX inhibitors) during or after first Rixubis infusion. SAEs and AEs were summarized by system organ class SOC) and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

preferred term (PT). Efficacy was established by analysis of annualized bleeding rate (ABR) with prophylactic use of Rixubis, in subjects on prophylaxis treatment of at least 3 months. The choice of study objectives and corresponding endpoints is appropriate.

An Erratum for the study report of study 251602 was also submitted, which clarified one correction for an erroneously depicted valued of the ABR SD in the body text of the CSR. No concern arises from this Erratum.

## Conclusion on efficacy

## Incremental recovery

The mean IR at baseline was 0.945 (SD: 0.2564) (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) with a minimum value of 0.43 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) in 22 subjects, which is comparable to the rate reported in the EPAR of Rixubis with 0.79 (SD: 0.2) (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) and a minimum of 0.26 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) at the first exposure day (as determined for all subjects in the combined phase 1/3 study250901).

## Consumption

The mean total number of infusions given for prophylaxis per subject (45.1, SD:12.08) during the mean treatment duration of 179.5 (SD: 9.08) days in study 251602 is in line with the recommended interval for infusions in patients ≥12 years during prophylactic treatment as recommended in the product information (i.e. 3-4 days).

## Treatment of bleeding episodes

The mean duration of Rixubis treatment to treat bleeding episodes was 1.8 (SD: 1.33) days with a maximum of 4 days and the mean number of infusions of Rixubis treatment to treat bleeding episodes per subject was 1.3 (SD: 0.52) with a maximum of 2 infusions (i.e. all with good or excellent treatment success; n=6 subjects received additional Rixubis for bleeding episodes). No subject received RIXUBIS treatment to maintain haemostasis. No concerns derive from the treatment of bleeding episodes in study 251602.

## Unique bleeding episodes

Out of 25 subjects enrolled in prophylactic Rixubis treatment group, 8 subjects (32%) experienced a total of 13 unique bleeding episodes during the study and 3 of these unique bleeding episodes occurred prior to starting prophylactic treatment. While most bleeding episodes after start of treatment only occurred once in each patient, one subject experienced 3 unique bleeding episodes and two further subjects had 2 unique bleeding episodes each. No subject developed a new target joint (i.e. ≥ 4 bleeds within 6 months) for the treatment duration of 3 months. The vast majority of bleeds were spontaneous (at least n=11 as the two remaining bleeds are of unknown cause) and mild (n=3, rest was moderate) joint (n=12) bleeds (see below the discussion on ABR for joint and spontaneous bleeds). No traumatic bleeds are reported. Overall, the unique bleeding episodes reported are within the expected range and raise no further concerns.

## Annualized bleeding Rate

The mean ABR for prophylactic use of Rixubis was 0.914 (SD: 1.6896), with highest ABR for joints of 0.82 (SD: 1.557). The mean ABR for spontaneous bleeding episodes during RIXUBIS prophylaxis was 0.74 (SD: 1.668). The mean ABR for minor severity and moderate severity during RIXUBIS prophylaxis were 0.45 (SD: 0.869) and 0.47 (SD: 1.463), respectively. The median ABR in all mentioned categories was 0. This is in line with ABR reported in similar trials and no concerns are raised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusion on safety

All enrolled subjects who received Rixubis at any time during the trial (n=25) were included in the safety analysis set. Out of 25 subjects, 23 received Rixubis treatment for prophylaxis for at least 3 months, with a mean duration of 179.5 (SD 9.08) days. No deaths, SAEs or other significant AEs were reported during the study. 3 subjects experienced TEAEs, all of them occurring once: arthropathy (severe), joint swelling (moderate) and Dengue fever (mild). Two further AEs were not considered treatment emergent as they occurred before IMP administration. All events were considered not to be related to the investigational product by the investigator. The moderate event of joint swelling was also rated as bleeding event of the left elbow in a subject with in total 3 bleeding episodes (also Conclusion on efficacy above), whereas the event of arthropathy was not caused by a bleeding event. Importantly, no new or unexpected safety finding was observed in study 251602.

Binding antibodies to FIX were found in only 1 subject at EOT Visit and the titre value for the binding antibodies to FIX was 1/160. No antibodies to rFurin or CHO were detected in any subject over the course of the trial. Importantly, also no inhibitory antibodies against FIX were identified throughout the study.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

No concerns derive from data reported from trial 251602 regarding the current B/R for Rixubis Efficacy and safety results did not reveal any unexpected findings and appear to be in line with results from previous studies. Also, no changes of the PI appear required. However, the delayed submission beyond 6 months after study completion is critically noted.

## Fulfilled:

## 4.  Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

1. The Applicant is asked to clarify reasons for the delayed submission of the study report for Study 251602.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question 1:

The Applicant is asked to clarify reasons for the delayed submission of the study report for Study 251602.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH Response:

The reason for the delay was due to insufficient detail in the internal procedure for handling the requirements of Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation EC 1901/2006. Takeda is now proactively monitoring upcoming studies that include paediatric patients to support timely submission of CSRs per the Article 46 timelines.

Corrective actions are in process. Preventative measures have been put in place to strengthen internal processes, to train relevant stakeholders in the organisation on paediatric requirements, and to monitor studies in scope of Article 46.

## Rapporteur's assessment and conclusion:

The Applicant clarified that the delayed submission was due to insufficient detail in the internal procedure for handling the requirements of Article 46 submissions and that actions are in place to prevent future submissions to be delayed.

Issue resolved.
