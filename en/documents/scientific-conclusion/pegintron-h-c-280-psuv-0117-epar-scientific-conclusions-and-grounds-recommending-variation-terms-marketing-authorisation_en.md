## Scientific conclusions

Based on a review of data concerning tongue pigmentation provided in this PSUR as well as similar data provided in the PSUR of another peginterferon alfa containing product, the PRAC considered that tongue pigmentation should be added as an Adverse Drug Reaction to section 4.8 of the SmPC and that the package leaflet be updated accordingly. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for PegIntron, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance Peginterferon alfa-2b is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
