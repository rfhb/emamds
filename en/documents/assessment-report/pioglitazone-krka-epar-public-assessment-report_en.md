## 1 Background information on the procedure

## 1.1 Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  Krka,  d.d.,  Novo  mesto  submitted  on  27  October  2010  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Pioglitazone Krka, through the centralised procedure falling within the scope of the Article 3 (3) - 'Generic of a Centrally authorised product' of Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure  was  agreed  upon  by  the EMA/CHMP on 23 March 2010.

The  application  concerns  a  generic  medicinal  product  as  defined  in  Article  10(2)(b)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC  and  refers  to  a  reference  product  for  which  a  Marketing  Authorisation  is  or  has  been granted  in  the  Community  on  the  basis  of  a  complete  dossier  in  accordance  with  Article  8(3)  of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

The applicant applied for the following indication:

Pioglitazone  is  indicated  as  second  or  third  line  treatment  of  type 2  diabetes  mellitus  as  described below:

## as monotherapy

in  adult  patients  (particularly  overweight  patients)  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance;

## as dual oral therapy in combination with

a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated,  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  monotherapy with a sulphonylurea;

Pioglitazone  Krka  is  also  indicated  for  combination  with  insulin  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  in  adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance.

After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response,  pioglitazone  should  be  discontinued.  In  light  of  potential  risks  with  prolonged  therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained.

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data  and  at least a bioequivalent study with the reference medicinal product Actos/Glustin instead of non-clinical and clinical unless justified otherwise.

## 2 Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

This centralised application is submitted by Krka, d.d. Novo mesto for Pioglitazone Krka 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg Tablets according to regulation EC No 726/2004, article 3(3)- generic of a centrally authorised product.  It  is  submitted  in  accordance  with  article  10(1)  of  2001/83/EC.  The  reference  medicinal products  are  Glustin  15  mg,  30  mg,  45  mg  Tablets  authorised  by  EMA  on  11  October  2000. Bioequivalence has been demonstrated against Actos 45 mg tablets authorised by EMA on 13 October 2000. These are identical duplicate products marketed by Takeda.

In  addition  to  the  presentations  authorised  for  Glustin,  the  applicant  has  added  the  60  tablets presentations  for  the  15  mg  tablets,    the  30  mg  tablets  and    the  45  mg  tablets.  The  proposed packsizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

Pioglitazone  hydrochloride  belongs  to  the  class  of  thiazolidinediones  (ATC  code:  A10BG03).  The proposed indication is:

Pioglitazone  is  indicated  as  second  or  third  line  treatment  of  type 2  diabetes  mellitus  as  described below:

## as monotherapy

in  adult  patients  (particularly  overweight  patients)  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance;

## as dual oral therapy in combination with

a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated,  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  monotherapy with a sulphonylurea;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance.

The product is intended for use in the adult population only.

The indication proposed for Pioglitazone Krka is the same as the proposed indication for Paglitaz (i.e. treatment of type 2 diabetes). However, due to the patent grounds and in line with 2001/83/EC, the triple  combination  pioglitazone/metformin/sulphonylurea  and  dual  therapy  with  metformin  has  been deleted from the Pioglitazone Krka SmPC and PIL texts.

Pioglitazone is a high affinity ligand for PPAR γ , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligandactivated  transcription  factors.  The  most  relevant  mode  of  pioglitazone  action  seem  to  be  the activation of this receptor. Once activated, PPAR γ forms a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, the  retinoid-X  receptor.  This  heterodimer  then  binds  to  specific  DNA  sequences  and  regulates  the transcriptional  activity  of  target  genes  that  play  a  role  in  the  metabolism  of  glucose  and  lipids  by regulating  synthesis  and  expression  of  cellular  glucose  and  fatty  acid  transporters.  Pioglitazone  is dependent on the presence of insulin in order to exert its beneficial effects. The activation of PPAR γ by pioglitazone leads to increased peripheral, hepatic and adipocyte insulin sensitivity. By reducing insulin resistance, pioglitazone lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations, circulating free fatty acids and insulin levels, and also hepatic glucose production may decline.

The glucose-lowering effect of pioglitazone in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is also  related  to  its  ability  to  reduce  insulin  resistance  in  skeletal  muscle.  PPARγ activation  also stimulates  differentiation  of  pre-adipocytes  and  bone  marrow  stromal  cells  into  mature  adipocytes. Barring  the  beneficial  effects  on  glycaemic  control,  insulin  levels  and  function  and  free  fatty  acids, pioglitazone  also  confers  benefits  in  terms  of  other  lipid  parameters,  hsCRP,  MMP-9,  MCP-1  and adiponectin.

Pioglitazone is indicated for the treatment of non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

It can be prescribed as monotherapy in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise in whom metformin is contraindicated or not adequately tolerated.

Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in patients with insufficient glycemic control with insulin.

Pioglitazone is to be taken once daily regardless of food intake. The starting dose may be 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The maximal daily dose is 45 mg. When the pioglitazone is added on top of insulin, the latter  can  be  continued  as  previously,  while  attention  has  to  be  paid  on  hypoglycaemic  episodes.  If they occur, insulin dose should be reduced.

Pioglitazone can be used in elderly and in patients with impaired renal function (bar dialysis patients) without any dose adjustment. There is a lack of information about the use in dialysis patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in this patient group.

Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

Cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) is also contraindication for the use of pioglitazone due to increased volume overload as a consequence of fluid retention.

This can exacerbate or trigger heart failure. Therefore pioglitazone has to be administered with caution in patients with any risk factors for heart failure (careful titration and follow up). Pioglitazone must not be administered to patients with hepatic impairment (enzyme ALT &gt; 2.5 times the upper normal limit

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or any other sign of hepatic disease) due to reports on hepatocelular dysfunction in patients treated with  pioglitazone.  During  the  treatment,  liver  enzymes  activity  has  to  be  controlled  and  treatement withdrawn in case of persistent elevations of ALT more than 3 times the normal value.

Pioglitazone is contraindicated in diabetic ketoacidosis.

Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer, and uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria.

The  use  of  pioglitazone  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  bone  fractures.  This  risk  should  be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.1 Introduction

Pioglitazone  Krka  duplicate  are  tablets  that  exist  in  3  strengths  namely  15  mg,  30  mg  and  45  mg differentiated by their size and strengths 15 mg and 45 mg further by engravings.

The formulation contains pioglitazone hydrochloride as the active substance and the following common compendial excipients: lactose monohydrate (diluent), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), hydroxypropylcellulose (binder), magnesium stearate (lubricant).

The proposed packaging for the finished tablets consists of blisters:  OPA/Al/PVC foil - aluminium foil blisters placed in a printed carton.

## 2.2.2 Active Substance

Pioglitazone  INN  is  a  known  active  substance.  There  is  not  current  no  monograph  in  the  European Pharmacopoeia, but a draft monograph has been published in Pharmeuropa Vol. 22 no.4.

Full information about the active substance has been provided by the active substance supplier and the finished product manufacturer in the Module 3.

Acceptable QP declarations confirming the active substance is manufactured in compliance with GMP have been provided in annex 5.22 of Module 1.

## Manufacture

The synthesis of pioglitazone hydrochloride has been well described. It can be summarised in six steps. Five of them are synthesis steps and the last one is the crystallisation of the final product.

The main intermediate can be prepared by two different processes (process 1 and process 2). These  processes  have  the  same  first  reaction  steps,  but  differ  slightly  in  the  reaction  and isolation conditions. The other steps of the synthesis are the same for both processes. In the last step pioglitazone hydrochloride is crystallised to prepare the final active substance. A flow chart and a detailed description have been provided.

Starting materials have been well characterised along with a brief description of the analytical methods used and a summary of the validation of the methods used for their control.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Specifications for all other solvents and reagents have been provided and are acceptable. The reagents and solvents are suitably controlled for the stage of use.

No specific critical steps have been identified. Seven in-process controls are applied in the synthesis of pioglitazone  hydrochloride,  but  only  one  intermediate  is  isolated  and  controlled  with  adequate specification.

The in-process control specifications are the same irrespective of whether process 1 or 2 is used. The methods used for the in-process controls and for the control of the intermediate have been provided and validated.

No process validation data have been provided. It has been confirmed that process validation will be performed before launching the product. As this is not a sterile active this is acceptable.

A  very  brief  description  of  the  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  provided.  It  is stated that minor changes were made during the scale development, but these did not influence the yield or quality of the substance. This is considered acceptable.

## Characterisation

The chemical structure of Pioglitazone hydrochloride has been determined by  1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, FTIR, elemental  analysis,  mass  spectrometry,  melting  point  and  X-ray  diffraction.  Spectra  have  been provided. Polymorphism was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. It has been shown that the manufacturing process produces consistently the same polymorphic form

## Impurities

The  extensive  discussion  on  potential  impurities  included  synthetic  impurities,  residual  solvents, inorganic  impurities  and  metal  catalysts  (although  no  metal  catalysts  were  used).  The  synthetic process was also evaluated regarding genotoxic impurities and it was demonstrated that their levels were  below  the  authorised  limits  in  the  final  active  substance.  All  the  impurities  levels  including residual solvents were in accordance with ICH limits.

## Specification

A European Pharmacopoeia monograph for Pioglitazone Hydrochloride has been drafted and published in  PharmEuropa 22.4. A monograph for the active substance Pioglitazone Hydrochloride will also be published in USP 34.

As  the  official  monograph  is  not  yet  available,  pioglitazone  is  analyzed  by  the  active  substance manufacturer as per in-house specification. Parameters testes included: appearance (visual method), solubility  (Ph.Eur.),  identification  (Infra-Red  and  chloride  method),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.Eur.),  loss  on drying ( Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph.Eur), related substances (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography HPLC), pioglitazone hydrochloride assay (HPLC), particle size (laser diffraction), residual solvents (GC), genotoxic impurities (HPLC).

Solubility, identity by IR, identity of chlorides, sulphated ash, loss on drying and heavy metals were tested  using  Ph.  Eur.  methods.  Validation  was  not  required  for  simple  Ph.  Eur.  methods  (such  as solubility, sulphated ash, loss on drying, heavy metals),

The non-compendial methods such as the method used for related substances and pioglitazone content have been adequately described and validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.

The active substance specification has been appropriately justified and found acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Batch Analysis

Batch analysis data have been provided for 4 batches of Pioglitazone hydrochloride.  All results are within the specifications and are acceptable.

## Container Closure System

The  active  substance  is  packed  in  two  low  density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags  inside  a  carton  drum. Specifications  have  been  provided  for  the  LDPE  bags  including  the  IR  spectra.  The  Certificates  of Analysis  confirms  that  they  comply  with  the  specifications.  A  statement  confirming  compliance  with Directive 2002/72/ EC as amended and the Ph. Eur. Monograph on olefins has also been provided.

## Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  three  production  scale  batches  under  ICH  conditions  (24 months at 25°C/60% RH, 12 months at 30°C/65% RH and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH). Photostability testing has also been carried out.

Tests  for  stability  testing  include:  appearance,  loss  on  drying,  Pioglitazone  content  and  related substances.  This is acceptable as these are the stability indicating parameters.

No increase in impurities has been observed and no significant change were noticed. Results indicate that  Pioglitazone  hydrochloride  complies  with  the  end-of-shelf  life  specifications  under  all  tested storage conditions

The available stability data support a justified retest period, with no special storage conditions.

## 2.2.3 Finished Medicinal  Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The drug product is presented as white to almost white round tablets with bevelled edges. The three different strengths (15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg) are differentiated by the size of the tablets and strengths 15 mg and 45 mg by engravings.

.

The formulation contains pioglitazone hydrochloride as the active substance and the following common compendial excipients: lactose monohydrate (diluent), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), hydroxypropylcellulose (binder), magnesium stearate (lubricant).

The development of the formulation has been adequately described.

During the development, in comparison to the reference product, carmellose calcium was replaced by croscarmellose sodium and hyprolose by hypromellose. Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been demonstrated and confirmed during ICH stability studies.

The tablets are kept in blisters made of OPA/AL/PVC foil and aluminium foil inside a printed carton

## Manufacture of the product

During the formulation development both direct compression and wet granulation were compared and wet granulation selected since it was found to give better physical properties.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The qualitative and quantitative composition of the 15mg, 30mg and 45mg tablets is the same with the same ratio between active ingredient and all the excipients. The manufacturer and the manufacturing process are the same for all strengths.

The  effect  of  particle  size  was  investigated.  Dissolution  profiles  of  batches  manufactured  using pioglitazone of different particle sizes were compared to the bioequivalence test and reference products and similar profiles were observed.

Comparative dissolution studies have been conducted against the reference product  in three different pH. All strengths showed a dissolution of 85% in 15 min. The results were satisfactory and showed the similarity of dissolution profiles between the tested product and the reference product. The release and shelf  life  specification  are  set  based  on  the  dissolution  data  of  the  biobatches.  A  biowaiver  was requested for all strengths in accordance with the 'Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence' (CPMP/QWP/EWP/EWP/1401/98 rev 1) and it was agreed that the criteria were fulfilled to grant this biowaiver.

The choice of the container closure system was adequately justified and stability results indicate that the packaging material is suitable for this finished product.

The impurity profile in the test product was compared against those of the reference product and found comparable. Results were within the specification in line with ICH thresholds. The impurity levels seen in both products were very low and the results obtained for the test products are not higher than those observed in the reference products. All impurities found in Pioglitazone Krka have been qualified and present no toxicological concern in the levels observed.

## Description of the manufacturing process and process control

The  manufacturing  process  is  relatively  simple  and  consists  of  mixing  of  excipients,  granulation  of excipients, addition of active substance and disintegrant, mixing with lubricant and compression.

A  flow  chart  detailing  the  different  steps  is  provided.  In-process  controls  are  performed  on  the  dry granulate, the compression mixture and the tablets following compression.

Sufficient information has been provided on the equipment used and the manufacturing conditions.

Information is also provided on the packaging process. Blister tightness is controlled using the vacuum test. The information on the packaging process is acceptable.

## Controls of critical steps and intermediates

Three critical steps have been identified (granulate, compression mixture and compressed tablets) and adequate controls put in place. The critical steps cover all of the parameters relevant for immediate release tablets.

## Process validation

Process validation has been satisfactorily performed on three pilot scale batches of each strength. Content uniformity in the compression mixture and parameters related to the tabletting process were investigated.

The results were in line with the pre-defined criteria and were acceptable. A validation protocol has been provided and is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Control of Excipients

All  excipients  used  in  the  manufacture  of  pioglitazone  hydrochloride  tablets  comply  with  their respective Ph. Eur. monographs Satisfactory certificates of analysis have been provided.

Statements  have  been  provided  from  all  suppliers  certifying  that  the  milk  is  sourced  from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption and that the lactose  complies  with  the  note  for  guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products (EMEA/410/01 rev2). Lactose monohydrate is not considered to pose a TSE risk.

A statement has also been provided to confirm that magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin.

The  primary  packaging  for  the  bulk  product  is  polyethylene  bags.  Compliance  with  food contact requirements has been confirmed.

## Stability of the product

Stability testing was performed on three pilot scale batches of each strength kept in the commercial packaging. The batches were kept under long-term conditions (up to 60 months at 25±2°C/60±5% RH) and  under  accelerated  conditions  (6  months  at  40±2°C/75±5%  RH).    The  testing  conditions  and intervals were according to ICH Q1A (R2).

The  following  parameters  were  tested  during  stability  studies:  appearance,  pioglitazone  content, related substances, water content (for information), hardness (for information), dissolution, microbiological  purity.  The  analytical  methods  were  the  same  as  those  used  for  the  control  of  the finished product.

All results comply with the specification and no trends have been observed. No impurities have been detected above the reporting limit

Based on the stability data, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.'

## 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance pioglitazone and drug product  have  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the clinic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  Data  has  been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

## 2.3 Non- Clinical aspects

A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need  to  generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

## Ecotoxicity/ environmental risk assessment

No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the introduction  of  Piogliatazone  Krka  tablets  manufactured  by  Krka,  d.d.,  Novo  mesto  is  considered unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  pioglitazone containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## 2.4.1 Introduction

This is an application for oral tablets containing pioglitazone. To support the marketing authorisation application  the  applicant  conducted  one  bioequivalence  study  with  cross-over  design  under  fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well  as  efficacy  and  safety  of  pioglitazone  based  on  published  literature;  this  was  considered acceptable. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

No  formal  scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP  was  given  for  this  medicinal  product.  For  the  clinical assessment Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1 )  in  its current version is of particular relevance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Exemption

As this marketing authorisation application for pioglitazone, manufactured by KRKA, d.d., Novo mesto, Slovenia is based on the 'essential similarity' claim, the applicant has performed a clinical study to establish  the  bioequivalence  of  Pioglitazone  45  mg  tablets,  produced  by  KRKA  d.d.  and  a  reference formulation of pioglitazone produced by Takeda. For additional strengths, i.e. Pioglitazone hydrochloride 15 mg tablets and Pioglitazone hydrochloride 30 mg tablets, a biowaiver was claimed based on the justification presented in the dossier and based on the following criteria:

- The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process
- The qualititative composition of the different strengths is the same

- The composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional, i.e. the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance is the same for all strengths

-  Appropriate in  vitro dissolution  data  should  confirm  the  adequacy  of  waiving  additional in  vivo bioequivalence testing

The selection of the 45 mg dose to establish bioequivalence is in line with the Questions and Answers on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  guideline  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006,  which  in  general recommends  performance  of  the  bioequivalence  study  at  the  highest  strength.  In  addition  clinical safety concerns do not prevent the use of the highest strength in healthy volunteers. The biowaiver was granted for the lower strengths.

## Clinical studies

To support the application, the applicant has submitted one single bioequivalence study (study code 09-267).

## 2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics

## Methods

## Study design

The study was 'laboratory-blinded', randomised, single-dose with a 2 period 2 sequence cross-over design  and  was  performed  in  healthy  male  volunteers  under  fasting  conditions  to  evaluate  and compare the relative bioavailability and therefore the bioequivalence of two different formulations of pioglitazone.  Male  subjects,  aged  18  -  55  with  a  body  mass  index  within  18.5  and  29  kg/m 2  were studied.

A single oral dose 45 mg of each formulation was administered to subjects after an overnight fast in each  period  in  a  total  of  two  periods . Subjects  were  administered  60ml  of  25%  glucose  solution approximately 1,2 and 4 hours after dosing to minimise hypoglycaemic effects.

The  tested  bioequivalence  was  based  on  plasma  drug  levels  analysis  of  pioglitazone.  Individual concentrations  of  pioglitazone  and  the  metabolite  were  measured  in  plasma. Blood  samples  were withdrawn pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours post-dose, after each administration.

There  was  a  14  calendar  days  wash-out  between  the  two  periods  (corresponding  to  more  than  10 times the expected half lives of the substances to be measured).

The  open  labelled,  cross  over,  single  dose  design  is  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  A  fasting study is appropriate and in accordance with the current bioequivalence guidelines CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 as there is no food effect. The washout period was sufficient long. Also the sampling frequency was sufficient. The sampling was planned to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of absorption of pioglitazone as well as the terminal half life and to ensure that AUCt was a least 80% of the AUC extrapolated to infinity.

The selection of the highest dosage strength is in agreement with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1,  which  in  general  recommends  performance  of bioequivalence study at the highest strength. In addition, clinical safety concerns do not prevent the use of the highest strength in healthy volunteers.

The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant.

## Test and reference products

The  bioavailability  of  Pioglitazone  45  mg  tablets    further  on  referred  to  as  test  formulation,  was assessed in  comparison to the reference product Actos (pioglitazone) 45 mg tablets, manufactured by Takeda Ireland Limited, Ireland and obtained on the EU market

## Population studied

Male volunteers, non or ex-smokers, of at least 18 years of age but not older than 55 years with a BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 and below 29kg/m2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Out of 40 subjects enrolled, 38 have concluded both treatment periods and were analysed, while 2 subjects  withdrew  their  consent  during  the  study.  These  two  drop  outs  were  not  due  to  medical reasons.

The population studied is considered adequate by CHMP.

The exclusion and inclusion criteria are acceptable and in line with the requirements of the 'Guideline on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence'  (Doc.  Ref.:  CPMP/QWP/  EWP/1401/98  Rev.1,  20  January 2010).

## Analytical methods

The  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  according  to  the  CPMP  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of bioequivalence. Plasma samples obtained in the bioequivalence study were analysed for pioglitazone and hydroxy pioglitazone by a validated LC-MS/MS in one analytical run.

For both analytes calibration curve was linear in the applied concentration range.

A comparison of the measured quality control sample (QCs) values with the nominal concentrations was used for the estimation of analytical precision and accuracy.

The  results  were  considered  to  represent  an  acceptable  level  of  method  repeatability  during  the present bioequivalence study.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

On the basis of individual plasma concentration/time profiles pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax, kel and t1/2 for both analytes, AUCt and AUCi for pioglitazone and AUC0-72h for M-IV were determined for both formulations.

Test for bioequivalence included an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for AUCt, AUCi and Cmax parameters of pioglitazone and AUC0-72h and Cmax parameters of M-IV and followed by the calculation of the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of test/reference means.

The Pharmacokinetic variables were considered appropriate by the CHMP.

## Statistical methods

. On the basis of individual plasma concentration/time profiles pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax, kel and t1/2 for both analytes, AUCt and AUCi for pioglitazone and AUC0-72h for M-IV were determined for both formulations

Test for bioequivalence included an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for AUCt, AUCi and Cmax parameters of pioglitazone and AUC0-72h and Cmax parameters of M-IV and followed by the calculation of the 90% confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  test/reference  means.  The  data  was  ln-transformed  prior  to analysis. A non-parametric test was used for the untransformed tmax parameter.

Statistical  inference  of  pioglitazone  was  based  on  a  bioequivalence  approach  using  the  following standards:  The  ratio  of  geometric  LS  means  with  corresponding  90%  confidence  interval  calculated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from the exponential of the difference between the test and reference product for the ln-transformed parameters  Cmax  and  AUCt  should  all  be  within  the  80.00  to  125.00%  bioequivalence  range. Pharmacokinetic data for M-IV were presented for information purposes only.

The statistical evaluation was considered appropriate by the CHMP.

## Results

Out of 40 subjects enrolled, 38 have concluded both treatment periods and were analysed, while 2 subjects  withdrew  their  consent  during  the  study.  These  two  drop  outs  were  not  due  to  medical reasons.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no significant protocol deviations. There were 37 blood sampling deviations but it is stated that for deviations greater than or equal to 2 minutes, it is stated that they were adjusted to reflect actual sampling time. Deviations were mostly 3 - 5 minutes but individual deviations of up to 18, 21, 26 and 41 minutes were notedThe mean Cmax were respectively 1264.8 ng/mL and 1282.6 ng/mL for the test and reference formulations and the test to reference Cmax ratio of geometric LSmeans was 93.925 (90% CI: 84.10 to 104.89%).

The  mean  AUCt  were  respectively  1436.7ng.h/mL  and  16163.9ng.h/mL  for  the  test  and  reference formulations. The test to reference AUCt ratio of geometric LSmeans was 86.58% (90%CI: 80.23 to 93.43%).

The results therefore confirmed that the test formulation is bioequivalent to Actos.

## Safety data

There were twenty nine adverse events recorded during the study in fourteen subjects. The incidence of the events  and  their  profile  did  not  indicate  any  significant  differences  between  the  two formulations. There were no cases of hypoglycaemia.

Four possibly drug related adverse events (constipation, a sensation of fever and two cases of nausea) were unexpected. There were no cases of serious adverse events.

## Conclusions

The  applicant  has  performed  an  appropriate  pharmacokinetic  study  in  38  male  subjects  The  study design was appropriate with an acceptable wash out period. The chosen strength is appropriate.

Inclusion exclusion criteria were appropriate. Timing of samples was acceptable.

The pharmacokinetic parameters chosen are in accord with the recommendations of the bioequivalence guidance.

Two subjects withdrew for personal reasons and both received Actos 45mg in period 1.

There were no significant protocol deviations.

The  mean  Cmax  were  respectively  1264.8  ng/mL  and  1282.6  ng/mL  for  the  test  and  reference formulations and the test to reference Cmax ratio of geometric LSmeans was 93.925 (90% CI: 84.10 to 104.89%)

The  mean  AUCt  were  respectively  1436.7ng.h/mL  and  16163.9ng.h/mL  for  the  test  and  reference formulations. The test to reference AUCt ratio of geometric LSmeans was 86.58% (90% CI: 80.23 to 93.43%).

The results therefore suggest that the test formulation is bioequivalent to Actos.

Based on the presented bioequivalence study Pioglitazone Krka is considered bioequivalent with Actos.

The applicant has provided an appropriate request for biowaiver.

The  results  of  study  09-267  (study  code)  with  45mg  formulation  can  be  extrapolated  to  other strengths 15 and 30 mg,  according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 4.1.6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics

No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this application.

## 2.4.4 Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

## 2.4.5 Discussion on Clinical aspects

The results of study 09-267 (study code) suggest that the test formulation is bioequivalent to Actos.

## 2.4.6 Conclusions on clinical aspects

The  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  pioglitazone  in  the  indication  claimed  for  Pioglitazone  Krka  (i.e. treatment of type 2 diabetes) is well known and no additional clinical studies are needed.

A bioequivalence study was conducted and confirmed that the test product (pioglitazone 45 mg tablets, manufactured  by  Krka  d.d.)  is  bioequivalent  to  the  Reference  formulation  (Actos  45  mg  tablets, manufactured by Takeda Ireland Limited, Ireland) with respect to rate and extent of availability.

The recommended dosage and method of administration of the generic product Pioglitazone Krka 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg tablets is the same as that recommended for the reference product Glustin 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg tablets.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The applicant did not submit a risk management plan because this application concerns a generic for a reference medicinal product for which no safety concern requiring additional risk minimisation activities had been identified when the Marketing Authorisation application was submitted on 27 October 2010. However  taking  into  account  the  outcome  of  the  Article  20  procedure  on  already  authorised pioglitazone  containing  products  and  the  potential  increased  risk  of  bladder  cancer,  the  MAH  shall submit within one month of the Commission Decision a risk management plan which will incorporate risk  minimisation measures, as detailed in the conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective  use  of  the  medicinal  product  in  Annex  II,,in  line  with  those  required  for  the  reference medicinal product.

The MAH shall perform the Pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, to be agreed in the Risk Management Plan to be submitted and any consequent updates to the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal product for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next PSUR.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

-When  new  information is received that may  impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities

- Within 60 days of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
- At the request of the European Medicines Agency

## PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product Glustin, which is on a 6 monthly cycle, having 1 August 2011 as its data lock point.

## 2.6 User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3 Benefit-Risk Balance

This application concerns a generic version of pioglitazone oral tablets. The reference product Glustin is indicated as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described below:

## as monotherapy

in  adult  patients  (particularly  overweight  patients)  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance;

## as dual oral therapy in combination with

a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated,  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  monotherapy with a sulphonylurea;

Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult patients with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  on  insulin  for  whom  metformin  is  inappropriate  because  of contraindications or intolerance.

After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response,  pioglitazone  should  be  discontinued.  In  light  of  potential  risks  with  prolonged  therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained (see section 4.4).

No nonclinical studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary of the available  nonclinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was  presented  and  considered  sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview  on  these  clinical  aspects  based  on  information  from  published  literature  was  considered sufficient.

The pivotal basis forms a bioequivalence study with a 'laboratory-blinded', randomised, single-dose with a 2 period 2 sequence cross-over design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the  bioequivalence  of  this  formulation  and  was  in  line  with  the  respective  European  requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

The test formulation of Pioglitazone 45 mg tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Actos 45 mg tablets. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0- , and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, the available data on the chosen reference  medicinal  product  Glustin  and  the  outcome  of  the  Article  20  procedure  on  the  already authorised pioglitazone containing products and the potential increased risk of bladder cancer, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information as per the conditions of the Marketing Authorisation included in Annex II.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4 Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy and taking into account the opinions adopted by the CHMP on 21 July 2011 and 20 October 2011 in the framework of the procedures under Article 20 of Regulation 726/2004 for pioglitazone containing medicinal products and the subsequent Commission  Decision,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Pioglitazone Krka  is  favourable  as  second  or  third  line  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## Risk Management System and PSUR cycle

The MAH shall submit within one month of the Commission Decision a risk management plan which will incorporate risk minimisation measures, as detailed below, in line with those required for the reference medicinal product.

The MAH shall perform the Pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, to be agreed in the Risk Management Plan to be submitted and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

-When  new  information is received that may  impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities

- Within 60 days of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
- At the request of the European Medicines Agency

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product.

Prior to distribution of the prescriber guide in each Member State, the MAH must agree the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  material,  together  with  a  communication  plan,  with  the national competent authority.

-  This educational pack is aimed at strengthening awareness of important identified risks of bladder cancer and heart failure and the overall recommendations intended to optimise the benefit-risk margin at the patient level.
-  The physician educational pack should contain: The Summary of Product Characteristics, package leaflet, and a Prescriber Guide.

The Prescriber Guide should highlight the following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Patient selection criteria including that Pioglitazone should not be used as first line therapy and emphasising the need for regular review of treatment benefit.
-  The risk of bladder cancer and relevant risk minimisation advice.
-  The risk of heart failure and relevant risk minimisation advice.
-  Caution in use in the elderly in light of age related risks (in particular bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pioglitazone Krka (EMEA/H/C/002453)

## Divergent statement

We have a divergent position from the above mentioned positive opinion recommending granting of Marketing Authorisation from that which has been readopted by the CHMP during its January 2012 session:

We consider that the benefit-risk balance of pioglitazone has become negative given the increased risk of bladder cancer in addition to the other well known adverse effects (especially heart failure and bone fracture in post menopausal women) of this medicine, its questionable long term benefit in terms of cardiovascular protection and the available alternative treatments in type 2 diabetic patients.

1. Pre-clinical data indicate an increased frequency of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone in male rats. Results of the PROactive trial show a significantly higher number of bladder cancer in patients treated with pioglitazone. Data provided by three epidemiologic studies (US, France and UK) provide very similar evidence of an increased risk of bladder cancer, even though the magnitude of such risk is low with a hazard ratio around 1.2, however, likely increasing with cumulative dose and duration of pioglitazone exposure.
2. This increased risk of bladder cancer includes invasive types of bladder cancer with major adverse impact on morbidity and mortality. No biomarker of bladder cancer is available which could provide effective screening and early treatment. Symptoms such as haematuria can occur late after the onset of tumour development and are not specific. Cystoscopy appears to be the only investigational procedure able to adequately establish the diagnosis of bladder cancer but its invasive nature precludes is use for systematic cancer screening.

It appears impossible to define a subpopulation of diabetic patients where the benefits of pioglitazone would outweigh its risks. In addition, according to PROactive long term follow up and utilisation studies, a large proportion of patients stop pioglitazone treatment within the first years of treatment precluding potential long term benefit on prevention of cardiovascular events. The identified increased bladder cancer risk is likely to reduce adherence to pioglitazone long term treatment.
