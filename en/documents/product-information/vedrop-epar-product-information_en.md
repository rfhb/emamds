## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Vedrop 50 mg/ml oral solution

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 50 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol, in the form of tocofersolan, corresponding to 74.5 IU of tocopherol.

## Excipients:

Each ml contains 6 mg sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), 4 mg sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E215) and 0.18 mmoles (4.1 mg) of sodium.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Oral solution.

Slightly viscous, pale yellow solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Vedrop is indicated in vitamin E deficiency due to digestive malabsorption in paediatric patients with congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis, from birth (full term newborns) up to 18 years of age.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

The treatment with Vedrop should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients suffering from congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis.

Bioavailability of vitamin E from Vedrop differs from that of other medicinal products. The dose should be prescribed in mg of d-alpha-tocopherol in the form of tocofersolan. Plasma vitamin E level should be monitored monthly for at least the first few months of therapy, thereafter at regular intervals and the dose adjusted accordingly if necessary.

## Posology

The recommended total daily dose in paediatric patients suffering from congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis is 0.34 ml/kg/day (17 mg/kg of d-alpha-tocopherol in the form of tocofersolan). The dose should be prescribed in ml.

The dose should be adjusted according to plasma vitamin E level.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To calculate the dose of Vedrop to be administered, divide the prescribed dose of d-alpha-tocopherol (in mg) by 50. The result is the volume of Vedrop in ml:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The following table gives the volume of oral solution in function of patients' weights.

|   Weight (kg) |   Oral solution volume (ml) |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
|             3 |                         1   |
|             4 |                         1.4 |
|             5 |                         1.7 |
|             6 |                         2   |
|             7 |                         2.4 |
|             8 |                         2.7 |
|             9 |                         3.1 |
|            10 |                         3.4 |
|            15 |                         5.1 |

## Special populations

Hepatic or renal impairment

Experience with tocofersolan therapy in patients with renal impairment or underlying liver impairment has demonstrated no need to adapt the dose regimen of Vedrop (see section 4.4).

## Method of administration

Vedrop is administered orally with or without water. The 1-ml or 2-ml oral syringes included in the container are designed to assist in measuring out the exact dose in accordance with the prescribed posology.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Vedrop must not be used in preterm newborn infants.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

As large doses of vitamin E have been reported to increase bleeding tendency in vitamin-K deficient patients or those taking oral anti-vitamins K treatment, it is therefore recommended to monitor the prothrombin time and international normalised ratio (INR). A possible adjustment of the dose of oral anticoagulant during and after treatment with Vedrop may be necessary.

As data on patients with renal impairment are limited, Vedrop should be administered with caution and under close monitoring of the renal function in patients with renal impairment e.g. dehydrated patients (see section 4.2).

Vedrop should be administered with caution in patients with underlying liver impairment and under close monitoring of the hepatic functions in such patients (see section 4.2).

Vedrop contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E215) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product contains sodium. It should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.

## 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

It is recommended to monitor the coagulation function when administered with anti-vitamins K treatment (see section 4.4).

Due to inhibition of P-Glycoprotein transporter, tocofersolan may also enhance intestinal absorption of other concomitant fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) or that of highly lipophilic medicinal products (such as steroids, antibiotics, antihistamines, cyclosporine, tacrolimus). Therefore, monitoring should be performed and, when necessary, doses should be adjusted.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

For tocofersolan no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tocofersolan is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of tocofersolan in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Vedrop should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of tocofersolan therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

No data is available

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Vedrop has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reaction during treatment is diarrhoea.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Large vitamin E doses may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. In case of overdose, a symptomatic treatment should be proposed.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vitamins, Other plain vitamin preparations; ATC code: A11HA08

Vitamin E is the principal lipo-soluble antioxidant in the organism. It acts as a free radical chain breaking molecule, stopping the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and it is involved in maintaining the stability and integrity of cell membranes.

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The active substance d-alpha-tocopherol-polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (tocofersolan) is a pro-drug; the active metabolite is the d-alpha-tocopherol. At low concentrations, tocofersolan forms micelles which enhance absorption of non-polar lipids such as fat-soluble vitamins. Its critical micellar concentration is low (0.04 to 0.06 mmol/l).

The hydrolysis of tocofersolan occurs in the gut lumen. Taken up by cells, the alpha-tocopherol moiety appears in chylomicrons in the lymph in a manner identical to vitamin E absorbed from the diet. Cellular uptake does not require receptors, binding proteins or metabolic processes and does not occur by pinocytosis. Absorption of deuterated tocofersolan showed a normal pattern in lipoproteins: alphatocopherol peaked first in chylomicrons, then in very low- density lipoproteins (VLDL) and finally in lowdensity lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and the disappearance portions of the curves paralleled those in control subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A study in 12 healthy volunteers compared tocofersolan with a water-miscible reference vitamin E after a single oral loading dose of 1200 IU. The relative bioavailability of tocofersolan tended to be higher (Frel of 1.01 ± 1.74) with AUC0-t of 0.383 ± 0.203µM.h/mg, Cmax of 0.013 ± 0.006, tmax of 6.0 h (6.0 - 24.0), and t1/2 of 29.7 h (16.0 - 59.5).

In a similar study tocofersolan showed a higher bioavailability than a water-miscible reference vitamin E in paediatric patients with chronic cholestasis (n=6), absorption was significantly higher on both plasma concentration maximum increase (p=0.008) and AUC (p=0.0026).

## Distribution

Located principally on cell membranes, within mitochondria and microsomes, vitamin E is ubiquitously distributed (red blood cells, brain, muscle, liver, platelets) and fat tissues are its major reservoir.

## Elimination

Vitamin E is mainly eliminated in the bile (75%) and stools, either as free tocopherol or as oxidized forms. Urine represents a minor elimination route of vitamin E (as glucuro-conjugate).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data in the literature reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Vedrop is and what it is used for

Vedrop contains vitamin E (in the form of tocofersolan). It is used to treat lack of vitamin E due to digestive malabsorption (where nutrients from the food are not easily absorbed during digestion) in patients from birth (full term newborns) up to 18 years of age suffering from chronic cholestasis (a hereditary or congenital disease where bile cannot flow from the liver to the intestine).

## 2. What you need to know before you take Vedrop

## Do not take Vedrop

- if you are allergic to vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- Vedrop must not be used in newborn premature babies.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before taking Vedrop if you have:

-  Problems with your kidney or dehydration. Vedrop should be used with caution and your kidney function closely monitored, because polyethylene glycol, part of the active substance tocofersolan, may damage your kidneys.
-  Problems with your liver. Vedrop should be used with caution and liver functions closely monitored.

## Other medicines and Vedrop

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:

-  Certain medicines to thin the blood (oral anticoagulants such as warfarin). Your doctor will ask you to perform blood tests regularly and may adjust their dose to avoid higher risk of bleeding.
-  Fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A, D, E or K) or highly fat-soluble medicines (such as corticoids, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, antihistamine). As Vedrop may increase their absorption during digestion, your doctor will monitor the treatment effect and adjust the doses if necessary.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

No clinical data are available on exposure to this medicine during pregnancy. Inform your doctor if you are pregnant as he/she will decide if the medicine may be used.

There is no data on whether or not this medicine is present in the breast milk. Inform your doctor if you want to breast-feed. Your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine..

## Driving and using machines

Vedrop is not likely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.

Vedrop contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E215) , which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

Vedrop contains 0.18 mmoles (4.1 mg) sodium per ml. Speak to your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet.

## 3. How to take Vedrop

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

The usual dose is 0.34 ml/kg/day.

Your doctor will prescribe the dose in ml.

The dose will be adjusted by your doctor according to your vitamin E blood level.

## Method of administration

Swallow the solution with or without water. Use only with the oral syringe provided in the box.

You can take Vedrop before or during your meal, with or without water.

To measure the dose:

1- Open the bottle.

2- Put the oral syringe included in the pack in the bottle.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3-Fill the oral syringe with the liquid by pulling the plunger up to the graduation mark corresponding to the quantity in millilitres (ml) prescribed by your doctor.

- 4- Remove the oral syringe from the bottle.
- 5- Empty the contents of the syringe by pushing the plunger to the bottom either:
- directly into the mouth,

or

- into a glass of water and then drink the entire content of the glass.
- 6- Close the bottle.
- 7- Wash the syringe with water.

## If you take more Vedrop than you should

If you take large doses of Vitamin E, you may experience temporary diarrhoea and stomach ache. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if symptoms persist more than two days.

## If you forget to take Vedrop

Skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Vedrop

Do not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor because lack of vitamin E may come back and affect your health. Contact your doctor or pharmacist before stopping.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
