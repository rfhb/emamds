- The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 27 December 2013.

· The Rapporteur circulated an updated Assessment Report addressing the comments from CHMP members and applicant clarifications on 20 January 2014. · During the meeting on 23 January 2014, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation to Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction The  application  for  Rivastigmine  3M  Health  Care  Ltd,  4.6mg/24  hours,  and  9.5  mg/24  hours, transdermal patches is a duplicate to the product, Rivastigmine Actavis 4.6mg/24 hours, and 9.5 mg/24 hours.  Rivastigmine Actavis however, is also authorised as 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 4.5 mg and 6 mg  hard  capsules.  Rivastigmine  Actavis  was  authorised  as  a  generic  application  according  to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC in the centralised procedure. The indication for Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd transdermal patches is the same as the reference medicinal product: symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd is presented in the form of transdermal patches containing rivastigmine base. The patches are packed in heat-sealed pouches made of paper/aluminium/acrylonitrile-methacrylate copolymer laminate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The composition is described in section 6.1. of the SmPC

## 2.2.2. Active substance

The chemical name of rivastigmine is 3-[(1S)-1-(dimethylamino)ethyl]phenyl ethyl(methyl) carbamate and has the following structure:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Rivastigmine base is a colourless or slightly yellowish transparent liquid which is very soluble in several organic solvents and slightly soluble in water. The molecular structure of rivastigmine has been  confirmed  by  FT-IR,  MS, 13 C-NMR,  1 H-NMR  and  elemental  analysis.  The  Rivastigmine's structure presents a chiral centre. The (S) enantiomer is consistently synthesised.  The active substance does not exhibit polymorphism.

Batch analysis data of seven full scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. Manufacture The synthetic process of the active substance Rivastigmine involves three chemical transformations and is using well characterised starting materials. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual, Identification (IR, HPLC, water (KF), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur), heavy metals (Ph. Eur),  related  substances  (HPLC),  enantiomeric  purity  (HPLC),  potentiometrical  assay  on  the anhydrous basis (Ph. Eur) and  residual solvents (GC). The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Stability

Stability  studies  under  ICH  conditions  have  been  conducted  on  6  production  and  pilot  scale batches from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market. Studies were performed for 36 months under long term conditions at 5°C±3°C, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 25°C, 60% RH according to the  ICH  guidelines.  This  was  presented  in  the  ASMF.  The  test  parameters  evaluated  in  these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies were appearance, water content, related substances by HPLC, assay by potentiometry, and enantiomeric purity by HPLC.

Forced degradation studies were performed by treatment with heat (110°C for 24 hours), under acidic and alkaline conditions, under oxidizing conditions as well as under light stress conditions.

During long-term and accelerated stability studies the active substance is stable.

The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  is  sufficiently  stable  and  justify  the proposed retest period.

2.2.3. Finished medicinal product Pharmaceutical development The  objective  of  the  development  of  the  finished  product  was  to  develop  a  transdermal rivastigmine  system  that  is  bioequivalent  to  the  transdermal  patch  of  the  reference  medicinal product. During formulation development different modifications of the formulation were evaluated. Both, in vitro and in vivo proof of concept clinical trials (POC BE study I, PoC BE study II, Pivotal BE/A and SI study I and PoC BE study III) were performed before the final formulation was tested and found bioequivalent in a bioequivalence study (BE study C11-1612) with a pilot scale batch. The  formulation  efforts  sought  to  load  rivastigmine  with  comparable  total  active  substance amounts  to  see  if  the  acrylate  copolymer  adhesives  could  accommodate  the  required  active substance loading while retaining suitable skin adhesion properties. Since the reference patch did not  require  the  use  of  permeation  enhancing  or  solubilising  excipients  for  meeting  delivery requirements, compositions without these excipients were initially explored. A  formulation  without  additional  excipients  was  developed  and  used  in  a  pivotal  BE/A  and  SI study I. This formulation was found to match reference product in PK and SI but failed adhesion. The  product  was  reformulated  with  the  addition  of  an  excipient  as  a  tackifier  to  increase  the adhesion of the product while leaving the PK of the product unchanged. The excipients used in the final formulation comply with compendial requirements. In vitro test methods were also used during the development, checking the permeation and also physical tests such as Tack, 180° peel from steel, release from liner and shear/creep compliance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary packaging is stated in the SmPC and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the product.  The material complies with Ph Eur and EC requirements, and the choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the transdermal patch.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd is satisfactorily described, and it has  been  clearly  detailed  in  flow-chart  diagrams.  The  manufacturing  process  is  typical  of transdermal patches.

The  manufacturing  process  is  performed  in  three  steps.  The  steps  consist  of  mixing  the components  in  order  to  create  the  active  formulation,  the  coating  and  the  creation  of  the patches.

Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this pharmaceutical form. The  production  process  is  performed  in  compliance  with  the  principle  of  Good  Manufacturing Practices. The batch analysis data shows that the transdermal patches can be manufactured reproducibly according  to  the  agreed  finished  product  specification,  which  is  suitable  for  control  of  this pharmaceutical form. Product specification The product specification includes as appropriate parameters for the dosage and pharmaceutical form.  Validations  of  the  analytical  procedures  have  been  presented.  The  results  of  the  batch analysis presented show that the finished product meets the proposed specification. The release and shelf life specification of the finish product contains test with suitable limits for appearance  (visual,  identification  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC), related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  microbiology  (Ph.  Eur).  The  acceptance  criteria and test methods are justified. Batch analysis results are provided for seven full scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Stability of the product Stability studies were performed under ICH conditions. Stability data is presented for 7 batches for 12 months at 25 °C / 60% RH and 30 °C / 65% RH, and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH. The batches of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Medicinal product no longer authorised

All data meet the specification limits at all-time points and no trends were observed except for a slight increase of release from liner.

The proposed shelf life as indicated in the SmPC with no special temperature storage condition is found acceptable.

According  to  the  draft  monograph  on  rivastigmine,  the  active  substance  is  light  sensitive.  No photostability testing of the patches has been performed. Since the finished product is packaged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in heat-sealed pouches consisting of an aluminium foil among other constituents, it is considered acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of this new pharmaceutical form has been presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical  performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd manufactured by 3M Health Care Ltd is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all rivastigmine containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the Environmental Risk is expected to be similar and not increased. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.3. Discussion and Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  Rivastigmine  transdermal  patch  and  it  is  a duplicate pharmaceutical  form  of Rivastigmine Actavis patch.  To  support  the  marketing authorisation application the applicant refers to one bioequivalence study, Study C11-1612.

## GCP

The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial, conducted outside the community, was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics Methods Study design The  study  was  a  randomised,  single-application  and  multiple-application,  two-way  open-label crossover relative bioavailability  and  adhesion  study.  38  non-smoking  male  and  female volunteers were included. Each treatment period was 7 days, and on day 1 as well as day 3-7 a patch was applied on the upper back after an overnight fast and was removed after 24 hours. There was a 7-days washout between the periods. The patches were applied on the upper back, and each new patch was positioned approximately 2  cm  from  the  previous.  The  patches  in  period  2  were  aligned  2  cm  below  the  first  series  of patches. The subjects were not allowed to bath/shower or apply heat/cold to the application site. Blood  sample collections were obtained within 15 minutes prior to patch application (0 hour) on Day 1, and Days 3-7, and after patch application at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 36 hours on Day 1-2 and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hours on Day 7.  A total of 41 blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis per study period for a total of 82 samples or 492 mL total blood volume. Samples were cooled on ice-bath, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and plasma aliquots were mixed with eserine  solution  (1:1,  conc  1  μg/mL)  and  vortexed.  The  samples  were  frozen  at  -70  °C (maximum time from sample collection 1.5 h) and shipped frozen to the analytical facility. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Adherence was judged by an evaluator according to a 5-grade scale just after application and before  removal  of  each  patch.  On  day  1,  adherence  was  also  evaluated  at  7  additional  time points. Local tolerability and skin appearance was monitored before each administration and 0.5 and 12 h after removal of each patch.

Specificity was shown employing 7 independent sources of human plasma. Sensitivity at the limit of  quantification,  100  pg/ml,  was  shown.  Satisfactory  between-  and  within-run  accuracy  and precision  was  shown  for  low,  medium  and  high  QC  (quality  control)  sample  concentrations. Linearity was demonstrated within the calibration range 100 - 10 000 pg/ml. Dilution integrity for  a  factor  of  10  was  demonstrated.  Stability  in  plasma  was  demonstrated  for  24  h  at  room temperature, for 6 days at - 20 ° C and over 6 freeze-thaw cycles. The clinical summary claims long-term stability in plasma up to 54 days at -20 ° C as well as -70 ° C. Matrix effect was evaluated in 6 lots of blank matrix.

Population studied 38 healthy men and women (10 + 28) were included (7 African Americans, 31 white), mean age was 41 years. Two subjects discontinued due to patch falling off in the multiple-dose part of the study,  and  their  data  were  not  included  in  the  multiple-dose  PK  evaluation.  Data  from  all  38 subjects were used in the single-dose evaluation. Analytical methods Rivastigmine  concentrations  in  eserine  (acetylcholine  esterase  inhibitor)  treated  plasma  were measured  after  a  solid  phase  extraction  procedure  using  a  validated  reversed  phase  liquid chromatography  assay  with  tandem-MS  detection  with  deuterium  labelled  rivastigmine  as internal standard. K2-EDTA was used as an anticoagulant. Pre-study validation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Within-study validation

3087 samples were run in 49 batches. Inter-run precision was ≤4.3% and the mean accuracy ranged from 96.1 to 101.2%. LLOQ (Lower Limit of Quantification) was below 1/20 of average Cmax. About 150 re-assays (5%) were performed, due to measured values above LOQ, raised LLOQ (to Std 2) in the run, high internal standard or extraction error. Incurred sample reanalysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was performed on 220 samples, of which 12 deviated more than 20% from the original value, which is acceptable.

## Pharmacokinetic variables

Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using a standard non-compartmental approach. For the single dose, AUCo-t, AUCo-inf, Cmax, Tmax, Kel and T1/2 was evaluated.  For the multipledose part, AUCτ, Cavg(ss), Cmax (ss), Cmin (ss), Tmax (ss), Flux (fluctuation in % of Cavg) and Swing (fluctuation in % of Cmin).

Statistical methods A  steady-state  evaluation  was  performed  on  pre-dose  concentrations  using  Helmert  contrasts. ANOVA  was  performed  on  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  including  sequence, formulation and period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as the error term. 90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratios  between  geometric  means  were  constructed,  and bioequivalence criteria were 0.8-1.25. Results The results of the bioequivalence studies are presented below. Single dose Bioequivalence was shown both for Cmax and AUC0-t (Table 1). The extrapolated AUC was less than  10% in  all  subjects.  No  pre-dose  concentrations  were  detected  and  no  subjects  reached tmax at the first sampling point. Table 1.

An analysis of the Local Tolerability and Skin Appearance Check results have been provided. The analysis showed no skin appearance with either patch exceeded score 2 (Definite visible erythema) in the dermal response scale. The scores of 1 and 2 tended to be evenly distributed between the two products. From the analysis it can be concluded that the two patches behaved similarly as far as local tolerability and appearance changes were concerned.

The mean score for the test product (1.1; SD 2.2) was somewhat higher than for the reference product (0.9; 1.8), but there was no statistically significant difference between treatments when the  Wilcoxon  Signed  Rank  Test  was  used  for  treatment  comparison  (p=  0.0882).  A  noninferiority test was also performed concluding that Rivastigmine 3M attachment was considered non-inferior to Exelon attachment. No patches detached on day 1, but on day 7, two subjects had detached patches, in both cases it was the test formulation, and detachment occurred at 8-10 h in one subject and at 24 h in the other. 2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented, as no such studies are required for this type of application. 2.4.3. Safety data Overall, considering the limited number of subjects in the study and study design, the AE pattern reported in the study is in line with what could be expected.

## 2.4.4 Discussion on clinical aspects

To  support  this  duplicate  application  the  applicant  submitted  one  single-  and  multiple  dose bioequivalence study on the highest patch strength (9.5 mg/24 h), showing bioequivalence both after  single  dose  application  and  at  steady  state  between  Rivastigmine  3M  Health  Care  Ltd patches and the reference Exelon. The applicant has also submitted data presenting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmaceutical  similarity  between  the  strengths,  as  well  as  adherence  data  for  the  lower strength,  making  it  possible  to  extrapolate  bioequivalence  to  the  lower  patch  strength  (4.6 mg/24 h). In addition, the applicant has provided data on the intra-individual variability of the two formulations in the bioequivalence study, by calculating variability of pre-dose concentrations at steady state. Variability was of the same magnitude for both test and reference.

The  bioequivalence  study  also  included  investigations  on  patch  adherence,  showing  noninferiority to the original Exelon in patch adherence day 1. A study patch adherence of the lower patch  strength  (4.6mg/24h)  was  submitted,  with  similar  results.  A  tendency  towards  higher frequency of slightly detached patches in the test group was seen in both studies, and in the two studies three patches in total detached completely, all of them in the test group. The majority of patches, however, had a good adherence in both studies, and the difference is not considered to be  of  clinical  importance.  The  patch  adhesiveness  is  therefore  considered  similar  between formulations and acceptable.

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

2.4.5 Conclusions on clinical aspects A  summary  of  the  literature  with  regard  to  clinical  data  of  Rivastigmine  3M  Health  Care  Ltd transdermal  patch  and  justifications  that  the  active  substance  does  not  differ  significantly  in properties from the reference product with regards to safety and efficacy, was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guidelines and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary. The results of study C11-1612 with 9.5 mg/24 h formulation can be extrapolated to the other strength applied for (4.6 mg/24 h), according to conditions in the relevant Guidelines. The patch adhesiveness is considered similar between formulations and acceptable. The AE pattern reported in the study is in line with what could be expected. Local tolerability was similar to the original Exelon patch. Based on the presented bioequivalence study Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd 4.6 mg/24h &amp; 9.5 mg/24h transdermal patch is considered bioequivalent with Exelon 4.6 mg/24h &amp; 9.5 mg/24h transdermal patch. 2.5.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  Rivastigmine  transdermal  patch.  The  reference product,  Exelon  patch,  is  indicated  for  'symptomatic  treatment  of  mild  to  moderately  severe Alzheimer's  dementia'.  No  non-clinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this  application  but  an adequate  summary  of  the  available  non-clinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the  active  substance;  the  applicant's  clinical  overview  on  these  clinical  aspects,  based  on information from published literature, was considered sufficient. The  bioequivalence  study  (BE  study  C11-1612)  was  a  randomised,  single-application  and multiple-application,  two-way  open-label  crossover  relative  bioavailability  and  adhesion  study. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was  in  line  with  the  respective  EU  requirements.  Choice  of  dose,  sampling  points,  overall sampling  time,  and  wash-out  period  were  adequate.  The  analytical  method  was  validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test formulation of rivastigmine 3M patch met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Exelon patch. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞ , and  Cmax  were  all contained  within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 4. Recommendation Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd in the treatment of Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia  is favourable and therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following conditions: Medicinal product no longer authorised
