For further information, see section 5.1. 4.3 Contraindications Medicinal product no longer authorised

History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to trace residues (e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

- Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of a similar whole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during a pandemic period. Such reactions occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with no known allergy.

•

- Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed. The Western Blot technique disproves the results. The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine.

· Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to trace residues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. · As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. · If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. · PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. · There are no data with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. · Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. · A protective response may not be induced in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction · PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. · Immunoglobulin is not to be given with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. If it is necessary to provide immediate protection, PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be given at the same time as normal or specific immunoglobulin. Injections of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER and immunoglobulin should be made into separate limbs. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

The safety of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER in pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed in clinical trials. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity.

Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). The use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations. PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be used in lactating women. Health care providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient before administering PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Some undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 such as dizziness and vertigo may affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Adults, older people and special risk groups Clinical trials were conducted with this H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on the H5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3500 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years and 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. The safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is similar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older subjects. Infants, children, and adolescents Children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: In a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were administered the H5N1 vaccine. The incidence and nature of symptoms after the first and second vaccination were similar to those observed in the healthy adults and older subjects. Infants and children aged 6 to 35 months: In a clinical trial the H5N1 vaccine was administered to 36 infants and children aged 6 to 35 months. Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency below. Summary of adverse reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity

Nervous system disorders: convulsion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema

Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: pain in extremity

Trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines The following serious adverse reactions have been reported from post-marketing surveillance with egg-derived interpandemic trivalent vaccines: Uncommon: generalised skin reactions Rare: neuralgia, transient thrombocytopenia Very rare: vasculitis with transient renal involvement. Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01 PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. This section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccine following a two-dose administration. Mock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as 'novel' antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. Adults, older people and special risk groups Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immune response against the vaccine strain contained in PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (A/Vietnam/1203/2004)

The immunogenicity of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004) has been evaluated in three clinical studies in adults aged 18 - 59 years (N=961) and in older subjects aged 60 years and older (N=391) following a 0, 21 day schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, the immunogenicity has also been evaluated in a Phase 3 study in specified risk groups of immunocompromised subjects (N=122) and patients with chronic disease conditions (N=123) following a 0, 21 day schedule.

## Antibody persistence

Antibody persistence after vaccination with the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004) has been evaluated in a clinical study in adults aged 18 - 59 years and subjects aged 60 years and above at 6 months, 12 - 15 months and 24 months after the start of the primary vaccination series. The results indicate an overall decline in antibody levels over time.

## Information from non-clinical studies

The protective efficacy of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER against morbidity and mortality induced by the infection with lethal doses of highly pathogenic avian Influenza

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

H5N1 virus was assessed non-clinically in a ferret challenge model. Two studies have been performed using either the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or the A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine.

In one study, sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated. All ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent H5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. The A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced by full survivorship, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals. All control animals succumbed to the infection.

In a second study, sixty-six ferrets were divided into 6 cohorts of 11 ferrets and were immunized on days 0 and 21 with 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of the Indonesia vaccine or were sham vaccinated. The ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of either the clade 2 H5N1 virus A/Indonesia/05/2005 or the clade 1 H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. The A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence of fever, reduced weight loss, reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia and lymphopenia) changes in the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge. Similarly, the A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was efficacious against a heterologous challenge, showing a vaccine dose-dependent survivorship in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to the control cohort. Similar to the homologous challenge, vaccination against a heterologous challenge reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia) changes associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza infection. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical studies demonstrated minor alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels in a repeat dose toxicity study in rats. Clinically significant alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels have not been seen to date in human clinical studies. Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development parturition or post natal development. Male fertility was not investigated in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, however there were no findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies to indicate any vaccine-related changes to the tissues of the male reproductive tract. 6.

History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to trace residues (e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

- Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of a similar whole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during a pandemic period. Such reactions occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with no known allergy.

•

- Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed. The Western Blot technique disproves the results. The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine.

· Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to trace residues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. · As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. · If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. · PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. · There are no data with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. · Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. · A protective response may not be induced in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction · PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. · Immunoglobulin is not to be given with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. If it is necessary to provide immediate protection, PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be given at the same time as normal or specific immunoglobulin. Injections of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER and immunoglobulin should be made into separate limbs. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

The safety of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER in pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed in clinical trials. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity.

Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). The use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations. PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be used in lactating women. Health care providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient before administering PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Some undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 such as dizziness and vertigo may affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Adults, older people and special risk groups Clinical trials were conducted with this H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on the H5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3500 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years and 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. The safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is similar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older people subjects. Infants, children, and adolescents Children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: In a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were administered the H5N1 vaccine.

Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01 PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. This section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccine following a two-dose administration. Mock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as 'novel' antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.

## Information from non-clinical studies

The protective efficacy of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER against morbidity and mortality induced by the infection with lethal doses of highly pathogenic avian

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Influenza H5N1 virus was assessed non-clinically in a ferret challenge model. Two studies have been performed using either the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or the A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine.

In one study, sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated. All ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent H5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. The A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced by full survivorship, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals. All control animals succumbed to the infection.

In a second study, sixty-six ferrets were divided into 6 cohorts of 11 ferrets and were immunized on days 0 and 21 with 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of the Indonesia vaccine or were sham vaccinated. The ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of either the clade 2 H5N1 virus A/Indonesia/05/2005 or the clade 1 H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. The A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence of fever, reduced weight loss, reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia and lymphopenia) changes in the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge. Similarly, the A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was efficacious against a heterologous challenge, showing a vaccine dose-dependent survivorship in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to the control cohort. Similar to the homologous challenge, vaccination against a heterologous challenge reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia) changes associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza infection. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical studies demonstrated minor alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels in a repeat dose toxicity study in rats. Clinically significant alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels have not been seen to date in human clinical studies. Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development parturition or post natal development. Male fertility was not investigated in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, however there were no findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies to indicate any vaccine-related changes to the tissues of the male reproductive tract. 6.

During a pandemic situation, the resources must be concentrated on a timely and effective monitoring of the safety profile of the influenza vaccines used during the pandemic. Moreover, a 6-monthly cycle may be too long to allow assessment of the safety of a vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time. Therefore, 6-monthly or annual PSURs falling within the pandemic period will be replaced by monthly 'simplified PSURs' (S-PSUR) accompanied by a summary of vaccine distribution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Frequency of submission

- -The clock should start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine.
- -First data-lock point is 30 days later.
- -S-PSUR submission to the Rapporteur and CHMP members on Day 45.
