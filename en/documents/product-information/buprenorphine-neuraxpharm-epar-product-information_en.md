## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Substitution treatment of opioid drug dependence, within a comprehensive therapeutic monitoring framework of medical, social and psychological treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older, who have agreed to be treated for addiction.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate dependence/addiction.

It is recommended that buprenorphine treatment be prescribed as part of comprehensive management for opioid drug dependence. The result of the treatment depends on the dose prescribed as well as on the combined medical, psychological, social and educational measures taken in monitoring the patient.

## Precautions to be taken before induction of treatment

Prior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with or buprenorphine only should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated by a score indicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS).

For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of buprenorphine should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 6 hours after the patient last used opioids.

For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone should be reduced to a maximum of 30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine therapy. The long half-life of methadone should be considered when starting buprenorphine. The first dose of buprenorphine should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms of withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone.

## Posology

## Initiation therapy (induction)

The recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is 2 to 4 mg as a single daily dose. An additional 2 to 4 mg may be administered on day one depending on the individual patient's requirement. Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm can only be used for initiation therapy when a starting single daily dose of 4 mg is indicated.

During the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper sublingual placement of the film and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective dose titration according to clinical effect.

## Dose adjustment and maintenance therapy

Following treatment induction on day one, the patient should be stabilised to a maintenance dose during the next few days by progressively adjusting the dose according to the clinical effect of the individual patient. Dose titration is guided by reassessment of the clinical and psychological status of the patient, and should not exceed a maximum single daily dose of 24 mg buprenorphine. Dose titration steps may can be achieved using combinations of 0.4 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg strengths. Daily dispensing of buprenorphine is recommended, particularly during the initiation of treatment. Then, after stabilisation, the patient may be given a supply of the product sufficient for several days of treatment. However, it is recommended that the amount of the product dispensed be limited to a maximum of 7 days.

## Less than daily dosing

After a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of dosing may be decreased to dosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient stabilised to receive a daily dose of 8 mg buprenorphine may be given 16 mg buprenorphine on alternate days, with no dose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, the frequency of dosing may be decreased to 3 times a week (for example on Monday, Wednesday and Friday). The dose on Monday and Wednesday should be twice the individually titrated daily dose, and the dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, with no dose on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine. Patients requiring a titrated daily dose superior to 8 mg buprenorphine /day may not find this regimen adequate.

## Reducing dosage and stopping treatment (medical taper)

When clinical evaluation and the will of the patient lead to consider treatment discontinuation, it must be achieved with caution. The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine after a period of maintenance or brief stabilisation should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. To avoid withdrawal symptoms and potential relapse to illicit drug use, the buprenorphine dose may be progressively decreased over time in favourable cases until treatment can be discontinued. After a satisfactory period of stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dosage of buprenorphine may be reduced gradually; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The availability of the sublingual films with doses of 0.4 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg, respectively, allows for a downward titration of dosage but alternative buprenorphine formulations may be needed. Patients should be monitored following termination of buprenorphine treatment because of the potential for relapse.

## Switching between buprenorphine sublingual film and other buprenorphine medicinal products (where applicable)

In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine film 0.4 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg were shown to be similar to the respective dosage strengths of Subutex ®  buprenorphine sublingual tablets. If switching between film and sublingual tablets, the patient should nevertheless be monitored in case a need to readjust the dose occurs.

Interchangeability with other buprenorphine medicinal products (apart from sublingual tablets) has not been studied. Dose adjustments may be necessary when switching between medicinal products. Patients should be monitored for overdose, withdrawal or other indications of underdosing.

## Special populations

## Elderly

The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not been established. No recommendation on posology can be made.

## Hepatic impairment

Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status are recommended prior to commencing therapy.

The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine were evaluated in a postmarketing study. Buprenorphine is extensively metabolized in the liver, and plasma levels were found to be higher for buprenorphine in patients with liver impairment. Systemic exposure is marginally enhanced in mild liver impaired subjects and no dose adjustment is deemed to be necessary. After administration of a 2 mg single dose, overall systemic exposure is significantly increased in moderate (1.6 fold) and severe (2.8 fold) hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and reduction of initiation and maintenance doses should be considered. Considering the pronounced higher exposure in severe patients and the potential for more accumulation after repeated dose administration Buprenorphine must not be used in severe hepatic impaired patients (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).

Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products (see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of accelerated liver injury. Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status are recommended prior to commencing therapy. Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

Modification of the buprenorphine dose is not generally required in patients with renal impairment. Caution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine in children and adolescents below the age of 15 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Sublingual use.

Physicians must advise patients that the sublingual use is the only effective and safe use for this medicinal product.

The medicinal product should be administrated immediately after their removal from primary packaging.

The film is not to be swallowed. The film is to be placed under the tongue until completely dissolved, which usually occurs within 10 to 15 minutes. It is advised that patients moisten their mouths prior to dosing. Patients should not move the film after placing it under the tongue, nor consume food or drink until the film is completely dissolved. The film should not be moved after placement, and proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.

If an additional film is necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, it should be placed under the tongue after the first film has been completely dissolved.

Films should not be split prior to administration for dose adjustment.

## Treatment goals and discontinuation

Before initiating treatment with Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm, a treatment strategy including treatment duration and treatment goals, should be agreed together with the patient. During treatment, there should be frequent contact between the physician and the patient to evaluate the need for continued treatment, consider discontinuation and to adjust dosages if needed. When a patient no longer requires therapy with Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm it may be advisable to taper the dose gradually to prevent symptoms of withdrawal (see section 4.4).

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- Severe respiratory insufficiency
- Severe hepatic insufficiency
- Acute alcoholism or delirium tremens

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Use in adolescents: Due to lack of data in adolescents aged 15 - 17 years, patients in this age group should be more closely monitored during treatment.

## Misuse, abuse and diversion

Buprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some risks of misuse and abuse include overdose, spread of blood borne viral or localised and systemic infections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the intended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using buprenorphine as the primary drug of abuse and may occur if the medicine is distributed for illicit use directly by the intended patient or if the medicine is not safeguarded against theft.

In cases of intravenous drug misuse, local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis) and potentially serious acute hepatitis and other acute infections, such as pneumonia and endocarditis have been reported.

Sub-optimal treatment with buprenorphine may prompt medicinal product misuse by the patient, leading to overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is under-dosed with buprenorphine may

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms and craving by self-medicating with opioids, alcohol or other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines.

To minimise the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, physicians should take appropriate precautions when prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as to avoid prescribing multiple refills early in treatment and to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate to the patient's level of stability.

## Sleep-related breathing disorders

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and sleeprelated hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage.

## Respiratory depression

A number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when buprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines or gabapentinoids (see section 4.5) or when buprenorphine was not used according to the prescribing information. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol or other opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are not tolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur.

This medicinal product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to potential shortness of breath)).

Patients with the physical and/or pharmacological risk factors above should be monitored, and dose reduction may be considered.

Buprenorphine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and nondependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the sachet safely, to never open the sachet in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other household members, and not to use this medicinal product in front of children. An emergency unit should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion.

## CNS depression

Buprenorphine may cause drowsiness, particularly when used together with alcohol or central nervous system depressants (such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives, or hypnotics) (see sections 4.5 and 4.7).

Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids or related medicinal products.

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids or related medicinal products may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, concomitant prescribing with these sedative medicinal products should be reserved for patients for whom alternative treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe buprenorphine concomitantly with sedative medicinal products, the lowest effective dose of the sedative medicines should be used, and the duration of treatment should be as short as possible. The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their caregivers to be aware of these symptoms (see section 4.5).

Tolerance and opioid use disorder (abuse and dependence)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tolerance, physical and psychological dependence, and opioid use disorder (OUD) may develop upon repeated administration of opioids such as buprenorphine neuraxpharm Abuse or intentional misuse of buprenorphine  neuraxpharm  may  result  in  overdose  and/or  death.  The  risk  of  developing  OUD  is increased in patients with a personal or a family history (parents or siblings) of substance use disorders (including alcohol use disorder), in current tobacco users or in patients with a personal history of other mental health disorders (e.g. major depression, anxiety and personality disorders).

Before initiating treatment with buprenorphine neuraxpharm and during the treatment, treatment goals and a discontinuation plan should be agreed with the patient (see section 4.2).

Patients will require monitoring for signs of drug-seeking behavior (e.g. too early requests for refills). This includes the review of concomitant opioids and psychoactive drugs (like benzodiazepines). For patients  with  signs  and  symptoms  of  OUD,  consultation  with  an  addiction  specialist  should  be considered.

## Serotonin syndrome

Concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition (see section 4.5).

If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms.

If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be considered depending on the severity of the symptoms.

## Hepatitis and hepatic events

Serious cases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in a context of misuse, especially for intravenous use (see section 4.8). These hepatic injuries have mainly been observed at the high doses and could be due to a mitochondrial toxicity. In many cases the presence of pre-existing mitochondrial impairment (genetic diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicines), and ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products (see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of liver injury, and these underlying factors must be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine and during treatment (see section 4.2). When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and etiological evaluation is required. Depending upon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent withdrawal syndrome and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic function should be monitored closely.

## Precipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome

When initiating treatment with buprenorphine, the physician must be aware of the partial agonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, particularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or if administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone (according to the long half-life of methadone). Patients should be clearly monitored during the switching period from methadone to buprenorphine since withdrawal symptoms have been reported. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine should be undertaken when objective signs of moderate withdrawal are evident (see section 4.2).

Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing.

## Allergic reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, urticaria, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to buprenorphine use.

## Hepatic impairment

The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine were evaluated in a single-dose postmarketing study. Since buprenorphine is extensively metabolized, plasma levels were found to be elevated for buprenorphine in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic insufficiency the use of buprenorphine is contraindicated (See sections 4.3 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment

Renal elimination may be prolonged since 30% of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal route. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## CYP3A4 inhibitors

Combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole and ritonavir can lead to increased plasma concentrations of buprenorphine. Patients receiving buprenorphine should be closely monitored and may require dose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5).

## General opioid class warnings

Opioids can cause orthostatic hypotension.

Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures. As with other opioids, caution is requested in patients using buprenorphine and having head injury, intracranial lesions and increased cranial pressure, or history of seizure.

Opioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of concomitant disease.

Opioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g. Addison's disease).

Opioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture.

Opioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.

Opioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients.

The following combinations are not recommended with buprenorphine: level II analgesics, ethylmorphine and alcohol (see section 4.5).

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Not recommended combinations

## Alcohol

Alcohol increases the sedative effect of buprenorphine, which can make driving and using machines hazardous. Avoid taking buprenorphine together with alcoholic drinks or medicinal product containing alcohol.

## Buprenorphine should be used cautiously when co-administered with

## Sedatives such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids or related substances

The  concomitant  use  of  opioids  with  sedative  medicinal  products  such  as  benzodiazepines  (e.g. diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam), gabapentinoids (e.g. pregabalin, gabapentin) or related substances such as barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital) or chloral hydrate increase the risk of sedation, respiratory depression,  coma  and  death  because  of  additive  CNS  depressant  effect.  The  doses  and  duration  of concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). Patients should be  warned  that  it is  extremely dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this product and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently whit this product only as prescribed (see section 4.4).

Other central nervous system depressants, such as other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics and antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptors antagonists, benzodiazepines, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances

The concomitant use with these substances increases central nervous system depression. The reduced level  of  alertness  can  make  driving  and  using  machines  hazardous.  Additionally,  for  barbiturates, increased risk of respiratory depression.

## Naltrexone and nalmefene

Opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of buprenorphine. For opioid dependent patients currently receiving buprenorphine treatment, naltrexone or nalmefene may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms. For patients currently receiving naltrexone or nalmefene treatment, the intended therapeutic effects of buprenorphine administration may be blocked.

## Opioid analgesics such as morphine

Adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine. The potential for overdose also exists with a full agonist, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining. Patients with a need for analgesia and opioid dependence treatments may be best managed by multidisciplinary teams that include both pain and opioid dependence treatment specialists.

Serotonergic medicinal products , such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (SNRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants The risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is increased (see section 4.4).

## CYP3A4 inhibitors

An interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of buprenorphine (approximately 50% and 70% respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of norbuprenorphine. Patients receiving buprenorphine should be closely monitored, and may require dose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir, or azole antifungals like ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole or posaconazole)

## CYP3A4 inducers

In  a  clinical  study  performed  in  healthy  volunteers,  the  combination  of  buprenorphine  with  either rifampicin or rifabutin shows a 70% and 35% reduction, respectively, in plasma buprenorphine levels and onset of withdrawal symptoms in 50% of the 12 volunteers. Therefore, it is recommended that patients  receiving buprenorphine  should  be  closely  monitored  if  inducers  (e.g. phenobarbital,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered, and the dose of buprenorphine or CYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly.

## Anticholinergics or medications with anticholinergic activity

Concomitant administration of buprenorphine with anticholinergics or medications with anticholinergic activity (e.g. tricyclic andidepressants, antihistamines, antipsycholtics, muscle relaxants, anti-parkinson drugs) may result in increased anticholinergic adverse effects.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited data from the use of buprenorphine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Buprenorphine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

Chronic use of buprenorphine by the mother at the end of pregnancy, at any dose, may cause a withdrawal syndrome (high-pitched cry, poor feeding, abnormal sleep, irritability, tremor, hypertonia, myoclonus, or convulsions) in the neonate. This syndrome can be delayed several hours to a few days after birth. Cases of respiratory disorders in neonates have also been reported. Consequently, if the mother is treated up to the end of pregnancy, neonatal monitoring should be considered during the first postnatal days.

## Breast-feeding

Very small amounts of buprenorphine and its metabolite pass into mother's milk. These amounts are not sufficient to prevent withdrawal syndrome which can be delayed in breastfed infants. After evaluation of individual risk factors, breast feeding can be considered in buprenorphine-treated patients.

## Fertility

There are limited data on the effects of buprenorphine on human fertility.

In a study at pharmacological doses in mice, an atrophy and a tubular mineralisation of testis have been evidenced in treated animals. No adverse effects on fertility were seen in rat studies; however, difficulty in parturition was noted (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Buprenorphine has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines when administered to opioid-dependent patients. This medicinal product may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or impaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken together with alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case buprenorphine may adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical studies were symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported with a higher incidence in patients treated with buprenorphine (n=103) during a pivotal clinical study versus placebo (n=107).

The frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10), Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), Uncommon (≥ 1/1 , 000 to &lt; 1/100), Rare (≥ 1/10, 000 to &lt; 1/1, 000), Very rare (&lt; 1/10, 000).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Drug dependence

Repeated use of buprenorphine neuraxpharm sublingual films can lead to drug dependence, even at therapeutic doses. The risk of drug dependence may vary depending on a patient's individual risk factors, dosage, and duration of opioid treatment (see section 4.4).

## Respiratory depression

Respiratory depression has occurred. Death due to respiratory depression has been reported, particularly when buprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5), or when buprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information. Deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other CNS depressants such as alcohol or other opioids (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Drug withdrawal syndrome neonatal

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported among newborns of women who have received buprenorphine during pregnancy. The syndrome may be milder and more protracted than that from short acting full μ -opioid agonists. The nature of the syndrome may vary depending upon the mother's drug use history (see section 4.6).

## Hypersensitivity reactions

The most common signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include rashes, urticaria and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, respiratory depression, angioedema and anaphylactic shock have been reported.

## Transaminases increase, hepatitis, jaundice

Hepatic transaminases increase and hepatitis with jaundice which generally have resolved favourably occurred (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Buprenorphine appears to have a theoretical wide margin of safety because of its partial opioid agonist properties.

## Symptoms

Respiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom requiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death (see section 4.4). Signs of overdose may also include sedation, miosis, hypotension, nausea and vomiting.

## Treatment/Management

In the event of overdose, general supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and cardiac status of the patient.

Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, and standard intensive care measures, should be performed. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation should be implemented if necessary. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities are available.

If the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus.

Use of an injectable opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in reversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine; buprenorphine being highly bound to the morphinic receptors.

If naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of previously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. Ongoing IV infusion rates should be titrated to patient response. If infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in opioid dependence ATC code: N07BC01

## Mechanism of action

Buprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which attaches itself to the μ (mu) and k (kappa) receptors of the brain. Its activity in maintenance treatment of opioid dependence is attributed to its slowly reversible binding to the µ receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of the addicted patients for drugs.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

When taken orally, buprenorphine undergoes first-pass hepatic metabolism with N-dealkylation and glucuroconjungation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medication by oral route is therefore inappropriate.

Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 90 minutes after sublingual administration and the maximal dose -concentration relationship is dose-dependent but not dose-proportional in the dose range between 2 mg and 24 mg buprenorphine.

Plasma levels of buprenorphine increased with increasing sublingual dose of buprenorphine.

*Median

## Distribution

The absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase and a half-life of 2 to 5 hours.

## Metabolism

Buprenorphine is metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation and glucuroconjugation of the parent molecule and the dealkylated metabolite. Clinical data confirm that CYP3A4 is responsible for the Ndealkylation of buprenorphine. The N-dealkybuprenorphine is a μ agonist with weak intrinsic activity.

## Elimination

Elimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri- exponential, with long terminal elimination phase of 20-25 hours, due in part to reabsorption of buprenorphine after intestinal hydrolysis of the conjugated derivative, and in part to the highly lipophilic nature of the molecule.

The median half-lives observed for doses of 0.4 mg, and 8 mg were 25.37and 26.45 hours, respectively.

## Excretion

Buprenorphine is essentially eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated metabolites (70%), the rest being eliminated in the urine.

## Special populations

## Hepatic impairment

Buprenorphine is extensively metabolized in the liver, and plasma levels were found to be higher for buprenorphine in patients with liver impairment. Table 3 summarizes the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure of buprenorphine was determined after administering a buprenorphine/naloxone 2 0/0.5 mg sublingual tablet in healthy subjects, and in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment.

Overall, buprenorphine plasma exposure increased approximately 3-fold in patients with severely impaired hepatic function.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Chronic toxicity studied in four species (rodents and non-rodents) by four different administration routes has not showed any clinically pertinent element. In one oral study of one year in dogs, a hepatic toxicity has been observed at very high dose (75 mg/kg).

Teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits allow to conclude that buprenorphine is not embryotoxic nor teratogenic. No undesirable effect on fertility has been reported in rats, however a high peri- and post- natal mortality has been observed in this species by IM and oral administration routes, due to difficult parturition and impairment of maternal lactation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a standard series of tests, none proof of genotoxic potential has been evidenced.

Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats show that there is no difference in the incidences of different tumour types between control and buprenorphine treated animals. However, in a study conducted with pharmacological doses in mice, an atrophy and a tubular mineralisation of testis have been evidenced in treated animals.

## 1. What Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm is and what it is used for

Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm contains the active substance, buprenorphine, a type of medicine known as an opioid. Buprenorphine is used to treat dependence on opioid (narcotic) drugs in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older  who are also receiving medical, social and psychological support. Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm is intended for patients who have agreed to be treated for their opioid dependence. Buprenorphine helps individuals addicted to opioids by preventing opioid withdrawal symptoms and reducing drug cravings.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm

## Do not take Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm

- -if you are allergic to buprenorphine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6),
- -if you have serious breathing problems,
- -if you have serious problems with your liver,
- -if you are intoxicated due to alcohol or have delirium tremens (trembling, sweating, anxiety, confusion or hallucinations caused by alcohol).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm.

## -Misuse and abuse

This medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines and should be kept in a safe place to protect it from theft. Do not give this medicine to anyone else . It can kill or otherwise harm them.

## -Sleep-related breathing disorders

Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (frequent interruption of breathing during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood). Symptoms can include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties staying asleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor.

## -Breathing problems and sleepiness

Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) or have experienced increased sleepiness because they misused buprenorphine or have taken it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), gabapentinoids or other opioids or with inhibitors of the buprenorphine metabolism such as anti-retrovirals (used to treat AIDS) or certain antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) (See section 2 'Other medicines and Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm).

Tell your doctor if you suffer from asthma or other respiratory problems before you start treatment with Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm.

## -Serotonin syndrome

Concomitant use with certain anti-depressants may cause serotonin syndrome (See section 2 'Other medicines and Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm).

## Tolerance, dependence, and addiction

This medicine contains buprenorphine which is an opioid medicine. Repeated use of opioids can result in the drug being less effective (you become accustomed to it, known as tolerance). Repeated use of buprenorphine can also lead to dependence, abuse, and addiction, which may result in life-threatening overdose.

Dependence or addiction can make you feel that you are no longer in control of how much medicine you need to take or how often you need to take it.

The risk of becoming dependent or addicted varies from person to person. You may have a greater risk of becoming dependent on or addicted to buprenorphine if:

- -You or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines or illegal drugs ('addiction').
- -You are a smoker.
- -You have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety, or a personality disorder) or have been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses.

If you notice any of the following signs whilst taking buprenorphine, it could be a sign that you have become dependent or addicted:

- -You need to take the medicine for longer than advised by your doctor
- -You need to take more than the recommended dose
- -You are using the medicine for reasons other than prescribed, for instance, 'to stay calm' or 'help you sleep'
- -You have made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to quit or control the use of the medicine
- -When you stop taking the medicine you feel unwell, and you feel better once taking the medicine again ('withdrawal effects')

If you notice any of these signs, speak to your doctor to discuss the best treatment pathway for you, including when it is appropriate to stop and how to stop safely (See section 3, If you stop taking Buprenorphine neuraxpharm.

## -Liver damage

Liver damage has been reported after taking buprenorphine, especially when buprenorphine is misused. This could also be due to viral infections (e.g. chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, anorexia or use of other medicines with the ability to harm your liver (See section 4 'Possible side effects\"). Regular blood tests may be conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell your doctor if you have any liver problems before you start treatment with Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm.

- -Withdrawal symptoms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicine can cause opioid withdrawal symptoms if you take it too soon after taking opioids. You should leave at least 6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, heroin) or at least 24 hours after you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone.

This medicine can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly.

## -Allergic reactions

Tell your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention if you experience side effects such as sudden wheezing, difficulty breathing, swelling of the eyelids, face, tongue, lips, throat or hands; rash or itching especially those covering your whole body. These may be signs of a life-threatening allergic reaction.

- -General opioid class warnings
- This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. Prescribing and dispensing for a short period of time are recommended especially at the beginning of the treatment.
- Tell your doctor if you recently suffered head injury, or brain disease or if you suffer from seizures. Opioids can cause an increase in pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord).
- Opioids may induce constriction of the pupils and may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases.
- Opioids should be used with caution in patients with thyroid problems or adrenocortical disorder (e.g. Addison's disease).
- Opioids should be used with caution in patients with low blood pressure, a urinary disorder (especially linked to enlarged prostate in men) or a dysfunction of the biliary tract (network of organs and vessels that make, store and transfer bile in the body).
- Opioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients.
- The following combinations with Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm are not recommended: Tramadol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, alcohol or medications containing alcohol (see also section 2 'Other medicines and Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm').

## Children and adolescents

This medicinal product is not for use in children and adolescents below 15 years. For adolescents between 15 and 17 years, the doctor may decide to conduct regular blood tests.

## Other medicines and Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Some medicines may increase the side effects of buprenorphine or cause very serious reactions. Do not take any other medicines whilst taking Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm without first talking to your doctor, especially:

Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, or alprazolam, and gabapentinoids (used to treat neuropathic pain, epilepsy or anxiety) such as pregabalin or gabapentin. Concomitant use of Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related medicines increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be considered when other treatment options are not possible.

However if your doctor does prescribe Buprenorphine Neuraxpharm together with sedative medicines the dose and duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor.

Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor's dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms.
