## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant MERCK SHARP &amp; DOHME LIMITED submitted on 4 June 2014 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Keytruda, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

The applicant applied for the following indication:

'KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults.'

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that pembrolizumab was considered to be a new active substance.

The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, nonclinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies).

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0059/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the granting of a (productspecific) waiver.

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0059/2014 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Melanoma is the sixth and seventh most common malignancy in men and women, respectively. 1  The median age at diagnosis is 59 years. The incidence of melanoma varies between different European countries but the estimated incidence was about 39.6 cases /100.000 men and 42.5 cases /100.000 women in 2012. In Europe in 2012, the mortality rate was approximately 8.8 cases/100.000 in males and 6.9 cases/100.000 in females. 1  The outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation 2 . Approximately 85% of patients with melanoma present with localised disease, 10% with regional disease and 5% with distant metastatic disease. The 5-year survival rates in patients who present with localised disease and primary tumours 1.0mm or less in thickness are very good, with more than 90% of patients surviving. The 5-year survival rates decrease as the tumour spreads: for tumours of more than 1.0mm in thickness, survival rates range from 50% to 90%, with  regional node involvement survival rates are around 50%, for within stage III (regional metastatic melanoma) 5-year survival rates range between 20-70%, depending on primary nodal involvement. The long term survival for distant metastatic melanoma, the 5-year survival is less than 10%.

Current treatments for metastatic melanoma include systemic therapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Spontaneous regression of melanoma has been reported with an incidence of less than 1%. Complete resection of isolated metastases to one anatomic site (lung, gastrointestinal tract, bone or brain) may occasionally achieve long term survival. Systemic treatment may consist of chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy is indicated for symptomatic relief of metastases to brain, bones and viscera.

Chemotherapy with dacarbazine (DTIC) may achieve objective response rates of about 20%, of which less than 5% is complete remission. Higher response rates have been seen using combination chemotherapy, however no increase in over-all survival has been demonstrated with combination regimens when compared to dacarbazine alone. Immunotherapeutic agents used for metastatic melanoma are interferon-alfa (IFNα) and interleukine-2 (IL-2). Recurrent melanoma is resistant to most standard systemic therapy and no standardized effective second line treatment is established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In EU Countries, dacarbazine was used for many years as standard first line treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma 3 . Clinical trials with dacarbazine have shown low response rates ranging from 11% -25%, low rate of complete responses and of short duration (3 to 6 months). The median survival time ranged from 4.5 to 6 months 4,5,6 . Ipilimumab (Yervoy), a human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, was approved in the EU in 2011 for melanoma patients who have received prior therapy. The approval of ipilimumab was based on the results of a phase III study performed in previously treated melanoma patients was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with the gp100 vaccine (10.1 versus 6.4 months; HR: 0.66; p= 0.003). In recent times, the serine-threonine kinase BRAF was discovered mutated in many cancers 7 . BRAF mutations have been found in approximately 50% of melanoma, 30-70% of thyroid carcinomas, 30% of ovarian carcinoma and 10% of colorectal carcinoma. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF result in constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway which in turn stimulates cell growth, proliferation and cell survival in the absence of typical growth factors 8 . For patients with tumours harbouring the BRAFV600 mutation, kinase inhibitors vemurafenib (Zelborarf) and dabrafenib (Tafinlar) were approved in the EU in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and target directly the mutated protein BRAFV600. Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), as first line treatment was approved based on the results of the pivotal phase III study (BRIM3) and was associated with a median progression-free survival (PFS) 6.9 vs 1.6 months, respectively (HR 0.38, 95%CI: 0.32-0.46, p&lt;0.0001) and  median OS 13.6 vs 9.7 months (HR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, p&lt;0.0001) compared with DTIC. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), as first line therapy was approved based on the results of the pivotal trial BREAK-3 that showed a median PFS of 6.9 vs 2.7 months for the dabrafenib and DTIC group respectively, (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.58; p-value&lt;0.0001) and OS (HR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.48, 1.21); a 12 month OS rate of 70 % and 63 % for dabrafenib and DTIC treatments, respectively). Trametinib (Mekinist) was approved in 2014 to target the mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK 1 and MEK 2) proteins to dampen the signalling pathway that promotes proliferation and survival in BRAFV600 mutated melanoma. Mekinist as first line of treatment was approved based on the results of a phase III study that showed a median PFS 4.8 vs 1.5 months, respectively (HR 0.45; 95%CI:0.33, 0.63; p-value &lt;0.0001) and median OS of 15.6 vs 11.3 months (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.57, 1.06) for trametinib and dacarbazine respectively.

The co-inhibitory receptor programmed cell death - 1 (PD-1) is a key regulator of T cell activity that belongs to the same immunoglobulin superfamily which includes the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and the co-inhibitory receptor CTLA-4. 9,  Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody (IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilising sequence alteration in the Fc region) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology. It binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Pembrolizumab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant applied for the following indication:

'KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults.'

The final approved indication was:

'KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.'

The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Patients  should be treated with KEYTRUDA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Atypical responses (i.e., an initial transient increase in tumour size or small new lesions within the first few months followed by tumour shrinkage) have been observed. It is recommended to continue treatment for clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression  until disease progression is confirmed.

Guidelines for withholding or discontinuation of KEYTRUDA are described in Table 1 of the SmPC. KEYTRUDA should be permanently discontinued:

- For Grade 4 toxicity except for endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones
- If corticosteroid dosing cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks
- If a treatment-related toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks after last dose of KEYTRUDA
- If any event occurs a second time at Grade ≥ 3 severity

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The active substance of Keytruda (50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for IV infusion) is pembrolizumab (MK-3475), which is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to human PD-1 and blocks the interaction between PD-1 receptor and its ligands. MK-3475 is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody with Class-II mechanism of action (binding to cell-bound antigen not involving Fc effector function).

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

It is an IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilizing SER228PRO sequence alteration in the Fc region; it could be demonstrated that the S228P mutation introduced into MK-3475 in the IgG4 hinge region prevents the formation of half molecules. Induction of half molecules, if not in that way engineered, is typical for IgG4 antibodies. The molecular characteristics were determined by a combination of techniques including mass spectrometry, peptide mapping, and N-glycan profiling.

The antibody is heterogeneously glycosylated at Asn297 within the Fc domain of each heavy chain, yielding a molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa for intact MK-3475. The dominant glycoform is the fucosylated agalacto diantennary glycan form (G0F).

The observed molecular weight of the most abundant form of the intact antibody is 148.9 kDa, while the most abundant forms of the heavy and light chains are 50.7 kDa and 23.7 kDa, respectively.

## Manufacturing process

MK-3475 is a humanised monoclonal antibody that is expressed as a secreted product from a suspension Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. A fully characterised Master Cell Bank (MCB) as well as a Working Cell Bank (WCB) was established. Cells from the WCB are expanded in shake flasks, disposable rocker bags, and a seed bioreactor to generate the inoculum for a production bioreactor to produce the antibody product. The downstream processing includes three chromatography steps, two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

orthogonal viral clearance steps, ultrafiltration/diafiltration, and a final 0.2 µm filtration step. All raw materials used in upstream/downstream manufacturing processes are animal component free. Upstream and downstream processing is considered as state of the art for production of monoclonal antibodies.

Definitions of key terms were provided by the Applicant as follows:

- Critical Quality Attribute (CQA): A critical quality attribute (CQA) is a physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality (ICH Q8).
- Critical Process Parameter (CPP): A process parameter whose variability has an impact on critical quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality (ICH Q8).
- Key Process Attribute (KPA): Process and/or product attributes that are primary measure(s) of the consistency of performance for each step.
- Key Operating Parameter (KOP): Parameter whose variability has an impact on a KPA and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the desired consistency of performance.

## Process development

There have been no major process changes other than scale and site changes between non-clinical and clinical manufacturing: non-clinical manufacturing was performed at the pilot plant facility using the MSB. Initial clinical manufacturing was performed at the clinical manufacturing facility. For initial clinical supplies, manufacture started from the MCB. Meanwhile, a working cell bank (WCB) has been qualified and introduced into the process. To enable facility fit at larger scale and also to increase productivity and robustness of downstream steps to ensure an adequate supply of MK-3475, the active substance manufacturing process has been transferred from the clinical site to a commercial manufacturing facility with greater capacity (MedImmune (FMC); Frederick Manufacturing Center, Frederick, MD). In addition to a change in scale of the active substance manufacture, other changes were made to further enhance the robustness of the commercial active substance manufacturing process.

Process validation , also referred to as Process Performance Qualification (PPQ), demonstrated that for all four PPQ batches, the predefined acceptance criteria for the upstream CQAs (of the unprocessed bulk) and for the downstream CQAs (active substance) were consistently met.

The active substance is already finally formulated. Active substance from FMC is stored at -40 ± 5°C and shipped at ≤ -35°C to the finished product manufacturing location.

Site changes were supported following ICH guideline Q5E by process and analytical comparability studies (comparative release testing and comparative extended site by site characterisation studies) including comparative long term stability assessments. Sufficient comparability for active substance from the clinical manufacturing site and active substance from FMC was demonstrated. Minor differences were sufficiently characterised (and understood). These root cause investigations (characterisations) were considered adequate and the outcome (i.e. no effect on safety and/or efficacy may be expected) seems plausible.

## Characterisation

The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of MK-3475 were evaluated using a series of biochemical, biophysical and functional characterisation techniques. The single characterisation methods are considered scientifically justified, sufficient sensitive and state of the art and therefore suitable for characterisation of the active substance.

Product-related species of MK-3475 active substance were adequately separated by methods that exploit differences in molecular size, charge, and hydrophobicity.

Process-related impurities were adequately determined and include CHO host cell proteins (HCP), CHO host cell DNA and Protein A.

## Control

The active substance Quality Control for batch release includes identity, potency (competitive binding ELISA), purity and impurities and several other general tests.

## Reference Standard

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As defined by ICH Q6B, an in-house reference material, manufactured at WAG facility, has been established for MK-3475.

## Stability

Based on the presented 18 months real time real condition long-term stability data for the three primary batches the claimed shelf life of 18 months at -40ºC is considered justified.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Description and composition

Finished product, powder for solution for infusion, single-use 50 mg/vial is reconstituted with sterile water for injection and further diluted with normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride injection) or 5% dextrose (5% dextrose injection; also referred to as 5% glucose) prior to IV administration.

Formulation development and optimisation studies have shown the pH of optimum product stability to be pH 5.2-5.8. Further low moisture content of the finished product lyophilisate ensures product stability. MK-3475 finished product does not contain any overages.

## Process development

Initially, clinical materials have been manufactured at the clinical manufacturing facility. Increasing demand for finished product based on promising clinical data required an increase in capacity. Therefore, a second site, Schering-Plough (Brinny) in Innishannon, Ireland (further referred to as Brinny) was added as a finished product manufacturing site to supply the clinical trials.

Site changes were supported following ICH guideline Q5E by process and analytical comparability studies (comparative release testing and comparative site by site extended characterisation studies) including comparative long term stability assessments.

## Manufacture

For the manufacture of MK-3475 finished product, FMC active substance is delivered as frozen final formulated bulk (FFB) solution containing the exact formulation of the final finished product. The finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing, pooling, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration, filling, lyophilisation, capping, and visual inspection.

The manufacturing process for finished product and its controls (in-process control (IPC) and critical process parameters (CPP) ranges) are adequately presented. The defined critical process parameters are justified. The proven acceptable ranges and the defined normal operating ranges are considered acceptable for the critical process parameters.

The defined IPCs and their ranges are considered justified. Overall adequate IPCs are in place as part of the overall control system to ensure consistent manufacturing of the finished product.

All PPQ study objectives and CPP, IPC, PPQ samples and CQA acceptance criteria were met. Based on the study results, the process is considered principally sufficient validated for commercial manufacturing.

## Control

The finished product Quality Control for batch release includes identity, potency (competitive binding ELISA), purity and impurities and several other general tests.

Reference standards are identical to the active substance material.

## Container closure system

The container closure system is adequately described. It consists of Type-I glass vials, stoppered with bromobutyl stoppers and sealed with flip-off seals Stability leachable data as well as a careful characterisation and risk assessment of the observed leachables were provided to exclude any impact on patient's safety.

## Stability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary stability batches are not produced at the proposed commercial full scale, and have been justified to be representative for the commercial process.

The updated 18 months real time real condition long-term stability data for the primary batches support the claimed shelf life of 18 months at 5ºC.

## Adventitious agents safety

Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 - rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The active drug substance of MK-3475 is produced in a serum-free culture medium. No animal-derived material is added during fermentation of MK-3475.

## Virus safety

The fermentation process of the monoclonal antibody MK-3475 is in a serum-free medium. No animal derived material is added during fermentation of MK-3475. This minimises a possible contamination for adventitious viruses. The cells used for production of MK-3475 have been sufficiently screened for viruses. These tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant in the MCB of MK3475 with the exception of intracellular A-type retroviral particles which are well known to be present in CHO cells. However, this is acceptable since there is sufficient capacity within the manufacturing procedure of MK-3475 for reduction of this type of viral particles. Therefore, there are no concerns for the use in the production process of MK-3475. The purification process of MK-3475 includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses. The effectiveness of these steps has been sufficiently demonstrated.

In summary, the adventitious agents safety of MK-3475 is considered to be sufficiently demonstrated.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Overall the quality data presented by the Applicant are detailed. However, Major Objections were identified during the review as well as numerous Other Concerns. It was acknowledged that characterisation of the active substance (and its microheterogeneity / product-related impurities) as well as extended characterisation in comparability studies were carried out very carefully using a large set of suitable and sufficient sensitive (wherever possible orthogonal) state-of-the-art analytical methods.

A Major Objection was raised in relation to the use of two significantly different manufacturing routes. In their responses, the Applicant withdrew one site as commercial active substance manufacturing site.

The Applicant acknowledged the relatively broad comparability acceptance criteria included in the original submission, when results were compared with the specification in effect at time of study initiation; therefore, the Applicant performed a thorough comparative assessment of product quality attributes.

In the description of the manufacturing process, the Applicant was asked to clarify the intended use of so-called Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs).

It was acknowledged that several orthogonal bioassay formats were used in the characterisation of Fab and Fc domains of MK-3475. However with regard to the Fab-related assays, the binding ELISA, which was initially proposed to be the sole potency test, did not fully reflect the mechanism of action of MK3475. Although there may be some lack of correlation, the notion that neither the cell-based competitive binding assay nor the functional cell-based assay contribute to any additional information necessary for correct release and stability decisions is endorsed.

The final specifications proposed by the Applicant for active substance and finished product are considered acceptable.

An issue was raised in relation to the evidence that the container closure system proposed for the finished product may not be suitable although adequate certificates and Ph. Eur. compliance is presented. Evidence is based on two leachable stability studies. Additional data were provided by the Applicant in their responses indicating that patient exposure to these materials results in leachable levels which are below the doses known to cause adverse events and therefore can be considered toxicologically safe. The issue was considered resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On the basis of additional stability data provided by the Applicant, the 18 month shelf life for the finished product was considered acceptable.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Overall, the quality of Keytruda is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications.

Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently assured.

The overall Quality of Keytruda is considered acceptable. Several recommendations for future quality development were agreed by the Applicant.

## 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommended several points for investigation.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The binding of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, SCH 900475, ORG 307488-0) to human PD-1 was evaluated in different experimental test systems. In vitro studies were performed in cell lines expressing either PD-1 or PD-L1, in cynomolgus and human PBMCs and in vivo studies were performed mainly in mouse models. Given the lack of cross-reactivity of MK-3475 with murine PD-1, a commercially available hamster anti-murine PD-1 mAb, J43, was used as surrogate for in vivo pharmacology studies.

The parental antibody to pembrolizumab was produced by immunizing mice with hPD-1 cDNA and CHO-PD-1 cells. The pembrolizumab antibody was generated by humanization of the parental murine anti-human PD-1 antibody.The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a non-GLP single dose pharmacokinetic study and two GLP repeat dose toxicokinetic (TK) studies (1-month and 6month) in cynomolgus monkeys. A non-GLP study in SCID mice was also conducted to evaluate the Fab-arm exchange of pembrolizumab in vivo.

Toxicology was evaluated in the relevant non-primate model cynomolgus monkey the only relevant and pharmacologically responsive model.

## Assessment of Functional Activity of pembrolizumab In Vitro

## Binding of pembrolizumab to cynomolgus PD-1

The binding affinity of pembrolizumab for cynomolgus PD-1 was evaluated by ELISA, cellular ELISA and by bio-light interferometry (study PD001). In these studies, the binding affinity of pembrolizumab to cynomolgus and human PD-1 was found to be in the same range, albeit slightly lower for cynomolgus PD-1. By kinetic analysis, KD was 29 pM for human PD-1 and 118 pM for cynomolgus PD-1 (Table 4). Functionally, pembrolizumab blocked the binding of human PD-1 ligands to cells expressing human or cynomolgus PD-1 with a comparable potency (Table 5).

## Efficacy of Anti-Mouse PD-1 Surrogate Antibody in Syngeneic Tumor Models In vivo studies

Study PD006 report SN 09546: anti-tumor activity of anti-mouse PD-1 antibody J43, in syngeneic mouse tumor models.

The following cell lines were used to set syngeneic mouse tumor models:

Tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into the ventral surface of the lower flank of syngeneic mice. Treatment with antibodies was initiated when tumors reached a volume of 50-70 mm 3 .

The Figure 7 shows results obtained by administrating IP J43 antibody or isotype control into mice SC implanted with MC38. The efficacy of anti-PD-1 was assessed in the MC38 syngeneic model of colon adenocarcinoma in C57BL/6 mice as monotherapy or in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. Anti-mouse PD-1 mAb J43 or hamster IgG were administered IP at 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3-4 days for a total of 5 doses.

C57BL/6 female mice were implanted subcutaneously with 1 x 10 6  MC38 syngeneic colon adenocarcinomas cells. On day 6 when tumour volumes were approximately 50-80 mm 3  , mice were injected i.p. with either control hamster Ig or hamster anti-mouse PD1 (J43) at 2mg/kg or 10mg/kg. Injections were repeated on day 10, 13, 16, and 20 (black arrows). Tumour volumes were measured every 3-4 days until day 30 and the results are presented as the means + standard errors. Survival was followed for 60 days.

In addition to monotherapy, anti-PD1 immunotherapy was evaluated in combination with either 5 FU or gemcitabine. The results are shown in Figure 8.

Together with 5-FU, mouse anti-PD-1 inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival; i.e. 60% of mice receiving concurrent treatments of 5-FU and J43 survived beyond 50 days with no evidence of tumour relapse.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

No studies evaluating secondary pharmacodynamics of pembrolizumab have been submitted. However, the applicant submitted a study to evaluate the ability of anti-PD-1 antibody to spontaneously activate the immune system.

## Assessment of the Ability of pembrolizumab to Spontaneously Activate the Immune System

The ability of pembrolizumab to activate the immune system (as measured by levels of IL-2) without concurrent T-cell receptor triggering was assessed in two in vitro assays (study PD004; SN 10121) . In the first assay, peripheral blood from healthy human donors was diluted, pre-incubated with pembrolizumab or human IgG4 isotype control antibody, and then stimulated with SEB or left unstimulated. In this assay, SEB represented a concurrent specific stimulus for the T-cell receptor. Pembrolizumab enhanced production of IL-2 only in the presence of SEB; in the absence of SEB, pembrolizumab had no effect on the level of IL-2.

## Non-GLP pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab following a single IV dose administration in female cynomolgus monkeys (PK001 = SN 08S00372)

Female cynomolgus monkeys (3/group) were given a single IV dose of pembrolizumab at 0, 0.3, 3 or 30 mg/kg and followed for a period of 84 days. Concentration of serum pembrolizumab was determined by ELISA. An overview of the PK parameters obtained after non-compartmental analysis is provided in Table 6.

There was a dose-dependent increase in exposure; the increase was more than dose-proportional between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg and dose-proportional between 3 and 30 mg/kg. Clearance varied from 2.5 - 11.3 ml/kg/day and was higher for the low dose. The elimination half-life was prolonged and the distribution volume increased in the high-dose group. From day 10 on, a drop in serum pembrolizumab levels (in 8 of 9 animals) correlated with detection of ADA.

Anti-pembrolizumab ADA (as measured by bridging ELISA) were detected in 8 out of 9 animals at variable time points starting as soon as day10 and most visible at day 21 after dosing. However, it should be noted that ADA could only be measured if the concentration of pembrolizumab was not interfering with the assay (&lt; 5 µg/ml).

In order to evaluate whether there was an increase in lymphocytes accumulation in the spleen derived from the increased T cells activation from anti-PD-1 therapy, the weight of the spleens were measured in treated animals.  A trend of higher mean absolute and relative spleen weights in comparison to control was observed in males starting from the low dose (6 mg/kg), reaching a significant 60% increase in males administered 200 mg/kg and euthanized during Week 5 (Table 9). However, no remarkable macroscopic observations were reported in spleens of high dosed animals.

However, the applicant provided literature data on the role of PD-1 on the maintenance of immune tolerance during foetal development. During pregnancy, foetal antigens can be detected in the maternal spleen, where they cause proliferation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes in response 10 . The

PD-L1 molecule is expressed at the utero-placental interface, where it protects the concepti from expected for syngeneic concepti, at the utero-placental interface of the placentas of CBA x CBA mice.

The role of T cell-mediated immunity in foetal rejection was then confirmed in an experiment by the demonstration of infiltrations of T cells congregated at the site of foetal resorption in anti-PD-L1treated animals from allogeneic pregnancy using immunohistochemistry of placental sections 13 . Confirmation that T cells are required for anti-PD-L1 rejection was obtained in the following set of experiments. RAG-1 -/- mice (on a C57BL/6 background), which lack T and B cells, were mated with CBA males and treated with anti-PD-L1 mAb. All RAG-1 -/-females had normal numbers of healthy mAb showed increased foetal resorption 13 . Further implication of T cells in PD-1/PD-L1-mediated fetal resorption was demonstrated by the allogeneic mating of B cell-deficient mice  followed by anti-PD-L1 mAb treatment. Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway resulted in foetal rejection in 100% of these mice. Wafula et al. 14 mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Regulatory T cells from normal pregnant mice transferred into abortion-prone mice allowed abortion-prone mice to pursue a successful pregnancy by restoring normal physiological protection to the concepti. Subsequent treatment of these mice with anti-PD1 abrogated the protective effect of Tregs and resulted in the previous abortion rates. PD-L1 expressed on the surface of Tregs was shown to be essential to control the maternal immune response 15 . From the literature provided by the applicant, there was no evidence of malformations related to the blockade of PD-L1 signaling 13, 14, 15 .

maternal T-cell mediated immunity 11  . Its expression is detected at the utero-placental interface of the placentas of CBA x C57BL/6 mice concepti as early as 10 days post-conception while it is negligible, as In human and non-human primate foetuses, maternal antibodies can cross the placenta via active transport across the chorioallantoic placenta. This transfer is mediated principally via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and there is general agreement that immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass are transported most efficiently. Foetal IgG levels remain low during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and typically rise during the third trimester so that the levels of IgG4 in the foetus are similar to those in the maternal circulation 12  . Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of allogeneic pregnancy (developed by mating different strains of mice) to abrogate feto-maternal tolerance to the concepti and to result in an increase in fetal resorption 13 . The rate of spontaneous abortion in the allogeneic pregnancy in crossed CBA x C57BL/6 mice is 18%. Treatment with anti-PDL1 resulted in a significant increase in the rate of abortion of those allogeneic concepti to 86%. embryos, whereas RAG sufficient C57BL/6 females mated with CBA males and treated with anti-PD-L1 identified PD-1 as an important player in the protection of the foetus that appears to be

## Toxicokinetic data

In both the ELISA and ECL assays, the concentrations of pembrolizumab in monkey serum were determined by ligand (hPD1-Fc) as capture followed by anti-human kappa chain antibody (Ab) as detection.

## Toxicokinetics of pembrolizumab following repeated dosing for 1-month study (study SN 08396)

In this toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys (6/sex/group) received IV doses of 0, 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg pembrolizumab, once weekly for a total of 5 doses. Toxicokinetics were evaluated after the first dose (day 1) and after the fifth dose (day 28). The results are shown in Table 10.

In the 6 mg/kg group, development of ADA during the dosing phase was observed. When taking into account only the ADA-negative samples for the 5th dosing interval, Cmax is 524 µg/ml and AUC(07day) is 2350 µg*day/ml. The terminal half-life was determined for the animals assigned to the recovery period. For the 6 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg group, these parameters were derived from ADAnegative animals only.

## Toxicokinetics of pembrolizumab in the 6-month study (study TT #11-1084)

Cynomolgus monkeys (5/sex/group) received IV doses of 0, 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg pembrolizumab, once every 2 weeks for a total of 12 doses. Toxicokinetics were evaluated after the 1 st dose (day 1), the sixth dose (day 71), and the eleventh dose (Day 141.) The T1/2 was evaluated after the last dose (dose 12 at day 155).

Anti-pembrolizumab antibodies were detected in 5 animals of the 6 mg/kg group (during the dosing period) and in 1 animal in the 200 mg/kg group (during the recovery period) and were associated with an increase in elimination of pembrolizumab. Due to drug interference, the presence of ADA in midand high-dose animals cannot be excluded.

## Local Tolerance

The applicant did not submit dedicated studies on local tolerance (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

## Other toxicity studies

## Immunogenicity

Three normal female cynomolgus monkeys per group were administered a single intravenous (IV) dose (vehicle control, 0.3, 3.0 and 30 mg/kg) of pembrolizumab. Blood was collected at predose day -7, day 0 and after SCH 900475 or vehicle administration at day 1, day 7, day 28, day 56 and day 84 for exvivo PD analysis.

ADA were detected in most of the treated animals: in all animals in the 0.3 mg/kg (14-day samples after dosing) and 3 mg/kg (21-day samples after dosing) dose groups, and in 2 out of 3 animals in the 30 mg/kg dose group (21-day samples after dosing). No assay was performed to assess whether ADA were neutralizing.

Table 13 shows the PK parameters following administration of pembrolizumab in the presence or absence of detectable anti-drug-antibodies (ADA). PK results showed a dose dependent increase in exposure. The clearance varied from 3.7 - 5.7 mL/kg/day and was higher for the low dose; the elimination half-life was prolonged and the distribution volume in steady state increased in the high dose group regardless of the ADA status.

## Lack Fab arm exchange in vivo (study report TRPT-002743)

In vivo studies were conducted to confirm the lack of Fab-arm or half-molecule exchange for pembrolizumab. The potential of pembrolizumab to engage in Fab arm exchange in vivo was studied in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SCID mice by co-injecting either pembrolizumab or anti-PD-1 wt with anti-PCSK9 wt. The amount of hybrid antibodies formed in vivo was detected by a hybrid-specific ELISA. As shown in Figure 10, hybrid antibodies can be detected in sera of mice injected with the mixture of wildtype anti-PD-1 and anti-PCSK9 mAb. In contrast no hybrid antibodies were detected when pembrolizumab and anti-PCSK9 wt mAb were co-injected.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Keytruda (pembrolizumab, SCH 900475, MK-3475) is a humanized antibody where only the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable regions are of mouse-sequence origin.

The pharmacology of pembrolizumab was evaluated in Cynomolgus monkey as the similarities in binding affinities with human PD-1 were observed in in vitro experiments compared to mouse, rat and dog, where no binding was observed. The antitumor activity induced by blocking PD-1 was shown in vivo in mice in a syngeneic tumour model where MC38 colon adenocarcinoma was injected subcutaneously and mice were treated using a commercially available homologous anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody J43 at 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses every 3-4 weeks. J43 10 mg/kg administered IP, alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine, significantly inhibited the growth of the tumours. The proposed clinical dose for pembrolizumab is 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Given the availability of clinical data from humans, the lack of a non-clinical proof-of-concept at the 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks dose is acceptable.

The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion. No radiolabeled tissue distribution/mass balance or metabolism studies with pembrolizumab were submitted and no serum protein binding assay was submitted. This is acceptable as in accordance with regulatory guidelines for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6), no tissues distribution studies, metabolism studies,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mass balance are considered necessary. Following a single 0.3, 3.0, 30-mg/kg IV dose of pembrolizumab to female cynomolgus monkeys, the Vss mean value (30.9, 36.8, 54.8 ml/kg) was similar to the plasma volume of monkeys suggesting that pembrolizumab has a limited distribution out of the plasma compartment. The elimination half-life was prolonged and the distribution volume increased in the high-dose group. Systemic exposure to pembrolizumab was independent of sex and increased with increasing dose. Exposure (AUC(0-7d)) was greater after 5 administrations than after the 1st administration of pembrolizumab. This indicates accumulation. pembrolizumab was eliminated following multiphasic kinetics. Terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 11.8 to 23.7 days across doses. From day 10 on, a drop in serum pembrolizumab levels (in 8 of 9 animals) correlated with detection of ADA. ADA were detected in all of the treated animals except in 1 animal dosed 30 mg/kg. At lower dose ADA were detected earlier in time (after 14-day) vs 21-day for higher doses. In the 6-month study, the systemic exposure to pembrolizumab was independent of sex and increased with increasing dose. The AUC(0-14d) and Cmax values were slightly greater than dose proportional from 6 to 40 mg/kg and approximately dose-proportional from 40 - 200 mg/kg. With repeated administration, the systemic exposure to pembrolizumab increased. However, the systemic exposure was similar on study day 71 and 141 across doses, indicating that steady state had been reached. The terminal elimination half-life ranged from 21 to 22 days across doses. Both the ADA assay and the neutralizing antibody assay are currently under revalidation and the validation report is expected to be finalized in December, 2015. The CHMP recommends the post-approval submission of stability data of the labelled reagents.

No excretion studies with pembrolizumab were submitted. This is acceptable according to the current ICH S6 (R1) guidance on the preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals.

Stand-alone studies evaluating safety pharmacology of pembrolizumab were not submitted. This is acceptable given that safety pharmacology was evaluated as part of the 1-month and 6-months repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The following parameters were evaluated: electrocardiograms, general veterinary and physical examinations with body temperature and blood pressure, clinical observations (within 1 to 3 hours post-dose), and histopathology of tissues from the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and nervous systems. No pembrolizumab-related effects were observed in any parameter evaluated. This limited safety pharmacology evaluation of pembrolizumab is supported by ICH guidelines S6(R1), S7A, and S9, which do not require specific safety pharmacology studies for biotechnology-derived products, such as monoclonal antibodies, or for anticancer pharmaceuticals.

No non-clinical dedicated pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions studies with pembrolizumab were submitted. Since pembrolizumab is designed to modulate the functional activity of T lymphocytes, there is potential for pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions of pembrolizumab in relation to cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. In the SmPC section 4.5 it is reported to avoid the use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before start of pembrolizumab treatment but systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used during pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related adverse reactions.\"Potential PD interaction with systemic immunosuppressants\" is listed among the missing information in the RMP.

The toxicity of pembrolizumab was evaluated in a 1-month and a 6-month repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. Overall, pembrolizumab was well tolerated and the NOAEL in both studies was the highest dose tested.

The applicant did not submit studies for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity as well as fertility and early embryonic development.  This is acceptable as according to ICH guideline S6(R1) 'Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals' (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998), these studies

are not required and are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer (ICH guideline S9 'Nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals' EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008), the lack of studies is acceptable.

No reproductive toxicity studies were submitted with pembrolizumab. According to the literature submitted, there appears to be sufficient weight of evidence suggests that pembrolizumab has an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. Therefore, the lack of studies in animal models is acceptable and information on the potential for an adverse effect on pregnancy was included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. Pembrolizumab is not expected to cause adverse effects in the male and female reproductive system, however as the number of sexually mature male treated with pembrolizumab for a sufficiently long duration ( ≥ 3 months according to ICH S6(R1) was too low to draw any conclusions about the effect of pembrolizumab on male fertility, a statement has been included in the SmPC section 5.3.

It is not known whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Since it is known that in general IgG antibodies are secreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the treatment to the mother. Pembrolizumab adverse effect on pregnancy outcome and potential secretion in human milk are adequately reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. \"Reproductive and lactation data\" and are listed as missing information in the RMP.

The applicant did not submit separate local tolerance studies with pembrolizumab. This is acceptable as no clinical signs, macroscopic findings and histopathologic examination of the injection site (IV administration) were observed in the repeat dose toxicological studies.

The applicant did not submit an ERA. According to the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is acceptable.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for the marketing authorisation application for pembrolizumab, were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects. The lack of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, fertility and early embryonic development was well justified. Based on the literature data, there is a potential risk for foetal loss in the third semester in humans. In addition, the Cynomolgus monkey model showed the development of ADAs after repeat administration. These risks are adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP.

The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues:

- The Applicant is requested to submit the addendum to the validation report AR3607 (regarding the stability of labelled reagents used in PK studies in cynomolgus).

The initial application included data from Protocol 001, an open label Phase I study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma (IPI-naïve or previously treated with IPI) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Part A (including A1 and A2) of the study involved dose escalation that used a traditional 3+3 design and was an exploratory dose escalation in patients with solid tumours. Cohorts of 3- 6 patients were enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (Q2W). Once the dose escalation was completed, additional patients were enrolled into Parts A1 and A2. Part B (B1, B2, and B3) and Part D investigate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma at dose regimens of 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The PK of pembrolizumab was investigated in patients with solid malignancies enrolled in the Phase I study, Protocol 001 titled 'Phase I Study of Single Agent MK-3475 in Patients with Progressive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Carcinoma, Melanoma, and Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma' (P001). PK data were obtained through a combination of intensive (parts A, A1, A2) and sparse sampling (parts B1, B2, C  and  D)  using  a  clinical  data  cut-off  date  of  26-Jul-2013.  Additionally,  serum  samples  for  the assessment of ADA were obtained at regular intervals during the study (analysis dataset cut-off date 26-Jul-2013, subsequent analysis update with cut-off date 31-Dec-2013). During the procedure, the Applicant  presented  an  enlarged  data  set  based on  a  pooled dataset  across  studies  P001  and  P002 (Total N=1139) with data cut-off date of 18-April-2014 for P001 and 12-May-2014 for P002.

In study 001, the PK of pembrolizumab was investigated following i.v. administration of:

- Part A (including A1 and A2): 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (Q2W)
- Part B (B1, B2, and B3) and Part D :  2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W
- Part C : 10 mg/kg Q3W.

## Absorption

The applicant did not submit studies on absorption (see clinical pharmacology discussion).

## Distribution

The volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at steady state is 8.1 L, in between the volumes of serum and extracellular water. Pembrolizumab has a clearance of 0.23 L/day and an elimination half-life (t½) of 26 days as determined by population PK modelling (Table 14).

Steady-state is  achieved  by  18  weeks  of  repeated  dosing,  with  ~2.1-fold  accumulation  in  exposure during administration every 3 weeks relative to exposure observed following single dose administration.

## Elimination

The applicant did not submit studies on elimination or metabolism of pembrolizumab (see pharmacology discussion).

## Dose proportionality

The PK of pembrolizumab following multiple-dose administration is consistent with that observed after single-dose administration, indicating time-independent disposition. This is supported by the population PK model, that describes the observed concentrations following first-dose and multiple-dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration  across  a  range  of  doses  (1  to  10  mg/kg)  and  regimens  (Q2W  and  Q3W)  in  a  single integrated model with a linear clearance term.

## Time dependencies

Steady state of pembrolizumab was achieved in 18 weeks (Figure 11). The accumulation ratio based on AUC at a Q3W dosing interval is 2.1. The majority (~82%) of this accumulation has occurred after the  third  dose.  Pembrolizumab  concentrations  both  after  single  dose  and  at  steady  state  can  be described  with  the  same  population  PK  model,  indicating  the  absence  of  any  time  dependency  in pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics (Figure below).

## Special populations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An initial pooled population PK analysis was performed to generate individual pembrolizumab exposure estimates to support exposure-response analysis for clinical efficacy and to support dose recommendations. The analysis included data from 476 patients from parts A, B1, B2, C, and D of protocol PN001. In total, 7034 PK observations were included in the analysis. Covariates included in the analysis were age, gender, creatine clearance, anti-drug antibody, race, tumour burden, ALP, AST,ALT, albumin and bilirubin, baseline ECOG performance status and geographical location.

An updated pooled population PK analysis was also was performed to investigate the effects of selected covariates on pembrolizumab exposure in patients with melanoma and NSCLC, as included in study P001 and P002. The population PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. Model selection was based on the Log-Likelihood, goodness of fit plots and scientific plausibility. Identification of covariates was based on step-wise forward addition (at alpha level of 0.01) and backward elimination (at alpha level of 0.001). The covariates tested included demographic factors (age, sex, diagnosis), a measure of renal function [baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assessed by MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula)], measures of hepatic function (baseline total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), with degree of hepatic impairment classified according to NCI guidelines), laboratory parameters related to FcRn capacity (baseline albumin, IgG) and measures of disease severity [baseline ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status and tumour size (SLD)].

The results showed that age, gender, albumin, impaired renal and hepatic impairment had no impact on pembrolizumab PK parameters. Results from PopPK analysis showed that after incorporation of the effect of body weight, most of the investigated covariates had no effect on the PK of pembrolizumab.

## Weight

Within the population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be dependent on body weight when dose is accounted for in the model on an absolute (mg) level (Figure 13). Body weight was not included in the list of covariates that were investigated, as it was included as a covariate on clearance and volume terms as part of the structural model.

The population PK model results have been applied to investigate the dependency of pembrolizumab exposure on body weight in the general population under body weight normalized dosing. Under this dosing paradigm, body weight has a limited impact on exposure, with the lowest exposure in the lowest weight class and the highest in the highest weight class.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

PD-1 is an immune-checkpoint receptor that limits the activity of T lymphocytes in peripheral tissues. The PD-1 pathway is an immune control checkpoint that may be engaged by tumour cells to inhibit active T-cell immune surveillance. Pembrolizumab is a high affinity antibody against PD-1, which exerts dual ligand blockade of the PD-1 pathway, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, on antigen presenting or tumour cells. By inhibiting the PD-1 receptor from binding to its ligands, pembrolizumab reactivates tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the tumour microenvironment and reactivates anti-tumour immunity.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Functional activity of pembrolizumab to PD-1 from healthy subjects and cancer patients

The ability of pembrolizumab to modulate the activity of T-cells was assessed in vitro using peripheral blood from healthy human donors or patients with cancer. Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) was used to activate T-cells for the production of cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2 (Study PD002 report SN 09545).

WBC isolated form healthy volunteers, prostate and melanoma cancer patients and were cultured in the presence or absence of pembrolizumab, its murine precursor PD-1.09A, abatacept and a neutralizing anti-CTLA4 antibody (ipilimumab (Yervoy) (all used 25ug/ml). Cells were then stimulated with SEB.  The results for cancer patients are presented in Figure 15. The results in healthy donors were comparable with those observed in cancer patients.

To demonstrate that antigen-specific T cell receptor triggering was modulated by anti-PD-1, a human T-cell recall assay for tetanus toxoid (TT) was used. Pre-existing memory T-cells in PBMC from healthy human donors were stimulated with TT (7 days) and the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma in the culture supernatants was determined after incubation with mouse anti-PD-1.09A, anti-CTLA4 or with a dose range of SCH 900475 by ELISA. Results were in agreement with the IL-2 assay.

In addition to IL-2, TNFα , IFNγ , IL-6 and IL-17 were found to be enhanced by PD-1 blockade (either PD-1.09A or MK-3475) in SEB-stimulated blood from healthy donors, prostate cancer patients and advanced melanoma cancer patients (Figure 16). IL-5 was decreased, while no modulation was observed for IL-13,  FGF, IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-15, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1 α , MIP-1β, PDGF, RANTES, and VEGF (data not shown).

## Early population PK/PD modelling based on ex-vivo IL-2 release measured in solid tumor patients.

Target engagement was analysed in an ex-vivo IL-2 stimulation assay. Results obtained from blood samples in patients with solid tumour were included in the early PK/PD model. The assay measured post-dose reduction in the ex-vivo stimulation ratio (SEB w/o addition of 25µg/mL pembrolizumab) as an indirect measure of PD-1 receptor occupancy on T-cells. A reduction of IL-2 stimulation ratio indicated high pre-existing receptor occupancy. The maximum response was a 2.7-fold increase of the IL-2 stimulation ratio. Furthermore, in the lower dose range, a plateau was only hypothesized and the differences in the IL-2 stimulation ratio obtained with different doses was found to be very little. In light of this, the assay's reliability is questionable. The early PK/PD model is based on poor data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

source, coming from assumptions (which may not be true at the tumour site) and therefore the PK/PD relationship results inconclusive. Furthermore, plasma concentration values were not simultaneously measured. Overall, the model is not considered robust enough for the simulation.

A nonlinear mixed effects model of tumour size as quantified by SLD has been developed to describe tumour size as a function of underlying tumour growth rate and tumour kill rate due to PD-1 inhibition.

The  model-estimated  relative  tumour  size  response  at  Week  28,  presented  as  categories  similar  to those used in RECIST, versus exposure or dose. Results indicated the absence of a clear association between exposure (or dose) and efficacy.

## Exposure-response simulation

The relationship  of  plasma  concentration  and  effect  was  analysed  in  a  tumour  size  reduction  model based on a total of 365 melanoma patients with a median number of tumour size measurements of 3 (1-14)  per  patient  and  median  time  to  last  scan  of  16  weeks  (maximum  93  weeks).  No  clinically relevant  exposure-response relationship was observed. In addition, no differences were seen across the wide range of exposures (&lt;660 µg/ml to &gt;8010 µg/ml) and doses (1 to 10 mg/kg). Altogether these evidences indicated that efficacy is near to plateau. Moreover, results suggest that 1 mg/kg Q3W may be sufficient to achieve clinical efficacy.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology profile of pembrolizumab has been characterised based on data from study P001, a phase I study expanded cohorts of patients, investigating pembrolizumab doses of 1, 2, 3 and 10 mg/kg at various dosing schedules ( see  section 2.4.1) and study P002, a phase II study investigating 2mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The studies were conducted in melanoma patients as well as in patients with other solid tumours (eg. NSCLC).

The dose proposed for pembrolizumab monotherapy is 2 mg/kg administered over 30 min every 3 weeks.

The applicant did not submit studies on absorption, bioavailability or food effect as pembrolizumab is administered via the i.v. route and is therefore completely (100%) bioavailable (SmPC section 5.2). Since the expected consequence of metabolism of pembrolizumab is degradation to small peptides and single amino acid, as per ICH S6(R1) guideline, the lack of studies submitted for elimination, excretion and metabolism [e.g., cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), glucuronosyltransferases] is acceptable.

Consistent  with  a  limited  extravascular  distribution,  the  volume  of  distribution  of  pembrolizumab  at steady  state  is  small  (approximately  8.1L,  CV:22%)  and  between  the  volumes  of  serum  and extracellular water. Pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins binds to receptors for the IgG4 Fc region. The systemic clearance of pembrolizumab is ~0.2 L/day (CV: 41%) and the terminal half life (t½) is ~26 days (CV: 43%).

Dose proportionality studies showed that exposure increased with dose from 1 to 10 mg/kg. Cmax and AUC0-28  increased  in  a  supra-proportional  manner.  However,  no  clear  conclusion  can  be  drawn because of the low number of patients at the two lower doses (N = 4 for 1 mg/kg and N = 3 for 3 mg/kg, compared to N = 10 at 10 mg/kg). Mean estimated t½ values range from 14.1 to 21.6 days.

Exposure  to  pembrolizumab  as  expressed  by  peak  concentration  (Cmax)  or  area  under  the plasma  concentration  time  curve  (AUC)  increased  dose  proportionally  within  the  dose  range  for efficacy. Upon repeated dosing, the clearance of pembrolizumab was found to be independent of time, and systemic accumulation was approximately 2.1 fold when administered every 3 weeks. Near steady state concentrations of pembrolizumab were achieved by 18 weeks; the mean Cmin at 18 weeks was approximately  22  mcg/mL  at  a  dose  of  2  mg/kg  every  3  weeks.  The  majority  (~82%)  of  this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

accumulation  occurred  after  the  third  dose.  In  the  dose  range  studied  for  efficacy  (2  -  10  mg/kg) pembrolizumab exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner, with clearance being independent of time or pembrolizumab concentration. Pembrolizumab has relatively low to moderate PK variability [inter  subject  coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  of  22-41%].  As  also  observed  with  other  therapeutic antibodies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab), there is a deviation from linearity in the low dose range ( ≤ 1 mg/kg), which is linked to a decrease of CL with increasing doses. With doses higher than 2 mg/kg, however, exposure increases in a dose-proportional way.

The  effects  of  various  covariates  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  pembrolizumab  were  assessed  in population pharmacokinetic analyses. The clearance of pembrolizumab increased with increasing body weight; resulting exposure differences are adequately addressed by administration on a mg/kg basis. The choice to apply a body weight-based dosing regimen for pembrolizumab seemed appropriate to control  the  resulting  variability  in  exposure  across  a  broad  range  of  body  weights.  The  observed increasing  trend  in  AUCss  with  body  weight  appears  to  be  related  to  the  effect  of  body  weight  on clearance, and is unrelated to the observed effect on volume of distribution. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of pembrolizumab: age (range 15 to 94 years), gender, mild or moderate renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, and tumour burden. The effect of race could  not  be  assessed  due  to  limited  data  available  in  non  Caucasian  ethnic  groups.  No  overall differences  in  clearance  were  reported  between  elderly  patients  (65  years  and  over)  and  younger patients  (less  than  65  years),  and  for  this  reason  no  dose  adjustment  was  recommended  in  this population (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

The impact of renal or hepatic impairment on pembrolizumab PK has not been studied. Renal function has no impact on pembrolizumab clearance when evaluated as continuous covariate or as categorical classification of impairment severity. At the same time, bilirubin, AST, ALT and ALP had no impact on clearance  in  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  and  no  dose  adjustment  was  needed  in  these patients (see section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC) and has been included as missing information in the RMP.

Interaction  with  systemic  corticosteroids  (glucocorticoids)  administration  was  assessed  as  potential covariate in the population PK analysis. The population PK analysis showed that concomitant treatment of  pembrolizumab  with  corticosteroids  had  no  significant  impact  on  pembrolizumab  exposure  (P  = 0.77). Information about the lack of drug interaction studies and about concomitant administration of corticosteroid are included in section 4.5 of the SmPC and as missing information in the RMP.

The ex-vivo biomarker (IL-2 release from PBMC) study supports the lowest dose studied in the clinical program. The PK/PD evaluations and the IL-2 PK/PD model  provided an hypothesis for the clinical response based on human PK data and preclinical efficacy of an anti-PD-1 antibody.

The ability of pembrolizumab to modulate the activity of T-cells was assessed in vitro using peripheral blood  from  healthy  human  donors  or  patients  with  cancer.    This  evaluation  was  based  on  the assumption that the target engagement processes (including potential receptor up-regulation) in the peripheral blood cells were similar to tumour cells. Peripheral whole blood samples from healthy donors and  melanoma  cancer  patients  were  assayed  to  determine  the  release  of  IL-2.  Following  activation with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), pembrolizumab was equally able to enhance the IL-2 release from  both  in  healthy  subjects  and  melanoma  cancer  patients.  Pembrolizumab  enhanced  the  T-cell production of IL-2 induced by SEB up to ~3 to 4-fold in a dose-dependent fashion. Pembrolizumab also demonstrated enhanced tetanus toxoid (TT)-mediated production of IFN-gamma.

Thus, T-cell activation in peripheral blood of melanoma patients as well as the predicted tumor size reduction in response to pembrolizumab both appear to be moderate, and both analyses suggest dose-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

independence in the clinical dose range (2 mg/kg q3w and 10 mg/kg q3w). However, the assumption of exposure independence on the basis of the tumor-size-reduction model is not considered reliable as the  exposure  value  used  for  modelling  of  its  relationship  to  tumor-growth  is  derived  from  the population PK model. The high variability in the melanoma source data of the tumor-size reduction model suggest that the response to pembrolizumab is not uniform and varies for individual patients, which is conceivable for a drug with an immune-mediated mechanism of action. However, this aspect also  complicates  the  evaluation  of  an  exposure  response  relationship.  In  consequence,  despite  the acknowledged modelling effort no quantitative assumptions should be drawn on the pharmacodynamics effect of pembrolizumab from the submitted data.

The presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and their neutralizing ability was assessed in 4042 samples taken from 1094 subjects. ADA concentration results obtained in 729, out of the 997 assessable patients were considered inconclusive, due to the circulating pembrolizumab above the test tolerance level. Only in 268 patients ADA results were conclusively assessed; four patients were declared ADA positive at screening and in the confirmatory assay; in one patient ADAs were seen as treatment emergent. This single patient with a treatment-emergent immunogenicity response and no impact on the exposure to pembrolizumab was found.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab has been mainly characterised by means of a population PK model which is considered acceptable. The body weight-based dosing regimen is considered justified as body weight may have a relative impact on exposure for patients in the lowest and highest weight classes,

The CHMP recommends the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology:

- The Applicant is requested to provide the validation report for neutralizing antibodies assay. In addition, the matrix interferences for NSCLC samples and the matrix effects in unfortified lipemic human serum samples in the ADA assay should be addressed and results should be reported.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Dose response study(ies)

The development program for pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma has focused on doses that have a high likelihood of providing a meaningful efficacy response. PD-1 receptor occupancy on circulating T-cells was measured as an indication of target engagement. In addition, an ex-vivo assay measuring induction  of  IL-2  (a  measure  of  T-cell  activity)  was  used  to  assess  functional  modulation  of  target activity on circulating T-cells by pembrolizumab.

These two types of PK-PD evaluations (a clinical biomarker approach and a translational projection of clinical  response  based on pre-clinical efficacy) converge on supporting the use of 2 mg/kg Q3W as lower end of the dose range in the program. As no DLT has been observed in Part A of study P001, higher doses (10 mg/kg Q3W or Q2W) have been also explored.

Exposure  response  analysis  of  tumour  size  data  was  used  to  characterize  the  relationship  between exposure to pembrolizumab and tumour size reduction in the clinical  dose  range  of  1  mg/kg  to 10 mg/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Graphical  exploration  was  conducted  on  tumour  size  observations,  i.e.,  observed  tumour  size  per RECIST  sum  of  longest  dimensions  (SLD)  relative  to  baseline  at  specified  time  intervals  (landmark analysis).

- 1) To evaluate the progression-free-survival (PFS) in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced melanoma receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy.
- 2) To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced melanoma receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy.

## Secondary

- 1) To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced melanoma receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy.
- 2) To evaluate the response duration in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced melanoma receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Co-Primary endpoints

- 1) Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) was based on assessment from a central imaging vendor using the RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (based on assessment from a central imaging vendor using the RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. See protocol ([16.1.1], Section 3.5.5.1) for definition of censoring. For patients whose subsequent assessments right after RECIST-defined PD show a stable disease or better and who remains on study treatment, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted that does not count the initial RECIST defined PD assessment as an event. Analysis of PFS based on investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 will be performed as a supportive analysis.

- 2) Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to documented death due to any cause.

Patients without documented death at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary endpoints

- 1) Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Responses were based on confirmed assessments from a central imaging vendor using the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
- 2) Confirmed CR or PR at the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death.
- 3) ORR, PFS and OS in the biomarker positive subgroup:
- ORR: Based on proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on confirmed central review assessment (IRO) using RECIST 1.1 criteria by PD-L1 expression level.
- PFS: Based on assessment of independent central review (IRO) using RECIST 1.1 by PD-L1 expression level from randomization until progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.
- OS: Based on time from randomization to death due to any cause by PD-L1 expression level.

The PD-L1 cutoff point was defined and validated using data from the melanoma subjects in P001 prior to any biomarker analysis in P002. PD-L1 positive is defined as Allred proportion score (APS) of 2 or higher and PD-L1 negative is defined as APS of 0 or 1.

## Key Exploratory endpoints

- 1) The key PRO endpoint was the score changes from baseline and the proportions of improvement/deterioration at week 12, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life score.
- 2) The supportive PRO Endpoints were the score changes from baseline and the proportions of improvement/deterioration at week 12, as measured by each of the EORTC QLQ-C30 functional subscales and each of the

## Sample size

The study is OS event-driven and planned to randomize 510 patients with a 1:1:1 ratio into two pembrolizumab arms (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) and one control arm. If one of the pembrolizumab arms discontinued at the interim analysis, the study would complete after 245 deaths have occurred in the remaining pembrolizumab arm and the control arm.

The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1) overall survival follows an exponential distribution with a median of six months in the control arm; 2) the hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 0.65; 3) an enrollment period of 15 months and a minimum of 9 months follow-up after enrollment completion; and 4) a drop-out rate of 2% in 12 months. If both pembrolizumab arms continued to the end, barring early stopping at interim analyses, the study would complete after 370 deaths had occurred (i.e., a 50% increase from 245).

The overall type I error rate for this study was strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to PFS at the second interim analysis and 2% allocated to OS. PFS was only be tested at the second interim analysis. The Bonferroni method was used for testing the two null hypotheses on PFS at the second interim analysis with each tested at 0.25%. If any of the two null hypotheses was rejected, the corresponding alpha level was rolled into the overall OS hypothesis (i.e., the OS hypothesis tested

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at 2%, 2.25% and 2.5% respectively if none, exactly one and both hypotheses were rejected at the second interim analysis).

The PFS hypotheses will be tested at the second interim analysis when all patients were enrolled and at least 270 PFS events among three arms (at least 180 PFS events if one MK- 3475 arm is discontinued at IA 1) have occurred. By the time of the second interim analysis, approximately 180 to 200 PFS events should have occurred between one pembrolizumab arm and the control arm. With 180-200 PFS events, the study had 88% to 92% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 in PFS between a pembrolizumab arm and control at alpha=0.25% (one-sided). The sample size and power calculation for PFS were based on the following assumptions: 1) PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 2 months in the control arm, 2) the hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 0.55, 3) an enrollment period of 15 months.

With 2% to 2.5% type I error allocated to OS (depending on the number of PFS hypotheses being positive at the second interim analysis), the reference type I error rate is 1% to 1.25% between one pembrolizumab arm and control. With 245 deaths between a pembrolizumab arm and control, the study had 85% power to detect a 0.65 hazard ratio and 95% power to detect a 0.6 hazard ratio on OS at alpha=1%.

## Randomisation

An interactive voice response system (IVRS)/IXRS was used to centrally randomize subjects. Prior to entering information into IVRS, the Investigator defined the chemotherapy treatment of Investigator choice (TIC) for each subject in the event the subject was randomized to the chemotherapy arm.

Patients were randomised to one of the following treatments:

- a) 180 subjects randomized to receive pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 2 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W)
- b) 181 subjects randomized to receive pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 10 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W)
- c) 179 subjects randomized to receive chemotherapy administered according to SOC

The randomization of enrolled subjects was stratified based on ECOG performance (0 vs. 1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (normal versus elevated LDH levels) and BRAF mutational status.

## Blinding (masking)

The pembrolizumab (MK-3475) dosing assignment was blinded to site and the applicant's personnel directly associated with the conduct of the trial. The study site assigned a designated unblinded pharmacist who was responsible for preparing the pembrolizumab study medication that was administered to the subject in a blinded fashion.

The applicant had access to individual study medication data (except for the dose information of pembrolizumab) for medical monitoring purpose, while the treatment assignment (pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg) was blinded according to in-house blinding procedures. Pembrolizumab doses remained blinded for medical monitoring.

The first IA occurred after the first 120 randomized patients have a minimum of 3 months follow-up (approximately 10 months into the study). The primary objective of this analysis was to discontinue 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg from the study if one arm is clearly not as effective as the other arm. Only responses from two pembrolizumab arms (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) were compared in this analysis. The overall response rate based on assessments from a central imaging vendor between the 10 mg/kg and the 2 mg/kg arms was  evaluated. If the p-value of the difference of response rate is less than 10% (two-sided), the MK arm with lower observed response rate will be discontinued. A 15% difference (i.e., 25% in one arm and 10% in the other) will approximately meet the criterion for discontinuing the less effective arm. There was no intention to stop the trial for efficacy or futility at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

this analysis. To prevent the study from premature stopping, a nominal alpha of 0.001% is spent on the OS hypothesis with negligible impact on the overall type I error rate.

The IA2 was planned to occur when all study subjects had been enrolled and at least 270 PFS events had been observed among three arms. It was expected that at least 240 subjects would have a minimum of 4 months follow-up and approximately 210 deaths at the time of IA2, assuming no pembrolizumab arms would be dropped earlier. Between-treatment comparison of OS was tested using stratified log-rank test, the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval was estimated using the stratified Cox model with efron's tie handling. OS curve is estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method in each treatment group.

At the time of this interim analysis, 86 SOC chemotherapy subjects had crossed over to the pembrolizumab treatment arm (2 or 10 mg/kg Q3W). Of these 86 subjects, 33 (38.4%) remained in the study on pembrolizumab, 1 (1.2%) subject discontinued treatment due to AE, and 48 (55.8%) discontinued treatment due to progressive disease.

## Recruitment

As of data cut-off date (12-May-2014), the trial was conducted in 73 trial centers worldwide: 34 trial centers in the United States; 11 in Germany; 5 in France; 4 trial centers each for Netherlands, Spain,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Switzerland; 3 trial centers each for Israel and Italy; 2 in Argentina; 1 trial center each for Australia, Norway, and Sweden.

## Conduct of the study

There were 333 subjects randomized under the original protocol (P002-00), 205 subjects randomized under amendment 01 (P002-01), and two subjects randomized under amendment 02 (P002-02).

## Amendment 01

Key changes included modification to indication statement for clarity, modifications to the primary and secondary objectives (moved ORR from primary to secondary, removed evaluations for ORR, OS, and disease control rate [DCR] at Week 12). Additional key changes included modification to the IPIrefractory definition in the Inclusion Criteria (provided minimum IPI dose; added text to indicate that PD is based on irRC; clarified requirements in the absence of rapid clinical progression, added sponsor collection of imaging scans, and clarification in documenting date of progression); revised Inclusion Criterion to specify that lesions must be measured radiologically. There were modifications to the timing for the second (move to 15 months; occur after study enrollment was completed) and final analyses as well as clarifications to the efficacy measurements (defined minimal criteria that must be met in subject with radiological PD at Week 12 assessment which enabled the subject to continue receiving pembrolizumab).

Additional changes were in response to Investigator feedback and additional information gained in the progression of P001 trial. Amendment 01 also reflected changes in Inclusion Criteria regarding baseline samples collected for biomarker analysis (only newly obtained tumor tissue was acceptable) and updated the eligibility age (deleted ≥ 16 years of age and replaced with ≥ 18 years of age). Exclusion Criteria was revised to exclude subjects who received ipilimumab only as an adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy treatment arm options were reduced in response to regulatory agency feedback: carboplatin monotherapy and temozolomide IV were removed; specified dosing regimens for the chemotherapy option.

Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an SAE unless it results in hospitalization. Death unrelated to the study medication and due to progressive melanoma is not considered an SAE. Death unrelated to the study medication and due to clinical signs or symptoms of progressive melanoma (without meeting RECIST 1.1 requirement for PD) is reported as an SAE.

## Amendment 02

Key changes included modification to the efficacy analysis sections (revised test regarding Full Analysis Set [FAS], added ITT to ORR analysis), updated dose modification guidelines to indicate that pembrolizumab will be withheld in the event of a Grade 4 drug-related hematologic toxicity, modified the supportive care guidelines for Grade 2 and Grade 3 reactions, added a section providing guidance for recommended treatment in subjects who experienced pneumonitis during the trial.

## Cross-over to pembrolizumab treatment arm

Subjects in the control arm were allowed to cross over to pembrolizumab arm (dose level pre-decided at original randomization) after Week 12 and once the progressive disease was confirmed by the IRO. By the time of the data cutoff for IA2 (i.e., 12 May 2014), a total of 86 of 179 subjects (48%) who were randomized to the control arm had crossed over and were treated with pembrolizumab.

## Numbers analysed

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population served as the primary population for the analyses of PFS and OS in this study. Both ITT population and Full Analysis Set (FAS) population were used for analysis of overall ORR. The FAS included all randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline, which was defined separately under investigator evaluation and independent radiologic review. Subjects were included in the treatment group to which they were randomized for the analysis of efficacy data using both the ITT and FAS populations. The primary efficacy endpoints were PFS (i.e., time from randomization to documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

based on blinded central reviews from an external imaging vendor per RECIST 1.1 and OS (i.e., the time from randomization to death due to any cause). The secondary endpoints for this study were ORR based on confirmed responses from blinded central reviews and response duration. Progression-free survival and ORR based on investigator's assessment was analyzed as supportive analyses.

The All-Patients-as-Treated (APaT) population was employed for safety analyses.

## Outcomes and estimation - Interim Analysis 2

## Co-primary endpoint: PFS analyses based on IRO evaluation

Study P002 compared the activity of pembrolizumab in IPI-refractory melanoma versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy. Both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arms met the pre-specified criteria for a positive PFS outcome at the second interim analysis, with a HR of 0.57 and 0.50 for the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treatment arms compared to chemotherapy. The median PFS was similar in  the  three  treatment  arms,  at  2.7  months  for  the  chemotherapy  control  arm  and  2.9 months for both pembrolizumab arms by independent central review (IRO), and coincides approximately  with  the  first  scheduled  disease  assessment  at  Week  12.  Although  the  number  of subjects  at  risk  at  longer  time  points  is  small  at  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  curves  for pembrolizumab appear to flatten  out,  with  around 22%  (at  2  mg/kg  Q3W) and  24%  (at 10  mg/kg Q3W) of subjects in the pembrolizumab arms appearing to derive PFS benefit from treatment at one year and beyond, in comparison to 4% of patients in the chemotherapy arm.

Table 23 summarise the primary analysis of PFS based on IRO assessment and Figure 23 shows the KM estimate of PFS for the three treatment arms.

Figure 24: Kaplan-Meier of overall survival (ITT population)

<!-- image -->

A sensitivity analysis of OS was conducted where subjects were censored at the time of crossover. The hazard ratio was 0.85 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W over the control group and 0.75 for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W over the control group.

## Secondary endpoint: ORR based on IRO per RECIST 1.1

The ORR for pembrolizumab was 21.1% and 25.4% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, respectively, compared to 4.5% in the control arm (see Table 25).

## Ancillary analyses

## Subgroup analyses of PFS

A number of sensitivity analyses, pre-specified and post-hoc, using different censoring rules, or based on  scheduled  tumour  assessment,  were  performed.  The  results  confirm  the  primary  PFS  analyses. Results from PFS analysis based on investigator evaluation are reported below:

Study P006: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Three-Arm, Phase III Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing Schedules of MK3475 Compared to Ipilimumab in Patients with Advanced Melanoma Interim Analysis 1 (IA1) and 2 (IA2)

## Methods

This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, three-arm pivotal study of two dosing regimens of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab versus IPI in patients with unresectable or metastatic MEL who have not received IPI treatment.

## Study Participants

Main inclusion criteria:

1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable stage III or metastatic melanoma not amenable to local therapy.
- Patient may not have a diagnosis of uveal or ocular melanoma.
- Patients who have not received prior systemic treatment (excluding adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy) for melanoma (first line) or who have received one prior systemic treatment (excluding adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy) for melanoma (second line) are both eligible.
- Patients must have testing for a BRAF mutation prior to study entry. Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma may have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy as first-line systemic therapy and be eligible for this study as second line treatment. At the discretion of the investigator, patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma who have NOT received a BRAF inhibitor are also eligible for this study as first line treatment if they meet the following additional criteria:
5. o LDH &lt; local ULN

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o No clinically significant tumor related symptoms in the judgment of the investigator
- o Absence of rapidly progressing metastatic melanoma in the judgment of the investigator
2. ECOG 0 or 1 and adequate organ function
3. Patient has a tumor sample (archival or newly obtained biopsy) that is adequate for PD-L1 assessment prior to randomization. Patients will be eligible to participate regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression, but will be stratified by PD-L1 expression level (high or low PD-L1 expression level) at the time of randomization
4. Measurable disease

## Main exclusion criteria:

1. Patient had prior treatment with IPI or other anti-CTLA-4 agent, any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti- PD-L2 agent.
2. Patient who has had chemotherapy, radioactive, or biological cancer therapy within four weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, or who has not recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or better from the AEs due to cancer therapeutics administered more than four weeks earlier.
3. Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 30 days of the first dose of study drug.
4. Patient is expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy while on study.
5. Patient is on any systemic corticosteroid therapy within one week before the planned date for first dose of randomized treatment or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication.
6. Patient has a history of a malignancy (other than the disease under treatment in the study) within 5 years prior to first study drug administration. This should exclude adequately treated Stage 1 or Stage 2 basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or other in situ cancers.
7. Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by MRI for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of study drug), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and are off systemic steroids for at least two weeks.
8. Patient previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another mAb.
9. Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.
10. Patient has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

## Treatments

Patients randomized to one of the pembrolizumab arms received pembrolizumab as IV infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg given once every 2 weeks or once every 3 weeks, for up to 2 years until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, confirmed complete response, withdrawal of consent, or they require another form of antineoplastic therapy as determined by the Investigator. Patients randomized to the IPI arm will receive IPI at 3 mg/kg as IV infusion once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses.

Patients on the IPI arm will receive IPI treatment for a total of 4 doses according to the label. Patients will remain on study and will continue to be monitored with scheduled disease assessments up to 24 months as described in the protocol for safety and efficacy evaluations until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, the withdrawal of consent, or they require another form of antineoplastic therapy as determined by the Investigator. Patients receiving IPI are not eligible for re-treatment with IPI as part of study treatment.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate for superiority of pembrolizumab to IPI in PFS or OS. The overall type I error rate for this study is strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to PFS and 2.0% allocated to the overall OS hypothesis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study will be progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Other endpoints include response rate, response duration, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and safety.

After the baseline tumor evaluation, tumor assessment during the study will be performed by radiological scans every 6 weeks starting from Week 12 until Week 48. At the discretion of investigators, patients who remain on study after 48 weeks and are clinically stable may decrease imaging frequency to every 12 weeks. Patients will be evaluated for tumor response and patient management by sites based on the Immune Related Response Criteria [irRC] (Appendix 6.6 with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

further details outlined in IIOM) by the investigator with site radiology reading. Copies of tumor images will be collected and provided to a central imaging vendor, and subjected to independent central review. Independent central review will utilize RECIST 1.1 criteria for response assessment. During the course of the study, the Data Monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor all safety information to ensure patient safety in accordance with a separate charter. The DMC will also evaluate the data at the planned interim analyses and make recommendations of stopping or continuing the study according to a separate charter. There are two planned interim efficacy analyses. The primary objective of the first interim analysis is to demonstrate clinical benefit in PFS. The study may stop early for futility based on PFS and OS at the first interim analysis. The primary objective of the second interim analysis is to evaluate treatment effect based on OS. In addition to the IAs, the study will also take into account data external to the study from PN001, which also has an ongoing cohort of advanced melanoma patients who are being randomized to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. As data from PN001 may become available prior to the first IA for PN006, if there is sufficient evidence of superiority or futility for one of the two dosing regimens of pembrolizumab from data external to the study, the SPONSOR may elect to discontinue one of the two pembrolizumab arms in PN006 prior to the first interim analysis via a protocol amendment.

## Sample size

The study will enrol approximately 645 patients randomized to one of two pembrolizumab arms or IPI in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by line of therapy, PD-L1 expression and ECOG performance status. The sample size was based on a target of 435 OS events among the two pembrolizumab arms and IPI arm at the final analysis of OS.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to IPI (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years, or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. The study was stratified by line of therapy (1st vs. 2nd), PD-L1 status (high positive vs. low positive) and ECOG (0 vs. 1).

## Blinding (masking)

This study was designed as an open label study.

## Statistical methods

The study is considered to be positive if at least one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in PFS at an interim analysis OR at least one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in OS at either an interim analysis or the final analysis of OS.

The data cutoff date for IA1 was 03SEP2014, driven by the fact that all patients have had at least 6 months of follow-up, which was deemed important for unbiased estimation of PFS effect based on data from PN001. The over enrollment and the requirement of a minimum of 6 months follow-up for all patients led to the actual number of PFS events of 489 based on IRO assessments at IA1.

The overall type I error rate for this study was controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to PFS and 2.0% allocated to the overall OS hypothesis. The study is consider to be positive if at least one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in PFS at an interim analysis OR at least one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in OS at either an interim analysis or the final analysis of OS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IA2 was planned to take place when minimum follow-up is at least 9 months and approximately 290 deaths have been observed, unless it takes longer than 12 months of follow-up to observe 290 deaths, in which case the analysis would be performed when the minimum follow-up is 12 months. The data cutoff  date  for  IA2  was  03-Mar-2015,  driven  by  the  minimum  follow-up  of  12  months.  The  total number of deaths is 289. The median OS follow-up is 13.8 months. OS was tested at the alpha level of 0.005 using the Hochberg step-up procedure at IA2 . Using the Hochberg procedure, if the p-value for both pembrolizumab arms is &lt;0.005, both pembrolizumab arms are superior to IPI arm in OS; if the least  significant  (larger)  p-value  is  &gt;0.005  then  the  most  significant  (smaller)  p-value  needs  to  be compared with 0.0025 (0.005/2).

## Results

## Recruitment

Enrollment of PN006 was completed in 6 months on 03MAR2014 with a total of 834 patients randomized, which is 29% over the target enrollment of 645 patients.

## Conduct of the study

In order to best evaluate the overall survival objective of this study, patients who progress during the study will not be allowed to cross-over from one arm to the other as part of study therapy, and patients who progress on the IPI arm will be excluded from participation in other pembrolizumab trials unless the DMC or the SPONSOR determine that the study has achieved its efficacy objective(s). Following the results from the IA1, the DMC recommended unblinding the study internally to facilitate regulatory filing while continuing study follow-up.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint for IA1: PFS based on IRO review per RECIST 1.1

Both pembrolizumab arms met the pre-specified criteria for a positive PFS outcome at the first interim analysis, with a HR of 0.58 for both treatment arms (individually) compared to IPI ( one-sided p-value &lt;0.00001 in both comparisons, favoring pembrolizumab) (Table 38 and Figure 25).

The primary PFS analysis was based on independent central review, applying RECIST 1.1. A supportive analysis based on investigator disease assessments, applying irRC criteria showed very similar results (HR 0.56 in both individual pembrolizumab arms over the control, one-sided p-value &lt;0.00001).The median PFS is 7.0 months in pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm, 7.2 months in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, and 3.3 months in the control arm. Six-month PFS rates are 55% for both of the pembrolizumab arms compared to 34% for the IPI arm.

## Primary endpoint for IA2: OS

The primary objective of the planned second interim analysis (IA2) was to evaluate treatment effect based on OS. The total number of deaths is 289. The median OS follow-up is 13.8 months.

## Secondary endpoint: Overall response

The ORR is 33.7% in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm, 32.9% in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, and 11.9% in the control arm based on independent radiologist plus oncologist review. Since most of the responses are ongoing in each arm the median DoR has not been reached.

A supplemental subgroup analysis based on BRAF mutation status from Study P006 was submitted. Since in this study patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma may or may not have received a prior BRAF inhibitor, depending on the baseline presence/absence of elevated LDH, clinically significant tumour related symptoms or rapidly progressing disease in the judgment of the investigator, patients who had BRAF mutant tumours and were BRAF inhibitor naive had more favourable disease characteristics than the other subgroups. In contrast, patients with BRAF mutant tumours who had received prior BRAF inhibitor had the worst baseline characteristics.

The subgroup analysis based on BRAF status shows a substantial benefit in terms of PFS, OS and ORR in all subgroups, with an effect slightly less evident in patients with BRAF mutant tumours who had received prior BRAF inhibitor.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No dedicated studies in special population have been conducted.

Overall, 492 ≥65 years patients (41%) have been included in the studies P001 and P002. More than 10% of patients enrolled were ≥75 years old.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Various pooled analyses across cohorts with all patients combined or segregated by prior ipilimumab exposure were performed.

An  integrated  efficacy  analysis  of  study  P001  Part  B2  and  study  P002  have  been  conducted, considering the similar patients population (IPI-refractory melanoma  patients) and  the  same pembrolizumab regimens compared. In both studies, patients were required to have confirmed PD in the  absence  of  rapid  clinical  progression,  with  progression  first  documented  within  6  months  (24 weeks) of the last dose of IPI (minimum of 2 doses). In addition, subjects with BRAF V600 mutant melanoma must have had a prior treatment regimen that includes vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or other approved BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors. Both Part B2 of P001 and P002 compared 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W in a randomized fashion.

The overall efficacy profile is consistent between the two trials:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Confirmed responses (CR + PR) were reported in 22% (95% CI: 18-28%) of patients who were treated at  2  mg/kg  Q3W  compared  to  25%  (95%  CI:  20-31%) of  subjects  who  were  treated  at  10  mg/kg Q3W, including complete responses in 3% (95% CI: 1-5%) and 4% (95% CI: 2-7%) at 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectively. In both treatment arms, approximately 43% of patients achieved disease control.

The median response duration has not been reached at the time of the analysis and ranged from 5+ to 62+ weeks.

At the time of this analysis, 70% of the subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W cohort and 69% of the subjects in the 10 mg/kg Q3W cohort had a PFS event (progression by independent central review or death). The median PFS was 3 months for both the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment groups. The 6-month progression-free  rate  was 37%  for  both  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W  group  and  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W group.

The median OS was not reached for the 2 mg/kg Q3W group and was 18.3 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W group and the lower bound of the 95% CI was 10.9 and 11.5 for the 2 mg/kg Q3W group and the 10 mg/kg Q3W group, respectively, and the upper bound of the CI was not estimable for either group. The OS rate at 6 months was comparable in both treatment groups with 75% for subjects treated 2 mg/kg Q2W and 76% for subjects treated 10 mg/kg Q3W. The 12-month OS rate was comparable for the 2 dose groups, with 53% alive in the 2 mg/kg Q2W group vs. 56% alive in for the 10 mg/kg Q3W group.

## Analysis of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry in melanoma patients from P001 (Parts B1+B2+D)

The  relationship  between  tumour  PD-L1  expression  via  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  and  the  antitumour activity of pembrolizumab was evaluated to examine the potential usefulness of this assay to identify patients responsive to pembrolizumab treatment.

PD-L1 expression was scored by board-certified pathologists. The Allred Proportion Score (APS) was chosen because it is basic (a six-point scale), it is familiar to pathologists, and has been shown to be a highly reproducible method of scoring hormone receptors in breast cancer. The scoring method for PDL1 omits an intensity score for simplicity. The cut-off of APS=2 was selected. The proposed cut-off of APS=2 was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 49.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.7%.

The following table displays the breakdown of confirmed responses by APS score:

Across the 534  IPI-refractory subjects  in  P001  and  P002  combined  who  were  treated  with pembrolizumab,  410  (77%)  subjects  were  evaluable  for  PD-L1  expression,  including  295  (72%) subjects  PD-L1  positive  and  115  (28%)  subjects  are  PD-L1  negative  as  defined  by  the  assay  and scoring methods used for these studies.

The ORR was 24% (95% CI: 20-28%) in the 410 PD-L1 evaluable subjects, slightly higher in PD-L1 positive subjects (28%, 95% CI: 23-33%), whereas was lower in PD-L1 negative patients (13%, 95% CI 8-21%). In responding subjects, the median duration of response was not reached, regardless of PD-L1 status, and 91% (PD-L1 positive) to 80% (PD-L1 negative) were non-progressing at the time of the  analysis.  The  median PFS  was  4.2  months  in  PD-L1  positive  and 2.8  months  in  PD-L1  negative patients.  In  PD-L1  negative  patients,  the  6-month  and  12  month  PFS  rate  was  25%  and  14%, respectively. Median OS is currently 18.5 months for PD-L1 positive and approximately 11 months for PD-L1 negative patients.

## Supportive study(ies)

Study P001: 'Phase I study of single agent MK-3475 in patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma, melanoma, and NonSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma'

Study P001 was a multi-center, open-label, first in human Phase 1 trial in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, NSCLC, or advanced solid tumor. The trial was initially designed as a standard dose escalation study, now called Part A, in which several melanoma patients were enrolled and had objective responses. Therefore, the study was expanded to evaluate efficacy in melanoma in Part B (now Part B1). Through a series of amendments, P001 evolved into 4 Phase 2-like melanoma sub-studies, known as Parts B1, B2, B3, and D. In addition, study P001 was further expanded in Parts C and F to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab in NSCLC.

All cohorts of study P001 are depicted in the following Figure:

Figure 31: Trial Design P001

Part B1 was the initial evaluation of the efficacy of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma, including subjects who were naïve to IPI or who had been previously treated with IPI. In Cohort B2, eligibility criteria required the enrolment of patient that were refractory ipilimumab (progression documented in two separate assessment and following at least 2 doses of IPI at a minimum dose of 3 mg/kg and within 6 months of the last dose of IPI) and excluded patients that were potentially delayed IPI responders. Furthermore, patients with known BRAF V600E mutations were required to have received a prior BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor, and could have received an unlimited number of prior therapies. Part B3 enrolled both IPI-naïve and IPI-exposed (treated or refractory) patients. Eligibility criteria in part D allowed the enrolment of IPI-naïve patients that may have received up to 2 prior lines of treatment. Of note, patients with known BRAF V600E mutation may or may have not received prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

Across the cohorts, pembrolizumab has been administered at 3 different dosing regimens: 2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W in Part B1; 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in both Cohorts B2 and D; 10 mg/kg Q2W or 10 mg/kg Q3W in Part B3.

The correlation of the extent of tumour response with the degree of biomarker positivity in IPI-naïve patients treated with pembrolizumab, and the anti-tumour activity per RECIST 1.1 of pembrolizumab in IPI-refractory melanoma patients both unselected and with PD-L1 expressing tumours were also considered for evaluation.

## Baseline characteristics

## Part B1 (IPI-naïve and IPI-treated)

Hundred-thirty  five  patients  (IPI-naïve  and  IPI-treated)  were  enrolled  in  Part  B1  (22  patients  at  2 mg/kg  Q3W,  56  patients  at  10  mg/kg  Q3W,  and  57  patients  at  10  mg/kg  Q2W).  In  the  total  B1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population, 59% of patients were male and 46% were ≥65 years old. All but 2 patients were white and 73% of patients were ECOG PS 0. A majority of the patients had had no history of brain metastasis (92%)  and  22%  harbored  BRAF  V600  mutations.  69%  of  patients  had  elevated  baseline  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and in 72% the stage of disease was M1c. In addition, 50 patients had at least 2 prior  systemic  therapies.  In  the  total  population,  27%  had  been  previously  treated  with  an immunotherapy (excluding IPI), 34% had previously received chemotherapy, and only 10% had been previously treated with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or trametinib). There was no notable difference in prior therapy between arms.

## Part B2 (IPI-Refractory)

Hundred-seventy three IPI-refractory patients were randomized in this Cohort (89 subjects at 2 mg/kg Q3W and 84 subjects at 10 mg/kg Q3W). In this Part, 60% of subjects were male and 36% were 65 years  old  or  older.  All  but  5  subjects  were  white,  and  67%  of  patients  were  ECOG  PS  0.  Most  of patients had no history of brain metastasis (91%) and 17% harbored BRAF V600 mutations. Subjects in Part B2 had significant tumor burden at baseline evidenced by 42% with elevated baseline LDH and 82%  with  stage  M1c  melanoma.  Approximately  73%  (126/173)  of  subjects  had  at  least  2  prior systemic therapies; 32% had been previously treated with an immunotherapy (excluding IPI), 47% had previously received chemotherapy, and the remainder (21%) had other (unclassified) therapy. A previous treatment with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor is registered in around 20%.

## Part B3 (IPI-naïve and IPI-exposed)

Two-hundred forty four patients (IPI-naïve and IPI-exposed) enrolled (121 patients at 10 mg/kg Q3W and 123 patients at 10 mg/kg Q2W).In this Cohort, 65% of subjects were male, and 40% were ≥65 years old. All but 8 subjects were white and 59% of subjects were ECOG PS 0. In this Part, nearly a quarter of the subjects (24%) harbored BRAF V600 mutations, 41 % had elevated baseline LDH and 80% stage M1c melanoma. In addition, 91% of subjects had no history of brain metastasis and 93 of the 244 subjects (38%) had at least 2 prior systemic therapies.

There  were  123  subjects  naïve  to  IPI,  while  121  subjects  received  prior  IPI  (IPI-treated  or  IPIrefractory). In the total population, 25% had been previously treated with an immunotherapy and 28% had previously received chemotherapy, including 18% previously treated with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor. The treatment arms were generally comparable although a higher percentage of subjects in the 10 mg/kg  Q3W  arm  previously  treated  with  a  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  (22%  vs  14%).  Overall,  59  (24%) subjects  had  BRAF  mutant  melanoma,  and  44  (18%)  were  previously  treated  with  an  approved BRAF/MEK inhibitor (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or trametinib) prior to study entry.

## Part D (IPI-Naïve)

Hundred-three IPI-naïve patients were enrolled (51 patients at 2 mg/kg Q3W and 52 patients at 10 mg/kg  Q3W).  In  this  Part  D,  61%  of  subjects  were  male  and  36%  were  ≥65  years  old.  All  but  4 subjects were white and 85% of subjects were ECOG PS 0. A majority of the patients had no history of brain metastasis (93%) and 35% harbored BRAF V600 mutations. Baseline LDH was elevated in 35% of  patients  and  stage  M1c  melanoma  was  registered  in  72%.  In  the  total  population,  previous treatment was immunotherapy in 20%, chemotherapy in 20%, and BRAF/MEK inhibitor (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or trametinib) in 18%. The treatment arms were generally comparable with regard to prior therapy, with the exception of a higher percentage of previously treated subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm (65%) compared to the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm (52%).

## Results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is ORR by independent central review (IRO) using RECIST 1.1. The primary method of analysis includes review of images by independent radiologists and review of objective clinical data (e.g. qualitative skin photographs, biopsy reports from suspicious lesions if performed)  by  independent  oncologists  when  such  data  were  available,  referred  to  as  the  IRO assessment.  In  P001,  subjects  were  managed  by  irRC  based  on  Investigator  assessment,  and independent central review was also performed based on irRC.

The primary analyses are based on the FAS population including all patients who received at least one dose  of  study  treatment  and  with  measurable  disease  as  defined  by  independent  central  review. Therefore, due to discrepancies between investigator and central reviewers the FAS population did not include  all  treated  patients.  The  response  rate  has  also  been  analysed  in  the  APaT  population  (All Patients as Treated, consisting in all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment).

A summary of ORR based on different methods of analysis across all doses is shown below:

Data Cutoff Date 18-Apr-2014

* FAS population by investigator assessment is the same as the APaT population, indicating that all patients treated filfilled the eligibility criterion of having at least one measurable lesion according to investigator assessment.

Duration of Objective responses

The 135 patients in Part B1 were followed for the longest duration of time, having been enrolled between 1-Dec-2012 and 6-Sep-2012, and thus had at least 18 months of follow-up data at the time of the data cutoff for this analysis (18-Apr-2014). There were 51 patients with a confirmed objective response across all dose levels tested, and the median time to response was 13 weeks (range 10-84), which coincides primarily with the protocol-determined time of disease response assessment. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

median response duration has not been reached for the 2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W cohorts, while was 93 weeks for the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. Response durations ranged from 11+ to 98+ weeks. Among the 51 responses, 37 (73%) patients have non-PD by IRO.

In Part B2, patients were enrolled between 24-Aug-2012 and 5-Apr-2013, and thus had at least 12 months of follow-up at the time of the analysis. There were a total of 43 confirmed objective responses, with duration ranging from 12+ to 62+ weeks at the time of the analysis. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 7-48), which coincides primarily with the protocol-determined time of disease response assessment. The median response duration was not reached. Similar duration of response was reported with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W. Over 90% of patients (91% for 2 mg/kg Q3W and 90% for 10 mg/kg Q3W) had no disease progression.

In Part B3 patients were enrolled between 18-Apr-2013 and 13-Sep-2013, and thus had approximately 6 months of follow-up. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 11-42). There were 74 patients with a confirmed objective response across all dose levels tested. The median response duration has not been reached for the cohort as a whole (range: 6+ to 36+ weeks), nor for any individual pembrolizumab dose. 91% of patients had non-PD by independent central review.

Patients in Part D were enrolled between 7-Sep-2012 and 11-Jan-2013, and thus had at least 15 months of follow-up. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 11-39) and response duration ranged from 6+ to 61+ weeks across both arms. 83% of patients had non-PD at the time of the analysis.

## Progression Free Survival

PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology, and the primary method of analysis was based on RECIST 1.1 measurements by IRO assessments in the APaT population.

In Part B1, the median PFS was 13.6 months for the 2 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 5.5 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 8.8 months for 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment arm, and 7.2 months for all patients regardless of dose schedule. These results compare with those previously reported in which the median PFS was 72 weeks (16.6 months) for the 2 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 24 weeks (5.5 months) for the 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 50 weeks (11.5 months) for 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment arm, and 31 weeks (7.1 months) for all patients in the B1 cohort.

In Cohort B2, the median PFS was 4.9 months for the 2 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm and 3.2 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm (HR 0.90, p=0.6).

In Part B3, the median PFS was 3.0 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W and 5.2 months for the 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment arm (HR = 1.19, p=0.3).

In Cohort D, the median PFS was 5.5 months for the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 4.2 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm (HR = 0.87, p=0.5).

A  comparison  of  PFS  as  determined  by  IRO  per  RECIST  1.1  and  IRO  per  irRC  is  displayed  in  the following Table 51.

## Overall Survival

Of the 135 patients in the APaT population in Part B1, 47 (35%) were reported to have died at the time of the analysis. The median OS was not reached for the entire study population or for any of the individual dose levels (95% CI 24.4 to not estimable). The 12-month and 18-month OS rates were respectively 81% and 62%.

In Part B2, there were a total of 70 deaths among 173 patients across both treatment arms. The median OS was not reached for the 2 mg/kg Q3W cohort (95% CI was 10.9 to not estimable) and was 18.3 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W cohort (95% CI 11.4 to not estimable). There was no significant difference in OS between treatment arms (p=0.920). The 12-month OS rate was comparable for the 2 dose cohorts, with 60% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm vs. 62% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. The 18-month OS rate was very similar to the 12-month OS rate, with 57% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W vs. 62% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm.

Of the 244 patients in the APaT population in Part B3, 36 (30%) were reported to have died in the 10 mg/kg Q3W cohort compared with 42 (34%) in the 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort at the time of the analysis. There was no significant difference in OS between treatment arms. The OS rate at 6 months was 75%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm and 77% for the 10 mg/kg Q2W arm. The median OS and the OS rate at 12 months for both cohorts had not been reached at the time of data cut off.

In Part D, the median OS was not reached, with no significant difference in OS between treatment arms. The 12-month OS rate using the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 2 dose cohorts was 72% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and 64% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. The 18-month OS rate was 61% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and 55% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm.

The OS analyses are summarized in the table below:

## Subgroup analysis in the pooled melanoma population (B1+B2+B3+D)

Subgroup analyses were performed based on major demographic factors and potentially important prognostic factors for patients with advanced melanoma. Analyses of patient cohorts based on dose and prior IPI treatment were pre-specified, while other subgroups were not pre-specified, but analyzed as post-hoc.

In the pooled melanoma population, including 655 subjects in the APaT population from Parts B1, B2, D, and B3, the ORR is 31% (95% CI 28-35%). No important differences were observed in ORR based on the age or gender of patients treated with pembrolizumab. Subjects with ECOG PS 0 versus 1, and baseline LDH normal versus elevated had generally similar ORR compared to the overall study population. With respect to M-stage, subjects with M1b tumor stage (lung metastases without other visceral metastases and with a normal LDH) had a higher ORR than the overall study population (52% vs. 31% in the B1/B2/B3/D pooled cohort). Subjects with M1c stage (non-pulmonary visceral metastases or elevated LDH) had a similar ORR to the overall population (27% vs 31%)

The 54 subjects with a history of brain metastases had a similar ORR (33%) compared to subjects without brain metastases (31%).

There were 155 subjects with BRAF mutations in the APaT population, and the ORR was 23% compared to 33% in subjects with a wild-type BRAF gene. Among the 110 subjects with reported prior treatment with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor, the ORR was 21% (95% CI: 14- 30%) in this subgroup.

## Uveal melanoma

P001 enrolled a total of 20 subjects with uveal melanoma (3 subjects at 2 mg/kg Q3W; 14 subjects at 10 mg/kg Q3W; and 3 subjects at 10 mg/kg Q2W) across all parts of the study (B1, B2, B3, and D). As of  the  18-Apr-2014  cutoff  date,  there  were  no  objective  responses  based  on  IRO  assessment  per RECIST 1.1 in these 20 subjects, while there were 6 subjects (2 subjects for each dose cohort) with stable disease as the best response.

Best overall response based on IRO assessment per RECIST 1.1 for subjects with uveal melanoma in P001 is described in the table below.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

In order to support the indication for pembrolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable and metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2mg/kg Q3W, the applicant submitted the data from an ongoing phase I study P001 cohorts B1, B2, B3 and D, data from a randomised, controlled trial of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in IPI refractory advance melanoma patients study P002 and the early results of a randomised, controlled study P006 of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in IPI naïve patients. To support the first line indication in melanoma patients untreated with ipilumumab, data from patients randomised to cohort B1 and B3 which were naïve to ipilumumab as well as patients in cohort D and study P006, which recruited patients naïve to ipilimumab were submitted. For the support of the last line indication, patients that were previously treated with ipilimumab were recruited in cohort B1 (treated with ipilimumab), B2 (refractory to ipilimumab), B3 (treated and/or refractory to ipilimumab) as well as patients recruited for study P002 (refractory).. All trials are currently still ongoing.

During the assessment, the CHMP had requested a triggered GCP inspection for study P001, which had been subject to eight amendments.  This study was initially submitted as the single pivotal trial to support the application in the broad indication and there were concerns identified during the assessment in relation to the Clinical Study report (CSR), with apparent inconsistency in the data presented in the submission and with that presented in the publication of the results of the trial 16 . The results of the inspection showed no critical findings and the overall conduct of the trial was found acceptable, providing reassurance on the integrity and reliability of the data.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## Dose rationale

Alternative schedules (10 mg/kg Q3w and 10 mg/kg Q2W) were evaluated in Study P001, and also in the on-going comparative studies P002 (IPI-refractory patients: 2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and P006 (IPI-naive patients: 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W). The CHMP was initially concerned that the 10 mg/kg dose in study P002 had shown a better efficacy compared with the proposed dose 2 mg/kg for the indication.  A higher ORR at 10 mg/kg Q2W dose was shown in comparison to other doses tested (2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W) in cohort B1 as well. Subsequent investigations and analyses across studies presented by the applicant demonstrated that this high response in a single group appeared to be a chance event as the totality of the currently available data, including randomized cohort comparisons, was consistent with a lack of statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in response across these doses and regimens.  Exposure-response analyses at the individual trial level revealed that no clinically relevant exposure-response relationship was observed. Further analyses with an integrated exposure-response analysis for clinical efficacy, including all melanoma studies (P001, P002 and P006) showed a non- significant relationship between

pembrolizumab exposure and change in tumour size, which was slightly more evident in IPI-naïve patients. Box plots representing the 25 th -75 th  percentile spread of change in tumour showed an overlap between the boxes at the different exposure level, with no apparent exposure-response relationship. No differences were seen across the wide range of exposures (&lt;660 µg/ml to &gt;8010 µg/ml) and doses (1 to 10 mg/kg). Based on these analyses, the CHMP is reassured that the extrapolation of the data shown in the trial P006 with the dose 10 mg/kg can be considered applicable for the 2mg/kg and that no differences in the efficacy are to be expected between the two doses.

## Efficacy

## Treatment of ipilimumab naïve patients

The use of pembrolizumab in IPI-naive patients was supported by Study P001, part D and preliminary data from Study P006.

Study P001, Part D, enrolled a patient population with similar characteristics of Study P006.

In study P001, around 35% of confirmed responses were reported in IPI-naive patients (37% and 35% in FAS and APaT population, respectively); an ORR of 33.3 has been reported at the proposed recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W (see section 5.1 of the SmPC); overall, approximately half of the IPI-naïve patients achieved disease control as the best response (52.2% and 53.4% in FAS and APaT population, respectively). As for IPI-refractory patients, data on the duration of stable disease were reported showing an overall median duration of stable disease of 36 weeks (48.1 and 25.9 weeks for 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arm, respectively), and the median duration of response was not reached

Study P006 enrolled patients with or without BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. Patients may have received a prior BRAF inhibitor, but it was not required if patients had normal LDH, no clinically significant tumour related symptoms and absence of rapidly progressing disease. All patients were required to submit a tumour tissue sample for PD-L1 expression evaluation. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the two pembrolizumab arms or IPI, and were stratified according to PD-L1 expression and ECOG PS. Cross-over was not allowed in order to avoid confoundment of OS results.

Overall baseline characteristics were well balanced in the three arms. Almost all patients (97.8%) were of white race. Around 60% of patients were male, and there was a slight prevalence of patients &lt; 65 years old (56.5%). Over 65.3% of patients had stage M1c, and about 68% of patients had received no prior systemic therapies lines of treatment for advanced disease. The prevalence of BRAF mutation was higher than in study P002 and P001, with 36.2% of subjects with BRAF mutant tumours, and 18.1% of subjects had received prior BRAF inhibitor; PD-L1 status was missing in a slight minority of patients (1.6%), while 80.5 of patients had PD-L1 positive staining tumours.

The IA1 part of Study P006 was performed at the pre-specified 0.002 alpha level for each pembrolizumab arm compared to the ipilimumab arm. Based on a total of 502 events, with a minimum of 6-month follow-up, the HR is 0.58 for both pembrolizumab arms over IPI. The median PFS is 5.5 months in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm, 4.1 months in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, and 2.8 months in the control arm. The 6 month PFS rate is 47.3% (95% CI; 41.2%, 53.2%) in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm and 46.4% (95% CI; 40.3%, 52.3%) in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, compared to 26.5% (95% CI; 20.9%, 32.4%) in the control arm.

The subgroup analyses for PFS show a consistent effect in all subgroups, at each pembrolizumab dose level.

The data cut-off date for IA2 was 03-mar-2015, and is based on a total of 289 OS events (66% of the 435 target events at the final analysis) with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and a median follow-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

up of 13.8 months. OS was tested at the alpha level of 0.005. The hazard ratio for OS is 0.63 (p=0.00052) for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W over the control arm and 0.69 (p=0.00358 ) for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W over the control arm, respectively, with no difference between the two pembrolizumab arms compared to each other (HR 0.91, p=0.51319) (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). The median OS has not yet been reached in all three arms, and the 12-month OS rates are 74.1% (95% CI: 68.5%, 78.9%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 62.5%, 73.6%) for pembrolizumab at Q2W and Q3W, respectively, compared to 58.2% (95% CI: 51.8%, 64.0%) in the control arm.

Overall, the provided results of Study P006 confirm preliminary observations from Study P001, Part D, and show a clinically meaningful advantage of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab in IPI-naive patients with unresectable advanced melanoma and support the proposed indication which includes patients that have not been treated with ipilimumab.

## Treatment of ipilimumab refractory patients

Data on the use of pembrolizumab in IPI-refractory patients were based on the results of Study P002 and supported by Study P001, part B2.

Overall baseline characteristics were well balanced in the three arms. The prevalence of BRAF mutation was less than expected in unselected population, with 23.1% of subjects with BRAF mutant tumours. PD-L1 status was undetermined in 22% of patients, and 53.9% of patients had PD-L1 positive tumours.

Study P001, Part B2, enrolled a patient population with similar characteristics.

Results from IA2 of Study P002 showed a substantial benefit from the treatment with pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy, with a PFS HR of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.73) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.64) in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, respectively, versus the chemotherapy arm (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

Overall, no clinically or statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 pembrolizumab doses, even though a trend towards better efficacy was reported with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg. Subgroups analyses showed a consistent effect in all subgroups. At the time of this interim analysis, 86 (48%) chemotherapy subjects had crossed over to the pembrolizumab treatment arm (2 or 10 mg/kg Q3W) confounding the OS results. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn on the OS at this stage.

The ORR observed in study P002 is comparable to that observed in Study P001, including a similar patient population. The median time to response was similar for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy and was consistent with the first scheduled tumour assessment. Interestingly, responses occurred up to 30 weeks in both the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and 10 mg/kg Q3W pembrolizumab arm, and only up to 18 weeks in the control arm. Median response duration was not reached in either of pembrolizumab arms, while been 37 weeks in the control arm.

P001 enrolled a total of 20 subjects with uveal melanoma. The sample size was too small to draw any conclusions. The information on limited available data in patients with ocular melanoma is reported in the SmPC section 5.1.

Overall, results from the randomized phase 2 Study P002, IA2, confirmed the benefit observed in Study P001 Part B2 in the IPI-refractory population, and demonstrated a substantial advantage of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy, supporting the proposed indication which includes patients that have been previously treated with ipilimumab (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

Patients with tumours designated as PD-L1 positive and BRAF V600 mutation positive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The benefits observed in the overall patient population in studies P001, P002 and P006 appear to be consistent across all subgroups analysed, although in some cases it appears more limited in the PD-L1 negative subset. For study P006, it is acknowledged that the study was not sufficiently powered for subgroup analyses, and that confidence intervals are quite large and overlapping, due to the relatively small sample size. The CHMP was concerned over the substantial higher rate of events observed in the PD-L1 negative subset relative to the PD-L1 positive subgroup for both PFS (70.6 vs 60.7% patients with a PFS event in the PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive subgroups, respectively) and OS (45.6% vs 34% of patients with an OS event in the PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive subgroups, respectively). However, the integrated exposure-response analysis provided by the applicant showed a similar lack of exposure-efficacy correlation with PD-L1 expression status as well as for patients with BRAF V600 mutated tumours. These results provided reassurance to the CHMP that no differences in efficacy are to be expected for patients that have tumours designated as PD-L1 negative and for patients that harbour the BRAF V600 mutation. In order to further support the analysis of the data provided in the application and strengthen interpretation of data which is hampered by the scarse number of patients in these subgroups, the CHMP has imposed a post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) to have the updated efficacy data from the P002 final analysis and from Parts B2 and D of P001 (data cut-off date:18-Oct-2014) by dose level based on BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression status as these uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal product in the sub-populations could not be resolved prior to marketing authorisation and require further clinical evidence.

## BRAF mutation status

A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-002 in patients who were BRAF wild type (n=415; 77%) or BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment (n=125; 23%) was performed. The PFS HRs (pooled pembrolizumab [2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks] vs. chemotherapy) were 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.65) for BRAF wild type and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.85) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The PFS HRs for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 0.51 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.67) for BRAF wild type and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.18) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The OS HRs for pooled pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.15) for BRAF wild type and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.43) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The OS HRs for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.18) for BRAF wild type and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.91) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. ORR for pooled pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy was 27% and 25% vs. 6% for BRAF wild type and 12% and 9% vs. 0% for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment.

A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-006 in patients who were BRAF wild type (n=525; 63%), BRAF mutant without prior BRAF treatment (n=163; 20%) and BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment (n=139; 17%) was performed. The PFS hazard ratios (HRs) (pooled pembrolizumab [10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks] vs. ipilimumab) were 0.57 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.73) for BRAF wild type, 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.77) for BRAF mutant without prior BRAF treatment, and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.11) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The OS HRs for pooled pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab were 0.61 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.82) for BRAF wild type, 0.69 (95% CI: 0.33, 1.45) for BRAF mutant without prior BRAF treatment, and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.26) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. ORR for pooled pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab was 34% vs. 13% for BRAF wild type, 41% vs. 13% for BRAF mutant without prior BRAF treatment, and 21% vs. 6% for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment.

## PD-L1 status

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-002 in patients who were PD-L1 positive (Allred proportion score of ≥2 representing PD-L1 membrane expression in ≥1% of tumour cells) vs. PD-L1 negative (Allred proportion score of 0 or 1) was performed. PD-L1 expression was tested retrospectively by immunohistochemistry research assay with the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody. Among patients who were evaluable for PD-L1 expression (78%), 69% (n=291) were PD-L1 positive and 31% (n=130) were PD-L1 negative. The PFS HRs (pooled pembrolizumab [2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks] vs. chemotherapy) were 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.68) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.94) for PD-L1 negative patients. The PFS HRs for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.75) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.50) for PD-L1 negative patients. The OS HRs for pooled pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.23) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.43, 1.37) for PD-L1 negative patients. The OS HRs for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.49) for PD-L1 positive patients and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.58, 2.46) for PD-L1 negative patients. ORR for pooled pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy was 26% and 23% vs. 4% for PD-L1 positive patients and 15% and 11% vs. 8% for PD-L1 negative patients.

A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-006 in patients who were PD-L1 positive (n=671; 80%) vs. PD-L1 negative (n=150; 18%) was performed. Among patients who were evaluable for PD-L1 expression (98%), 82% were PD-L1 positive and 18% were PD-L1 negative. The PFS HRs (pooled pembrolizumab [10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks] vs. ipilimumab) were 0.53 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.65) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.11) for PD-L1 negative patients. The OS HRs for pooled pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.73) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.62) for PD-L1 negative patients. The ORRs for the pooled pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab group were 37% vs. 12% for PD-L1 positive patients and 18% vs. 11% for PD-L1 negative patients.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with pembrolizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of all conditions included in the category of malignant neoplasms (except nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In conclusion, the overall data support the efficacy of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in both patients that are naïve to ipilimumab treatment and patients that have been previously treated with ipilimumab in melanoma patients with advanced disease. The comparative studies P002 and P006 are still ongoing and only interim results have been submitted. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed two PAES to have the final study reports for studies P002 and P006.

The proposed dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W is considered sufficiently justified for the overall population and it is agreed that there is no significant differences between the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W dose levels in the overall population. A similar conclusion can also be drawn for subgroups of patients that have tumours which harbour the BRAF V600 mutation and for the subset of patients that have tumours which have been designated as PD-L1 negative.  However, the evidence is based on data that is considered limited. The CHMP is of the opinion that the relevance of PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression as biomarkers, in the tumour microenvironment as well as in the peripheral compartment, should be further explored. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed a PAES to have updated efficacy data from the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

P002 final analysis and from P001 for Parts B2 and D of P001 by dose level in subgroups based on BRAF mutation status and PD-L1 expression status as an Annex II condition.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to be addressed as related to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product were identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed:

- Post-authorisation  efficacy  study  (PAES):  The  MAH  should  submit  the  final  study  report  for study P002: Randomized, Phase II Study of MK-3475 versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Melanoma - Final Study Report
- Post-authorisation  efficacy  study  (PAES):  The  MAH  should  submit  the  final  study  report  for study P006: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Three-Arm, Phase III Study to Evaluate the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  Two  Dosing  Schedules  of  MK-3475  Compared  to  Ipilimumab  in Patients with Advanced Melanoma - Final Study Report
- Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to confirm the benefit in BRAFV600 mutant and in PD-L1 negative patient subgroups at the recommended dose, the MAH should provide updated analyses from Study P001 and P002:
- o Updated efficacy data in subgroups comparing 2 vs 10 mg/kg Q3W from the P002 final analysis.
- o Efficacy data in subgroups comparing the 2 vs 10 mg/kg Q3W from P001, using the data cut-off date of 18-Oct-2014 from Parts B2 and D of P001 by dose level.
- The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, specifically:

Although  PD-L1  status  is  predictive  of  response  in  advanced  melanoma  patients,  durable responses have been observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by IHC (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy  should  be  investigated  together  with  more  information  regarding  the  pattern  of expression of PD-L1 obtained in the ongoing melanoma studies (P001, P002 and P006):

- o PD-L1 IHC comparison of archival tissue vs newly obtained
- o PD-L1 IHC comparison between pre and post treatment tumour tissues
- o Nanostring RNA gene signature
- o PD-L2 IHC
- o RNA and proteomic serum profiling
- o Immune cell profiling (peripheral blood)

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The pembrolizumab safety database submitted for this MAA includes complete safety data from 1012 melanoma patients enrolled in Parts B1, B2, B3 and D of study P001 (cut-off date 18 April 2014) and in study P002 (cut-off date 12 May 2014). Data from 38 NSCLC patients included in Part C and 30 patients with solid tumours enrolled in Part A, A1 and A2 have been also provided at the start of the procedure.

In addition, SAEs have been submitted from Part F of the Study P001, and from the following ongoing studies:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study P006 ( A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Three-Arm, Phase III Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing Schedules of MK-3475 Compared to Ipilimumab in Patients with Advanced Melanoma ): 87 patients with 44 exposed to pembrolizumab;
- Study  P010  ( A  Phase  II/III  Randomized  Trial  of  Two  Doses  of  MK-3475  (SCH900475)  versus Docetaxel  in  Previously  Treated  Subjects  with  Non-Small  Cell  Lung  Cancer ):  12  patients  with  8 exposed to pembrolizumab;
- Study  P012  ( A  Phase  Ib  Multi-Cohort  Study  of  MK-3475  in  Subjects  with  Advanced  Solid Tumors ):109 patients, all exposed to pembrolizumab .

## Adverse events

Overall, the safety profile for pembrolizumab is similar between all three dose groups, with only a few AEs (fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, and nausea) with incidence greater (&gt;10% difference) in the 10 mg/kg Q2W group versus the 2 mg/kg Q3W group. Among all subjects, the SOCs in which ≥ 50% of events were reported included: Gastrointestinal disorders (66.3%), General disorders (72.4%),

The overall incidences of Grade 3-5 AEs across the 3 groups was 43.5%, 41.9%, and 45.0%, in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W groups respectively. The incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs was occurring in more than 7.1% (anaemia in 2 mg/kg Q3W) of subjects in any treatment group. The most commonly reported Grade 3-5 AEs, occurring in at least 2% of subjects in this pooled melanoma population were: anaemia (4.6%), hyponatraemia (3.0%), fatigue (2.6%), and dyspnoea (2.4%). In the pooled analysis, Grade 3-5 AEs did not appear to cluster in any particular SOC (incidence in any SOC was not &gt;10%), with the biggest difference seen in the Metabolism SOC (9.4% in 2 mg/kg Q3W, 6.3% in 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 11.7% in 10 mg/kg Q2W).

Overall, drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs were reported for 137 of 1012 subjects (13.5%). The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3-5 AE was fatigue, reported for 15 subjects (1.5%). Aside from fatigue, the only drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs, reported in more than 5 subjects (0.5%), were: diarrhoea (0.8%), colitis (0.7%), asthenia (0.6%), anaemia (0.5%), dyspnoea (0.5%), and vomiting (0.5%).

Early  safety  results  from  study  P006  for  those  AEs  which  were  prespecified  in  the  protocol  to  be compared  between  treatment  arms  with  p-values  are  summarized  in  the  following  Table  59.  The comparison was performed using a stratified Miettinen &amp; Nurminen method.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

SAEs were reported for 377 of 1012 subjects (37.3%). Overall, the incidences were 40.6%, 35.4%, and 36.1% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W arms, respectively. The most commonly reported SAE overall was pneumonia, which was reported for 23 subjects (2.3%). The only other SAE reported in more than 2% of subjects was: dyspnoea, which was reported in 21 subjects (2.1%). The SAE profile of pembrolizumab was similar in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W groups, and the incidences of SAEs across SOCs were comparable across the three groups.

Overall, ADR related SAEs were reported for 93 of 1012 subjects (9.2%). By treatment arm, ADRrelated SAEs were reported for 29 of 340 subjects (8.5%) in the 2 mg/kg Q3W group, 42 of 492 subjects (8.5%) in the 10 mg/kg Q3W group, and 22 of 180 subjects (12.2%) in the 10 mg/kg Q2W

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group. ADR-related SAEs did not predominantly occur in any one SOC. With the exception of colitis (n=8, 0.8%), pneumonitis (n=8, 0.8%), pyrexia (n=7, 0.7%), and diarrhoea (n=6, 0.6%), no single AE was reported as both serious and drug related for more than 5 subjects. The percentage of drugrelated SAEs was numerically higher in the 10 mg/kg Q2W group (12.2%), compared to the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W groups (8.5% in each group) with the difference spread over small increases in individual AEs.

SAEs occurred in 37.9%, 33.5%, and 35.0% of subjects, and drug-related SAEs occurred in 8.5%, 7.7%, and 12.2% of subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W groups, respectively.

At the proposed regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W, the estimated mean change in QTc interval at peak concentrations is 0.83 msec (upper 90% CI of 0.93 msec), well below 20 msec, the level of concern in the setting of advanced cancer. These findings were confirmed based on an analysis of triplicate ECG data from Part F of P001, which indicated an estimated mean change in QTc interval at peak concentrations of the 2 mg/kg Q3W regimen of 0.91 msec (upper 90% CI of 1.4 msec).

There were no drug-related deaths in any of the melanoma cohorts in P001.

In study P002, there were 26 (2.6%) deaths due to AEs, of which all but one was considered by the Investigator to be not related to study drug. Deaths were generally similar across treatment arms, occurring in 6.2% and in 4.5% of subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W and the 10 mg/kg Q3W pembrolizumab arms, respectively, versus 4.7% of subjects in the chemotherapy control arm. The one drug-related death that occurred in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm was originally reported by the investigator as drugrelated. However, after the database was locked, the investigator changed the attribution of the death to unrelated. Although the cause of death was not clear, the investigator indicated that probable causes were disease progression and bleeding from intestinal metastasis.

In study P006, a total of 44 cases with a fatal outcome were identified, including 40 cases considered not related and 4 related to study therapy (IPI or pembrolizumab) by the investigator. There were only 2 pembrolizumab cases entered as related to pembrolizumab, 1 case reported as related by the investigator and 1 reported as unknown. One case was reported as renal failure as related to pembrolizumab by the investigator. The other case was likely related to malignant disease progression.

In study P010, A total of 67 cases with a fatal outcome were identified, including 62 events considered by the investigator not related and 5 events related to study therapy (docetaxel or pembrolizumab). There were two cases that were related to febrile neutropenia and cardiac failure acute, respectively, that occurred while on treatment with docetaxel. The remaining 3 cases that were considered related to pembrolizumab by the investigator showed that in one case insufficient information was provided for a  complete  medical  assessment,another  case  had  an  alternative  explanation  confounding  causality assessment,  such  as,  underlying  malignant  disease  progression  and  the  third  case  related  to pneumonitis  in  a  patient  with  NSCLC  in  which  a  causal  association  between  the  fatal  event  and pembrolizumab could not be excluded.

In study P012, a total of 21 fatal cases were identified, including 19 cases considered not related and 2 cases  related  to  pembrolizumab.  In  one  case,  there  was  insufficient  information  provided  for  a complete medicalassessment. The other case was related to a rapid onset of tracheobronchomalacia without etiology for which the investigator assessed as related to pembrolizumab.

## Immunogenicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A 10 mL sample of blood for anti-pembrolizumab antibodies was collected at specified time points. The samples were assayed for anti-pembrolizumab antibodies presence using a validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay on the Sector Imager 2400 analyser from MesoScale Discovery (MSD).  Samples  were  analysed  for  the  presence  of  anti  pembrolizumab  antibodies  with  further characterization of anti-pembrolizumab antibodies and assessment of their neutralizing capacity.

A validated bridging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay was used for the detection of antipembrolizumab antibodies in human serum (see above under section 'Analytical methods').

Overall, 2063 samples from 480 subjects from study parts A, B, C and D were available. A subset of 31 patients  was  not  evaluable  for  drug-induced  immunogenicity,  because  only  a  pre-treatment  ADA sample  was  available.  The  remaining  449  patients  were  evaluable  for  immunogenicity  (all  2063 samples were tested in the ADA screening assay).

Overview of Clinical Sample Results in Screening and Confirmatory Assay for Anti-MK-3475 Antibodies

Interference by pembrolizumab in the ADA assays may occur, especially at concentrations above the drug tolerance level of 25 μg/mL. Therefore, samples with a negative test result in the screening or confirmatory  anti-MK3475  assay  could  only  be  confirmed  to  be  negative  in  the  case  of  an pembrolizumab concentration below25 μg/mL. The immunogenicity status of a patient could only be confirmed to be negative if all pre-treatment and post-dose samples were negative in the confirmatory assay for antibodies against pembrolizumab and if the concentration of pembrolizumab in the last postdose sample was below the drug tolerance level.

The following table presents the immunogenicity status of all 449 evaluable patients (with at least one post-dose ADA sample):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Souta: Appodx )

Two patients had one sample each that tested positive in the tier 2 confirmatory assay for antibodies against pembrolizumab:

For patient AN 0263, the pre-treatment sample was found to be positive. This sample was negative in the confirmatory NAb assay. Post-dose samples were negative in the screening assay at Day 21 (Cycle 2) and inconclusive at Day 91 (Safety Follow Up). The immunogenicity status of this patient was classified as non-treatment emergent positive.

For patient AN 0383, the Day 84 post-dose sample (Cycle 5) tested positive in the screening and confirmatory assays, and was also confirmed positive in the NAb assay. Two additional immunogenicity samples were collected on day 169 (Cycle 9) and Day 253 (Cycle 13). Both samples tested positive in the screening assay but were inconclusive in the confirmatory assay

## Immune-related AEs

Based on updated pooled data from studies P001 and P002, the following cumulative incidences for immune-related  AEs  were  calculated:    7.4%  for  hypothyroidism,  2.6%  for  pneumonitis,  2.4%  for hyperthyroidism, 2.0% for infusion-related reaction, 1.6% for colitis, 1.5% for severe skin-reactions, 1.1% for thyroiditis, 1.0% for hypophysitis, 0.8% for hepatitis, 0.8% for uveitis, 0.4% for nephritis, 0.4%  for  myositis,  0.2%  for  adrenal  insufficiency,  0.2%  for  pancreatitis,  0.1%  for  type  1  diabetes mellitus, 0.1% for myasthenic syndrome, 0.1% for pericarditis, 0.1% for vasculitis.

Following this safety review, Thyroid Disorder (Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Thyroiditis), Pneumonitis, Colitis and Hepatitis were confirmed as immune-related events causally associated with pembrolizumab, and further adverse reactions (Hypophysitis, including Hypopituitarism and Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency; Uveitis; Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Nephritis, Pancreatitis, Myositis, Severe Skin Reaction  and  Infusion-Related  Reaction)  were  newly  added  to  the  list  of  Important  Identified  Risk. Gastrointestinal perforation secondary to colitis was considered as Potential Risk.

Hypothyroidism was reported as not resolved in most patients (66 out of 75 subjects). One subject reported  having  2  episodes  of  hypothyroidism,  all  other  subjects  were  reported  to  have  a  single episode. Corticosteroids (high-dose) were used to manage hypothyroidism in only 2 subjects.

Two  subjects  were  reported  to  have  2  episodes  of  hyperthyroidism,  and  all  other  subjects  were reported  to  have  a  single  episode.  The  event  was  reported  as  resolved  in  19  of  the  24  cases. Corticosteroids  were  used  to  manage  hyperthyroidism  in  2  subjects,  who  both  received  high-dose (defined as ≥ 40 mg/day of prednisone, or equivalent) corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism was reported as resolved in both patients.

Adrenal  insufficiency  was  reported  in  2  subjects  who  received  pembrolizumab  in  the  1012-subject pooled  melanoma  population  of  P001  +  P002.  Both  cases  were  treated  with  corticosteroid  and  the outcome was listed as 'not resolved' for patient AN100919 (disease progression persisted, leading to death) and recovered AN101258 for patient improved with corticosteroid treatment. Improvement was registered with corticosteroid treatment.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The applicant did not submit studies on drug-drug interactions (see clinical safety discussion).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the IPI-refractory melanoma patient population of study P002, 10.1%, and 14.5%, of patients in the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W pembrolizumab arms, respectively, and 11.7% in the chemotherapy control arm discontinued treatment due to AEs.

In  the  pooled  melanoma  population  (P001+P002),  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  in 8.2%  of  patients  in  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W,  in  12.4%  of  patients  in  10  mg/kg  Q3W,  and  in  15.0%  of patients in 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment arms, respectively.

With the exception of General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (n=24,2.4%), no SOC had  an  overall  incidence  &gt;2.0%.  However,  within  a  dose  group,  the Respiratory,  thoracic  and mediastinal  disorders (driven  by  pneumonitis,  n=3,  1.7%  overall)  SOC  and  the Nervous  system disorders SOC (n=5, spread out over 5 different AEs) had an incidence of 2.8% in the 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment  arms.  Also,  the Gastrointestinal  disorders SOC  had  an  incidence  of  2.2%  in  both  the  10 mg/kg  Q3W  and  10  mg/kg  Q2W  treatment  arms,  which  was  driven  by  colitis  (n=4,  0.8%)  and diarrhoea (n=2, 1.1%), respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  44  (4.3%)  subjects  discontinued  treatment  due  to  drug-related  AEs,  including  2.9%  of subjects  in  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W  group,  4.5%  of  subjects  in  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W  group,  and  6.7%  of subjects in the 10 mg/kg Q2W group. Across all doses, only pneumonitis and colitis were drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation that occurred in 5 or more subjects (n=7 and n=5, respectively). Other drug-related  AEs  that  caused  discontinuation  in  more  than  1  subject  were:  hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis,  hypopituitarism,  fatigue,  generalized  oedema,  and  autoimmune  hepatitis  which  all occurred in 2 subjects each.

## Post marketing experience

The applicant submitted data on post-marketing experience. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) was approved in the U.S. on 04-Sep-2014 for the treatment of subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.

The safety reporting database was queried to retrieve all SAEs and non-serious cases spontaneously reported in the US in temporal association with pembrolizumab through 30-Nov-2014. A total of 57 cases, including 28 SAEs, were identified. The most commonly reported SAEs were the PTs of death (8 events), malignant melanoma (4 events), adverse event unspecified (3 events), disease progression (2 events), and metastatic melanoma (2 events). All other SAE terms were reported only once. Seventeen of the 57 cases reported a fatal outcome, with the vast majority associated with either disease progression and/or complications of on-going medical conditions at the time of the fatal outcome. No safety signals have been identified.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The pembrolizumab safety database submitted to support the application consisted of safety data from 1012  patients  enrolled  in  study  P001  (Part  B1,  B2,  B3  and  D)  and  in  study  P002.  This  includes comparative safety data versus standard of care chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma refractory to ipilimumab (Study P002).

In addition, early safety results from the first interim analysis of P006 (data cutoff date 3 Sep 2014) providing comparative data versus ipilimumab in IPI-naïve advanced melanoma have also been provided. However, a pooled analysis was not feasible at the time of the interim analysis, hence section 4.8 of the SmPC includes all ADRs evaluated in 1012 patients across three doses (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks) in clinical studies P001 and P002.

No major differences in the safety profile were observed between the 2 mg/kg dose and the 10 mg/kg dose when given on a Q3W schedule. Overall 340 received pembrolizumab at the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W proposed for the treatment of advanced melanoma.

In the pooled melanoma population (Studies P001 and P002) 79% of patients reported drug-related AEs, of which 13.5% were Grade 3-5. The most common adverse drug reactions observed were in the General disorders and administration site conditions (47.7%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (46.3%), Gastrointestinal disorders (31.2%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (23.6%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (14.4%), Nervous System Disorders (14.2%), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (12.2%) SOCs. Severe adverse drug reactions were more frequently reported in Gastrointestinal disorders (2.7%), General disorders and administration site conditions (1.6%) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.6%).

A higher rate of adverse drug reactions was reported in P002 with chemotherapy (80.7%) in comparison to pembrolizumab (68% at 2 mg/kg and 74.3% at 10 mg/kg Q3W). In particular, drug-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related Grade 3-5 AEs were registered in 26.3% of patients treated with chemotherapy, while the rate in patients who received pembrolizumab was 11.2% and 14% in the 2 mg/kg Q3w and 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectively.

In both IPI-refractory patients of study P002 and IPI naïve patients of study P006, the Grade ≥3 AEs tended  to  occur  later  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  in  comparison  with  standard  chemotherapy  or ipilimumab.

An analysis of immune-related ADRs (irADRs) based on pooled data from studies P001 (cut-off 18 Apr 2014) and P002 (12 May 2014), including 1012 melanoma patients, together with a cross-program medical case review of SAEs and non-SAEs events of clinical interest from all clinical studies regardless of indication (3251 subjects) and the melanoma expanded access program (1787 subjects) has been performed. Following this safety review, Thyroid Disorder (Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis),  Pneumonitis,  Colitis  and  Hepatitis  were  confirmed  as  immune-related  events  causally associated with pembrolizumab, and the following adverse reactions: Hypophysitis, including Hypopituitarism  and  Secondary  Adrenal  Insufficiency;  Uveitis;  Type  1  Diabetes  Mellitus,  Nephritis, Pancreatitis and Infusion-Related Reaction, Myositis and Severe Skin Reaction have been added to the list  of  Important  Identified  Risk.  Based  on  updated  pooled  data,  the  following  cumulative incidences were calculated:  7.4% for hypothyroidism, 2.6% for pneumonitis, 2.4% for hyperthyroidism, 2.0% for infusion-related reaction, 1.6% for colitis, 1.5% for severe skin-reactions, 1.1% for thyroiditis, 1.0% for hypophysitis, 0.8% for hepatitis, 0.8% for uveitis, 0.4% for nephritis, 0.4% for myositis, 0.2% for adrenal insufficiency, 0.2% for pancreatitis, 0.1% for type 1 diabetes mellitus, (see section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for management of immune-related ADRs). These ADRs have been included in the RMP as important identified risks. In general, the duration of treatment seems to correlate with the occurrence of  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AEOSI).  In  order  to  minimise  the  risks  associated  with  these ADRs and to raise awareness to healthcare professionals and patients/carers on the early identification and  detection  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  these  ADRs,  the  CHMP  imposed  the  company  to  provide educational material will be distributed by the MAH. This was considered by the CHMP as a condition to the market authorisation (see Annex II of the SmPC).

Since patients with severe (grade 3) irADRs on prior IPI requiring corticosteroids for &gt; 12 weeks, or life-threatening irAEs on prior IPI were not eligible in Study P001 and P002, and data regarding AEs on prior ipilimumab treatment were not systematically collected, it is not possible to draw any conclusion on this issue at the present stage. Patients that had active systemic autoimmune disease, patients with HIV  or  hepatitis  B  or  C  were  excluded  from  enrolling  in  the  studies.  These  patient  populations  are included in the RMP as missing information. The trend observed versus a lower incidence of immunerelated  AEs  in  ipi-treated  in  comparison  to  ipi-naïve  patients  may  be  biased  and  driven  by  an unintended selection of patients. The use of pembrolizumab in patients with severe (grade 3) irADRs on  prior  IPI  requiring  corticosteroids  for  &gt;  12  weeks,  or  life-threatening  irADRs  on  prior  IPI  is considered as missing information, and the lack of data is included in the SmPC section 4.4.

A review of gastrointestinal perforation and colitis reports was performed by the Applicant involving more than 5000 patients who received pembrolizumab in clinical trials and in the Expanded Access Program. Based on the potential life-threatening nature of the event (1 fatal case was reported) and the limited information that hampers the real estimation of the events, GI perforation secondary to colitis has been added as a potential risk in the RMP and reflected in the SmPC Section 4.4.

There is no strong evidence supporting an influence of age on the safety profile, although a trend to a higher rate of drug-related AEs and discontinuations due to AEs has been reported in older patients. Based on submitted data no major differences in the pembrolizumab safety profile appear by age classes in both ipi-naïve and ipi-treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only two patients in study 001 tested positive for ADA to pembrolizumab and the presence of these antibodies seemed to have no impact on pembrolizumab PK. However, in the majority of ADA negative samples at the screening and in the confirmatory assays (1116 out of 2058), pembrolizumab concentration was above the drug tolerance level (25 μg/mL). Drug tolerance was shown to interfere to a different degree in the two dose groups (all dose regimens and 2 mg/Kg Q3W). While 64% of patients, who received 2mg/kg, were assessable for immunogenicity, in the overall population also including 10 mg/kg dose regimens, it was only 27%. Given the low number of evaluable patients for immunogenicity and the missing validation report for ADAs, immunogenicity has been included as important potential risks.

The applicant did not submit safety data on various ethnic groups. This has been included in the RMP as missing information.

Based on the current assessment of events with fatal outcome from studies P001, P002, P006, P010, and P012, as of 31 Aug 2014, overall 15 fatal cases considered drug-related by the investigator have been reported. Pneumonitis fatal events reported in NSCLC patient has been included in section 4.8 of the  SmPC  and  in  the  RMP  as  important  identified  risks.  Fatal  events  for  pembrolizumab  will  be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance activities.

The long term safety of pembrolizumab is unknown and has been included as missing information in the RMP. As some patients experience a relatively prolonged response to pembrolizumab, several ongoing studies in the PhV plan are being conducted which will provide further evidence on the long term safety of pembrolizumab treatment (See section 2.8 - pharmacovigilance plan).

Safety data is missing from patients who have previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another mAb as the exclusion criteria from the studies excluded this patient population. Therefore, this has been included as missing information in the RMP.

There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in patients with ocular melanoma (see SmPC section 5.1). The safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

Pembrolizumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported following administration of pembrolizumab (see section 4.7).

There is no information on overdose with pembrolizumab. In case of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted (SmPC section 4.9).

The use of keytruda is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (SmPC  section 4.3).

Special precautions for disposal and other handling are included in section 6.6 of the SmPC.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The ADRs reported for patients being treated with pembrolizumab appear to be mostly of low grade and  manageable.  It  was  noted  that  immunological  ADRs  include  skin,  gastrointestinal,  endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary and renal events. These are managed appropriately with the recommendations as stated in the SmPC section 4.2,  4.4 and 4.8 and are also addressed in the RMP.  However, in order to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

raise the awareness of health care professionals, patients and/or their caregivers about the potential for  immune-related  adverse  events  and  infusion-related  reactions,  which  are  considered  important identified  risks,  the  CHMP  has  imposed an educational programme for both healthcare professionals and patients to help on the identification and detection of the signs and symptoms relevant to the early recognition/identification of those ADRS.

In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  has  been described appropriately and is acceptable.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## 2.8. Risk Management Plan

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 could be acceptable if the applicant implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.

The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.3 with the following content:

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Pembrolizumab, an antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks binding to the natural ligand PD-L1 and PDL2, has shown significant treatment benefit in terms of ORR and DCR , together with preliminary data on the duration of stable disease, duration of response, PFS and OS in both IPI-refractory/treated and IPI-naïve patients, respectively, in the open label phase 1 study P001.

In IPI-refractory patients (cohort B2), ORR (25.9% and 26.3%) and there were a total of 43 confirmed objective responses, with duration ranging from 12+ to 62+ weeks at the time of the analysis. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 7-48).

In IPI-naïve patients (cohort D), ORR (33.3% and 40.43%),  and the duration of response ranged from 6+ to 61+ weeks across both arms. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 11-39) and  83% of patients had non-PD at the time of the analysis.

Further data from study P002, a randomized controlled trial versus chemotherapy in IPI-refractory advanced melanoma patients also showed a clinically relevant result in terms of PFS of  with HR: 0.57 (95%CI 0.45-0.73; p-value &lt;0.0001). OS was not statistically significant at the time of the interim analysis (median OS 11.4 [HR:0.88; 95%CI 10.2- not reached); p-value=0.229])

Early results from the randomized, controlled, phase III study P006 comparing pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W) to ipilimumab in IPI-naïve advanced melanoma patients showed compelling results for PFS and OS where both pembrolizumab arms met the pre-specified criteria for a positive PFS outcome at the first interim analysis, with a HR of 0.58 for both treatment arms (individually) compared to IPI ( one-sided p-value &lt;0.00001 in both comparisons, favoring pembrolizumab). Median PFS was 5.5 and 4.1 months for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W and 10 mg/kg Q3W arms compared to 2.8 months for IPI. After 6-months, 46-47% of patients were alive and progression free on pembrolizumab, and 27% on IPI. The hazard ratio for OS is 0.63 (p=0.00052) for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W over the control arm and 0.69 (p=0.00358 ) for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W over the control arm, respectively, with no difference between the two pembrolizumab arms compared to each other (HR 0.91, p=0.51319) . The median OS has not yet been reached in all three arms, and the 12-month OS rates are 74.1% (95% CI: 68.5%, 78.9%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 62.5%, 73.6%) for pembrolizumab at Q2W and Q3W, respectively, compared to 58.2% (95% CI: 51.8%, 64.0%) in the control arm.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There is some uncertainty in the knowledge of pembrolizumab in the long term efficacy in naïve and previously untreated patients as the efficacy data submitted for both studies P002 and P006 were based on interim analyses. Therefore, a PAES to confirm the long term efficacy of pembrolizumab were imposed as condition to the MA and reflected in the Annex II.

A numerical trend towards a lower efficacy of the 2mg/kg Q3W dose compared to 10 mg/kg Q3W dose in  both  PD-L1  negative  and  BRAFV600-mutated  patients  was  observed  in  studies  P001  and  P002, however, no exposure-response relationship for pembrolizumab both subgroups could be demonstrated in  the  integrated  exposure-response  analysis.  Although  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  benefit  of pembrolizumab  in  the  overall  population  as  well  as  in  the  PD-L1  negative  and  BRAFV600-mutated patients subgroup analyses, has been demonstrated, this evidence is currently based on a relatively

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

limited number of patients at the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W. Therefore, a PAES to have the updated  efficacy  data  for  the  patients  is  required  to  further  characterise  the  magnitude  of  the treatment effect in these two subgroups was imposed as a condition to the MA and reflected in Annex II.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The pembrolizumab safety database submitted consisted of safety data from 1012 patients enrolled in study P001 (Part B1, B2, B3 and D) and in study P002. In addition, early safety results from the first interim analysis of P006 (data cutoff date 3 Sep 2014) also provided further safety information for patients treated with pembrolizumab. No major differences in the safety profile were observed between the 2 mg/kg dose and the 10 mg/kg dose when given on a Q3W schedule. Overall 340 received pembrolizumab at the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W proposed for the treatment of advanced melanoma.

The most frequently reported ADRs (&gt;10%) with the 2 mg/kg dose Q3W were fatigue, pruritus, rash, arthralgia, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, cough, and vitiligo.

Serious ADRs were more frequently reported in Gastrointestinal disorders (2.7%), General disorders and administration site conditions (1.6%) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.6%).

On  the  basis  of  the  mechanism  of  action,  several  immune-mediated  AEs  were  identified  as  ADRs. Among  these, those observed with an incidence &gt; 1%  were hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, hyperthyroidism,  colitis,  severe  skin-reactions,  thyroiditis,  and  hypophysitis,  and  in  addition  severe skin reactions  and  infusion-related  reaction.  Other  immune-related  ADRs  were  gastrointestinal perforation,  hypopituitarism,  secondary  adrenal  insufficiency,  thyroiditis,  uveitis,  pancreatitis,type  1 diabetes mellitus, hepatitis, nephritis, and myositis.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

AEs of special interest will be systematically assessed within ongoing and planned studies (see RMP). Gastrointestinal perforation secondary to colitis and immunogenicity have been defined as important potential risk and are appropriately managed through the RMP and SmPC.  The uncertainty in relation to the safety in the patient populations described in the missing information in the RMP will be handled through routine risk minimisation measures and/or routine pharmacovigilance activities.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Consistent  evidence  of  a  treatment  benefit  has  been  generated  across  the  three  main  studies submitted in support of pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma. The updated data for P001  supports  the  activity  and  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  in  ipi-refractory  and  ipi-naive  advanced melanoma patients in terms of proportion  of  responders  and  duration  of  response.  In  addition,  the interim  results  from  P002  comparing  pembrolizumab  with  standard  chemotherapy  strengthen  the evidence of treatment benefit in IPI-refractory melanoma patients in terms of PFS. The top line results in  IPI  naïve  melanoma  patients  from  study  P006  show  a  clinically  meaningful  advantage  of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab in terms of PFS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  magnitude  of  treatment  effect  is  compelling  and  clinically  relevant  for  both  the  IPI-refractory melanoma patient population, as well as in the IPI-naïve patients. Furthermore, the safety profile of pembrolizumab appears manageable and compares favorably with both chemotherapy and ipilimumab.

## Benefit-risk balance

Based on the totality of the data from the interim results from studies P002 and P006 as well as the results from study P001, the benefits of pembrolizumab treatment in advanced (metastatic or unresectable) melanoma patients outweighed the risks. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance for pembrolizumab in the proposed indication is positive.

| 4. The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, specifically: Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in advanced melanoma patients, durable responses have been observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by IHC (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD-L1 obtained in the ongoing melanoma studies (P001, P002 and P006): • Comparison between PD-L1 IHC staining in archival tissue vs newly obtained • Comparison of PD-L1 IHC between pre and post treatment tumor tissues • Data on the Nanostring RNA gene signature • IHC staining for PD-L2 • Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling • Data on Immune cell profiling (peripheral blood) | 1Q 2017   |
