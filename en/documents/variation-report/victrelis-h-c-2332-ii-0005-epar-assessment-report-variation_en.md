This application concerns the following medicinal product: The following variation was requested: Variation requested Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data The MAH proposed the update of section 4.3 of the SmPC with a new contraindication with simvastatin and lovastatin and section 4.5 of the SmPC with information on interactions with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Change to section 4.6 of the SmPC with new information on contraceptive measures and to section 5.1 of the SmPC with updated information on resistance were also introduced. Changes were also made to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL to bring it in line with the current QRD template. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands and Portugal. In addition, translation mistakes were corrected in the product information for all EU languages. The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction Boceprevir (Victrelis, SCH 503034) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3 protease. Boceprevir covalently, yet reversibly, binds to the NS3 protease active site serine (Ser139) through a (alpha)-ketoamide functional group to inhibit viral replication in HCV-infected host cells. Boceprevir is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, in adult patients with compensated liver disease who are previously untreated or who have failed previous therapy. This application results from a Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) study (P08124) characterizing the pharmacokinetic interactions between boceprevir and cyclosporine, tacrolimus, escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin. This study is also one of the pharmacovigilance activities as detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan and agreed in the RMP for Victrelis. Moreover, the MAH proposed to revise the contraindication for co-administration of boceprevir with medicines that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events to include simvastatin and lovastatin. 2.2. Clinical Pharmacology aspects 2.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted Study design (P08124) This study was a single-center, 5-part, open label, drug-drug-interaction trial in healthy adult subjects. Each part of the study had a fixed-sequence design. The MAH stated that the study was conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices standards and applicable country or local requirements regarding ethical committee review. - Primary objective: To determine pharmacokinetic interaction between boceprevir and the tested drug at the level of AUC. - Secondary objective 1: To determine pharmacokinetic interaction between boceprevir and the tested drug at the level of Cmax Medicinal product no longer authorised

| Escitalopram, Atorvastatin and Pravastatin safety assessments were performed and subjects were discharged. During hospitalization the subjects were provided standard meals. On the first day of each PK sampling period, the subjects received a standard breakfast (after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours) to be consumed within 20 minutes. The subjects took the morning medication with 240 mL of water at 30 min after initiation of breakfast. Water was restricted 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after drug intake, and subjects fasted for 4 hours post morning dose. Safety assessments (safety labs, ECG, vital signs, adverse events and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS, Part 3 only) were performed throughout the study as described in the Study Flow Chart. Subjects returned to the clinic approximately 7 days after the last PK sample collection for final safety assessments. Study Plan for Part 2 Cohort B tacrolimus (inhibitor): To qualify for the study, subjects were evaluated during the 4-week screening period to ensure they met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects started confinement in the evening before the first dose (Day -1) for baseline assessments to confirm eligibility. The next morning (Day 1), the subjects received a standard breakfast (after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours) to be consumed within 20 minutes. The subjects were assigned a Subject number and took a single 800 mg PO dose of boceprevir at 30 min after the initiation of breakfast. Study medication was given with 240 mL of water. Water was restricted 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after drug intake, and subjects fasted for 4 hours post dose. PK samples for boceprevir determination (diastereomers SCH 534128 and SCH 534129, and metabolite SCH 629144) were obtained predose and up until 24 hrs post dose. On Day 2 (after the PK sample at 24-hr post Day 1 dosing was taken), subjects received another single dose of 800 mg boceprevir together with a single dose of 0.5 mg of tacrolimus on the same food and time restrictions as on Day 1. PK samples for boceprevir (in the presence of tacrolimus) were collected from Day 2 predose up until the morning of Day 3 (= 24 hrs post dose). During hospitalization the subjects received standard meals unless otherwise specified.

SAFETY RESULTS There were no deaths or serious AEs. No clinically significant changes in blood chemistry or hematological parameters, vital signs, or ECGs occurred in any treatment group. SIMVASTATIN AND LOVASTATIN Boceprevir is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4. Coadministration of boceprevir and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. Based on in vitro data in human liver microsomes, boceprevir does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1. In vivo, boceprevir administration increases the AUC of co-administered drugs which are CYP3A4 substrates, with midazolam increasing 5.30-fold; cyclosporine, 2.68-fold; and tacrolimus, 17.1-fold.

## 2.2.3. Discussion

Although complex due to its multipart design, the study design is overall suitable. Boceprevir was administered at the recommended dose of 800mg TID, except when required to be given at single dose. Of note, most of the interaction studies provided in the marketing authorisation application had been conducted with a lower than recommended dose of boceprevir.

All drugs were given with food in this study. This is consistent with the food requirement of boceprevir and adequate for escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin that could be given with or without food. Bioavailability of tacrolimus and cyclosporine are known to be decreased by food. In this study, immunosuppressive drugs were taken within 30 minutes after the initiation of breakfast. This is not optimal on a PK point of view and will have to be taken into account in the interpretation of the interaction results. A 5 days delay has been anticipated to reach maximal inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, which is appropriate. A washout period of minimum 7 days has been applied between the different dosing period which is in accordance with the mean plasma half-life of boceprevir of 3.4 hours. Dose of the co-administered substrate were adequately justified and chosen to provide robust PK profile while mitigating potential safety concerns. A fixed-sequence design was chosen by the MAH on the basis of the long apparent terminal half-lives of most of the interacting drugs and the absence of subjective and/or time-dependent pharmacodynamic or safety variables. All co-administered drugs were given at single dose. Interacting effect may be studied at single dose for drugs having a linear PK; however, the MAH did not comment on this aspect. IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS PK results are consistent with the known strong inhibitor effect of boceprevir on CYP3A4. The concomitant administration of boceprevir and cyclosporine led to significant changes in cyclosporine pharmacokinetics (Cmax increased by 101% and AUC by 168%). Cyclosporine half-life was increased from 11 to 16h and tacrolimus half-life from 37 to 62h. The AUC and Cmax of tacrolimus increased in an even more substantial manner (Cmax increases by 890% and AUC by 1610%) when combined with boceprevir. Boceprevir PK was not significantly altered by cyclosporine or tacrolimus in this study. Of note, however, a 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC of the metabolite SCH 629144 (inactive major metabolite) was observed following co-administration of boceprevir and cyclosporine (not shown in table 1).The underlying mechanism is unknown.

Given the significant difference in the magnitude of the interaction observed in this study (3 fold increase in cyclosporine AUC and 17 fold increase in tacrolimus AUC when coadministered with boceprevir), distinction in recommendations between cyclosporine and tacrolimus was discussed. However, the CHMP felt that the administration of immunosupressants is made under well controlled circumstances in clinical practice and clinicians treating transplant patients are fully experienced with the management of dose adjustment of immunosuppressants notably when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Therefore, similar recommendations for both compounds are made in the SmPC: dose adjustment with close monitoring of concentration, renal function and side effects to all immunosuppressants. In addition, the results obtained with these immunosuppressants were extrapolated to sirolimus. The recommendations were aligned with those for the other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunosuppressants by including monitoring of renal function and sirolimus-related side-effects (see section 2.4).

## ESCITALOPRAM

Escitalopram is metabolised in the liver to demethylated and didemethylated metabolites. Biotransformation of escitalopram is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Some contribution by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is possible. Boceprevir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 but does not inhibit CYP2C19.

Boceprevir PK was not significantly altered by escitalopram. On the other hand, escitalopram exposure and Cmax were reduced by 21% and 19% respectively, when coadministered with boceprevir. The mechanism underlying the decrease in exposure of escitalopram is not clear. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram have a wide therapeutic index, and as such the observed decrease of 21% in exposure and of 19% in Cmax is generally not thought to be of clinically significance. However, it is possible that for individual patients, doses may need to be adjusted when combined with boceprevir to preserve full therapeutic benefit. Therefore, the CHMP agreed on the MAH's proposal to highlight the need for clinicians to consider a dose adjustment of escitalopram when given together with boceprevir in the SmPC (see section 2.4). HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Atorvastatin and Boceprevir Consistent with the known strong inhibitor effect of boceprevir on CYP3A4, boceprevir significantly increased the exposure (AUC by 130% and Cmax by 166%) of atorvastatin. According to the MAH, atorvastatin may have P-gp inhibitory effects at concentration much higher than therapeutic concentrations. In this study, atorvastatin had no effect on PK parameters of boceprevir. Of note, dose of 40mg atorvastatin was used in this study (whereas usual dose are 10 or 20mg/day with maximal recommended dose of 80mg). In line with these findings, dose reduction of atorvastatin should be considered when co-administrated with boceprevir. Additional clinical monitoring is recommended when daily doses of atorvastatin exceed 40 mg (see section 2.4). Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Pravastatin and Boceprevir The exposure of pravastatin is increased when co-administered with boceprevir (AUC by 63% and Cmax by 49%).Given the metabolism pathway of pravastatin, a significant impact was not expected. As expected, pravastatin did not affect the exposure of boceprevir. In line with these findings, treatment with pravastatin can be initiated at the recommended dose when co-administered with boceprevir. However, close clinical monitoring is warranted (see section 2.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Lovastatin and simvastatin

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased plasma concentrations when coadministered with drugs which are CYP3A4 inhibitors. The interaction of boceprevir with lovastatin or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

simvastatin has not been studied; however, boceprevir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to markedly increase the plasma concentrations of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Since increased concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of lovastatin or simvastatin with boceprevir is not recommended (see section 2.4).

## 2.3. Risk management plan

This submission of the results from a Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) study (P08124) characterizing the pharmacokinetic interactions between boceprevir and cyclosporine, tacrolimus, escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin was one of the pharmacovigilance activities as detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan and agreed in the RMP for Victrelis. An updated RMP incorporating these results (version 3.0) was submitted in March 2012 and the review is currently on-going. 2.4. Changes to the Product Information During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the SmPC (addition / deletion): 4.3 Contraindications Co-administration with medicines that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as orally administered midazolam and triazolam, bepridil, pimozide, lumefantrine, halofantrine, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, simvastatin, lovastatin, and ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Victrelis, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, is contraindicated when co-administered with medicines that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as orally administered midazolam and triazolam, bepridil, pimozide, lumefantrine, halofantrine, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, simvastatin, lovastatin, and ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.3).

Of note, at the CHMP request, the mechanistic explanation for the drug-drug interactions (when understood) has been included in Table 2 of section 4.5 (i.e. ketaconazole, ritonavir, efavirenz, midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam, methadone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, atorvastatin, pravastatin). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Section 4.6 was updated to take into account the recent revisions made to soften the requirement for double contraception in the Rebetol SmPC and patient leaflet: 'Pregnancy Treated patients and their partners must use two effective forms of contraceptive methods when boceprevir is used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Due to the combined treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in female partners of male patients. Therefore, female patients of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded.' 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Section 5.1 was updated to delete redundant information regarding the association of the presence of baseline RAVs with treatment response in subjects receiving the combination of Victrelis with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin: 'However, among poorly interferon-responsive patients to peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin during the 4week lead-in period, the efficacy of Victrelis appeared to be reduced for those who had variants V36M, T54A, T54S, V55A or R155K detected at baseline. Subjects with these baseline variants and reduced response to peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin represented approximately 1% of the total number of subjects treated with Victrelis. The presence of baseline RAVs did not appear to have a notable association with treatment response in subjects receiving the combination of Victrelis with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.' Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representative(s) of Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal.

Variation accepted C.I.4 Update of section 4.3 of the SmPC with a new contraindication with simvastatin and lovastatin and section 4.5 of the SmPC with information on interactions with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Change to section 4.6 of the SmPC with new information on contraceptive measures and to section 5.1 of the SmPC with updated information on resistance were also introduced. Changes were also made to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL to bring it in line with the current QRD template. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands and Portugal. In addition, translation mistakes were corrected in the product information for all EU languages. The requested variation proposed amendments to the update of Summary of Products Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. Medicinal product no longer authorised
