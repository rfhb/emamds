## Procedural steps taken after granting the Marketing Authorisation

For procedures finalised after 1 April 2003, please refer to module 8B.

- On  25  November  1998  three  Type  I  variation  procedures  were  started  to  introduce  minor changes to the manufacture of the active substance (I/01) and to the finished product (I/02-03). The proposed variations were accepted on 23 December 1998.
- Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Council Directive No. 92/27/EEC of 31 March 1992, the Marketing Authorisation Holder notified the EMEA on 27 June 2000 of their intention to introduce changes to  aspects  of  the  package  leaflet  not  connected  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics (changes  in  contact  details  of  local  representatives  in  the  Package  Leaflet).    The  EMEA approved  this  Notification  on  16  August  2000.  The  Commission  Decision  was  issued  on  9 October 2000.

Subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications agreed upon are summarised in the table below:
