## 1. Introduction

On November2023, the MAH submitted a paediatric study for Entyvio, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The study was interrupted (no for safety reasons) and the development of the drug for this indication interrupted for adults and paediatric patients.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that  Study n° Vedolizumab-3035 'A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Prophylaxis of Intestinal Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Subjects Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell' is part of a clinical development program.

The MAH submits a clinical study report (early termination) in accordance to Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, for study vedolizumab-3035.

Study Vedolizumab-3035 was included in Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) EMEA-000645-PIP03-18. The age entry criteria for this study included subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg at the time of randomization. While the PIP stipulated this study (planned for adults) to have enrollment open to adolescents, it did not specify a minimum number for this age group.

Out  of  the  343  enrolled  subjects,  only  1  was  aged  &lt;18  years  at  entry  (placebo  subject),  and  no subgroup analyses were conducted for subjects aged ≥12 to &lt;18 yea rs.

Enrollment  was  terminated  early,  and  the  study  completed  on  09  May  2022,  primarily  due  to  low subject  recruitment  and  enrollment  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (since  February  2020).  The decision was influenced by multiple factors, none of which were related to safety concerns regarding the use of vedolizumab in this patient population.

The MAH decided to discontinue development of vedolizumab for use in this condition, in both adults and paediatrics.

Following early termination of enrollment  into  Study Vedolizumab-3035,  a  notification  of PIP discontinuation was submitted to the Agency, on 01 June 2022, to withdraw PIP EMEA-000645-PIP0318. The measures that had been agreed as part of this PIP are listed in Table 1.a

There were no new safety signals or concerns emerging from this study and there are no regulatory consequences  identified  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  with  no  changes  to  the  currently approved Entyvio Summary of Product Characteristics proposed and no variation is planned to update the Product information with regards to the use of vedolizumab in the paediatric population as a result of this study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Vedolizumab for Injection, for Intravenous Use; Vedolizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion; or MLN0002 IV) is a lyophilized solid, which after appropriate reconstitution and dilution is intended for intravenous (IV) infusion. It has been granted  marketing  approval  in  several  regions,  including  the  United  States  and  European  Union. Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids.

Vedolizumab IV has also been developed for the treatment of adult patients with pouchitis who have undergone  proctocolectomy  and  ileal  pouch-anal  anastomosis  (IPAA)  for  UC  and  have  had  an inadequate response, lost response, or are intolerant to antibiotic therapy, with marketing approval granted in several countries. As of 19 May 2022, approximately 7094 subjects (healthy or patients with UC or CD, pouchitis, melanoma, or undergoing allo-HSCT or with aGvHD involving the intestinal tract) have received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab across all studies in the clinical development program, and  global  cumulative  postmarketing  patient  exposure  to  vedolizumab  IV  is  estimated  to  be approximately  1,009,238  patient  years.  Overall,  vedolizumab  has  been  well  tolerated  in  clinical studies.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study n° Vedolizumab-3035 'A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Prophylaxis of Intestinal Acute Graft-VersusHost Disease in Subjects Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation'.

## Clinical study 3035

## Description

This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy  and  safety  of  vedolizumab  when  added  to  a  background  aGvHD  prophylaxis  regimen  for intestinal aGvHD in subjects undergoing allo-HSCT.

The  subject  population  consisted  of  subjects  with  hematologic  malignancies  or  myeloproliferative disorders for whom allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor was planned, using either peripheral blood or bone marrow as the stem cell source.

The study consisted of a 30-day screening period, 155-day treatment period, a visit on Day +180 after allo-HSCT,  and  a  posttreatment  follow-up  period  for  safety  assessments  and  survival  that  were completed by 12 months after allo-HSCT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Source: Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Amendment 7.

allo-HSCT: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; ATG: antithymocyte globulin; EOT: end of treatment; ET: early termination; HLA: human leukocyte antigen; IV: intravenous; MA: myeloablative; RIC: reduced intensity conditioning.

* ATG was either ATG-Fresenius or thymoglobulin.

Dose Subjects received 7 doses of IV study drug, beginning on Day -1 before allo-HSCT and then on Days  +13,  +41,  +69,  +97,  +125,  and  +153  after  allo-HSCT.  The  end-of-treatment  visit  was conducted on Day +180 after allo-HSCT. Subjects who discontinued study drug treatment completed an early termination (ET) visit upon discontinuation and a final visit 12 months after allo-HSCT.

Subjects then participated in posttreatment follow-up that began after the Day +180 visit or after ET, included a Day +280 final safety visit (or 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug), and concluded 12 months after allo-HSCT (final visit/end of study [EOS]).

In addition, upon study completion or ET, all subjects or their parents/legally acceptable representative were administered the long-term follow-up (LTFU) safety questionnaire by telephone 6 months after their last dose of study drug. For all subjects receiving study drug, the investigator completed the EOS electronic case report form (eCRF) 12 months after allo-HSCT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects were followed for safety, development of acute and chronic GvHD,  and OS for 12 months after allo-HSCT or until the subject's death or withdrawal of consent/assent or termination of the study by the sponsor.

## Methods

## Study participants

The population was chosen because it represents a high-risk, vulnerable population for development of intestinal aGvHD, which is widely recognized as a driver for poor outcomes, mortality,  and for whom significant unmet medical need exists with no currently approved medical therapy. The incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD has been reported to be 39% for HLA-matched sibling donors and 59% for HLAmatched unrelated donors (MUD) in 1 study (Jagasia et al. 2012) and 33% for matched related donor recipients,  51%  in  8/8  HLA-MUD  recipients,  and  53%  in  7/8  HLA-MUD  recipients,  with  OS  (45%) lowest in the 7/8 HLA-MUD recipients (Saber et al. 2012). Among pediatric subjects with allo-HSCT from unrelated donors, up to 56% develop Grade 2 to 4 aGvHD and 29% develop Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD (Davies et al. 2009; Rocha et al. 2001). The intestinal tract is often involved in Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD, and when the intestinal tract is involved in pediatric patients, NRM increases (Goussetis et al. 2011).

## Main inclusion Criteria

1. Male or female subjects ≥ 18 years of age and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 30 kg at the time of randomization.

2.    DNA-based  HLA  matching  8/8  or  7/8  unrelated  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT) from either peripheral blood or bone marrow  stem cells for a hematologic malignancy or myeloproliferative disorder.

3. Primary disease as follows: acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplasia,

Chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia/small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  and  other  non-Hodgkin  or  Hodgkin lymphoma, myelofibrosis and other myeloproliferative disorders

4. Elegibility for myeloablative conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning.

5.  Allo-HSCT  eligible  (met  institutional  criteria)  subjects  planned  medical  care  included  aGvHD prophylaxis  with  a  combination  of  CNI  (CYS  or  TAC)  and  MTX  or  CNI  and  MMF  all  other  therapies, approved or investigational, for GvHD prophylaxis were excluded with the exception of ATG.

6 .  ECOG performance status of ≤2 for subjects aged ≥ 18 years at randomization or ≥ 60% using the Karnofsky performance status for adolescent subjects aged ≥ 16 years at randomization or the Lansky performance status for adolescent subjects aged 12 to &lt;16 years at randomization.

## Main exclusion Criteria

Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria were not enrolled in the study:

1. Prior allo-HSCT.

2. Planned umbilical cord blood transplant or planned to receive posttransplant cyclophosphamide, in vivo  or  ex  vivo  T  cell-depleted  hematopoietic  stem  cells  with  the  exception  of  ATG  (ATG-F  or thymoglobulin).

3.  Planned  allo-HSCT  for  nonmalignant  hematological  disorders  (eg,  aplastic  anemia,  sickle  cell anemia, thalassemias, Fanconi anemia, or immunodeficiency).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4 .  Prior  or  current  therapy  with  α4  and/or  β7  integrin  inhibitors  (including,  but  not  limited  to natalizumab,  etrolizumab,  AMG-181),  MAdCAM-1-antibodies,  or  anti-CD11a  mAb  (eg,  efalizumab) within 60 days or 5 half-lives, whichever was longer from randomization or5.prior known exposure of the transplant recipient to vedolizumab.

6. Any  unstable  or  uncontrolled neurological/cerebral, psychiatric and  meningeal  diseases,  or cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, GI, genitourinary, coagulation, immunological, endocrine/metabolic or other medical disorder not related to the subject's primary disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have confounded the study results or compromised subject safety.

7. Clinically active systemic infection during screening.

8. Clinically active cytomegalovirus (CMV), active Clostridium difficile infection colitis or other intestinal pathogens during screening.

## Study Sites

Subjects were enrolled into this study drug at 95 sites in 25 countries worldwide (19 sites in North America, 45 in Europe/Israel, 24 in Asia/Australia, and 7 in South America). For additional site-and region-specific randomization information, see Table 15.1.4.

## Data Monitoring and Adjudication Committees

A data monitoring committee (DMC) was utilized in the study for safeguarding the interest of study participants,  and  assessed  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  interventions  during  the  study  while maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  study.  The  DMC  conducted  periodic  scheduled  reviews  of  safety, including a protocol-defined interim analysis (IA).

An Independent Adjudication Committee (IAC) was identified as part of the Risk Minimization Action Plan for PML (RAMP) program to review new neurological signs and symptoms potentially consistent with  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML).  The  IAC  provided  input  regarding  subject evaluation and management per the IAC PML project instructions.

## Objectives

## Primary Objective

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of vedolizumab when added to background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen compared to placebo and background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen on intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 in subjects who received allo-HSCT as treatment for a hematologic malignancy or myeloproliferative disorder.

## Safety Objective

The safety  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  vedolizumab  when  added  to  background  aGvHD prophylaxis regimen compared with placebo and background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen.

## Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy of vedolizumab using a range of clinical responses a day +180 (details are reported in the endpoints section).

A pletora of exploratory objectives are aimed at providing additional information on efficacy. (details on endpoints section)

## Endpoints

Primary Endpoint intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Grade C-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +180.
- NRM by Day +180.
- OS by Day +180.
- Grade B-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +180.

## The exploratory endpoints were:

- GvHD- and relapse-free (of the underlying malignancy) survival by Day +180 and 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Stage 2-4 intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 and 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Grade B-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Grade C-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- OS by 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- NRM by 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Relapse-free (of underlying malignancy) survival by Day +180 and 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Frequency  of  aGvHD  by  maximum  severity  and  organ  involvement  by  Day  +180  and  12 months after allo-HSCT.
- aGvHD outcomes by MAGIC criteria.
- Relapse by Day +180 and 12 months after allo-HSCT.
- Incidence and duration of systemic immunosuppression for GvHD treatment.
- FACT-BMT.
- EQ-5D scores.
- Health care utilization (eg, length of stay and re-hospitalization). Note that analyses were not performed for this exploratory endpoint; see Section 9.8.4 for details.
- Vedolizumab serum trough concentration on Day +180.
- The percentage of subjects with positive AVA and neutralizing AVA.

## Sample size

Assuming  the  event  rate  for  the  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT  was 34.1% for the placebo group and 21.8% for the vedolizumab IV group, and the rate of loss-to-followup  was  10%  for  both  groups,  a  sample  size  of  279  subjects  per  group  (558  subjects  total)  was expected to generate 148 events for the intestinal aGvHD-free survival, and hence provide 90% power at the at alpha of 0.05 for a 2-sided hypothesis based on log-rank test. Assuming the event rate for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival was 39.5% for the placebo group and 27.1% for the  vedolizumab IV group, this sample size was expected to generate 177 events for the intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival and hence provide approximately 86% power at alpha of 0.05 for a 2-sided hypothesis.

The study closed with a total of 343 subjects enrolled (with 71 primary efficacy events) of the 558 subjects originally planned (with an estimated 148 primary efficacy events anticipated).

IA An IA for futility and sample size re-estimation was conducted after 31% of the targeted primary endpoint events (specifically,  46  intestinal  aGvHD/death events  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT)  were accrued. The analysis was performed by an independent statistical center (ie, an external vendor) in a manner that maintained blinding for the sponsor study team, investigators, and subjects. IA results were reviewed by the DMC, but not the sponsor.

The futility stopping was considered non binding. At the time of the IA, 256 subjects had been randomized (130 to vedolizumab IV, 126 to placebo). This  analysis  included  the  primary  endpoint: intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  after  alloHSCT. There were 17 events (13%) of intestinal aGvHD or death (any cause)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  29  events  (23%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  Kaplan  Meier estimates by Day +180 were 85.04% in the vedolizumab IV group and 74.76% in the placebo group. The HR (vedolizumab IV vs placebo) was 0.52, and the conditional power was 0.989.

Based on the review of IA data, the DMC recommended to continue the trial without modification.

## Selection of Vedolizumab Dose in the Study

The vedolizumab IV dose selected, 300 mg, was based on safety, efficacy, and PK data from Study Vedolizumab-1015  and  the  IBD  program.  This  dosing  regimen  was  estimated  to  provide  serum concentrations above 10 μg/mL for 180 days.

The 300 mg dose of vedolizumab was well tolerated in subjects in Study Vedolizumab-1015 without delay of engraftment (median 14 days for the 300 mg vedolizumab IV cohort) or new safety concerns. In this study, vedolizumab dosing was repeated during the 6 months after the allo-HSCT, during which time subjects were at the highest risk of developing intestinal aGvHD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The same vedolizumab dose regimen administered to adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who underwent alloHSCT for prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD was considered appropriate for administration to adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 30 kg. In phase 3 studies in adults with IBD, body weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety data from these studies showed no difference in the incidence of treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) and a similar safety profile in adults receiving vedolizumab IV every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks. A population PK model was developed using pooled phase 1, 2, and 3 study data  from  the  vedolizumab  IV  clinical  program  in  adults  with  UC  or  CD  to  characterize  the  PK  of vedolizumab  and  to  assess  the  impact  of  patient  demographic  characteristics  (eg,  age  and  body weight) on PK. This model indicated that weight-based dosing is not required and that age is not a clinically meaningful covariate. In addition, results from Study Vedolizumab-1015 indicated that the PK of vedolizumab (300 mg) in adults with aGvHD was similar to that in adults with UC or CD.

Background GvHD prophylaxis Additionally, all subjects received a combination of CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF (Choi et al. 2014; Reshef 2012; Ruutu et al. 2012), which is commonly prescribed as prophylaxis of GvHD for subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin) may have been used at the discretion of the treating physician; however, the proportion of subjects receiving ATG did not comprise more than approximately 25% of the total number of subjects enrolled into this study.

## Prior and Concomitant Therapy

## Excluded Medications and Treatments

The following is a list of medications and treatments that were prohibited during the study:

- Any investigational agent (other than vedolizumab), including agents other than corticosteroids for treatment of GvHD.
- Checkpoint inhibitors.
- Any therapy for aGvHD prophylaxis other than that specified in the inclusion criteria. If 1 of the GvHD  prophylaxis  agents  specified  in  the  inclusion  criteria  had  been  discontinued  due  to toxicity and an alternative agent was started, the subject was permitted to remain on study drug after consultation with the medical monitor.
- All live vaccines from 30 days before randomization to at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.
- Either approved  or  investigational monoclonal  antibody  or  equivalent  biologics for the treatment  of  other  conditions  (eg,  rheumatoid  arthritis),  other  than  localized  injections  (eg, intra-ocular injections for wet macular degeneration).

Subjects  were  instructed  not  to  take  any  medications,  including  over-the-counter  products,  without first consulting with the investigator.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Randomization  and  stratification :  Subjects  who  met  all  eligibility  criteria  and  provided  written informed consent were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to 2 treatment arms (vedolizumab IV or placebo IV) no more than 2 days before the first dose of study drug on Day -1.

Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  ( ≥ 18  years  or  adolescents  aged  12  to  &lt;18  years),  human leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  match  or  mismatch  (8/8  or  7/8),  conditioning  regimen  (myeloablative  or reduced intensity conditioning), and treatment with or without ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin).

There  were  inconsistencies  in  the  information  regarding  one  or  more  stratification  factors  for  22 subjects  collected  at  the  time  of  randomization  (per  the  IRT)  versus  information  collected  after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomization.  The  original  IRT  data  (collected  at  randomization)  were  used  for  the  main  efficacy analyses.

## Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment

The investigator or the investigator's designee utilized the IRT to randomize the subject into the study. The  medication  ID  number  of  the  study  drug  dispensed  was  then  provided  by  the  IRT  by  email notification  to  the  unblinded  site  pharmacist/nurse.  To  maintain  the  blind,  the  IRT  ensured  that  the investigator or designee was unaware of the medication ID assigned to the subject.

Blinding The investigational drug blind was maintained using the IRT.

## Statistical Methods

The end of treatment (EOT) analysis (ie, primary analysis) for efficacy and safety data was originally planned at the EOT, when all subjects completed Day +180 or withdrew from the study, or when the planned number of primary endpoint events as determined by the sample size adaptation rule in the IA were accrued. However, the sponsor decided to terminate study enrollment early due to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a shift in standard of care for transplant practice  Subsequently, the EOT analysis  was  not  performed  as  planned  and  the  SAP  was  amended  to  reflect  this  change.  The  EOS Analysis (ie, final analysis) was performed after the final database lock at the end of study.

All statistical testing was 2-sided, performed at an alpha level of 0.05. All Cis reported were 2-sided 95%,  unless  stated  otherwise.  P-values  were  rounded  to  4  decimal  places  before  assessment  of statistical significance.

aGvHD: acute graft-versus-host disease; allo-HSCT: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; EOS: end of study.

In the case that liver or skin aGvHD occurred but neither intestinal aGvHD nor death occurred, subjects were censored.

## Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data

## Missing Efficacy Data

Through the end of the double-blind period, missing dichotomous efficacy data (eg, intestinal aGvHD event as dichotomous endpoint) were to be handled using the nonresponder imputation method, ie,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

any subject with missing information for determination of endpoint status was considered as having an undesirable outcome in the analysis.

Missing data for continuous endpoints were imputed using the LOCF method. For subjects without any nonmissing  postbaseline  measurement,  the  missing  data  were  to  be  imputed  using  the  baseline observation carried forward method. Other missing data imputation methods (eg, multiple imputations or repeated measure mixed effects model) may have been explored.

Missing data for time to event endpoints were not to be imputed.

## Analysis Sets

Analysis sets included the following:

Randomized set: All subjects who were randomized.

Safety analysis set (SAF): All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects in this set were  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  actually  received.  This  population  was  used  for  safety analysis.

Full analysis set (FAS): Following the intent-to-treat principle, the FAS included all subjects who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and underwent allo-HSCT. The analysis was based on the treatment to which subjects were randomized. This population was used for efficacy analysis.

PK population set: Subjects from the SAF with at least 1 posttreatment PK sample collected.

## Efficacy Analysis

Efficacy data were analyzed using the FAS.

Efficacy endpoints and the associated supporting data were planned to be descriptively summarized by age groups. However, since only 1 subject was aged ≤ 18 years, results were descriptively summarized in the overall population.

Unless stated otherwise, all statistical comparisons were also conducted in the overall population.

All statistical testing was 2-sided and performed at an alpha level of 0.05. To control the overall type I error  rate  for  the  comparison  between  vedolizumab  and  placebo  groups  for  the  primary  and  key secondary efficacy endpoints in the overall population, a fixed-sequence testing approach was used. Specifically, the statistical testing of the intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival was only to be performed if the treatment difference for the primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant (ie, p &lt;0.05). The next secondary efficacy endpoint was only to be tested if the treatment difference for the  first  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  significant  (ie,  p  &lt;0.05),  and  so  on  for  each  subsequent secondary efficacy endpoint.

The order of the statistical testing for the primary and key secondary endpoints were as follows:

1. Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT.
2. Intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival by Day +180.
3. Grade C-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +180.
4. NRM by Day +180.
5. OS by Day +180.
6. Grade B-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +180.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Testing  of  the  additional  efficacy  endpoints  were  not  multiplicity  adjusted.  Nominal  p-values  are presented.

Per  the  SAP,    sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy endpoints  using  corrected  stratification  information  that  was  collected  after  randomization  and recorded in the EDC.

Additionally, HLA compatibility also captured HLA matching (7/8, 8/8) between the study subject and an HLA-compatible donor. The source of these data was the donor page. HLA compatibility differed slightly from both sets of data for HLA match (collected at randomization and recorded in the IRT vs corrected stratification information collected after randomization and recorded in the EDC).

## Primary Efficacy Analyses

The null (H0) and alternative (HA) hypotheses for the primary efficacy endpoint, intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT, were as follows:

H0: Intestinal aGvHD-free Survival by Day +180 Vedolizumab = Intestinal aGvHD-free Survival by Day +180 Placebo

HA: Intestinal  aGvHD-free  Survival  by  Day  +180  Vedolizumab ≠ Intestinal  aGvHD-free  Survival  by Day +180 Placebo

The primary endpoint was analyzed using the log-rank test, with Kaplan-Meier estimates presented. Subjects without documented intestinal aGvHD events or death before reaching Day +180 after alloHSCT were censored at the date of last  assessment/visit/contact or  Day  +180,  whichever  occurred first. Randomized subjects who did not receive any of their assigned study drug were censored at Day -1. The statistical significance of treatment effect was tested against a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  also  analyzed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with treatment group, stratified by randomization strata. Point estimate of hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding 95% CI are presented herein. The randomization strata are as follows:

- Age ( ≥ 18, ≥ 12 and &lt;18). Note: Only 1 subject was aged ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years; therefore, age was not used as a stratification factor.
- HLA match (7/8, 8/8).
- Conditioning regimen (myeloablative, reduced intensity conditioning).
- ATG (with, without).

In addition, summary statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimates by treatment group are provided.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

The secondary efficacy endpoints are reported in the endpoints section.

All time-to-event endpoints were analyzed in a similar way as the primary efficacy endpoint, using logrank test in the FAS. Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with treatment group and stratified by the randomization strata. Point estimate of HR and the corresponding 95% CI are presented.

Additional Efficacy Endpoints are reported in the endpoints section.

All time-to-event endpoints were analyzed in a similar way as the primary efficacy endpoint, using logrank test in the FAS, with Kaplan-Meier estimates presented. Nominal p-values are provided.

Dichotomous  efficacy  endpoints  were  summarized  by  treatment  group  using  descriptive  statistics (count,  percentage).  The  nominal  p-value  and  point  estimate  of  treatment  difference  based  on  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)  method  adjusted  for  randomization  stratification  factors  along  with 95% Cis  are  presented.  All  subjects  with  missing  data  for  determination  of  status  of  dichotomous efficacy  endpoints  were  considered  treatment  failures  or  as  having  an  undesirable  event  in  the analysis.

Duration  of  systemic  immunosuppression  for  GvHD  treatment  by  12  months  after  allo-HSCT,  was summarized  descriptively  (n,  mean,  SD,  median,  minimum,  maximum),  and  tested  using  Wilcoxon rank-sum test between treatment groups.

The following sensitivity analyses were performed:

- To  accommodate the events of interest  that  occurred  within  the  protocol-defined  +/-  7-day window, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed by Day +187 after alloHSCT. Subjects who did not have an event by Day +187 after allo-HSCT were censored at last contact or Day +187 after allo-HSCT, whichever occurred first.
- Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using stratified log-rank test using the FAS, stratified by randomization stratification factors.
- Primary and secondary endpoints (with the exception of OS) were explored using competing risk analysis to accommodate the competing nature of multiple causes to the same event.

Due to inconsistency(ies) in stratification information collected in the IRT versus the EDC, sensitivity analysis  for  inconsistency(ies)  among  them  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  study endpoints using the corrected stratification information from the EDC.

Subgroup Analysis applied to the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.

## Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses

The  COVID-19  pandemic  disrupted  various  aspects  of  the  study  conduct,  including  onsite  visits  for subjects and auditors; no other changes in conduct occurred during the study. Ultimately, enrolment was  terminated  early  and  the  study  completed  on  09  May  2022,  primarily  due  to  low  subject recruitment and enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic (since February 2020). The decision was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

influenced  by  multiple  factors,  none  of  which  were  related  to  safety  concerns  regarding  the  use  of vedolizumab in  this  patient  population.  Reasons  for  reduced  enrollment  varied  among  sites,  eg,  an increased  number  of  excluded  donor  sources  (haploid  transplants),  excluded  medications  (posttransplantation  cyclophosphamide), and increased use of ATG, for which a 25% cap had been met. Additionally,  there  was  continued  competition  for  hospital  and  study  resources,  minimization  of hospital visits by patients to those considered strictly necessary, and voluntary discontinuations from the study due to concerns of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected the following aspects of the planned study conduct:

- For sites that were not able to conduct onsite visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth visits  were  conducted  as  an  acceptable  alternative  to  remotely  assess  subject  safety  and overall  clinical  status  per  the  schedule  of  study  procedures.  Telehealth  visits  were  done  by delegated site  staff  speaking directly  with  the  subject  by  telephone or  other  medium  (eg,  a computer-based video communication).
- A total of 8 investigator site audits were planned for the study; however, 3 site audits were not conducted due to an inability to physically visit sites related to COVID-19 restrictions.

Furthermore, European regulations did not allow remote access to subject data. The study completed before the investigator site audits could be rescheduled for when COVID-19 restrictions allowed.

## Protocol Changes

A total of 7 amendments to the initial protocol (13 June 2018) were issued. Two of the amendments were global and 5 were local (France, Sweden, UK, Norway, and Germany).

Both global protocol amendments were considered substantial, and all local amendments were nonsubstantial. Although approved, no subjects were enrolled under the local Protocol Amendment 05 in Germany. Study subjects were enrolled under all other global and local protocols/protocol amendments.

## Protocol Amendment 6 (Dated 10 June 2019) - Global

The  primary  purpose  of  this  substantial,  global  protocol  amendment  was  to  consolidate  all  of  the preceding  local  amendments  (France,  Sweden,  UK,  Norway,  and  Germany)  into  a  single  global amendment that  included  (1)  the  addition  of  specified  methods  and  time  frame  of  highly  effective contraception, (2) addition of PML or tuberculosis as examples of withdrawal criteria, (3) unblinding without  sponsor  permission  in  case  of  medical  emergency,  and  (4)  notification  of  the  competent regulatory  authorities  upon  study  termination  or  suspension  along  with  other  local  regulations.  The following is a summary of the changes made in the amendment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Consolidation of the previous local amendments to meet local regulations into a single global amendment.
- Addition of final results from the completed Study Vedolizumab-1015.
- Clarification of the screening window and that subjects may be rescreened.
- Clarification that randomization may occur within 2 days of the first dose of study drug on Day -1.
- Clarification of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
- Clarification of the excluded and permitted concomitant medications.
- Addition of a criterion for withdrawal of a subject from the study for lack of efficacy.
- Clarification of the management of clinical events.
- Clarification regarding unscheduled PK sample collection.

## Protocol Amendment 7 (Dated 18 September 2019) - Global

The  primary  purpose  of  this  substantial,  global  protocol  amendment  was  to  open  enrollment  to adolescent  subjects  aged ≥ 12  years  and  weighing ≥ 30  kg,  which  was  a  required  condition  of  the European  Medicines  Agency's  Paediatric  Committee-endorsed  paediatric  investigational  plan  for vedolizumab  as  prophylaxis  of  aGvHD  after  allo-HSCT.  The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  changes made in the amendment:

- Clarification of the description of the disease to be treated in adolescent subjects.
- Addition of results from nonclinical studies related to inclusion of adolescent subjects.
- Updated human experience as reported in the 9th development safety update report.
- Updated the study rationale and benefit:risk profile to support the inclusion of adolescent subjects.
- Addition of data supporting the dose regimen in adolescent subjects.
- Update to the inclusion criteria impacted by the addition of adolescent subjects.
- Updated the permitted medications to include use of topical anesthetic in adolescent subjects.
-  Clarification  to  the  procedures  that  were  to  be  conducted  after  discontinuation  or  withdrawal  of  a subject.
- Addition of height assessment to be collected at the EOS visit.
- Updated the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements to include female adolescent subjects aged ≥ 12 years.
-  Addition  of  necessary  age-appropriate  documentation  that  was  to  be  completed  for  adolescent subjects.
- Addition of blood collection volumes for adolescent and adult subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Updated the version of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events to be used for the grading of AEs.
- Updated stratification to include age group and data assessments in adolescent subjects.
-  Updated  the  appendices  regarding  methotrexate  treatment  to  support  the  inclusion  of  adolescent subjects,  and  to  include  age-appropriate  assessments  of  aGvHD  clinical  stage  and  MAGIC  severity index for aGvHD.

AE: adverse event; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; CRF: case report form; GvHD: graft-versus-host disease; LTFU: long-term follow-up.

The designation of visits was based on the actual day of evaluation relative to the start date of the study rather than the nominal visit recorded in the CRF.

* Percentages are based on the number of subjects eligible for randomization.

b Subjects completed study treatment if they received 7 doses of study drug and completed the Day +180 visit.

Percentages are based on the number of subjects who discontinued study drug or discontinued the study.

Study completion refers to the 180-day treatment period and the LTFU, 6 months after the last dose of study drug.

The  blind  was  broken  for  a  total  of  6  subjects  (3  subjects  in  each  treatment  group):  3  were accidentally unblinded on site (2 in the vedolizumab IV group and 1 in the placebo group), and 3 were unblinded per protocol due to a medical emergency related to GvHD progression (1 in the vedolizumab IV group and 2 in the placebo group).

## Medical History and Concurrent Medical Conditions

## Medical History

All 334 study subjects (100% overall) reported medical history. The most commonly reported ( ≥ 25.0% of subjects overall) medical history terms by SOC were neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl  cysts  and  polyps)  (100%),  vascular  disorders  (35.9%),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders (34.7%), gastrointestinal disorders (33.5%), surgical and medical procedures (31.7%),

musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (27.5%), psychiatric disorders (26.6%), and infections and infestations (26.0%).

The most commonly reported ( ≥ 10.0% of subjects overall) medical history terms by PT were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (43.7%), hypertension (29.3%), myelodysplastic syndrome (21.9%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (15.9%), anemia (14.7%), and depression (10.8%).

## Concurrent Medical Conditions

The most commonly reported concurrent condition terms by SOC were vascular disorders (32.3%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (31.1%), gastrointestinal disorders (25.1%), psychiatric disorders (24.0%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (21.0%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (21.0%). The most commonly reported concurrent condition terms by PT were hypertension (27.5%),  anemia  (14.4%),  nausea  (9.6%),  depression  (9.6%),  anxiety  (9.0%),  and  hyperlipidemia (7.2%).

## Baseline Disease Characteristics

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics for the FAS are summarized in Table 11.d.

Overall,  baseline  disease characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  vedolizumab  and placebo treatment groups. Additionally, the study population (patients undergoing allo-HSCT) was also generally  well  balanced  within  the  subgroups  of  conditioning  regimen  and  ATG  use  and  for  other factors influencing the risk of intestinal aGVHD development.

Per protocol, the total  number  of  subjects  receiving  ATG  was  not  to  comprise  more  than approximately 25% of the total number of subjects enrolled into the study. However, as enrollment terminated early (see Section 9.8), the overall percentage of subjects with ATG at baseline was higher: 41.1%  (137  subjects)  with  ATG,  and  58.9%  (196  subjects)  without  ATG  per  IRT  data  collected  at randomization.

## Medication History

All  334  study  subjects  (100%  overall)  reported  medication  history.  The  most  commonly  reported medications (&gt;50% of subjects overall) in the medication history were ursodeoxycholic acid (84.1%), acyclovir  (81.4%),  paracetamol  (80.2%),  methotrexate  (79.6%),  sulfamethoxazole;  trimethoprim (73.4%), ondansetron (67.4%), furosemide (67.4%), fluconazole (60.5%), tacrolimus (57.5%), and magnesium sulfate (55.1%). As immunosuppressants, methotrexate and tacrolimus were part of the prophylaxis regimen for this study.

## Concomitant Medications

A total of 181 subjects (54.2% overall) reported medications that started and stopped before baseline. The  most  commonly  reported  medications  by  therapeutic  classification  were  antineoplastic  agents (28.7%), antiemetics and antinauseants (24.9%), and corticosteroids for systemic use (15.9%).

## Concomitant Medications That Were Ongoing or Started After Baseline

A total of 333 subjects (99.7% overall) reported medications that were ongoing at baseline or those that  started  after  baseline.  The  most  commonly  reported  ( ≥ 60%  overall)  ongoing/newly  started concomitant  medications  by  therapeutic  classification  were  antivirals  for  systemic  use  (96.1%),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antibacterials for systemic use (95.2%), antimycotics for systemic use (94.0%), drugs for acid related disorders (90.4%), analgesics (85.9%), antiemetics and antinauseants (83.2%), bile and liver therapy (79.0%), blood substitutes and perfusion solutions (75.1%), antihistamines for systemic use (73.4%), corticosteroids  for  systemic  use  (67.7%),  psycholeptics  (65.9%),  mineral  supplements  (62.6%), stomatological preparations (62.0%), and drugs for functional gastrointestinal disorders (60.8%).

## Number analysed

## Data Sets Analyzed

Analysis  sets  were  the  randomized  set,  safety  analysis  set  (SAF),  full  analysis  set  (FAS),  and  PK population  set.  The  analysis  sets  are  defined  in  Section  9.7.1.2  and  summarized  in  Table  11.a. Subjects excluded from the analysis set are included in Listing 16.2.3.1.

A total of 343 subjects were randomized to study treatment: 174 subjects to the 300 mg vedolizumab IV group and 169 subjects to the placebo IV group. Overall, 97.1% (169 of 174) and 97.6% (165 of 169) of subjects in the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups, respectively, were included in the SAF (Table 11.a). In the FAS, 96.6% (168 of 174) and 97.6% (165 of 169) of subjects in the vedolizumab IV  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  were  included.  One  subject  was  randomized  to  treatment  and received at least 1 dose of study drug but did not receive allo-HSCT per protocol; this subject was included in the SAF but not the FAS. The PK population set included 97.1% (169 of 174) of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group.

## Efficacy results

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

## Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT

Definition: Intestinal  aGvHD  was  defined  as  Stages  1  through  4  intestinal  involvement  per  aGvHD clinical stage criteria.

There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo group  in  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT  (p  &lt;0.001).  The  risk  of  an intestinal aGvHD event or death in subjects was 55% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI of HR, 0.27-0.73).

In  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  there  were  24  subjects  (14.3%)  with  an  observed  event  of  intestinal aGvHD or death (any cause), whichever occurred first, by Day +180 after allo-HSCT; in the placebo group, there were 47 subjects (28.5%) with an observed event (Table 11.h). Of those subjects, 12 (7.1%)  from  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  31  (28.8%)  from  the  placebo  group  had  an  intestinal aGvHD event, and 12 subjects (7.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 16 subjects (9.7%) from the placebo group died.

Intestinal aGvHD-free survival was the time from the date of first study drug administration (Day -1) to intestinal aGvHD event/death, whichever occurred first, where an event was defined as death due to any cause or Stage 1-4 intestinal involvement per aGvHD clinical stage criteria.

*Kaplan-Meier estimate.

Represents the censored valued. It was censored for subjects who did not have the intestinal aGvHD event or died or had the event after prespecified timing, eg, last contact or Day +180 after allo-HSCT, whichever occurred first. If a subject had an intestinal aGvHD event and died due to any cause including intestinal aGvHD, time to event was derived as time to first qualifying event, ie, intestinal aGvHD event.

° Obtained via log-rank test.

d Obtained via Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group, stratified by randomization strata: HLA match (7/8, 8/8), conditioning regimen (myeloablative, reduced intensity conditioning), ATG (with, without).

The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  for  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  was  85.52%  (95%  CI, 79.17-90.05) for the vedolizumab IV group and 70.85% (95% CI, 63.16-77.22) for the placebo group. Figure 11.a presents Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the primary endpoint.

If a subject had intestinal aGvHD event and died due to any cause, including intestinal aGvHD, time to event was derived as time to first qualifying event, ie, intestinal aGvHD event. Hazard ratio was obtained via Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group, stratified by randomization strata: HLA match (7/8, 8/8), conditioning regimen (myeloablative, reduced intensity conditioning), ATG (with.

without), and p-value from a log-rank test.

Consistent results were observed for the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, which included  the  use  of  the  Day  +187  window,  stratified  log-rank  test,  competing  risk  analysis,  and corrected stratification information.

A forest plot of subgroup  analyses for  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  for  the  FAS  is presented  in  Figure  11.b.  These  subgroup  analyses  provide  further  support  for  the  benefit  of vedolizumab IV in reducing the risk of intestinal aGvHD and mortality up to Day +180. In particular, HRs favoring vedolizumab IV were observed in subjects with a 8/8  HLA antigen match with a favorable trend in the 7/8 ones (not statistically relevant). Similarly, a favourable effect could be seen in patients conditioned with the RIC regimen while only a trend is recognizable with the myeloablative one.  A positive effect was observed throughout the population regardless the ATG use (with or without), or stem cell source (peripheral blood or bone marrow). Overall, although in some cases a positive effect of  Vedolizumab was recognized in the subgroup analysis, the reduced numbers of enrolled patients and,  consequently,  the  small  numbers  of  each  subgroup  could  have  impaired  the  strength  of  this analysis.

## Secondary Endpoints

## Intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free (of the underlying malignancy) survival by day +180

Definition: Risk of an intestinal aGvHD event, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first by day 180.

There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo group in the intestinal  aGvHD-free and relapse-free (of the underlying malignancy) survival by Day +180  (p  =  0.0043).  The  risk  of  an  event  in  subjects  was  44%  less  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.56; 95% CI of HR, 0.37-0.86).

Although the number of subjects who relapsed was greater in the vedolizumab IV group (18 subjects) compared with  placebo  (13  subjects),  the  total  number  of  subjects  who  relapsed  during  this  study through Day +180 was similar between treatment groups (18 subjects in the vedolizumab IV group vs 17 subjects in the placebo group).

The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  for  intestinal  aGvHD-free  and  relapse-free  survival  by  Day  +180  was 78.87% (95% CI, 71.83-84.35) for the vedolizumab IV group and 65.35% (95% CI, 57.46-72.13).

The subgroup analysis confirms what previously seen in the primary endpoint for the benefit of vedolizumab IV in reducing the risk of intestinal aGvHD and mortality up to Day +180. In particular, HRs favoring vedolizumab were observed in subjects with HLA antigen match of 8/8, RIC conditioning regimen and with peripheral stem cell source of graft. For the ATG use, patients treated with ATG presented a favorable HR. The same concerns raised about the small numbers of patients included in each subgroups and, consequently, about the strength of these evidences are valid.

## Grade C-D aGvHD-free survival by Day +180).

Definition : GVHD grade C-D in any organ involvement based on IBMDR Index by Day +180.

There was a statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group; the risk of a Grade C-D aGvHD event or death, whichever occurred first, in subjects was 41% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI of HR, 0.390.91).

In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 35 subjects (20.8%) with an observed event of Grade C-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +180; in the placebo group, there were 52 subjects (31.5%) with an observed event (Table 11.k). Of those subjects, 22 (13.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 35 (21.2%) from the placebo group had an observed Grade C-D aGvHD event, and 13 subjects (7.7%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 17 subjects (10.3%) from the placebo group died.

Although the numbers for each of the subgroup analyses related to standard GvHD prophylaxis therapies were small, the results were statistically consistent, suggesting a benefit with the addition vedolizumab IV therapy. The same consideration regarding the limits of analysis performed with small numbers of patients are valid also for the subgroup analysis of this endpoint.

## Nor Relapse Mortality by Day +180

Definition: Effect of vedolizumab compared to placebo on NRM in subjects by Day +180

There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo group in the endpoint of NRM by Day +180 (p = 0.0668). The marginal effect in NRM was observed in favor of the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI of HR, 0.221.04). In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 10 subjects with an observed event of death without relapse  by  Day  +180  (6.0%  of  subjects);  in  the  placebo  group,  there  were  19  subjects  with  an observed event (11.5% of subjects). The Kaplan-Meier estimate for NRM by Day +180 was 93.93% (95%  CI,  89.01-96.69)  for  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  88.02%  (95%  CI,  81.85-92.19)  for  the placebo group.

Definition: the effect of vedolizumab compared to placebo on OS by Day +180

Per the fixed-sequence hierarchical testing procedure following a prespecified order of primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, the statistical testing of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint of OS was not performed given that the statistical significance of the preceding key secondary efficacy endpoint (ie, NRM) was not demonstrated (ie, p &gt;0.05). By Day +180, 17 subjects (10.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 25 subjects (15.2%) from the placebo group had died.

Additionally, the nominal p-value for OS by Day +180 between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group was 0.1458.

The Kaplan-Meier estimate for OS by Day +180 was 89.72% (95% CI, 83.98-93.48) for the vedolizumab IV group and 84.38% (95% CI, 77.76-89.16) for the placebo group.

Definition: GVHD grade B-D in any organ involvement based on IBMDR Index by Day +180

Per  the  fixed-sequence  hierarchical  testing  procedure  the  fifth  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  of Grade B-D aGvHD-free survival was not tested. Nominal p-value is provided instead. The nominal pvalue for  Grade  B-D  aGvHD-free survival  by  Day  +180  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the placebo group was 0.0105. The risk of a Grade B-D aGvHD event or death, whichever occurred first, was 36% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI of HR, 0.46-0.91). In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 56 subjects (33.3%) with an observed event of Grade B-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +180; in the placebo group, there were 77 subjects (46.7%) with an observed event (Table 11.n). Of those subjects, 47 (28.0%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 64 (38.8%) from the placebo group had an observed Grade B-D aGvHD event, and 9 subjects (5.4%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 13 subjects (7.9%) from the placebo group died.

## Exploratory Endpoints

An overview of the exploratory efficacy results by Day +180 and Day +365 is presented above.

Exploratory endpoints by Day +365 are similar to the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (at Day +180) for this study:

- -Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +365

A total of 21.4% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 33.9% of subjects in the placebo group had an observed event of intestinal aGvHD or death (any cause), whichever occurred first, by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.0041; HR, 0.53 [95% CI of HR, 0.35-0.81]). At Day +180, there were 14.3% and 28.5% of subjects with an observed event in the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups, respectively (p &lt;0.001).

- -Intestinal  aGvHD-free  and  relapse-free  (of  the  underlying  malignancy)  survival  by Day +365

A total of 33.3% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 38.8% of subjects in the placebo group had an observed event of intestinal aGvHD, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.1676; HR, 0.78 [95% CI of HR, 0.54-1.12]). At Day +180, there were 20.8% and 33.9% of subjects with an observed event in the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.0043).

- -Grade C-D aGvHD-free (based on IBMTR index for any organ involvement) survival by Day +365

A total of 28.0% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 35.8% of subjects in the placebo group had an observed event of Grade C-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.0709; HR, 0.68 [95% CI of HR, 0.46-1.00]). At Day +180, there were 20.8%  and  31.5%  of  subjects  with  an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.0204).

- -NRM by Day +365

A total of 8.9% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 15.2% of subjects in the placebo group had an observed event of death without relapse by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.0670; HR,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.49 [95% CI of HR, 0.25-0.95]). At Day +180, there were 6.0% and 11.5% of subjects with an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo  groups,  respectively  (nominal  p  = 0.0668).

## -OS by Day +365

A total of 16.7% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 21.8% of subjects in the placebo group died by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.1741; HR, 0.67 [95% CI of HR, 0.41-1.11]). At Day +180,  10.1%  and  15.2%  of  subjects  had  died  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo  groups, respectively (nominal p = 0.1458).

## -Grade B-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +365

A total of 41.1% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 49.7% of subjects in the placebo group had an observed event of Grade B-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.0534; HR, 0.71 [95% CI of HR, 0.52-0.99]). At Day +180, there were 33.3%  and  46.7%  of  subjects  with  an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo groups, respectively (nominal p = 0.0105).

Of additional interest was Stage 2-4 intestinal aGvHD-free survival at Day +180 compared with Day +365. At Day +180, 11.3% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 20.0% of subjects in the placebo group had an observed event of Stage 2-4 intestinal aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first (nominal p = 0.0222). At Day +365, 19.0% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 25.5% of subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  an  observed  event  of  Stage  2-4  intestinal  aGvHD  or  death, whichever occurred first (nominal p = 0.0981)

Global numbers of events increase during the follow up, from the day +180 to 365; this is consistent both with the follow up trend but also with the late onset of aGVHD. The reduced enrolment presented an effect in this subset analyses, considering that each analysis was conducted on small numbers of patients. Patient's distribution between the treatment groups were well balanced, with the exception of relapse of the underlying malignancy by Day +365 (19.6% of subjects with non-missing data in the vedolizumab IV group vs 13.3% in the placebo group).

For subjects with GvHD requiring immunosuppression, the mean number of days that immunosuppression was required was numerically less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo  group  through  Day  +180  (nominal  p  =  0.0151)  but  the  effect  was  lost  through  Day  +365 (nominal  p  =  0.4882),  suggesting  a  time  limited  efficacy  of  Vedolizumab  in  reducing  the  need  of immunosuppression treatments.

## Quality of life results

Results from the FACT-BMT at the Day +97, +180, and +365 visits were similar between treatment groups for FACT-G (general) and the BMT-specific subscales of physical well-being, social/family wellbeing, emotional well-being, functional well-being, bone marrow transplant subscale, and trial outcome index. A noted exception was the Day +97 subscale of social/family well-being that had a nominal pvalue of 0.0203 between treatment groups (least-squares [LS] mean difference, -0.98; 95% CI, -1.81 to -0.15). The change from baseline in FACT total scores between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo  group  (LS  mean  difference  [95%  CI])  was  not  statistically  significant  at  any  time  point assessed (p = 0.1420, Day +97; p = 0.7754, Day +180; p = 0.4237, Day +365). A summary of the FACT-BMT and change from baseline by visit for the FAS can be found in Table 15.2.38.1.1.

A numerical benefit was observed in the change from baseline in the EQ visual analog scale (VAS) at Day  +180  (LS  mean  difference,  3.93;  95%  CI,  0.08-7.77)  in  favor  of  the  vedolizumab  IV  group (minimal p-value = 0.0452); however, results were not statistically significant at the Day +97 (p = 0.3786) or Day +365 (p = 0.3570) visits. Additionally, results from the EQ-5D scores at the Day +97, +180, and +365 visits were not statistically different between treatment groups for the subscales of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, or anxiety/depression at any time point assessed. Similarly, the change from baseline in the index scores (US) between the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups  was  not  statistically  significant  at  any  time  point  (p  =  0.5089,  Day  +97;  p  =  0.3646,  Day +180; p = 0.7315, Day +365).

## Safety results

AEs were  coded  using  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  version  24.0,  and summarized by System Organ Class (SOC), High-Level Term (HLT), and Preferred Term (PT). AEs were also summarized by severity and by relationship to study drug.

A TEAE was defined as any AE newly occurring or worsening from the first dose and 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A serious TEAE was defined as any SAE newly occurring or worsening from the first dose up to 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug, regardless of relationship to study drug. SAEs were also collected from 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug until the EOS.

## Extent of Exposure

The mean duration of exposure was similar between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group (241.7 and 230.0 days, respectively).

The mean number of doses received was also similar between treatment groups (5.4 doses [SD, 2.05] for the vedolizumab IV group and 5.1 doses [SD, 2.25] for the placebo group). Most subjects received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

7  doses  of  study  drug  per  protocol  (52.7%  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  50.9%  of subjects in the placebo group).

AE: adverse event; aGvHD: acute graft-versus-host disease; MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SAF: safety analysis set; TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event.

Subjects with 1 or more AE within a level of MedDRA term were counted only once in that level. MedDRA Dictionary (version 24.0) was used for coding AEs. TEAE was defined as any AE that started or worsened after administration of the first dose of study drug and up through 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

* One subject in the placebo group had 2 TEAEs that were coded as resulting in death. Both events (aGvHD and sepsis) were included in the total number for the placebo group.

TEAEwasdefined asanyAEthatstartedorworsened after administrationof thefirstdoseofstudydrug andupthrough18 weeks after the last dose of study drug. SOCs were sorted using alphabetical order and PTs were sorted in decreasing frequency based on the total number of subjects. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate was defined as the number of subjects experiencing the AE divided by the total exposure-time among subjects. The extent of exposure was calculated as (date of last dose of study drug - date of first dose of study drug +127) /365.25 for each subject.

AE: adverse event; MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PT: Preferred Term; SAF: safety analysis set; SOC: System Organ Class; TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event.

Subjects with 1 or more AE within a level of MedDRA term were counted only once in that level. MedDRA Dictionary (version 24.0) was used for coding AEs. TEAE was defined as any AE that started or worsened after administration of the first dose of study drug and up through 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

## Study Drug-Related TEAEs

Overall,  26.6% (89 of 334) of subjects had a TEAE considered by the investigator to be related to study drug (48 of 169 subjects [28.4%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 41 of 165 subjects [24.8%] in the placebo group) (Table 12.c). Study drug-related TEAEs were similar between the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups.

The  most  frequently  reported  study  drug-related  TEAEs,  by  SOC,  were  investigations  (5.9%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  7.9%  in  the  placebo  group),  infections  and  infestations  (6.5%  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vedolizumab  IV  group,  3.6%  in  the  placebo  group),  gastrointestinal disorders (2.4%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  6.7%  in  the  placebo  group),  immune  system  disorders  (3.0%  in  the vedolizumab IV group, 5.5% in the placebo group), blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group) (Table 12.f).

## AEs by Intensity

Overall,  1756  TEAEs  in  303  subjects  were  Grade  3  or  higher  in  intensity  (Table  12.c  above);  156 subjects (92.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group had 873 Grade 3 or higher events, and 147 subjects (89.1%) in the placebo group had 883 such events.

Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were similar between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group. The most  commonly  reported  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs,  by  SOC,  were  blood  and  lymphatic  system disorders (62.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 64.2% in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders (40.2%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  44.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  investigations  (37.9%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  40.0%  in  the  placebo  group),  infections  and  infestations  (35.5%  in  the vedolizumab IV group, 37.0% in the placebo group), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (21.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 23.0% in the placebo group).

The  most  commonly  reported  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs,  by  PT,  were  anaemia  (29.6%  in  the vedolizumab IV group, 31.5% in the placebo group), febrile neutropenia (31.4% in the vedolizumab IV group, 29.7% in the placebo group), stomatitis (27.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 26.7% in the placebo group), platelet count decreased (21.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 24.8% in the placebo group),  neutropenia  (17.2%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  17.0%  in  the  placebo  group),  and thrombocytopenia  (17.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  16.4%  in  the  placebo  group)  (Table 15.3.1.14).  All  other  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs  were  each  reported  for  29  subjects  or  fewer  in  the vedolizumab IV group.

No clinically meaningful difference in Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were found between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group.

## Treatment-Emergent AESIs

Overall,  321  subjects  (96.1%)  reported  a  total  of  1635  treatment-emergent  AESIs;  161  subjects [95.3%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  reported  857  treatment-emergent  AESIs,  and  160  subjects [97.0%] in the placebo group reported 778 treatment-emergent AESIs. The treatment-emergent AESI data suggest comparable safety profiles between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group.

AESI: adverse event of special interest; CMV: cytomegalovirus; IRR: infusion-related reaction; MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PML: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; SAF: safety analysis set. Subjects with 1 or more adverse events within a level of MedDRA term are counted only once in that level. The treatment-emergent period is defined as the period from administration of the first dose of study drug and up through18weeksafterthelastdoseofstudymedication.

MedDRA Dictionary (Version 24.0) was used for coding adverse events.

## Serious Infections

A total of 633 treatment-emergent AESIs of serious infection were reported for 236 subjects (70.7%) overall,  with  a  numerically  higher  incidence  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  (125  subjects  [74.0%]) compared with the placebo group (111 subjects [67.3%]).

The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  serious  infections,  by  PT,  were  CMV  infection reactivation (23.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 18.2% in the placebo group), pneumonia (7.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 8.5% in the placebo group), sepsis (5.3% in the vedolizumab IV group, 7.3% in the placebo group), Candida infection (4.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 4.2% in the placebo group),  urinary  tract  infection  (3.6%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  4.8%  in  the  placebo  group), Epstein-Barr  virus  infection  reactivation  (4.1%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  3.6%  in  the  placebo group), nasopharyngitis (5.3% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group), Clostridium difficile infection (5.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.2% in the placebo group), and conjunctivitis (3.6% in each treatment group).

Seven  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  had  at  least  1  SAE  of  pneumonia  (including  PTs  of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pneumonia pseudomonal, pneumonia bacterial, organising pneumonia, and pneumonia pneumococcal); 3 subjects had 2 SAEs of pneumonia, and 1 subject had 3 events.  Ten events resolved or were resolving at study completion, and 1 subject died. Two of the SAEs of pneumonia were considered related to study drug; for both events, study drug was withdrawn. No other SAEs of pneumonia were related to study drug.

Seven  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  had  at  least  1  SAE  of  sepsis  (including  PTs  of staphylococcal sepsis and Klebsiella sepsis) (Listing 16.2.7.3). Six events resolved or were resolving at study completion, and 1 event did not resolve. None of the events were related to study drug.

One subject in the vedolizumab IV group had an SAE of urinary tract infection. The event resolved and was not considered related to study drug.

## PML

A total of 3 subjects (1.8%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 2 subjects (1.2%) in the placebo group were listed as having 'PML' in the clinical trial database (Table 12.h). In none of these cases was PML

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

listed as a PT; however, all were identified because they were reported to have had a TEAE (by PT) of Human  polyomavirus  infection.  This  PT  was  included  as  an  event  under  the  definition  of  an  AESI, possibly suggestive of PML. An additional subject was confirmed as having PML. This subject had an AML status posttransplant and received a total of 6 doses of vedolizumab IV. Approximately 6 months after the last dose of vedolizumab IV, the subject developed AML relapse and aGvHD, for which the subject  received  intense  immunosuppressive  therapy  with  IV  steroids,  tacrolimus,  and  azacytidine. Approximately  1  month  later,  the  subject  developed  the  SAE  of  PML,  with  a  fatal  outcome.  The investigator  and  the  IAC  deemed  that  the  event  of  PML  was  due  to  acute  GvHD  and  'heavy' immunosuppression treatment that was unrelated to vedolizumab IV. This case is not listed as a TEAE of PML (by PT) in the clinical trial database because the event of PML occurred more than 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The subject died after completing the study.

## Malignancy

Malignancies, including relapse of the primary disease, were captured as AESIs and presented by SOC, HLT, and PT.

A total of 71 treatment-emergent AESIs of malignancy were reported for 55 subjects (16.5%) overall (29  subjects  [17.2%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  26  subjects  [15.8%]  in  the  placebo  group) (Table  12.h).  Treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy  were  similar  between  the  vedolizumab  IV group and the placebo group and consistent with a population of subjects undergoing allo-HSCT.

The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of malignancy, by PT, were acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent (5.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 5.5% in the placebo group), myelodysplastic syndrome (3.0%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  1.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  acute  lymphocytic  leukaemia recurrent (1.8% in the vedolizumab IV group, 0.6% in the placebo group), chronic myeloid leukaemia recurrent  (1.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  0.6%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (none in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.8% in the placebo group).

## Liver Injuries

A total of 292 treatment-emergent AESIs of liver injury were reported for 137 subjects (41.0%) overall (68  subjects  [40.2%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  69  subjects  [41.8%]  in  the  placebo  group) (Table  12.h).  Treatment-emergent  liver  injuries,  by  SOC,  included  investigations  (33.7%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  33.3%  in  the  placebo  group),  hepatobiliary disorders (10.1%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  8.5%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (0.6%  in  the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group). The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of liver  injury,  by  PT,  were  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  (24.9%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 17.6%  in  the  placebo  group),  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (18.9%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV group, 15.8% in the placebo group), blood bilirubin increased (13.0% in the vedolizumab IV group, 16.4% in the placebo group), hepatic function abnormal (4.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 6.7% in the placebo group), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (4.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in  the  placebo  group),  and  hyperbilirubinaemia  (5.3%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  none  in  the placebo group).

## Hypersensitivity Reactions Including IRRs and Injection Site Reactions

A total of 618 treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site reactions were reported for 270 subjects (80.8%) overall (134 subjects [79.3%] in the vedolizumab IV group  and  136  subjects  [82.4%]  in  the  placebo  group)  (Table  12.h).  The  high  incidence  of hypersensitivity reactions is confounded by the background/conditioning regimen that was administered 1 day before study drug dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site reactions, by SOC, were gastrointestinal disorders (55.0% in the vedolizumab IV group, 57.6% in the  placebo  group);  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (27.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 30.9%  in  the  placebo  group);  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (26.6%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  31.5%  in  the  placebo  group);  renal  and  urinary  disorders  (16.0%  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group,  18.8%  in  the  placebo  group);  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal disorders (8.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 7.3% in the placebo group).

The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site  reactions,  by  PT,  were  stomatitis  (54.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  56.4%  in  the  placebo group), oedema peripheral (17.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 21.1% in the placebo group), pruritus (16.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 20.0% in the placebo group), acute kidney injury (14.2% in the vedolizumab  IV  group,  15.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  erythema  (13.6%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV group, 7.9% in the placebo group).

## Leukopenia or Lymphopenia

A total of 26 treatment-emergent AESIs of leukopenia and lymphopenia were reported for 21 subjects (6.3%)  overall,  which  is  consistent  with  the  patient  population  (subjects  undergoing  allo-HSCT  and taking concomitant immunosuppressants). There were 14 subjects (8.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 7 subjects (4.2%) in the placebo group with an AESI of leukopenia or lymphopenia (Table 12.h).

Nine subjects (5.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 6 subjects (3.6%) in the placebo group had a treatment-emergent  AESI  of  leukopenia.  Five  subjects  (3.0%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  1 subject  (0.6%)  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  treatment-emergent  AESI  of  lymphopenia  (Table 15.3.1.26).  Although  the  incidence  of  leukopenia  and  lymphopenia  were  numerically  higher  in  the vedolizumab  IV  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  was observed  between  treatment  groups  given  the  small  number  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  event  of leukopenia or lymphopenia.

## CMV Reactivation

A total of 115 treatment-emergent AESIs of CMV reactivation were reported for 83 subjects (24.9%) overall  (45  subjects  [26.6%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  38  subjects  [23.0%]  in  the  placebo group) (Table 12.h). Forty subjects (23.7%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 30 subjects (18.2%) in the placebo group had CMV infection reactivation; 3 subjects (1.8%) in each treatment group had CMV infection, 1 subject (0.6%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 3 subjects (1.8%) in the placebo group had CMV viraemia, and 1 subject (0.6%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 3 subjects (1.8%) in the placebo group had CMV test positive. In the vedolizumab IV group, 7 subjects had 9 SAEs of CMV reactivation or active CMV infection (verbatim terms) that required or prolonged hospitalization. In the placebo group, 2 subjects each had 1 SAE of CMV reactivation. All 9 SAEs in the vedolizumab IV group resolved or were resolving at study completion, and no event led to study drug interruption. None of the events were related to study drug.

## Deaths

A total of 65 subjects (19.5% of the SAF) who participated in this study died. A total of 48 subjects had  a  TEAE  resulting  in  death  (21  subjects  [12.4%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  27  subjects [16.4%] in the placebo group) (Table 12.i). The treatment-emergent period (for TEAEs) was defined as the period from administration of the first dose of study drug through 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The leading causes of death included multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (3.0% in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.8% in the placebo group), acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent (0.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group), respiratory failure (1.8% in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.2% in the placebo group), pneumonia (1.2% each in both treatment groups), and sepsis (no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.8% in the placebo group). All other causes of death occurred in  2  subjects  (0.6%)  or  fewer  overall.  None  of  the  TEAEs  resulting  in  death  in  the  vedolizumab  IV group were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug (Listing 16.2.7.5).

An additional 17 subjects (5.1%) died after the 6-month treatment-emergent period (ie, 18+ weeks after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug):  8  subjects  (4.7%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  9  subjects (5.5%) in the placebo group.

A  total  of  62  subjects  (18.6%)  had  at  least  1  SAE  beyond  the  treatment-emergent  period  (ie,  18 weeks after the last dose of study drug): 36 subjects (21.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 26 subjects (15.8%) in the placebo group.

Reported SAEs beyond the treatment-emergent period were similar between treatment groups; most events occurred in only 1 subject per treatment group at the PT level.

## Serious COVID-19-Related TEAEs

Overall, 2 subjects (0.6%) had at least 1 serious COVID-19-related TEAE; 1 subject in each treatment group. No  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  COVID-19-related  TEAEs  was  observed  between treatment groups.

## TEAEs Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation

Overall, 95 subjects (28.4%) had at least 1 TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation; 44 subjects (26.0%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 51 subjects (30.9%) in the placebo group.

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation,  by  SOC,  were  immune system disorders (5.3% in the vedolizumab IV group, 12.1% in the placebo group); neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) (7.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 6.7% in the placebo  group);  investigations  (3.6%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  2.4%  in  the  placebo  group);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infections  and  infestations  (2.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  3.0%  in  the  placebo  group);  and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.8% in each treatment group).

The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, by PT,  were acute graft versus host disease in intestine (1.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 7.3% in the placebo group), acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent (2.4% in the vedolizumab IV group, 3.0% in the placebo group), alanine aminotransferase increased (3.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 0.6% in the placebo group), and acute graft versus host disease (1.8% in the vedolizumab IV group and 1.2% in the placebo group) (Table 12.l). All other events were reported for 4 subjects or fewer overall.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

## Serum Chemistry

Liver injury has been reported among AESI.

Kidney: a total of 50 subjects (15.0%) overall had at least 1 AESI of acute kidney injury: 24 subjects (14.2%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 26 subjects (15.8%) in the placebo group. Twenty-three subjects (13.6%) in the vedolizumab IV group had markedly abnormal creatinine values throughout the study compared with 22 subjects (13.3%) in the placebo group.

## Hematology

In general, markedly abnormal hematology results were similar between treatment groups throughout the study.

Failure to engraft by Day +28 was considered as primary graft failure and was reported as an SAE. Most study subjects (97.3% overall) had a successful engraftment. Three subjects in the vedolizumab IV  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group had  a  life-threatening  SAE  of  engraftment.  For  2  of  the  3 subjects, the event occurred in the treatment-emergent period; study drug was therefore withdrawn. None of the events were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug, and all subjects recovered.

Neutrophil  engraftment,  defined  as  absolute  neutrophil  count  &gt;500/mm3  for  3  consecutive  days  or &gt;2000/mm3 for 1 day, occurred in 97.3% of all subjects (165 subjects [97.6%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 160 subjects [97.0%] in the placebo group) (Table 15.3.2.9). Overall, 5 subjects (1.5%) did not recover (2 in the vedolizumab IV group and 3 in the placebo group), and 3 subjects (0.9%) were not applicable for analysis. The overall mean (SD) number of days to engraftment was 16.8 (4.6) days, which was similar between treatment groups (17.1 [4.58] days for the vedolizumab IV group and 16.5 [4.60] days for the placebo group).

Platelet engraftment, defined as a platelet count &gt;20,000 cells/mm3 without transfusion, occurred in 91.9% of all subjects (159 subjects [94.1%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 148 subjects [89.7%] in the placebo group). Four and 12 subjects did not recover in the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups, respectively, and 4 subjects from each treatment group were not applicable for analysis. The overall mean (SD) number of days to platelet recovery was 21.4 (20.02) days, which was similar between treatment  groups  (22.0  [17.51]  days  for  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  20.9  [22.41]  days  for  the placebo  group).  Additionally,  markedly  abnormal  platelets  (109/L)  were  similar  between  treatment groups throughout the study; a total of 158 subjects (93.5%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 155 subjects (93.9%) had low platelet values during the study, with the majority of subjects reporting low values at the Day +1 (76.0% overall) and Day +20 (61.% overall) visits.

## Vital Signs

Overall,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  for  vital  signs  were observed

AVA:antivedolizumab antibody;FAS:full analysisset.

Negative AVA was defined as a sample that was evaluated as negative in the AVA screening assay or samples that were determined to be positive in the AVA screening assay, but the result was not confirmed in the AVA confirmatory assay.

Positive AVA was defined as a sample that was evaluated as positive in both the AVA screening and confirmatory assays. Transiently positive was defined as patients with a confirmed positive AVA in at least 1 sample, but not consecutive samples.Persistentlypositivewas defined as patients with confirmed positive AVAin 2 or more consecutive samples. Positive neutralizing AVA was defined as a sample that was evaluated as positive in the neutralizing AVA assay. AVA positive at baseline was defined as a positive AVA sample before the first dose of studydrugadministration.

* Percentage was calculated using the number of subjects with at least one nonmissing AVA sample as the denominator.

The overall positive AVA rate in subjects who were treated with vedolizumab via IV infusion was 2.4% (4  of  168  subjects).  In  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  only  1  of  the  168  AVA  positive  subjects  was persistently positive (0.6%), and 2 of the 168 subjects developed neutralizing antibodies (1.2%).

PK  Related  to  AVA  Status The  development  of  persistent  AVA  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in vedolizumab serum trough concentrations.

Safety Related to AVA Status There was no relationship between AVA status and investigator defined infusion-related eactions.

## Efficacy Related to AVA Status

There was no relationship between AVA-positive status and efficacy of vedolizumab IV.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

Study Vedolizumab-3035 was included in Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) EMEA-000645-PIP03-18. The age entry criteria for this study included subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg at the time of randomization.

Enrollment was terminated early (343 subjects had been enrolled (of the  estimated  target  558  subjects)  with  a  total  of  71  primary  endpoint  events  accrued  (of  the anticipated  148  events),  and  the  study  completed  on  09  May  2022,  primarily  due  to  low  subject recruitment and enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic (since February 2020). The decision was influenced  by  multiple  factors,  none  of  which  were  related  to  safety  concerns  regarding  the  use  of vedolizumab in this patient population. All enrolled subjects were allowed to complete the study as per the protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The reduced number of enrolled patients has affected the strength and reproducibility of the results, especially  for  subgroup  analyses.  Moreover,  the  absence  (only  1  subject  in  the  Placebo  arm)  of paediatric population did not allow to make any conclusion for the paediatric setting.

The MAH decided to discontinue development of vedolizumab for use in this condition, in both adults and paediatrics.

Study design This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab when addd to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen for intestinal aGvHD in subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. The subject population consisted of subjects with hematologic malignancies or myeloproliferative disorders for whom allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor was planned, using either peripheral blood or bone marrow as the stem cell source.

The study consisted of a 30-day screening period, 155-day treatment period, a visit on Day +180 after allo-HSCT, and a posttreatment follow-up period for safety assessments and survival that were completed by 12 months after allo-HSCT. The study design is considered appropriate.

Randomization followed a 1:1 fashion to 2 treatment and wa s stratified by age (≥18 year s or adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 years), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match or mismatch (8/8 or 7/8), conditioning regimen (myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning), and treatment with or without ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin).

Subjects were enrolled in 25 countries worldwide (19 sites in North America, 45 in Europe/Israel, 24 in Asia/Australia, and 7 in South America),  with a good representation of EU sites.

Dose The vedolizumab dose and regimen in this phase 3 study was 300 mg on Day -1 before alloHSCT and Days +13, +41, +69, +97, +125, and +153 after allo-HSCT. The end-of-treatment visit was conducted on Day +180 after allo-HSCT. The selected dose was based on as based on results from Study Vedolizumab-1015: a phase 1b study that enrolled 24 subj ects aged ≥18 years, demonstrated the safety and tolerability of adding vedolizumab on Day -1 (before allo-HSCT) and then on Days +13 and +42 after allo-HSCT to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen (TAC + MTX) in subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. The duration of vedolizumab prophylaxis in this study design was intended to provide coverage during the posttransplant period, when subjects are at risk of developing classic and late aGvHD.

The same vedolizumab dose regimen administer ed to adults (aged ≥18 years) who underwent alloHSCT for prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD was considered appropriate for administration to adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg.

Supportive data on the use of the same dose of adults in adolescents  are from: i) the phase 3 studies in adults with IBD, body weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg, there was no difference in the safety profile in adults receiving vedolizumab IV every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks; ii) a population PK model in adults with UC or CD indicated that weight-based dosing is not required and that age is not a clinically meaningful covariate.

Background GvHD prophylaxis consisting of a combination of CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF, ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin) was permissible in prophylaxis therapy per institutional practice is acceptable.

## Study population

A  substantial  protocol  amendment  7  (Dated  18  September  2019) was made to open enrollment to adolescent subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  selection  criteria  of  the  study  resulted  appropriate  and  included  patients  with  a  high  risk  of development of intestinal aGVHD, related to poor outcomes, mortality. The inclusion criteria respected the common standard clinical practice in stem cell transplantation; similarly, the allowed medical care for prophylaxis of aGVHD is in line with current international guidelines. In the exclusion criteria, the most  important  causes  of  infections  that  could  mimic  intestinal  aGVHD  were  excluded  (CMV  and Clostridium Difficile infection), ensuring a reduction   of interpretation bias.

Notably, the underlying primary haematologic diseases included in this trial are more frequent in the adult setting than in the paediatric one (except for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or some types of lymphomas).

A sample size of 279 subjects per group (558 subjects total) was expected to generate 148 events for the  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival,  and  provide  90%  power  at  the  alpha  of  0.05  for  a  2-sided hypothesis based on log-rank test. For the primary and key secondary endpoints a hierarchy of the statistical testing was established and testing of the additional efficacy endpoints were not multiplicity adjusted.

Disposition of Subjects A total of 343 subjects were randomized to study drug. 187 (54.5% of total) completed 7 doses of IV study drug. The primary reasons for discontinuation from study drug were AEs (34.8% in the vedolizumab IV group, 25.9% in the placebo group), death (24.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 23.5% in the placebo group) unsatisfactory therapeutic response (lack of efficacy) (16.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 27.2% in the placebo group), and withdrawal by subjects (12.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 11.1% in the placebo group).

A total of 282 subjects (82.2%) completed the Day +180 visit (ie, through the end of the treatment period). The majority of subjects who discontinued study drug (42.9%) also discontinued the study. The reasons for discontinuation of the study and of drug treatment were similar for each treatment group.

Seventy-six  subjects  from  each  treatment  group  had  at  least  1  significant  protocol  deviation  (152 subjects overall [44.3%]); the most common significant protocol deviations, not related to the COVID19 pandemic, were related to procedures not performed per protocol, which occurred in 91 subjects overall (26.5%) similarly distributed between vedolizumab and placebo groups.

Reasons for significant protocol deviation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic included procedures not per protocol (10 subjects, 2.9%), a missed visit (5 subjects, 1.5%), informed consent (3 subjects, 0.9%),  and  study  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (1  subject,  0.3%).  The  overall  number  of  significant deviations appear high potentially impacting the quality of the study.

Overall,  demographic  data  were  well  balanced  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo group;  with  the  exception  of  gender,  (more  male  than  female  subjects,  62.8%  vs  37.2%),  and ethnicity (majority of subjects were white,70.6%, and non-Hispanic or Latino, 79.9%). Regarding.

## Baseline demographic and disease characteristics

Demographic data resulted well balanced between the vedolizumab and the placebo group, with the exception of gender and ethnicity. It is important to highlight that gender is not recognized, per se, as a risk factor for aGVHD, but the specific gender discrepancy between female donor-male recipient is associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  GVHD.  Overall,  this  specific  population  (female  donor/male recipient) has been well balanced between the two treatment arms, so that gender discrepancy does not affect the results.

Regarding  the  prevalence  of  the  Caucasian  ethnicity,  this  datum  could  be  a  consequence  of  the ethnicity bias associated with the search of matched stem cell donor: it is widely known that patients of Caucasian ethnicities have a higher probability of matching a suitable donor as a direct consequence of the higher number of Caucasian donors in the IBMDR registry.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median age, it was of 55.0 years overall (16-74), with only one patient aged &lt; 18 years enrolled in the placebo group: this limitation did not allow to perform any evaluation about the possible role of vedolizumab in the adolescent setting. All the other age group were well represented and balanced between the two treatments groups.

Overall, there were a good balance of the possible risk factors for the development of intestinal aGVHD (HLA match 7/8, Myeloablative Conditioning, absence of ATG prophylaxis) between vedolizumab and placebo groups, as well as for the main risk factors for disease relapse (adverse cytogenetic, disease status at ASCT).

The medication history, the concomitant medications, and the frequency of choice of stem cell source were in line with the common medical practice. Regarding the use of ATG in prophylaxis, its use was well balanced between the two groups, although the total number of subjects receiving ATG was higher in  respect  to  what  defined  at  baseline.  It  reasonable  to  assume  that  this  datum  could  not  have influenced the results between the two treatment arms.

## Efficacy data

The primary endpoint (intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT) showed a statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group in intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT (p &lt;0.001). The risk of an intestinal aGvHD event or death in subjects was 55% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI of HR, 0.27-0.73). In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 24 subjects (14.3%) with an observed event of intestinal aGvHD or death (any cause), whichever occurred first, by Day +180 after allo-HSCT; in the placebo group, there were 47 subjects (28.5%) with an observed event. Of those subjects, 12 (7.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 31 (28.8%) from the placebo group had an intestinal aGvHD event, and 12 subjects (7.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 16 subjects (9.7%) from the placebo group died.

A consistent figure is shown by day +365 (exploratory endpoint, nominal p = 0.0041; HR, 0.53 [95% CI of HR, 0.35-0.81]).

A a statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group is shown by the first key secondary endpoint (intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free, of the underlying malignancy, survival by day +180) (p = 0.0043). The risk of an event in subjects was 44% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.56; 95% CI of HR, 0.37-0.86).

At Day +365 the HR was 0.78 [95% CI of HR, 0.54-1.12]), nominal p = 0.1676.

Grade C-D aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 was 41% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI of HR, 0.39-0.91). Similar results obtained by Day +365.

A positive trend in favour of vedolizumab was shown for the Grade B-D aGvHD-free survival , all by Day +180 although per the fixed-sequence hierarchical testing this endpoint was not tested. The nominal p-value was 0.0105.  The risk of a Grade B-D aGvHD event or death, whichever occurred first, was 36% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI of HR, 0.46-0.91).

Analyzing other key secondary endpoints related to survival ( Nor Relapse Mortality by Day +180 and Overall Survival by day +180) no statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group were observed:  for the endpoint of NRM by Day +180 (p = 0.0668; HR, 0.48; 95% CI of HR, 0.22-1.04); for Day +180 overall survival nominal p-value 0.1458). Similar results have been obtained by day +365.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, a statistic significance was reached favouring vedolizumab over the placebo group in terms of intestinal aGVHD free survival and relapse free survival, which was maintained through Day +365. Consistent results were observed for the sensitivity and subgroup analyses, although the reduced size impairs  the  strength  of  results.      From  these  results  seem  that  the  favourable  outcome  with vedolizumab  over  placebo  was  not  affected  by  ATG  treatment;  moreover,  Vedolizumab  effect  in intestinal aGVHD prevention seemed clearer in a specific setting of patients with lower risk of aGVHD development  (patients  treated  with  RIC  regimen  instead  of  MAC  and  full  8/8  instead  of  7/8  HLA match).

The benefit observed for the key primary and for the secondary efficacy endpoints of  combined aGVHD/relapse free survival  with vedolizumab at Day +180 was maintained through Day +365 and was more apparent with regard to aGvHD (intestinal or any organ involvement) than death (NRM and OS); this finding was consistent regardless of the assessment used for GvHD staging and grading (eg, clinical stage criteria, IBMTR severity index, MAGIC criteria) and probably it could be explained by the specific intestinal target of the drug.

For subjects with GvHD requiring immunosuppression, the mean number of days that immunosuppression was required was numerically less in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group through Day +180 but the effect was lost through Day +365, suggesting a time limited effect in reducing the need of immunosuppression.

## SAFETY

Safety analysis was performed using the SAF with the actual treatment received. The mean duration of exposure  was  similar  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo  group  (241.7  and  230.0 days, respectively).

The mean number of doses received was also similar between treatment groups (5.4 doses [SD, 2.05] for the vedolizumab IV group and 5.1 doses [SD, 2.25] for the placebo group). Most subjects received 7  doses  of  study  drug  per  protocol  (52.7%  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  50.9%  of subjects in the placebo group).

All  subjects  (100.0%;  334  of  334  subjects)  reported  at  least  1  TEAE,  with  a  total  of  8323  TEAEs overall: 4287 events in the vedolizumab IV group and 4036 events in the placebo group.

92.3% (156 of 169) of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 89.1% (147 of 165) of subjects in the placebo group had a Grade 3 or higher TEAE.

TEAEs were serious (120 subjects [71.0%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 114 subjects [69.1%] in the placebo group), and 79 serious TEAEs led to study drug discontinuation (39 subjects [23.1%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 38 subjects [23.0%] in the placebo group).

Forty-eight subjects (14.4% of total) died due to a TEAE during the study; 21 subjects (12.4%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 27 subjects (16.4%) in the placebo group.

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs,  by  PT,  were  diarrhoea  (57.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 63.0% in the placebo group), stomatitis (54.4% in the vedolizumab IV group, 56.4% in the placebo group), nausea (50.9% each in both treatment groups), pyrexia (49.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 41.8% in the placebo group), anaemia (40.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 45.5% in the placebo group), acute GvHD in skin (40.8% in the vedolizumab IV group, 40.6% in the placebo group), and febrile neutropenia (42.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 37.6% in the placebo group).

No clinically meaningful difference in TEAEs or exposure-adjusted incidence rates were found between the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  Drug-Related  TEAEs Overall,  26.6%  (89  of  334)  of  subjects  had  a  TEAE  considered  by  the investigator to be related to study drug (48 of 169 subjects [28.4%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 41 of 165 subjects [24.8%] in the placebo group) (Table 12.c). Study drug-related TEAEs were similar between the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups. infections and infestations (6.5% in the vedolizumab IV group, 3.6% in the placebo group).

Deaths A total of 65 subjects (19.5% of the SAF) who participated in this study died.

A total of 48 subjects had a TEAE resulting in death (21 subjects [12.4%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 27 subjects [16.4%] in the placebo group).

## AESI

- Serious infections a numerically higher incidence in the vedolizumab IV group (125 subjects [74.0%]) compared with the placebo group (111 subjects [67.3%]) was reported. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent serious infections, by PT, were CMV infection reactivation (23.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 18.2% in the placebo group).

- PML A total of 3 subjects (1.8%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 2 subjects (1.2%) in the placebo group were listed as having 'PML' in the clinical trial database. An additional subject was confirmed as having PML. the SAE of PML, with a fatal outcome. The investigator and the IAC deemed that the event of PML was due to acute GvHD and 'heavy' immunosuppression treatment that was unrelated to vedolizumab IV.

-  Malignancy A total  of  71  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy  were  reported  for  55  subjects (16.5%) overall (29 subjects [17.2%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 26 subjects [15.8%] in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent AESIs of malignancy were similar between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group and consistent with a population of subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. The most  common  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy,  by  PT,  were  acute  myeloid  leukaemia recurrent (5.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 5.5% in the placebo group)

- Liver injury A total of 292 treatment-emergent AESIs of liver injury were reported for 137 subjects (41.0%) overall (68 subjects [40.2%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 69 subjects [41.8%] in the placebo  group).    The  most  common  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  liver  injury,  by  PT,  were  alanine aminotransferase increased (24.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 17.6% in the placebo group).

- Hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and IRRs of AEs. A total of 618 treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site reactions were reported for 270 subjects (80.8%) overall (134 subjects [79.3%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 136 subjects [82.4%] in the placebo group). The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site reactions, by PT, were stomatitis (54.4% in the vedolizumab IV group, 56.4% in the placebo group).

- Leukopenia or lymphopenia. A total of 26 treatment-emergent AESIs of leukopenia and lymphopenia were reported for 21 subjects (6.3%) overall, which is consistent with the patient population (subjects undergoing allo-HSCT and taking concomitant immunosuppressants). There were 14 subjects (8.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 7 subjects (4.2%) in the placebo group with an AESI of leukopenia or lymphopenia. , no clinically meaningful difference was observed between treatment groups given the small number of subjects with at least 1 event of leukopenia or lymphopenia.

- CMV colitis. CMV colitis: 0.6% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group each had an AESI of CMV colitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- CMV reactivation. A total of 115 treatment-emergent AESIs of CMV reactivation were reported for 83 subjects (24.9%) overall (45 subjects [26.6%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 38 subjects [23.0%] in  the  placebo  group)  (Table  12.h).  Although  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  CMV  reactivation  were reported  in  a  numerically  higher  number  of  subjects  in  vedolizumab  IV  group  compared  with  the placebo group, there was no clinically meaningful difference.

Laboratory findings similar trends between treatment groups in serum chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or physical examination findings were reported.

In conclusion , the observed safety profile was comparable between treatment groups no meaningful differences have been identified. A specific evaluation of the paediatric subset could not be made.

Overall, vedolizumab IV at a dose of 300 mg was well tolerated when added to standard GvHD prophylaxis (tacrolimus plus short-term methotrexate) in patients undergoing allo-HSCT. No new safety signals were identified. The safety profile reported for the indication should account for the known risk of undergoing allo-HSCT and taking concomitant immunosuppressants. with the known risk in the patient population undergoing allo-HSCT and taking concomitant immunosuppressants.

## 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Study n° Vedolizumab-3035 'A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Prophylaxis of Intestinal Acute Graft-VersusHost Disease in Subjects Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell was terminated early primarily due to low subject recruitment and not related to safety concerns regarding the use of vedolizumab in this patient population. Entyvio is not authorized in this indication.

There were no new safety signals or concerns emerging from this study and no changes to the currently approved Entyvio Summary of Product Characteristics are considered needed as a result of this study.
