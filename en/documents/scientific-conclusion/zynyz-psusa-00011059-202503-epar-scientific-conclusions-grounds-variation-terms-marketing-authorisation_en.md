## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for retifanlimab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of data on patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease, that suggest an increased risk of immune-mediated adverse reactions and flares of the underlying autoimmune disease following therapy from the literature, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing retifanlimab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for retifanlimab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing retifanlimab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
