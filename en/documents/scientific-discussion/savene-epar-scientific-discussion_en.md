## 1 Introduction

Extravasation of cytotoxic agents is the unintentional instillation or leakage of these agents into the perivascular or subcutaneous spaces during their administration (Cox et al, 1988).

Cytotoxic  drugs  are  often  infused  intravenously  through  peripheral  lines.  Although  central  venous access devices, such as implantable venous ports and central venous catheters (CVC), have become useful options, extravasation injury may also occur and poses special problems in the treatment due to the embedded site of the catheter.

Extravasation  of  cytotoxic  agents  occurs  rarely  but  is  a  feared  complication,  especially  from  drugs such as the anthracyclines, mitomycin C, vincristine, and vinorelbine.  Doxorubicin and daunorubicin account for most clinical extravasation reports. If a treatment is not established as soon as realization of  the  accident,  severe  complications  may  occur,  leading  to:  progressive  necrosis  of  skin  and subcutaneous tissue, nerve, vascular, tendon and articular damage, surgical resection often necessitating skin grafting, pain  and  functional  defects,  hospitalisation, interruption  of  cancer chemotherapy.

The clinical picture of the natural course of anthracycline extravasation consists of different phases. The initial phase, characterised by immediate pain, oedema/swelling, erythema, blistering is followed by  a  marked  brownish  induration  lasting  for  days  to  months.  In  some  patients,  after  1-4  weeks ulceration of the induration occurs, initially perhaps a small ulcer, but it will constantly enlarge for 1-3 months  without  tendency  for  spontaneous  healing  and  will  assume  invasive  character  extending  to deep  structures  and  underlying  tendons  and  joints  without  respecting  fascia.  Infection  is  often superimposed. The ulcer is largely avascular and without significant inflammatory response. The risk of ulceration is related to the concentration and amount of extravasated anthracycline. Long-term pain, contractures, dystrophy, loss of function of affected limb may follow.

Symptoms from a central venous catheter may be somewhat different and with delayed onset. Chest wall infiltration may present as shoulder pain and mediastinal leakage as substernal pain.

At the time of submission of the marketing authorisation application for Savene for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation no medicinal product had been authorized in this indication.

Non-surgical methods currently in use for the treatment of suspected anthracycline extravasation are immediate discontinuation of the infusion and an attempt to aspirate the site for residual drug before removing  the  catheter.  In  most  institutions,  local  cooling  (to  produce  vasoconstriction  preventing spread,  and  provide  pain  reduction),  and  administration  of  corticosteroids  and  dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO,  a  solvent  that  enhances  skin  permeability  and  thus  facilitates  absorption  and  recuperates anthracycline-generated free radicals.

Existing non-surgical methods have not proven up till now to be always effective.

Dexrazoxane is a bisdioxopiperazine that readily enters cells and is subsequently hydrolysed to form a chelating  agent  analogous  to  EDTA,  the  two-ring  opened  metabolite,  ICRF-198  /  ADR-925.  This chelating  property  is  proposed  to  be  its  mechanism  of  action  in  the  prevention  of  anthracyclineinduced  iron-dependent  free  radical  oxidative  stress  on  the  cardiac  muscle.  Dexrazoxane  is  also  a catalytic inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II. Dexrazoxane has been in clinical use since 1981. Initially, it was considered as an antineoplastic agent but the antineoplastic potential was insufficient for further development. It was then found to protect against the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines.  In Europe, since 1992, there is a marketed formulations of dexrazoxane licensed for the prevention of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Researches  conducted  since  1991  indicate  that  dexrazoxane  is  also  a  specific  catalytic  inhibitor  of DNA topoisomerase II in that it is able to lock the enzyme's N-terminal clamp while simultaneously inhibiting its ATPase activity. The new results indicate that dexrazoxane blocks the induction of DNA strand-breaks by anthracyclines and that may be involved in the amelioration of anthracycline toxicity. (Tanabe et al., 1991; Sehested et al., 1993; Langer et al., 2000).

## 2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Savene is presented as powder and diluent for solution for infusion.

Savene  powder  contains  20  mg/ml  corresponding  to  500  mg  of  dexrazoxane  (as  hydrochloride) supplied in an amber coloured, light-resistant, Type I glass vial closed with rubber stoppers and either an aluminium cap with a polypropylene disc on top.

Savene diluent is presented as an isotonic solution for infusion, packaged in a 500 ml flexible plastic container.

It is packaged in a box containing 10 vials and 3 bags of 500 ml diluent for solution for infusion. It is intended to first reconstitute the powder with Water for Injections and then add it to the diluent prior to administration.

## Active Substance

The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, soluble in 0.1N HCl and sparingly soluble in water. Dexrazoxane is the INN name of the active substance 2,6-Piperazinedione, 4,4'-(1methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-, (S)-. The molecule shows an asymmetric centre and the S (+) form is used in Savene. No polymorphic forms have been identified during the development.

## · Manufacture

The active substance is synthesised by multiple steps and purified to high optical purity material.

Batch  analysis  data  produced  with  the  proposed  synthetic  route  provided  show  that  the  active substance can be manufactured reproducibly.

## · Specification

The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  solubility,  identity  (IR,  HPLC), melting  point  (PhEur),  purity  (UV-VIS)  assay  (HPLC)/  assay  basic  function,  purity  and  related substances HPLC, chiral purity (chiral HPLC), specific rotation, content of R(-) enantiomer, residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition, and water content. Furthermore, particle size and bulk density are reported for information purpose only. Results from three batches confirm the suitability of the active substance specification approved.

## · Stability

Stability studies in both long-term and intermediate conditions (30°C/60%RH)  showed  that dexrazoxane  was  stable  at  long-term  conditions  and  remained  within  the  specification  during  the whole  accelerated  study.  The  results  of  the  long-term  and  accelerated  studies  comply  with  the proposed specifications and justify the proposed retest period.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

## Powder

Pharmaceutical development of Savene focused on obtaining a formulation containing &gt; 250 mg of Dexrazoxane per vial, which would easily dissolve in water and be stable after reconstitution under the circumstances specified in the SPC.

The desired efficacy of dexrazoxane in clinical practice is achieved when administered in a three-day schedule with 1000 mg/m 2 administered for the first 2 days and 500 mg/m 2 administered the third day. Hence, the standard dose (based upon a 70 kg person with a 1.8 m 2 body surface area) will be 1800 mg/patient per treatment day 1 and 2 and 900mg/patient day 3. Consequently, the formulation of 500 mg  dexrazoxane/vial  was  considered  optimal,  since  lower  dexrazoxane  content  would  require  too many vials per treatment while a higher content would complicate the manufacturing process. Dexrazoxane  is  the  S-enantiomer  of  the  racemic  mixture  of  Razoxane.  Due  to  its  low  solubility, Razoxane  cannot  be  formulated  for  parenteral  use  and  is  erratically  absorbed  when  administered orally. Dexrazoxane is more soluble in water than Razoxane, which allows parenteral administration. Dexrazoxane is poorly soluble in its base form, and in order to obtain a more soluble form, the drug substance is converted into its hydrochloride salt. Development studies have shown that it is soluble in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid with an acceptable dissolution rate. Due to the limited stability of dexrazoxane in  aqueous  solutions  a  liquid  or  solution  dosage  form  of  Savene  was  not  feasible,  therefore  a  solid dosage form was developed.

Various factors were optimised during pilot and commercial scale formulation and process.

## Diluent

Savene  diluent  is  an  isotonic  solution  consisting  of  Water  for  Injections,  Sodium  hydroxide  and pharmacopoeial  grade  salts.  These  are:  Sodium  chloride,  Potassium  chloride,  Magnesium  chloride hexahydrate, Sodium acetate trihydrate and Sodium gluconate.

The manufacturing of the bulk solution is a standard process for an aqueous solution. The solution is then filled into the plastic container and terminally sterilised using moist heat with a steam sterilisation cycle.

The infusion bag and port system are composed of materials complying with the Ph.Eur, or the French Pharmacopoeia.

The  compatibility  of  Savene  powder  with  several  potential  infusion  liquids  has  been  screened. However,  Savene  diluent  is  the  diluent  of  choice  for  stability  and  patient  tolerance  reasons  and therefore, it is mentioned in the SPC and included in the presentation of the Medicinal Product.

## · Adventitious Agents

Dexrazoxane powder does not contain any materials of animal origin.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Manufacturing process involves the following steps: preparation of the bulk solution, sterilisation by filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation and washing of the outside of the vials and visual inspection. The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the manufacturing process, and is satisfactory. All results from the in-process controls were within  the specifications.

The  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the agreed finished product specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product Specification

The  specification  for  Savene  powder  includes  tests  for  appearance/colour,  uniformity  of  mass  (Ph. Eur.),  identification  of  dexrazoxane  (IR,  HPLC),  identification  of  Chloride  (Ph.  Eur.),  dexrazoxane assay (HPLC), uniformity of content (Ph. Eur.), and purity (HPLC).

The current specifications for Savene powder were established over statistical evaluation of data from 89 batches.

The specification for Savene diluent includes tests for appearance, identification, assay, pH, sterility bacterial endotoxins, sub-visible particles, extractable volume and leachables. All tests are performed using suitable validated methods.

The  specification  for  Reconstituted  Product  includes  tests  for  clarity,  colour,  particulate,  rate  of dissolution, pH, endotoxins and sterility according to Ph. Eur.

The tests and limits of the specifications Savene powder, diluent and the Reconstituted Product are appropriate to control the quality of the finished product for the intended purpose.

## · Stability of the Product

The on-going stability studies on Savene powder (long-term and accelerated) are being conducted on batches  containing  stoppers  supplied  by  the  two  different  suppliers  according  to  the  current  ICH guidelines.

Other batches were stored (in the commercial packaging) for the full shelf life at 25°C. Some of these batches have been stored at 4°C and 60°C. The results of these studies are provided as supportive data.

Drug  Product  vials  were  analysed  for  appearance,  content  of  dexrazoxane,  impurities  A,  B,  C, moisture  and  sterility  (initial  and  at  the  end  of  the  study),  and  the  solution  after  reconstitution  was evaluated for colour, pH and completeness/clarity of dissolution.

The  test  methods  used  for  the  stability  testing  are  equivalent  to  the  ones  used  for  Quality  Control testing for the release of commercial product.

Concerning the diluent, stability data for 50, 100 and 1000 ml bags have been provided. The samples are stored in the proposed commercial packaging. In addition to the above conditions containers have been  subjected  to  resistance  to  thermal  stress  at  design  verification  and  final  validation  stages.  No significant adverse effects have been observed.

The  parameters  and  test  methods  used  for  routine  release  testing  are  applied  to  the  stability  trials. Additionally,  visual  inspection  (black  and  white  background),  colour  test  (Ph.  Eur.),  leachables determination and extractable volume determination have been performed.

Weight Loss (WL) / Volume Loss (VL) has been performed using other products stored in the same container.

Concerning  the  product  as  a  whole,  based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## · In-Use Stability study on reconstituted and diluted Savene.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The stability of the reconstituted product in water for injection has been investigated.

Savene is stable for 4 hours after reconstitution and subsequent dilution in Savene diluent when stored under the conditions specified in the SPC. (see SPC section 6.3).

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow-Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Dexrazoxane is the S(+)-enantiomer of the racemate razoxane and acts as a detoxifying agent, most likely by inhibition of topoisomerase II, for antineoplastic agents.

## Pharmacology

None of the primary and secondary pharmacodynamics studies were made according to GLP.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

A model, where subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin to the back of female mice produced skin necrosis for four to six weeks, has been used in all studies carried  out  by  the  applicant  to  evaluate  the  protective  effect  of  dexrazoxane  against  extravasation following anthracycline administration.

Following  daunorubicin,  doxorubicin  or  idarubicin-induced  extravasation  of  3  mg/kg  in  the  mouse model, a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of dexrazoxane (62.5-375 mg/kg) significantly reduced the occurrence of skin wounds. In mice given a 3 mg/kg doxorubicin injection s.c., doses with 62.5 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p. repeated every three hours three times resulted in two experiments in an absence of skin wounds in the mice compared with a 61 and 100% skin wound occurrence in the control mice. In mice with doxorubicin-induced skin wounds, a single dose of 250 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p. completely prevented skin wound occurrence after experimental extravasation with 2 or 3 mg/kg doxorubicin or decreased the AUC  of  wounds  significantly. In a timing study with 3 mg/kg  doxorubicin extravasations, the frequency of wounds increased when treating with 250 mg/kg dexrazoxane 6 hours after  experimental  doxorubicin  extravasation:  At  treatment  6  h  after  doxorubicin  s.c.,  wound frequency  was  44%  compared  to  19  and  11%  at  treatment  at  t=0  or  3  h  after  extravasation, respectively.

Using single high doses of 250 mg/kg dexrazoxane on day 0, 1 and 2 had good effect on skin wound size and duration, as the mean AUC of the wounds was 170.3 mm² days compared with 1546 mm² days in saline-treated mice given 3 mg/kg daunorubicin s.c. The dose of 62.5 mg/kg dexrazoxane and treatment schedule of q3h x 3 on the same day as the experimental extravasation was sufficient to treat a 6 mg/kg doxorubicin extravasation in the mice, as 8% of the mice developed a skin wound after this treatment compared with 12% of mice developing skin necrosis when the treatment was extended to three consecutive days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comparison  of  the  i.p.  and  i.v.  treatment  route  of  250  mg/kg  dexrazoxane  resulted  in  similar  skin wound frequencies: Of mice with experimental daunorubicin extravasation, 67% given dexrazoxane i.v. had skin wounds vs. 87% of mice given dexrazoxane i.p. (p=0.58). After dexrazoxane treatment, 22%  in  mice  treated  with  dexrazoxane  using  the  i.v.  route  had  wounds  and  no  mice  after  i.p. dexrazoxane (p=0.47). The skin wound size and duration was smaller in mice given i.p. dexrazoxane after s.c. daunorubicin compared with mice treated i.v. (p=0.07).

The  effect  of  dexrazoxane  on  idarubicin  or  epirubicin-induced  extravastion  was  not  statistically significant, showing no difference in the wound frequency or AUC (p=0.59).

Placing an ice pack for 0.5 hour to the daunorubicin-affected skin area did not change the effect of 62.5  mg/kg  dexrazoxane  given  q3h  three  times  after  the  extravasation,  as  none  of  the  treated  mice developed skin wounds following the treatment, but all mice treated with the ice pack alone for 0.5 h had  skin  wounds.  Intra-lesional  injection  of  125  mg/kg  hydrocortisone  alone  and  combining  this treatment with systemic dexrazoxane 62.5 mg/kg q3h three times did not change the protective effect of  dexrazoxane  against  skin  wounds.  Topical  treatment  with  pure  dimethylsulfoxide  (DMSO)  three times daily for four days following the accidental extravasation did not decrease skin wound size and duration compared to mice given saline topically in the same schedule as the DMSO (p=0.41). Topical DMSO treatment, added to the three 62.5 mg/kg doses of dexrazoxane, increased the frequency of skin wounds from no skin wounds in the dexrazoxane-treated mice to 7/9 mice having wounds.

The mechanism of action of dexrazoxane was investigated in comparison studies with various other adjuvant treatment. Neither EDTA, given as single i.p. doses of 62.5- 250 mg/kg, nor ADR-925 after injection  of  3  mg/kg  daunorubicin  s.c.  did  prevent  skin  necrosis  or  decrease  the  AUCs  of  the  skin wounds. The free radical binding cytoprotectant amifostine (100 -200 mg/kg) had no effect on AUC or occurrence of skin wounds. Single doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine or 62.5 -200 mg/kg alpha-tocopherol  were  also  given  to  groups  of  mice  after  a  daunorubicin  injection  s.c.  without  any effect  on  occurrence  or  size/duration  of  skin  wounds.  The  catalytic  inhibitors  of  topoisomerase  2, aclarubicin (10 or 20 mg/kg i.p. to mice after s.c. daunorubicin injection), and merbarone (50- 100 mg/kg i.p. after s.c. daunorubicin), had no effect on skin wound frequency or size/duration.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

A review of the literature showed that pre-treatment with dexrazoxane reduced anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and mini-pigs. Male  rabbits, given  12.5-25mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p. 30 min. before 3.2mg/kg i.v. daunorubicin once every three weeks five times, showed significant lower cardiomyopathy scores [1, 2]. In beagle dogs, given 1 mg/kg doxorubicin as a bolus injection  i.v.  once  weekly  15  times  and  12.5  mg/kg  dexrazoxane  i.p.  30  minutes  before  the doxorubicin  injection,  a  significant  reduces  cardiomyopathy  score  was  observed  compared  to  the control group without dexrazoxane [2]. In mice, given 50 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p. 30 minutes before 4 mg/kg  doxorubicin  i.p.  two  times  weekly  on  weeks  1,  2,  5,  6  and  7,  53%  of  mice  receiving doxorubicin  had  myocardial  changes  vs.  18%  in  the  dexrazoxane-doxorubicin  treated  group  [3]. Chronic  doxorubicin  administration  in  rats  and  evaluation  at  5  weeks  using  electron  microscopic evaluation [4], or at various time points up to 28th week after the last treatment was given using light microscopic evaluation [5], showed that different doses of dexrazoxane protected against microscopic signs of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.

Studies  dating  back  to  the  1960's  showed  that  razoxane  has  antineoplastic  activity  against  L1210 leukaemia, sarcoma 180 and Ca 755 tumours. In one study with leukaemic mice, given a split dosage regimen of dexrazoxane (16 mg/kg i.p., every 3 h on days 1, 5 and 9) an increased mean survival time was observed [6].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Safety pharmacology programme

The  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  according  to  GLP  regulations,  but  due  to  prior performance not in accordance to ICH S7A.

Administration  of  dexrazoxane  50,  100  and  200  mg/kg  did  not  have  an  effect  on  spontaneous locomotor  activity,  motor  coordination  using  rotarod  and  intestinal  motility  in  mice.  Dexrazoxane (200mg/kg) resulted in a significant increase in hexobarbital induced sleeping time in mice. There was no significant effect with the lower doses of dexrazoxane. Administration of dexrazoxane 100 mg/kg caused a significant  decrease  in  the  urine  output  in  rats  at  4  and  5  hours  post  dose.  No  significant effects  were  noted  with  the  higher  and  lower  doses.  There  was  no  significant  effect  on  urinary electrolyte  excretion  with  any  of  the  doses.  There  were  no  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  effects recorded following administration of 25, 50, 100 mg/kg dexrazoxane in anaesthetized dog.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No  specific  studies  for  this  indication  were  conducted. In  vitro dexrazoxane  and  docorubicin interacted synergistically to enhance sarcoma S180 cell kill [7].

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics  of  dexrazoxane  was  investigated in  vivo in  two  studies  with  rats  and  dogs  (by Inveresk International) and supplemented by a review of published literature.

## · Absorption-Bioavailability

In  studies,  in  which  male  mice  received  a  50  mg/kg  dose  of  [14C]dexrazoxane  i.v.  (Narang et  al ., 1988), kinetic  analysis  of  plasma  [14C]  levels  measured  over  time  demonstrated  the  adequacy  of  a three compartment model, with associated half-lives (t1/2) of 3.5 min, 30 min and 4.8 h, respectively. In a separate study (McPherson et al. ,  1984), mice were treated i.v. (100 mg/kg) with dexrazoxane, and plasma t1/2 α - and t1/2 β values of 3 min and 23 min, respectively, were reported.

After a single bolus intravenous administration of [14C]dexrazoxane (20 mg/kg) in the rat, the plasma total  radioactivity  level  fell  in  males  (female  data  in  parentheses)  from  a  maximum  of  45.7  (45.4) µg/ml at 2 min post-dose, to mean values of 5.1 (7.4) - and 0.1 (0.2) µg/ml at 1- and 8 h post-dose, respectively. The AUC (0 - 8 h), was approx. 20 µg /ml for males and 25µg /ml for females. When rats were pre-treated with doxorubicin (1 mg/kg; i.v.), prior to administration of [14C]dexrazoxane, all observed plasma data sets were similar to those above, except that the male peak radioactivity level was initially higher (90.1 µg/ml).

In rats, plasma razoxane levels followed a biphasic pattern of decay (mean initial and terminal phase half-lives  were  11.7-  and  40.3  min,  respectively)  following  i.v.  administration  (21.75  mg/kg),  and following oral administration, the peak plasma level (3.7 µg/ml; 30 min) declined mono-exponentially with a half-life of 78.4 min. The ratio of the AUC curves for oral versus i.v. administration was 0.53, showing a limited bioavailability of oral razoxane.

Razoxane  (100  mg/kg)  was  absorbed  quickly  from  the  peritoneal  cavity  in  rats,  reaching  a  peak plasma concentration (12.0 µg/ml; 15 - 30 min), which decayed mono-exponentially following firstorder kinetics (t1/2 approx. 1.6 h).

In dogs, receiving a single i.v. 20 mg/kg dose of 14 C-dexrazoxane, the plasma total radioactivity level fell from a maximum of 63.5 µ g/ml at 2 minutes post-dose, to a mean value of 15.7 -, 0.4 - and 0.1 µg/ml at  1-,  8-  and  24  hours  post-dose,  respectively.  The  mean  AUC0  -  24  h was  approx.  60 µ g/ml. Plasma radioactivity levels were at or near the level of detection by 48 hours post-dose. In the dog, a two-compartment open model adequately described the dexrazoxane plasma concentration versus time data  (single  iv  administration;  10  -100  mg/kg)  and  a  terminal  plasma  half-life  of  1.1  -  1.3  h  was reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Distribution

After  a  single  bolus  i.v.  administration  of  [14C]dexrazoxane  (20  mg/kg)  in  the  rat,  the  tissue distribution of total radioactivity was similar for both sexes (from 5 min to 96 h post-dose). Levels were highest in the kidney (80 and 100 µg/g, males and females, respectively), liver (50 and 52 µg base equiv./g, males and females, respectively) and bone marrow (54 and 37 µg base equiv./g, males and  females,  respectively)  at  5  min  post-dose.  In  all  other  organs  and  tissues  the  radioactivity  was similar to or less than in plasma at each time. Elimination from organs and tissues was at a similar rate as  from  plasma,  indicating  that  significant  accumulation  did  not  occur.  Binding  of  dexrazoxane  to plasma proteins was minimal in the rat (5%; 50 mg/kg) and the dog (Baldwin et al, 1988), and the blood  cell to plasma  partitioning ratio (approx. 0.517; dog)  indicated that the drug  resided predominantly in the plasma. The steady-state volume of distribution was limited.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-penetration of 14 C-dexrazoxane was investigated in rhesus monkeys [8]. In  the  animals,  receiving  i.v.25  mg/kg  dexrazoxane  spiked  with  1.2  mg  of 14 C-dexrazoxane  (37 µCi/mg), the CSF dexrazoxane levels were shown to be limited to 10% of the (bound and unbound) plasma concentration.

## · Metabolism

In  vitro dexrazoxane  was  hydrolysed  slowly  (pH  7.4,  37  °C),  in  a  non-enzymatic  (hydroxidecatalysed)  fashion  to  Intermediates  B  and  C  (t1/2  =  8  -  9  h),  and  to  ADR-925  (t1/2  =  23  h)[9]. Dihydropyrimidine  Amidohydrolase  (DHPase)  contained  within  the  soluble  fraction  of  liver  and kidney tissue homogenates, significantly enhances the hydrolysis of dexrazoxane , to form intermediates B and C, but is unable to effect full hydrolysis, to form ADR-925[10]. DHPase exhibits stereospecificity and acts four fold faster on dexrazoxane than on levrazoxane, and intermediate B is formed  faster  ( ≥ 1.5  -  fold)  than  intermediate  C.  Dihydroorotase  (DHOase)  catalyses  the  full  ringopening  of  intermediates  B  and  C  resulting  in  ADR-925,  but  shows  no  activity  towards  neutral dexrazoxane. DHOase is present in various tissues like the heart, liver and kidney.

In two in vivo studies after a single i.v. dose of 14 C-dexrazoxane (20 mg base/kg) in rats[11], or dogs, two major radioactive compounds were found in plasma, with retention times similar to ADR-925 and dexrazoxane. In dogs the same two major components were detected in urine. The same two major components plus a third radiolabelled compound (with a retention time of 12 minutes similar to that of the  one  ring  opened  product)  were  also  present  in  rat  urine  and/or  faeces  samples.  Dexrazoxane accounted for approximately 56% and 51% of the dose collected 0-24 hours post dose in male and female rats, respectively.

## · Excretion

Studies in which the animals received a 50 mg/kg i.v. dose of [14C]dexrazoxane, demonstrated that the cumulative urinary- and faecal recovery over 0 - 72 h, was 89 -90 % and 10 %, respectively for mice (Narang et al ., 1988) and rats (Baldwin et al 1988). In dogs the major route of excretion was via the  urine,  which  accounted  for  64  -  91  %  of  the  administered  dose.  Excretion  of  radioactivity  was rapid with 69-86% and 54 - 87 % of the dose recovered in urine in the first 8 hours in rats and dogs respectively, and approx. 79 % recovered in the first 24 hours. Excretion via the faeces accounted for 2 - 7 % of the dose.

Mean elimination half life over 8 hours, t1/2 (0 - 8 h), was 0.5 and 0.7 hours after a single i.v. dose of [14C]dexrazoxane  for  male  and  female  rats,  respectively.  Pre-treatment  with  doxorubicin  did  not change the plasma kinetics. Higher levels of radioactivity remaining in the heart of rats 96h post-dose than  in  other  tissues  showed  a  slow  rate  of  elimination  in  this  organ.  The  t 1/2 (0  -  8  h)  value  was approximately 0.8 hours for the dog.

In a study [12],  in male beagle dogs, the systemic clearance (CL) ranged from 10.3 ± 0.8- to 11.5 ± 2.5 ml/min/kg, and over the dose range evaluated (10 - 100 mg/kg), CL was dose independent. The mean renal Clearance (CLR) contributed approx. 37 % to the systemic clearance. Dexrazoxane was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subject to low organ extraction, and large quantities of unchanged drug were found in liver and kidney extracts, and in plasma and urine.

## · Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions

Published literature on pharmacokinetic drug interaction between dexrazoxane and doxorubicin have produced conflicting results depending on the individual studies.

In  one  study  [4],  dexrazoxane  significantly  enhanced  doxorubicin  uptake  in  myocardial  tissue  in female rats. In another study [13], dexrazoxane inhibited the binding of doxorubicin to red blood cells in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced the binding of doxorubicin to haemoglobin in vitro, and exerted a significant reduction in various doxorubicin-associated pharmacokinetic variables in rats in vivo [13], (e.g., lowered the volume of distribution and plasma concentration of doxorubicin, reduced AUC and mean residence time). A third study [14] showed that dexrazoxane had no major effect on doxorubicin (or doxorubicinol) pharmacokinetics in plasma or heart tissue of either young or old rats, and  a  fourth  study  [15]  showed  that dexrazoxane  had  no  significant  effect  on  the  disposition  of doxorubicin in dogs. Other pharmacokinetic studies

No other pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity data was provided by two GLP-compliant studies in mice (RCC Notox 018753) and rats (RCC Notox 018742) and by data published in the scientific literature.

After administration of 600 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.v. within 24 hours to Albino CD-1 strain mice, no clinical  signs  of  toxicity  were  obsereved,  but  enlarged  spleen  in  2/10  animals.  A  single  i.v.  dose schedule of 1000 mg/kg dexrazoxane given to a group of 20 CDF1 mice did not produce toxicity or lethality.  In  a  study  with  mice, receiving single doses of 50- 500 mg/kg i.p. dexrazoxane combined with topoisomerase 2 poisons (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide), the highest dose of dexrazoxane resulted in a leucocyte nadir, as the mean WBC count dropped to to around 2 x 10 9 cells/L compared with a pre-treatment value of ca. 4 x 10 9 cells/l [16]. Examination of the jejunum after single dose of dexrazoxane up to 675 mg/kg i.p. showed no changes in jejeunal crypts of mice [17]. In a study with Albino Wistar rats (5 male and 5 female), receiving a total of 600 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.v. within 24 hours, no mortality occurred, but all males showed severe oedema of the cervical region and/or the legs. Macroscopic examination at necropsy of all animals revealed in 6/10 animals an enlarged spleen. In Wistar rats, 3 hours after dosing with 100mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p., increased liver protein synthetic capacity  and  protein  synthesis  was  found.  At  24  hours  after  dosing  the  rats  had  increases  in  serum AST and ALP activity [18].

Beagle dogs, receiving single i.v. doses of 250-2000 mg/kg dexrazoxane, showed toxic signs during and after treatment including emesis, diarrhoea, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss and hypothermia. The lethal  dose  was  2000mg/kg  dexrazoxane  i.v.  and  the  NOAEL  dose  was  250mg/kg.  After  45  days recovery, there were no lesions in dogs given a 1000 mg/kg dose of dexrazoxane, showing that the acute lesions were reversible. Toxic effects were noted on rapidly dividing cells: bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa. Liver, kidney and intestinal toxicity were more severe at the highest dose and reduced or absent in lower doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The long-term toxicity of dexrazoxane was provided in rats and rabbits by i.v. route in compliance with GLP requirements and by literature in mice, dogs and swine.

Five daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 3000 mg/m 2 /day did not produce toxicity in mice . Mice treated once weekly with 100 mg/kg i.p. for 8 weeks had slightly decreased weight gain.

In  toxicity  study  rats  were  treated  once  daily  i.v.  with  5-200mg/kg/day  dexrazoxane  for  28  days followed by a 42-day recovery period or once in 14 days at 200 mg/kg dexrazoxane over 70 days . Decreases in body weight gain, spleen and testes weights, atrophy of lymph nodes, spleen, thymus and testes,  decreased  WBC and red blood cell (RBC) counts, and variable changes were observed. The NOAELs could not be established. In the 70 days arm of the study only male rats showed toxicity signs, particular a decrease in red blood cell parameters and testicular atrophy. In a 91 day toxicity study  using  up  to  25  mg/kg/day  dexrazoxane  i.v.,  atrophie  of  lympoid  tissue  and  tested,  anaemia  , depletion of WBC, high liver and low testicular and spleen weights were observed. The effects were dose related. In a satellite study to the 91 day study, rats received vehicle, dexrazoxane 5.0 mg/kg/day only,  doxorubicin  0.25 mg/kg/day  only,  and  5.0  mg/kg/day  dexrazoxane  and  0.25  mg/kg/day doxorubicin for 91 days. Degeneration of the myocardium and sciatic nerve and glomerulonephropathy  changes,  which  were  seen  in  doxorubicin  treated  animals  only,  were  less severe in the dexrazoxane and doxorubicin concomitant treatment group.

Administration of dexrazoxane 25 to 50 mg/kg i.p. once weekly for 12 weeks to male rats caused no changes  in  haematology  and  clinical  chemistry  examinations  of  rat  blood  samples,  but  a  slight decrease in the rat's weight gain at 50 mg dexrazoxane/kg/week [19, 20]. Four doses of dexrazoxane 100 mg/kg over a 14-day period resulted in oxidative damage to the kidney in rats and an increase in lipid peroxidation markers [21]. Using immunohistochemical staining on tissue sections, comparable numbers of apoptotic cells in the kidney tubular cells or small intestinal epithelial cells were found in dexrazoxane-treated and saline-treated systemic hypertensive rats treated with the same once-weekly schedule for 12 weeks [22].

In  systemic  hypertensive  (SHR)  rats  and  WKY  rats  treated  with  25  mg/kg  dexrazoxane  i.p.  once weekly  for  12  weeks,  weight  gain  and  blood  pressure  was  affected  one  week  after  the  last  dose. Clinical chemical analysis and histopathology findings were unaffected by treatment. Male SHR rats given 25 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p. once weekly for 12 weeks had the same number of various examined immune  cells  in  the heart (dendritic cells,  macrophages,  t-helper  and  cytotoxic/suppressor  tlymphocytes) as controls.

Dexrazoxane was not tolerated by rabbits given 50 and 200 mg/kg/day i.v. as all animals were either found dead or were killed for humane reasons between days 9 and 22. As in rats, lymph nodes, thymus and testes were atrophic. The bone marrow was atrophic in both dexrazoxane-treated groups, and the high-dose group had bleeding in the lymph nodes and coecum lumen. Rabbits tolerated 12.5 and 25 mg/kg i.p. once weekly with three weeks interval five or six times without changes in haematology and clinical biochemistry values [1].

Beagle dogs were administered dexrazoxane using a slow constant-rate intravenous infusion of 3.8 4.9 ml/minute once daily for five consecutive days. Dexrazoxane doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg/day for five  days  were  lethal  to  the  dog.  A  nine  day  rest  period  between  three  series  of  five  daily  doses reduced  toxicity  and  did  not  produce  severe  changes  in  serum  liver  function  test.  Dogs  given dexrazoxane i.v. for 5 days tolerated up to 125 mg/kg/day with necroses and bleeding in lymph nodes and signs of liver and kidney affection. NOAEL was 15.6 mg/kg/day for 5 days treatment.

In dogs treatment every three weeks with doses of 25 mg/kg i.p. or 35 mg/kg i.v. dexrazoxane seven times were well tolerated [23, 24]. In addition, i.v. dose of 25 mg/kg dexrazoxane given up to 30 times in three week gaps, was well tolerated [25].

Swine tolerated a single dose of 12.5 mg/kg dexrazoxane i.p. every three weeks six times as for dogs [26].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Genotoxicity

The mutagenic potential of dexrazoxane has been investigated in vivo in a micronucleus test in bone marrow  cells  of  the  mouse.  Only  this  study  was  conducted  under  GLP  conditions.  Dexrazoxane (1000mg/kg) induced a statistically significant increase in the incidence of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) in both male and female mice.

Treatment with suspensions of dexrazoxane at single doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg i.p. increased the number of micronuclei in PCE in the bone marrow from male and female CCBF1 mice compared with solvent  treated  controls  [27].  In  bone  marrow  smears  from  male  Chinese  hamsters  stained  for metaphase  chromosomes,  an  increase  in  the  number  of  chromosome  abnormalities  compared  with vehicle-treated control animals in the time interval of 12-48 hours after they were given an oral dose of 500 mg/kg razoxane was observed [27].

In  vitro four  salmonella  strains  were  testes  by  Ames  test  with  doses  up  to  5000  µg/plate  razoxane. Raxozane was not mutagenic in this assay (McCann et  al. 1975). An in vitro study performed with cytokinesis-blocked human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6 showed that 24-hour incubation of cells with dexrazoxane  resulted  in  significantly  increased  numbers  of  micronuclei  at  5  µM  dexrazoxane concentrations and above [28].

## · Carcinogenicity

No specific studies have been conducted with dexrazoxane in order to investigate the carcionogenic potential  of  the  drug.  In  one  study,  withouth  GLP  compliant,  35  rats  and  mice  were  injected  three times  per  week  with  up  to  96  mg/kg  razoxane  (racemic  product).  The  animals  were  dosed  for  52 weeks,  and  then  observed  for  a  further  29-34  weeks.  In  female  mice,  the  frequency  of  all haematopoietic neoplasms, was higher in the low-dose group (P = 0.038) and in the high-dose group (P = 0.002) than in the pooled controls and the incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas was higher in the low- and high-dose groups (P&lt;0.001) than in the pooled controls (National Cancer Institute, 1978). Raxozane is determined to be carcinogenic in female rats and mice.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

The applicant conducted no formal studies or published literature.

The  results  of  one  study  investigating  the  prenatal  effects  of  razoxane  in  mice,  rats  and  rabbits administered orally have been provided (Duke, 1974). Growth retardation was seen in rat and mice foetuses when treatment was given on various days during early/mid gestation. Relatively low doses induced the resorptions, growth retardation and malformations. The frequency of malformations was below 10% in mice or rats.

## · Local tolerance

The  applicant  has  carried  out  a  GLP-compliant  local  tolerance  study  in  rabbits  according  to  the CPMP/SWP/2145/00  Note  for  Guidance  on  Nonclinical  Local  Tolerance  Testing  of  Medicinal Products. One i.v. injection per day for three days of dexrazoxane 3 mg/ml was injected into the lateral ear  vein  of  rabbits  (TTT  001).  The  animals  were  observed  for  7  days  following  the  last  injection. There was no treatment related local tissue reaction.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Combination with anthracyclines

An overview of published studies  investigating  the  toxicity  of  co-administration  of  dexrazoxane  or razoxane and daunorubicin, doxorubicin or anti-cancer drugs has been provided.

Haematological toxicity of single doses of dexrazoxane and doxorubicin was studied in vivo in mice and in vitro in the colony forming unit granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) assay using human and murine granulocyte/macrophage precursor cells. Dexrazoxane (125 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on CFUGM survival after doxorubicin 10- 20 mg/kg i.v. exposure (Hofland et al 2005).

Dogs treated i.p. with 12.5 mg/kg dexrazoxane before 1 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v. 15 times at weekly intervals  had  decreased  WBC  and  RBC  counts  and  haemoglobin  concentration  compared  with pre-treatment  values.  The  dogs  treated  with  dexrazoxane  and  doxorubicin  did  not  have  a  larger decrease in the RBC and WBC counts compared with dogs treated with doxorubicin alone (Herman and Ferrans, 1983).

Pre-treatment  with  razoxane  (200  mg/kg)  prevented  the  acute  lethality  of  a  single  high  dose  of  10 mg/kg daunorubicin in mice [29]. Dexrazoxane given i.p. in doses from 12,5 to 200 mg/kg protected against lethality in hamsters given 25 mg/kg daunorubicin i.v. [30].

Dexrazoxane protected against the epirubicin-induced cardiac and kidney toxicity in rats treated with weekly injections for 12 weeks [20]. Dexrazoxane reduced mitoxantrone-induced cardiotoxicity in rats [31].

## Studies on impurities

No studies conducted.

## Immunotoxicity

No studies conducted.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  drug  product  has  been  designated  as  an  Orphan  Drug  in  the  European  Union,  and  due  to  the Guideline (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) no environmental risk assessment has been performed.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

Dexrazoxane,  a  detoxifying  agent,  reduced  significantly  the  occurrence  or  size  of  skin  wounds following  daunorubicin,  doxorubicin,  epirubicin  or  idarubicin  induced  extravasation  in  mice.  Skin wound  area  and  size  time-dependently  increased  with  delayed  dexrazoxane  treatment.  A  triple treatment of 62.5 or 125 mg/kg dexrazoxane administered immediately, three hours and six hours after anthracycline administration was more effective than a single dose of 250 mg/kg. This daily treatment for  3  consecutive  days  is  the  rational  for  the  clinical  regimen  (see  SPC,  section  4.2).  If  there  is suspicion  of  extravasation  by  vesicant  compounds  other  than  anthracyclines  through  the  same  i.v. access,  dexrazoxane  would  not  be  effective  against  the  reaction  from  these  compounds  (see  SPC, section 4.4).

Dexrazoxane  reduces  anthracycline  cardiotoxicity  and  is  approved  in  several  countries  for  this indication. Dexrazoxane has anti-tumour properties.

In the safety pharmacology studies, due to the lack of toxicokinetic data, the appropriate dose level was difficult to assess. According to the ICH S7A guideline, in the absence of an adverse effect on the safety pharmacology parameters evaluated in the study, the highest tested dose should be a dose that produces moderate adverse effects. The used dose levels can be assessed as low from the fact that the single dose NOAEL in dogs is higher than the highest dose level used in the dog safety pharmacology study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmakokinetics

The metabolism of dexrazoxane as described in the dossier appears very simple, however it is unclear whether also other detoxification systems are active, and whether this implies a risk of interactions when co-medication with anthracyclines or other drugs relevant for the patient group takes place. Data on  drug  interaction  between  dexrazoxane  and  anthracycline  has  shown  conflicting  results.  In  the majority of non clinical and clinical studies, no effect was found. The studies in rats or humans, which found an effect of dexrazoxane on anthracycline pharmacokinetic were both characterized by the use of quite high anthracycline doses and showed an increase of anthracycline clearance.

Patients  treated  with  anticoagulants  should  be  monitored  more  frequently  (see  SPC,  section  4.5). Dexrazoxane  is  generally  not  recommended  in  combination  with  live  attenuated  vaccines  or  with Phenytoin  (see  SPC,  section  4.5).  Detailed  interactions  are  explained  in  section  4.5  of  the  SPC. Excessive  immunosuppression  with  risk  of  lymphoproliferative  diseases  have  to  be  taken  into consideration when concomitant use of Ciclosporine or Tacrolimus is administered (see SPC, section 4.5).  Due  to  an  increase  of  occurrence  of  wounds,  DMSO  should  not  be  used  in  patients  that  are administered dexrazoxane to treat anthracycline-induced extravasation (see SPC, section 4.4).

## Toxicology

The main toxic effects for dexrazoxane, as expected for a topoisomerase 2 inhibitor which inhibits cell proliferation, were seen in proliferating tissues as haematologic and lympoid tissues and gastrointestinal mucosa. The kidneys and liver were also affected, being the main excretory organs for dexrazoxane and therefore containing high concentrations of the compound. No toxicokinetic studies have been performed by the applicant and therefore the animal: human exposure multiples cannot be calculated with confidence. Due to the provided conversion factors (Freireich et al) the animal doses expressed in mg/kg can be compared to human doses expressed in surface area (mg/m 2 ). The safety of dexrazoxane in humans is well described in the literature and the results from the clinical trials TT01 and  TT02  showed  acceptable  safety  results,  with  no  reports  of  adverse  reactions  relating  to cardiovascular and respiratory functions or the CNS. It is agreed that the clinical safety data suffice to waive the request for conventional toxicokinetic studies.

Dexrazoxane  will  be  administered  to  patients  undergoing  cytotoxic  therapy  with  anthracycline containing  chemotherapy  and  its  cytotoxic  potential  will  therefore  be  added  to  that  of  the  other chemotherapy administered (see SPC, section 4.4).

As dexrazoxane possess mutagenic activity, male patients should use contraceptives during treatment and for 3 months after treatment with dexrazoxane has been concluded (see SPC, section 4.6 and 4.4). Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment (see SPC, section 4.4). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants exposed to dexrazoxane, mothers should discontinue nursing during dexrazoxane therapy (see SPC, section 4.6).

Signs  and  symptoms  of  overdosage  are  likely  to  consist  of  leucopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin reactions and alopecia. Treatment should be symptomatic (see SPC, section 4.9).

## 4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane, given alone [32-35] and in combination with one or more other cytostatics  agents  [36-40]  have  been  described  in  the  literature  (Table  1).  No  additional  clinical pharmacokinetic studies were submitted by the applicant.

## · Absorption

No information on absorption following oral treatment was submitted.

## · Distribution and Elimination

Five adult patients without hepatic or renal dysfunction received, in separate cycles, 1000 mg/m 2 i.v. infusion dexrazoxane over 30 min, 8 hours or 48 hours [32]. The kinetics of dexrazoxane in the serum followed a two-compartment open model. The mean peak serum levels for the three schedules were 75.3, 22.8 and 2.9 mg/ml, respectively. The mean T½ α values were 9.9, 10.6 and 19.5 minutes (mean 13.3 min) respectively, and the t½ β values 121.4, 143.6 and 173.0 minutes, respectively (mean 146 min). Total protein binding was less than 2%. The mean central compartment volume of distribution was  0.193  l/kg.  Drug  clearances  for  the  15  minutes  and  the  48-hour  schedules  were  similar.  Total urinary drug recovery was similar for the 3 schedules, on average 48% (range 25-62%). Less than 1% of dexrazoxane was excreted in the bile over 24 hours. In one patient with a creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min renal clearance was 23 % of total drug clearance versus a mean of 56% for all five patients and the  serum  level  of  dexrazoxane  was  increased.  In  two  additional  patients  with  malignant  pleural effusions an equilibration with serum and identical decrease pattern was seen in one, while in the other the pleural concentration reached less than 50% of serum and disappeared more slowly.

In a phase I study, 46 paediatric patients received 2-hour infusions dexrazoxane daily for 3 days [33]. In 4 patients (9-16 years) receiving 3200-3800 mg/m 2 pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated a mean α -half-life (t½ α =distribution half life) of 16 minutes and a β -half-life (t½ β = elimination half life) of 113 minutes. The volume of distribution was larger than in adults, but the difference was less apparent when normalized to body surface area rather than body weight. The 24-hour urinary excretion was 60% ± 24 %.

In  a  study  conducted in 8 patients receiving 1 hour (2-5 h at the higher doses) infusions weekly of dexrazoxane 3.8 g/m 2 (5 patients), 5.9 and 7.4 g/m 2 (2 patients each), the biphasic elimination curve had a t½ α of 1.0 ±0.3 h and a t½ β of 3.2 ± 0.9 h. Mean clearance was 288.7 ± 85 ml/h/kg and the apparent Vd was 1.3 ± 0.4 l/kg. The mean percentage of total dose recovered in the urine was 33.7 % in 24 h. In one patient, the ratio of pleural fluid to plasma concentration at the end of infusion was 0.1[34].

Inter-individual variability was evaluated from pharmacokinetic data collected in 19 patients treated with i.v. infusion of dexrazoxane over 30 min to 2 hours [32-34]. The average coefficient of variation was 38.3% and 24.0 % for the t½ α and the t½ β , respectively. The coefficient of variation was 30.4%, and  35.6%  for  total  clearance  and  the  volume  of  distribution,  respectively.  The  intra-individual variability was investigated in 5 patients receiving i.v. infusion of 1000 mg/m 2 of dexrazoxane within various schedules 30 min, 8 hour and 48 hour. The average coefficient of variation was 44.7%, 17.7%, 13.6%, 14.9% and 38.0% for t½ α , t½ β , total clearance, AUC and Volume of distribution, respectively [32].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a study conducted in 21 patients treated by 96-hour continuous infusion in a dose-escalation phase I study  with  doses  from  125  mg/m 2 /d  to  250  mg/m 2 /d  [35],  the  mean  steady  state  clearance  was  7.2 l/h/m 2 and  the  t½ β was 2.0 h ± 0.8 h. The mean percentage of administered drug recovered in the urine at steady state was 40.5%.

## · Metabolism

Dexrazoxane underwent in vivo a rapid hydrolysis by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine aminohydrolase (DHPase) to  its  two  one-ring  opened  metabolites  [40].  DHPase  is  found  in  liver  cells  and  in  renal cells.  Both  intermediate  one-ring  opened  metabolites  are  subsequently  converted  by  the  enzyme dihydroorotase (DHO), to the two-ring opened metabolite ADR-925. DHO is found in a number of cells including heart, liver, kidney and blood cells. ADR-925 has a structure similar to EDTA and is a strong  metal  chelator  for  iron  (free  and  bound),  copper  and  other  metals.  The  two  one-ring  opened hydrolysis  products  appeared  quickly  in  plasma  at  low  levels  upon  completion  of  dexrazoxane infusion and then rapidly decreased with half-lives of 0.6 and 2.5 hours. The two-ring opened ADR925 was detectable at the end of the dexrazoxane infusion, then rapidly increased three-fold at 15 min after the infusion, remained constant for 4 hours and then decreased to about half at 24 hours.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The concentration at steady state of dexrazoxane (following continuous infusion) was achieved within the first 12 hours of infusion [35]. Upon  completion  of the infusion,  plasma  dexrazoxane concentrations  declined  rapidly  in  a  mono-exponential  form  and  were  undetectable  within  12-24 hours. AUCs were dose-proportional [34, 36]. The systemic clearance and volume of distribution were found to be independent of dose.

## · Special populations

No studies in special populations or investigating intrinsic factors were submitted.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Pharmacokinetic  data  available  from  the  literature,  in  which  dexrazoxane  was  administered  with anthracyclines,  were  submitted.  The  dose  of  dexrazoxane  (escalating  doses  from  60  to  900  mg/m² combined  with  60  mg/m 2 of  doxorubicin)  had  no  influence  on  doxorubicin  pharmacokinetics  [36]. Dexrazoxane did not influence epirubicin pharmacokinetics and escalating doses of epirubicin did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane [38]. A 30% increase in terminal half-life and a decrease in total body clearance were observed when the epirubicin dose was raised from 60 to 100 mg/m 2 .  High  doses  of  dexrazoxane  (900  and  1200  mg/m 2 )  increased  the  systemic  clearance  of epirubicin,  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  the  AUC  [39].  Elimination  half-life,  Cmax  and  volume  of distribution  of  epirubicin  were  not  affected.  Interaction  studies  of  dexrazoxane,  etoposide  and methylprednisolone have also been described [40].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Two  main  modes  of  action  described  for  dexrazoxane  consist  of  metal  ion  chelation  [41]  and topoisomerase II inhibition [Tanabe et al 42]. The precise pharmacodynamic mechanism is not known. Human primary pharmacodynamic studies have not been submitted.

## · Primary and secondary pharmacology

No  studies  in  the  claimed  indication  have  been  submitted.  The  secondary  pharmacology  of dexrazoxane, used as anticancer agent and not for the treatment of  anthracycline extravasation, was investigated through six phase 1 trials in adults [33-35, 43-45] and in on study in children [46] (table 2).

The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was generally determined by the occurrence of reversible bone marrow  toxicity  (especially  granulocytopenia)  and  reversible  hepatotoxicity  (SGOT)  and  bilirubin elevation while other toxicities were mild and not dose-limiting. The MTD was influenced by age, the extensiveness of prior treatment, the schedule and was lower with continuous infusion as compared to short bolus. In phase 1 studies, the metal ion excretion was examined [33, 35, 43].  Iron and calcium serum was increased and a zinc serum was decreased. Iron and zinc urinary excretion was increased and no change in magnesium, calcium, copper irons was observed.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The description of pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane was based on bibliographic data retrieved from the literature. Overall, these studies provide sufficient level of detail and further studies are considered unnecessary.  However,  there  were  insufficient  data  about  intrinsic  pharmacokinetic  factors  such  as age,  gender,  race  and  weight.  Inter-and  intra-individual  pharmacokinetic  variabilities  have  not  been studied systematically. Based on a limited number of patients, inter-individual variability calculated as the  coefficient  of  variation  (CV  %),  was  estimated  to  be  approximately  30%  for  the  main pharmacokinetic parameters (see SPC, section 5.2). No information was provided about pharmacokinetic interaction with other medicinal products specific to dexrazoxane.

Human  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  not  been  conducted.  The  chelating  property  is probably  responsible  for  an  increased  urinary  excretion  of  iron  and  zinc  and  a  decreased  serum concentration of calcium as described in a few studies (see SPC, section 5.1).

## Clinical efficacy

The  clinical  programme  for  Dexrazoxane  included  two  open  uncontrolled  studies.  These  studies, conducted  according  to  GCP,  were  designed  on  the  basis  of  the  non-clinical  work  and  on  the observation of a number of pilot cases.

## · Dose response study

No dose-response studies were conducted. In both pivotal studies, the dosage regimen was the same and based on the published and unpublished non-clinical and clinical work in other indications.

- Main study(ies)

## Study TT01

The study was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicentre clinical trial.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Main inclusion criteria were patients with cancer treated with anthracycline, history of anthracycline extravasation &lt;6 hours confirmed by fluorescence microscopy by the local pathologist, presence of at least  one of the symptoms (pain, swelling, redness), performance status &lt; 2 and age &gt;18 years The main exclusion criteria were known allergy towards dexrazoxane, reasonable suspicion of extravasation by other compounds than anthracycline, 3 × upper normal level of ASAT, ALAT, LDH, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Pregnant women or women of childbearing age and potential not using an efficient contraceptive were not eligible.

## Treatments

Treatment with dexrazoxane 1000 mg/m 2 as  i.v.  infusion  over  1-2  hours was started within 6 hours from  the  incident  and  was  repeated  after  24  hours  (1000  mg/m 2 )  and  48  hours  (500  mg/m 2 )  in  all patients.  The  maximal  dose  of  dexrazoxane  that  could  be  given  was  2000  mg.  No  other  dose modification was allowed.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  avoid  surgical  intervention  following  the  accidental  extravasation  of anthracycline  drug,  thus  preventing  the  patient  from  sequelae.  Secondary  objectives  were:  to  avoid any deleterious postponement of the cancer treatment itself; to describe and evaluate subjective and objective  symptoms  and  the  clinical  progression  in  the  damaged  area  following  treatment  with dexrazoxane; and to evaluate the tolerance to and/or toxicity of dexrazoxane used for this indication according to the indicated schedule.

## Outcomes/endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients undergoing surgical intervention. Both the plastic surgeon/surgeon  and  the  oncologist/haematologist  evaluated  any  sign  of  progression  in  the  area  of extravasation. Development of blistering and manifest necrosis defined progression requiring surgical intervention. The extent and number of blistering and necrotic areas were registered before operation, and a colour photograph taken. Secondary endpoints were the development of sequelae in the form of sensory disturbances, skin atrophy, pain and limitation of movements. The study data were reviewed by an Independent Review Committee.

## Sample size

The sample-size calculation was based on the hypothesis of a proportion of surgical interventions of 20% or less. The original planned number of patients was 25.

## Randomisation

The study was non-randomised.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was an open study.

## Statistical methods

The proportion of surgical interventions was estimated using exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. An  interim  analysis  was  scheduled  be  performed  after  inclusion  of  the  first  5  patients.  The  trial management team would discuss the future of the trial, should it have been necessary to operate on 3 of these 5 patients. A second interim analysis was planned after the inclusion of the 17th patient. If none of the 17 patients have been operated upon (0%, 95% CI 0-19.5), the trial management would discuss the future of the trial. At the completion of the 18th patient, who were eligible for efficacy evaluation,  no  failures  had  occurred,  and  the  inclusion  of  patients  was  stopped  (recruitment  to  the study was stopped when 18/23 evaluable patients had been entered).

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

23  patients  were  entered  and  received  treatment  with  dexrazoxane.  Eighteen  were  evaluable  for efficacy  and  safety  and  a  further  five  patients  were  evaluable  for  toxicity  only.  Of  these,  four  had negative  biopsies  and  received  no  further  therapy.  One  patient  had  extravasation  in  a  CVAD  not suitable for obtaining surgical biopsies, but received the full three-day treatment. Of the 18 evaluable patients, 17 received dexrazoxane day 0, 1, and 2. One patient received dexrazoxane on day 0 and 1 only. Sixteen patients were followed for three months. Two patients completed the day 28-visit, but died of their primary cancer diseases before the 3-month visits.

## Recruitment

Patients were recruited by 10 centres in Denmark from July 2001 to June 2003.

## Conduct of the study

No major protocol amendments were made. Baseline data

Baseline characteristics for patients evaluable for efficacy or toxicity, are tabulated in Table 3.

Numbers analysed

All 18 patients evaluable for efficacy had at least three biopsies from the affected area of which at least one was fluorescence positive. All biopsies were obtained within the time limit of 24 h. From 15 of 18 patients (83%) four or more biopsies were obtained. Nine of 18 (50%) patients had 4 or more fluorescence positive biopsies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes and estimation

None of 18 evaluable patients with biopsy-verified (fluorescence-positive) anthracycline extravasation underwent surgical intervention (95% CI 0-18.5%). Seventeen of 18 patients (94.4%) did not develop necrosis. One patient (5.6%) developed an infection in the biopsy area that led to a small necrosis that gradually  healed  upon  treatment  of  the  infection  with  antibiotics.  Two  patients  had  blisters  in  the affected area at baseline . In both cases the blistering had disappeared at follow-up 8-12 hours after the first treatment. No patients developed blistering after treatment with dexrazoxane.

Concerning the long-term sequelae (three months follow up), 16/18 patients (88.9%) had no sensory disturbances, 18/18 (100%) had no limitations of movement, 17/18 (94.4%) had no skin atrophy, and 17/18 patients (94.4%) had no pain at the last follow-up.

Twelve patients (67%) continued their scheduled further chemotherapy course(s) without delay after the  EV  incident.  Six  patients  (33%)  experienced  delay  in  the  planned  cytotoxic  treatment.  Nine patients (50%) were admitted to the hospital due to the EV with a mean duration for the 9 patients of 3.3 days (range 1-6 days; median 3 days).

## Ancillary analyses

Not applicable.

## Study TT02

The study was an open, single-arm multicentre phase 2-3 trial.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  the  same  as  in  TT01,  and  TT02  additionally  excluded patients who had topical use of DMSO at the area of the accident and who had received dexrazoxane within the last 3 weeks. At least two skin biopsies (punch- or knife-biopsies) were required to confirm the  anthracycline  extravasation.  The  biopsies  were  performed  under  local  analgesia,  which  was applied outside the area of redness and swelling. The biopsies were not to contain any part of the vein used for the infusion. They were to be ≥ 6 mm in length and ≥ 6 mm in width. The tissue was to be frozen at -20 to -80 °C. All biopsies were analysed in a central pathology department. Each biopsy was assessed as fluorescence-positive or as fluorescence-negative. Only those patients with fluorescence-positive microscopy were evaluable for efficacy.

## Treatments

See treatments for trial TT01.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  avoid  surgical  intervention  following  the  accidental  extravasation  of anthracycline drug, thus preventing the patient from sequelae.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients undergoing surgical intervention.

Secondary  efficacy  parameters  included  the  development  of  necrosis  (verified  by  two  independent physicians), the development of late sequelae (verified by two independent physicians) in the form of impaired  limb  function,  disfigurement,  pain  and  neurological  deficit,  and  the  postponement  of  the scheduled cancer treatment due to treatment of the extravasation incident.

Sample size

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  sample-size  calculation  was  based  on  the  hypothesis  of  a  70%  reduction  in  the  proportion  of surgical interventions, from a reference value of 35% (based on the literature) to 10% (alpha =.025, beta = .20, using a one-sided exact binomial test). A sample size of 35 patients was calculated, taking into account loss to follow-up.

## Randomisation

The study was non-randomised.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was an open study.

## Statistical methods

The exact binomial test was used. The proportion of surgical interventions was estimated using exact binomial 95% confidence intervals.

The protocol (amendment) specified that an interim analysis was to be conducted after inclusion of the first 18 patients - solely for the purpose of evaluating side effects of the dexrazoxane treatment.

An initial interim analysis was conducted and reported on the basis of the first 19 patients entered, as one patient was incorrectly included. A second interim analysis was based on data from the first 46 patients entered.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

57 patients entered the study at 24 centres and received the first dose of dexrazoxane. One of these patients was entered twice as she experienced extravasation on two occasions, once in each arm. Of the  57  patients  entered,  36  were  evaluable  for  efficacy.  Nine  patients  had  negative  biopsies  and  12 patients had major protocol deviations. The protocol deviation for four patients was no biopsy. All 57 patients enrolled received study treatment and therefore were included in the safety population.

## Recruitment

Patients were recruited by 24 centres in Denmark, Italy, Netherlands and Germany form July 2002 to August 2005.

## Conduct of the study

The final protocol was dated 26 November 2001 and one amendment was issued (26 September 2002). This amendment incorporated several changes to the protocol including a change of the objectives, which  led  to  a  change  in  the  Success  Criteria from 'the  absence  of  surgical  intervention  and postponement  of  the  planned  antineoplastic  treatment  of  the  patient' to 'the  prevention  of  surgical intervention, necrosis and late sequelae evaluated 3 months after the extravasation'.

Amendment 1 also modified the sample size calculation : 35 evaluable patients rather than 55 were to be recruited.

## Baseline data

Baseline characteristics for patients evaluable for efficacy or safety are shown in Table 4.

## Numbers analysed

All 57 patients enrolled received study treatment and therefore were included in the safety population. 36  Patients  were  evaluable  for  the  efficacy  analysis.  Twenty-one  patients  were  excluded  from  this analysis.  Nine  patients  had  negative  biopsies  and  12  patients  had  major  protocol  deviations.  The protocol deviation for four patients was no biopsy. All patients in the efficacy population had at least one positive biopsy (by definition). The median number of biopsies analysed per patient was 2 in both the safety population and the efficacy population.

## Outcomes and estimation

One patient (2.8%) in the efficacy population underwent surgery as a consequence of the extravasation incident (p&lt;0.0001; 95%CI 0.1%-14.5%). The patient had progressive symptoms, including necrosis, and underwent surgery to remove the necrotic tissue on Day 13 and again 3 days later. Two other patients in the efficacy population also had necrosis during the study, but this was due to the biopsy and not extravasation. Ten patients (27.8%) in the efficacy population experienced a postponement of scheduled  chemotherapy.  For  one  patient,  there  was  no  duration  of  postponement  reported  as  no further chemotherapy was given because of surgery. The duration of postponement was 7 to 15 days (mean 10 days) for the nine patients for whom a duration was reported.

A summary of sequelae present at the last follow-up visit for the efficacy population is shown in Table 5 for an initial series of 29 patients.

## · Supportive studies

A  review  of  the  literature  was  presented.  Two  patients  with  large  extravasation  of  epirubicin  and doxorubicin,  both  receiving  dexrazoxane  for  3  days  (1000,1000  and  500mg/m²  on  day  1-3, respectively), did not need surgical intervention and no sequelae were observed [47]. A third patient, with a large biopsy-proven epirubicin extravasation, received the same treatment and also recovered without ulceration and sequelae except dysaesthesia [48]. One patient with an epirubicin extravasation [49] on the hand was treated first with DMSO for 20 minutes, cooling and hydrocortisone ointment and subsequently, after 12 hours, with a single dose of dexrazoxane (administered i.v.). The lesion healed slowly over 4 months without surgery. To one patient with a large doxorubicin extravasation in the chest wall from a needle displacement of a Port-a-Cath entrance, DMSO was applied every 6 hours for 18 hours (stopped due to local irritation), and dexrazoxane 1500 mg was administered i.v. within one hour and repeated after 5 hours and the next day [50]. The wound where the chamber was placed healed without delay but 3 months later a necrosis developed at the site, which then needed surgery. The  authors  concluded  that  the  3  days  of  dexrazoxane  prevented  the  immediate  toxic  effect  of  the extravasation but that additional dexrazoxane probably should have been given to prevent the delayed tissue necrosis

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  demonstration  of  the  clinical  efficacy  of  dexrazoxane  for  the  treatment  of  anthracycline extravasation  is  based  on  the  results  of  two  multicentre,  open  label,  single-arm  studies,  using  an external control from the literature. In total 1 out of 54 patients evaluable for efficacy had necrosis that required  surgical  treatment  as  a  consequence  of  the  extravasation.  Both  pivotal  studies  reached  the primary criterion and statistical requirements. Efficacy has been demonstrated whichever the reference chosen (surgery in 100% as in TT01 with reference to the Danish standard, or 35% as in TT02 with reference to literature). The effect observed can be considered as a clear clinically benefit .

One single dose level and dose schedule was assessed. It was not possible to individualise the dose of dexrazoxane in relation to the amount of extravasated anthracycline. The recommended schedule of the  treatment  is  based  on  literature  and  no  experience  with  modification  is  available.  Until  more knowledge is obtained, the 6-hour time interval between the proof of an anthracycline extravasation and the administration of Savene is recommended (see section 4.2 of the SPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only one patient with extravasation in a CVAD was included. Section 5.1 in the SPC mentions that the efficacy of Savene has not been investigated in a sufficient number of patients with suspicion of anthracycline extravasation from a central venous access device.

Patients with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia &gt; CTC grade 1 have not been included in the clinical studies.  This  patient  group  is  expected  to  be  most  vulnerable  regarding  hematological toxicity. The safety of dexrazoxane in this patient group remains unclear and has to be followed thoroughly by the applicant. It is also mentioned in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Since  studies  on  special  populations  were  not  conducted,  dexrazoxane  is  not  recommended  for treatment (see section 4.2 of the SPC). In case of hepatic impairment a routine liver function test is recommended before each administration of dexrazoxane (see section 4.4 of the SPC).

Since  biopsy  is  not  available  in  all  centres  and  none  of  the  patients  excluded  form  the  efficacy analyses  due  to  a  negative  biopsy  required  surgical  intervention,  the  indication  of  dexrazoxane  can include patients in whom biopsy is not feasible.

## Clinical safety

Safety  data  was  collected  in  two  open  uncontrolled  studies  (TT01,  TT02).  Adverse  events  were monitored up to day 28. Adverse events were graded in severity by the investigator according to NCICTC criteria and causality assessments provided. The clinical adverse events are also coded according to  MedDRA. Laboratory test results were assigned a grade by the applicant, according to the NCICTC definitions.

## · Patient exposure

Data  from  80  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  dexrazoxane  have  been  included.  For  all patients the scheduled regimen was an initial dose of 1000 mg/m 2 , followed 24 hours later by a further dose of 1000 mg/m 2 and after a further 24 hours by a dose of 500 mg/m 2 . In total 80 (100%) patients received  dexrazoxane  treatment  on  Day  1,  72  (90%)patients  on  Day  2  and  69  (86.2%)  patients received the treatment on Day 3 (Table 6) .

Table 6. Exposure to dexrazoxane in TT01 and TT02

|       | TT01 (N = 23)   | TT02 N=46   |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Day 1 | 23 (100%)       | 57 (100%)   |
| Day 2 | 19 (82.6%)      | 53 (92.98%) |
| Day 3 | 18 (78.3%)      | 51 (89.47%) |
| Day 4 | 0               | 1 (1.75%)   |
| Day 5 | 0               | 1 (1.75%)   |

In study TT01, four patients received only one dose of dexrazoxane as they had negative biopsies and so received no further treatment. One additional patient had a traumatic femoral bone fracture and did not receive the last dose of dexrazoxane.

In study TT02 four patients received treatment on Day 1 only because their biopsies were investigated at the local hospital and found to be fluorescence negative. Two patients received treatment on Days 1 and  2  only;  one  withdrew  because  of  personal  reasons,  while  one  stopped  treatment  because  of adverse  events  (see  below).  One  patient  received  five  dexrazoxane  treatments  over  Days  1  to  5  as (because of cooling of the affected area) it was considered that the amount reaching the affected area would be reduced. Treatments on Days 4 and 5 were at the same dosage as given on Day 3.

## · Adverse events

The incidence of adverse reactions in studies TT01 and TT02 that are related or possibly related to treatment are shown in Table 7. All patients in TT01 and the great majority in TT02 experienced one or more adverse events.

In TT01, the most common adverse events were those in the general disorders and administration site conditions, affecting 20 (87.0%) patients. The most frequently reported adverse events in this system organ  class  (SOC)  were  injection  site  pain  (9  patients,  39.1%),  pyrexia  (6  patients,  26.1%)  and injection  site  phlebitis  (5  patients,  39.1%)  followed  by  peripheral  oedema  (4  patients,  17.4%)  and fatigue (3 patients, 13.0%). Adverse events of the gastrointestinal disorders SOC were also common (15  patients,  65.2%),  with  the  most  common  individual  adverse  event  nausea  (13  patients,  56.3%). Infections and infestations were reported for eight (34.8%) of study participants.

The adverse event profile in TT02 was similar to that in TT01. In the safety population, 45 (78.9%) patients  had  at  least  one  clinical  adverse  event  and  27  (47.4%)  patients  had  at  least  one  treatmentrelated  clinical  adverse  event.  SAEs  were  reported  for  20  patients  (35.1%),  with  SAEs  classed  as having  a  'suspected'  or,  in  two  cases,  probable,  relationship  to  study  medication  in  nine  patients (15.8%).  The  most  common  adverse  events  were  those  in  the  gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC  (29 patients, 50.9%), with the most common individual adverse event nausea (36.8% of patients). General disorders and administration site conditions were also common, affecting 45.6% of patients, but were less  common  than  in  TT01.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  in  this  SOC  were  fatigue (12.3%)  and  pyrexia  (19.3%).  Infections  and  infestations were  reported  for  28.1%  of  study participants.

The grade 3 stomatitis was reported for a patient who entered one study twice and was reported under both exposures.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In study TT01, there were two deaths: two patients died of the primary malignant disease before the 3month  visit.  In  TT02  three  SAEs  resulted  in  death.  One  patient,  who  received  five  doses  of dexrazoxane, experienced septic shock due to neutropenia fever 4.5 months after the extravasation, one  patient  experienced  respiratory  insufficiency  due  to Aspergillus infection  2.5  months  after  the extravasation,  and  one  patient  experienced  pneumonia  2  months  after  the  extravasation.  All  deaths were considered unrelated to study medication and all three received the next course of chemotherapy after the extravasation and before death.

In TT01, 12 SAEs were reported for seven different patients (four patients had more than one SAE reported).  Eight  events  in  four  patients  were  related  to  dexrazoxane.  Two  were  related  to  local injection  site  reactions  and  two  events  were  related  to  neutropenia/neutropenic  fever/infection.  In TT02  twenty  patients  experienced  SAEs,  with  nine  patients  experiencing  SAEs  with  suspected relationship  or,  in  two  cases,  a  probable  relationship  to  treatment;  none  had  a  definite  relationship. Two of the events with a suspected relationship were the stomatitis in the patient treated twice, six were related to fever/infection and one to somnolence/dizziness.

## · Laboratory findings

The laboratory test-based toxicities (according to NCI CTC definitions) combined for the two studies are  summarised  in  Table  8.  Grade  2-4  toxicities  were  very  common  for  white  cells,  neutrophils, platelets, haemoglobin, ASAT and ALAT.

The most commonly observed CTC was decreased white cell count (71.9% of patients) with decreased neutrophil count also being very common (59.6% of patients). Decreased haemoglobin, thrombocytopenia,  increased  ALAT  and  increased  ASAT  were  also  frequently  found.  The  most common  grade  4  toxicities  were  decreased  white  cell  and  neutrophil  counts.  However,  grade  4 toxicities were also found for ASAT and ALAT as well as isolated cases of increased and decreased total calcium decreased sodium and increased creatinine.

## · Safety in special populations

No analysis of safety in special populations was performed due the low patient numbers.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No drug-drug interaction was investigated.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

One patient in TT01 had treatment discontinued because of an adverse event, which was unrelated to dexrazoxane.  One  patient  in  TT02  had  treatment  discontinued  because  of  an  adverse  event.  The patient  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  during  the  first  infusion  (dizziness  and  progressive somnolence) and had a recurrence of symptoms at the end of the second infusion and was withdrawn from further treatment.

## · Post marketing experience

At the time of the assessment, dexrazoxane had not been marketed elsewhere for the indication applied for.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Safety  data  from  80  patients  treated  with  dexrazoxane  were  provided  from  two  non-comparative pivotal  trials.  No  unexpected  adverse  events  were  recorded . Most adverse events were attributed to anthracycline-based  chemotherapy,  with  gastrointestinal  and  haematological  toxicity  as  the  most prominent characteristics, although due to the absence of a control group difficult to determine. Local examination should be performed on regular basis after treatment until resolution (see SPC, section 4.4).

Dexrazoxane has not been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and its use in such  patients  is  not  recommended  (see  SPC,  section  4.2).  Since  liver  dysfunction  (increases  in transaminases and bilirubin) may occur (especially after high doses above 1 g/m 2 dexrazoxane), it is recommended  that routine liver function tests are performed before each administration of dexrazoxane  in  patients  with  known  liver  function  disorders  (see  SPC,  section  4.4.).  Since  renal dysfunction may decrease the rate of elimination of dexrazoxane, patients with initial impaired renal function should be monitored for signs of haematological toxicity (see SPC, section 4.4).

Due to considerable haematological toxicity in one published phase 1 study [5] with doses lower than the  proposed posology, regular haematological monitoring is recommended (see SPC, section 4.4.). Patients with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia &gt; CTC grade 1 have not been included in the clinical studies (see SPC, section 4.4).

As  the  solution  for  infusion  contains  potassium  (98mg/500ml)  the  plasma  potassium  level  of  the patient  must  be  closely  monitored  in  patients  at  risk  of  hyperkalaemia.  It  also  contains  sodium (1.61g/500ml) which may be harmful to patients on a low sodium diet (see SPC, section 4.4.).

Safety and MTD results from phase I antineoplastic studies showed that MTD was dependent on age, posology and dosing schedule and varied from 3500 mg/m² 2-hour i.v. infusion for 3 days to 7420 mg/m² when given once weekly, with myelosuppression and abnormal liver function tests becoming dose-limiting. The MTD was lower in patients who have been heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy and those with pre-existing immunosuppression. The given dose schedule is far below these MTDs and no modification is recommended  (see  SPC,  section section 4.2). The  treatment is not recommended to paediatric and elderly patients (see SPC, section 4.2).

## Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP did not require the MAA to submit a risk management plan because the side effects of dexrazoxane  are  well-known  due  to  20  years  of  observation  in  other  indications.  For  the  new indication it is used as an antidote in an emergency situation with a fixed treatment schedule of 3 days.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Two  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  dexrazoxane,  its  antineoplastic  effect  and  its  use  in  the prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity, are well described in the literature.

Dexrazoxane has been shown  to possess mutagenic activity. The carcinogenic potential of dexrazoxane has not been investigated, however, razoxane, (the racemic mixture of dexrazoxane and levrazoxane), has been reported to be associated with the development of secondary malignancies in mice (lymphoid neoplasms) and rats (uterine carcinomas) after administration for a prolonged period of time. Both of these effects are expected for this class of compound.

Repeat-dose toxicity studies have shown that primary target organs were tissues that undergo rapid cell  division:  bone  marrow,  lymphoid  tissue,  testes  and  digestive  tract.  Myelosuppression  is  thus common. The apparent effects were greater during chronic administration than acute. The toxicity in combination with doxorubicin was additive and not synergistic.

The  related  razoxane  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  embryotoxic  in  mice,  rats  and  rabbits  and teratogenic in rats and mice.

When mice with experimental daunorubicin extravasation were treated with dexrazoxane systemically combined with topical treatment with DMSO on the daunorubicin-affected skin area, 67% of the mice developed  small  skin  wounds,  whereas  dexrazoxane  treatment  alone  completely  prevented  the daunorubicin  induced  skin  necrosis  in  another  group  of  mice,  Thus,  DMSO  should  not  be  used  in patients treated with dexrazoxane to prevent anthracycline extravasation.

## Efficacy

The clinical programme for dexrazoxane included two open, single arm, multicentre studies. The  overall  purpose  of  each  trial  was  to  investigate  the  efficacy  of  intravenous  dexrazoxane  in preventing  tissue  damage  from  accidentally  extravasated  anthracycline,  and  thus  preventing  the patients from undergoing the routinely used surgical excision of the affected tissue.

Treatment with dexrazoxane had to be started within 6 hours from the incident and was repeated after 24 and 48 hours. The first and second doses were at 1000 mg/m 2 and the third was 500 mg/m 2 .  A requirement for inclusion in the efficacy part of the study was that the anthracycline extravasation was proven by fluorescence microscopy of one or more biopsies.

In  study  TT01  23  patients  were  entered  and  received  treatment  with  dexrazoxane.  Eighteen  were evaluable for efficacy and safety and a further five patients were evaluable for toxicity only. None of the patients required surgical intervention.

In study TT02, 57 patients entered the study and received the first dose of dexrazoxane. 36 patients were evaluable for efficacy. Only one of the 36 patients required surgery.

In  both  studies  dexrazoxane  treatment  prevented  the  development  of  necrosis,  allowed  cancer treatment to continue as scheduled in the majority of patients, and reduced the occurrence of sequelae.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety

A  number  of  published  reports  comprising  more  than  1000  patients  have  demonstrated  a  uniform pattern  of  dose  dependant  adverse  reactions  such  as  nausea/vomiting,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis,  bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and affected liver function (increased ALT/AST). All adverse reactions have been rapidly reversible.

From  the  safety  database,  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  were  included  in  the Summary of Product  Characteristics.  Based  on  two  clinical  studies,  TT01  and  TT02,  conducted  in patients with extravasation receiving dexrazoxane and already receiving cycles of chemotherapeutic agents,  the  adverse  reactions  reported  were  those  typically  seen  with  standard  chemotherapy,  i.e. nausea/vomiting  in  about  a  third,  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  in  about  half,  more  rarely increased concentration of liver enzymes (ALT/AST).

## Risk-benefit assessment

Anthracycline extravasation is a worrying and serious complication of cytotoxics administration  that may lead to progressive tissue necrosis necessitating surgical resection. The condition is rare and the clinical  profile  is  heterogeneous.  Several  methods  are  available  to  treat  suspected  anthracycline extravasation  such  as  local  cooling,  Dimethylsulfoxide  (DMSO),  corticosteroids,  and  in  some countries  surgical  resection  of  the  affected  tissue  in  patients  with  biopsy-verified  (fluorescencepositive) anthracycline extravasation. No trial comparing available treatment principles was conducted. Currently there are no authorised products for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation.

The present  application  was  for  a  new  systemic  antidote  treatment,  dexrazoxane.  Dexrazoxane  is  a product that has been approved since 1992 for the prevention of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer treated by doxorubicin in several countries. The toxicity profile of the compound is well known and similar to that seen with topoisomerase inhibitors. There were two efficacy and safety studies in the application, study  TT01  and  TT02.  Both  studies  were  multicentre,  open  label,  single  arm.  phase  II  (TT01)  and phase  II-III  (TT02)  studies.  The  demonstration  of  efficacy  was  based  on  comparison  with  results described  in  the  literature.  The  number  of  patients  studied  was  limited  (80  patients  in  total).  Both studies reached the primary objective. In TT01, none of the evaluable patients underwent surgery as a consequence of the extravasation. In TT02, the proportion was one out of 36 evaluable for efficacy patients.  The  effect  of  dexrazoxane  was  considered  as  clinically  relevant  in  a  condition  where  no standard treatment is authorised and where no clinical trial had been previously conducted.

However in clinical practice, biopsy could be not available in all centres, neither for all patients (e.g. central  venous  access  device  CVAD).  In  this  situation  the  administration  of  dexrazoxane  could  be questionable as the efficacy data for dexrazoxane applied to patients in whom the biopsy was positive only. Considering that in both clinical trials, none of the patients excluded from the efficacy analyses due to a negative biopsy, required surgical intervention, it was considered that dexrazoxane could be indicated for patients in whom biopsy is not feasible.

At the time of the assessment, the safety profile of dexrazoxane was considered similar to the safety of the same product used for other authorised indication(including nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, stomatitis, bone marrow suppression). No unexpected adverse events were recorded in the two non-comparative pivotal trials. Gastro-intestinal and administration site condition were the most reported class effects. Most adverse events could be attributed  to  anthracycline  based  chemotherapy,  with  gastrointestinal and  haematological  toxicity  as  the  most  prominent  characteristics.  There  were  some  injection  site reactions and infections at the biopsy sites were seen in several patients and it is possible that there was  some  contribution  of  dexrazoxane  to  the  side  effects  otherwise  typical  of  anthracycline-based chemotherapy,  i.e.  nausea,  vomiting,  and  reversible  haematological  toxicity.  When  using  the  NCICTC system the frequency of Grade 3-4 toxicity seems relatively low, although laboratory neutropenia was recorded in a substantial number of cases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The generally favourable safety profile was confirmed by the small number of patients discontinuing treatment  due  to  adverse  events.  A  risk  management  plan  was  submitted.  The  CHMP,  having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

No  major  objections  were  identified  during  the  Marketing  Authorisation  application.  Satisfactory responses were given to the CHMP Lists of Questions.

Therefore  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  dexrazoxane  for  the  treatment  of  anthracycline  extravasation  is considered positive and an approval of the application is recommended.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Savene  is  not  similar  to  any  of  the  currently  authorised  orphan medicinal products within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## Market exclusivity

Not applicable.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Savene  in  the  treatment  of  anthracycline extravasation was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
