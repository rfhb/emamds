## 1. Introduction

Olanzapine  Neopharma  2.5,  5,  7.5,  10  and  15  mg  coated  tablets  is  a  generic  medicinal  product containing olanzapine as the active substance. The reference product Zyprexa 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 mg coated tablet has been centrally authorised on 27/09/1996.

Olanzapine,  a  thienobenzodiazepine  derivative,  belongs  to  class  of  second  generation  derivative antipsychotic agents, the so-called atypical antipsychotics. They have greater affinity for serotonin 5HT2 serotonin  receptors  than  for  dopamine  D2  receptors  and  cause  fewer  extrapyramidal  symptoms (EPS) in contrast with classical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol).

The active substance olanzapine (INN and chemical name: 2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10Hthieno[2,3-b][1,5]  benzodiazepine)  is  a  yellow  crystalline  powder.  Physico-chemical  properties  have been adequately described including solubility and polymorphism. Olanzapine can exist as 5 possible polymorphic forms (I,  II,  III,  IV  and  V).  The  control  of  polymorphism  has  been  achieved  and  was found to be stable during stability studies. The structure has been fully elucidated by 1 H-NMR, UV, IR and mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Physico-chemical characterisation includes appearance,  solubility,  loss  on  drying,  tapped  density,  DSC  scan  and  X-ray  diffraction  to  identify polymorphic form. The active substance has no chiral centres and no isomerism could be found in the literature.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The efficacy and safety of olanzapine has been demonstrated in randomised, placebo-controlled and comparative trials in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and also as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A summary of these studies may be found in the EPAR of Zyprexa. The  indication  proposed  for  Olanzapine  Neopharma  is  the  same  as  for  the  authorized  Reference medicinal product Zyprexa. 2 Quality aspects Introduction Olanzapine Neopharma exists as 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 mg coated tablets. It  contains  olanzapine  as  the  active  substance.  The  excipients  used  are  the  following  compendial excipients lactose monohydrate, maize starch, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropylcellulose and noncompendial ones for the coating (Opadry white and blue) The primary packaging is made of Aluminium/Aluminium (Al/Al) blisters.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Manufacture

The  scientific  information  has  been  submitted  as  an  Active  Substance  Master  File  (version  August 2006).  Olanzapine  is  obtained  from  one  manufacturer  via  a  3  steps  synthesis.  The  final  product  is dried, sifted and packed into food grade double PE bags kept in fibre drums.

## · Specification

The  applicant  has  provided  an  in-house  monograph  since  olanzapine  is  not  described  in  any pharmacopoeia.  Satisfactory  specification  for  olanzapine  includes  parameters  such  as  appearance, solubility, identification (IR and UV), melting range, loss on drying, residue on ignition, heavy metals, chromatographic  purity  or  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  particle  size  (laser diffraction),  tapped  density,  polymorphism  (DSC  and  XRPD),  assay  (HPLC).  Analytical  methods have been described and validated when non-compendial in accordance with ICH requirements.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Appropriate discussion has been presented on organic and inorganic impurities. Impurity levels have been  provided  for  three  batches  of  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  synthetic  route. Results were found to be in accordance with ICH limits and individual impurities remained below the ICH qualification limits. Specification for residual solvents is in line with the Note for guidance ICH Q3C. Residual solvents data were below the ICH limits. There is no safety concern. Certificates  of  analysis  have  been  provided  for  three  full  scale  batches.  Results  comply  with  the proposed specification and confirm the consistency of the process. Olanzapine is packed in polyethylene bags made of food grade polymer complying with EC Directive 2002/72/EEC. Satisfactory specification, certificates of analysis and IR identification are presented for the packaging. · Stability Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  10  batches  (6  batches  in  the  proposed  packaging  and  4 batches in the former one) under ICH conditions (up to 60 months at 25 ° C/60% RH, up to 24 months at  30 ° C/65%RH  and  6  months  at  40 ° C/75%)  including  forced  degradation  studies.  The  following parameters  have  been  studied:  description,  polymorphic  identity,  identification,  loss  on  drying, chromatographic purity, chemical and polymorphic assay. Results showed no significant change and remained within the specification when olanzapine is stored in  the  proposed  packaging  material  whereas  out-of  specification  results  were  found  in  the  former packaging.  Therefore  the  proposed  re-test  period  is  justified  based  on  the  stability  results  when olanzapine is kept in the proposed packaging. Medicinal Product Olanzapine Neopharma exists as 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 mg coated tablets. The excipients used in the formulation are lactose monohydrate and maize starch as filler and binder, hydroxypropylcellulose as a disintegrant agent, magnesium stearate as a lubricant. A coating has been used to differentiate the tablets.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  is  detailed  for  the  coating  agents  Opadry.  The Olanzapine tablets are packed in Aluminium/Aluminium (Al/Al) blisters and cardboard cartons. · Pharmaceutical Development

The objective was to obtain Olanzapine tablets achieving pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence with the product of reference Zyprexa 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 mg coated tablets.

Pharmaceutical development has been appropriately described, in particular the choice of particle size of olanzapine to obtain satisfactory dissolution properties. The control of the polymorphic form has been achieved during the synthesis of olanzapine.

Common compendial excipients have been chosen for Olanzapine tablets formulation except for the coating agents which have in-house specification. No novel or unusual excipients have been used. No compatibility issue could be identified between olanzapine and the excipients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adequate formulation development has been presented and the ratio between the excipients and the drug substance is identical for the five strengths.

Moreover, in order to demonstrate the equivalence of the Olanzapine Neopharma immediate release tablets  and  the  reference  product  Zyprexa  coated  tablets:  Comparative  dissolution  data  between  the proposed and reference products (all five strengths) have been provided including the biobatch and the batch of reference product bioequivalence study. In all cases dissolution is ≥ 85 % in 15 minutes and since  the  discriminatory  power  has  been  proven,  the  dissolution  can  be  considered  as  similar.  The dissolution  method  has  been  appropriately  detailed  including  the  choice  of  the  method  and  the conditions.

Comparative impurity profiles have been presented between the reference product and the Olanzapine Neopharma product for the 5 strengths. All impurities were present at very low level, and the products can be concluded similar from the impurity point of view.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In vivo comparison has been made in bioequivalence study. The following products were used: test product - Olanzapine 10 mg tablets and, reference product Zyprexa 10 mg tablets. The 10 mg tablets were chosen, because 2.5; 5.0; 7.5 and 10.0 mg have the same ratio between the active substance and excipients and the 15 mg tablets are dose proportional to the 10 mg tablets. The biowaivers have been applied. This is acceptable because all conditions of guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 have been fulfilled: · the same manufacturing site and manufacturing process  is used for all strengths · pharmacokinetic is linear · the qualitative components of different strengths are the same · the composition of all strengths is proportional · the dissolution profile is similar for all five strengths Among  the  available  options  of  tabletting  (direct  compression,  dry  and  wet  granulation),  the  wet granulation was chosen since it was the preferred method for a low dose formulation and for a water insoluble active substance. The  process  can  be  considered  as  standard.  This  has  been  supported  by  results  during  formulation development, by the successful scale-up and by the validation of the process itself. The excipient  used  are  Lactose  monohydrate,  maize  starch,  magnesium  stearate  and  purified  water (used  for  the  manufacture  only),  hydroxypropylcellulose.  They  are  controlled  according  to  their relevant PhEur or USP monographs. Two non-pharmacopeial coating agents Opadry II White and Opadry Blue have been tested according to appropriate in-house monographs.  Details  of their  composition  have  been  presented.  The specifications are acceptable. All the components of the coating agents are Ph Eur quality except the dyes. This is acceptable. Methods used for non-compendial excipients have been described but not validated since they are very simple,  this  is  satisfactory.  Compendial  methods  are  accepted  as  such.  Satisfactory  Certificates  of analysis of all excipients have been provided. Magnesium  stearate  and  lactose  monohydrate  are  of  animal  origin.  A  satisfactory  current  copy  of Certificate  of  Suitability  from  the  PhEur  and  a  BSE  statement  have  been  provided  for  magnesium stearate. The conformity with Note for Guidance EMEA/410/01 rev 2 has been confirmed. The  Al/Al  blisters  were  chosen  for  packaging  of  Olanzapine  tablets  and  the  suitability  of  the packaging was confirmed by stability study.

## · Manufacturing of the product

The manufacture of the finished product consists of a standard wet granulation process followed by compression  and  coating.  Full  description  of  the  process  has  been  provided  and  include  details  of operating conditions. Satisfactory in-process controls performed during the manufacture of Olanzapine tablets  have  been  provided.  No  critical  steps  could  be  identified  in  the  manufacturing  process  but uncoated tablets were classified as intermediate product. Appropriate controls have been performed on the uncoated tablets.

The process validation has been carried out on two pilot scale batches per strength and showed the process is adequately controlled and reproducible. A satisfactory validation plan has been presented

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for  the  validation  of  the  process  on  commercial  batches,  according  to  the  Annex  I to  Note  for Guidance on Process Validation CPMP/848/96 .

## · Product specification

Specifications  at  release  and  at  the  end  of  the  shelf-life  include description,  tablet  diameter, identification of olanzapine, identification of titanium dioxide, identification of the coating, uniformity of  weight,  average  weight  of  the  tablet,  disintegration  time,  uniformity  of  content,  uniformity  of dosage units, dissolution, related substances, assay of olanzapine, microbiological quality.

The proposed specifications are acceptable in particular the skip-testing approach for microbiological quality.  Release and shelf life limits for the assay of olanzapine are in line with batch and stability data. Limits for related substances comply with ICH guidelines Q3B and on the maximum daily dose so  the  proposed  limits  are  acceptable.  No  new  impurities  have  been  arising  compared  to  the  active substance and the specifications have been justified.

Satisfactory specifications for blisters have been provided as well IR identification and certificates of analysis. The packaging material complies with PhEur and EC Directive 2002/72/EC. · Stability of the product Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  2  pilot  batches  of  each  strength  kept  in  the  commercial packaging under ICH conditions (up to 36 months under at 25°C / 60% RH, up to 12 months at 30°C / 65% RH, 6 months at 40°C / 75% RH). Parameters tested were description, disintegration, dissolution, assay, microbial limit test and related substances. Results remain within the specification under longterm and intermediate conditions. Based on the data, the proposed shelf-life can be granted under the precautions of storage stated in the SPC. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 3. Non-Clinical aspects This  application  is  being  made  under  Article  10.1  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of olanzapine are well characterised. As olanzapine is widely used and well-known, non-clinical testing strategy did not include any further toxicological or pharmacological studies. Reference is made to the originator's data and to published literature. The active substance used in the reference product and the submitted generic application is identical, the excipients used in drug formulation are conventional, well known and broadly used in other medicinal products. Declared impurities in amounts  present in the formulation do not require further identification and qualification. No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided.

## 4. Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

The CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of bioequivalence studies.

## GCP aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical bioequivalence studies were performed in healthy volunteers. In these studies the compliance to regulatory, ethical and GCP requirements of clinical phases can be recognized. The clinical facility has recently been inspected by an EU inspection.

In accordance to Art 8 (ia) of the amended Directive, Art 9.4(c) and Art 127 (a) of the new Regulation, the  Applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Inspections  were  carried  out  during  the  assessment  procedure:  the  inspection  has  not  resulted  in critical  findings  and  the  studies  can  be  accepted  in  the  context  of  a  marketing  authorization application.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Exemption The Applicant submitted only one comparative bio-availability study with 10 mg tablets to determine whether  Olanzapine  2.5  mg,  5.0  mg,  7.5  mg,  10.0  mg  and  15.0  mg  Tablets  to  be  licensed  by Neopharma Ltd. demonstrate equivalent pharmacokinetic characteristics to the Eli Lilly and Company brand  Zyprexa  2.5  mg,  5.0  mg,  7.5  mg,  10.0mg  and  15.0  mg  Tablets.  However,  the  Applicant adequately  justified  the  lack  of  the  bioequivalence  studies  for  the  other  strengths  according  to  the requirements of the Guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 section 5.4. Clinical studies To support the application, the Applicant has submitted a single bioequivalence study (study 007/05). The design of the study was an open label, balanced, randomized, analyst blind, two treatment, two period, two sequence, single dose, crossover oral bioequivalence study in 24 healthy male volunteers. The study was performed to determine whether Olanzapine 10 mg Tablets, which is the subject of this application, demonstrates equivalent pharmacokinetic characteristics to the Eli Lilly brand Zyprexa 10 mg Tablets (containing 10 mg Olanzapine). Pharmacokinetics · Methods STUDY DESIGN The study number 007/05 was an open label, balanced, randomized, analyst blind, two-treatment, twoperiod,  two-sequence,  crossover  with  oral  single  dose  in  24  healthy  male  volunteers  under  fasting conditions. The study was conducted using the facilities of a Contract Research Organisation located in Mumbai, India, and was carried out over the period 10/05/05 to 02/06/05. After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the subjects were dosed between 08:00 and 08:21 a.m. A single oral dose (1 x 10 mg) was administrated with 240 ml of water. A controlled meal was served about 4 hours post-dose, and fluids were not permitted for 1 hour before and 2 hours after dosing. The subjects were confined at least 11 hours before dosing and until after 24-hour blood sample was taken in  each  period.  Blood  samplings  were  performed  pre-dosing  and  at  different  time-points  up  to  168 hours post-dose. Single doses of olanzapine were separated by a wash-out period of 2 weeks.

There was a small number of protocol deviations, including several missing blood samples. None of the deviations were considered to have any impact on the overall outcome of the trial. The deviations were presented appropriately and can be seen in the full study report.

The  study  was  declared  to  be  conducted  in  compliance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice,  and  this  was verified  and  confirmed  by  an  inspection.    The  centre  was  inspected  by  internal  quality  assurance department  of  the  Clinical  Research  Organisation  and  the  study  protocol  was  approved  by  an independent Ethical committee.

Medicinal product no longer authorised ANALYTICAL METHODS A validated HPLC method with MS/MS detection (LC-MS/MS) was used for plasma analysis. PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES The  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  according  to  protocol  were  the  area  under  the  plasma concentration  curve  from  administration  to  last  observed  concentration  at  time  t  (AUC0-t),  AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax). Secondary variables were determined  as  time  of  the  C max -  T max ,  terminal  half-life  -  T 1/2 and  elimination  rate  constant  -  K el. WinNonlin software and SAS software release 9.1 were used for analysis. STATISTICAL METHODS The  statistical  analysis  consisted  of  an  ANOVA,  performed  on  untransformed  and  log-transformed data. 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of means between drug formulations were calculated for the  log-transformed  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  and  Cmax  .  The  acceptance  range  was  pre-defined  within  85125%.  The  statistical  model  included  sequence,  period  and  treatment  as  factors  for  the  subsequent ANOVA analysis. · Results Table 1.

The  mean  ratios  of  the  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  and  Cmax  for  olanzapine  were  within  the  acceptable confidence intervals of 80-125%. Bioequivalence was assessed according to the standard equations. The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  reported  in  the  study  are  consistent  with  literature  reports.  The

individual  data  listings  as  well  as  linear  and  semilogaritmic  individual  graphs  are  presented  in  the dossier.

A statistically significant effect was not detected. Both treatments were well tolerated after a single dose, with 14 non-serious adverse events reported in the study. The adverse events include drowsiness (9  subjects),  dizziness  (2  subjects),  pain  in  calf  muscle  (1  subject)  and  giddiness  (1  subject).  These adverse events were randomly distributed between the test and reference product, except for the pain in the calf muscle, which was classified as probably related to the medication and is described in the SPC of both the reference and the test products.

##  Conclusions on clinical studies

## 5. Pharmacovigilance

Medicinal product no longer authorised The BE study was designed and conducted according to the typical randomized cross-over design. All the  primary  parameters  are  well  within  the  limit  of  80-125  %  for  90  %  confidence  intervals.  The presented results of the means of AUC0-inf and AUC0-t with relatively low intraindividual variability indicate residual AUC area to be less then 5%. All the clinical work was declared to be in compliance with GCP, and this was verified and confirmed by an inspection. Based on the presented study Neopharma Olanzapine is considered bioequivalent with Zyprexa by Eli Lilly. The results of study 007/05 with 10 mg formulation can be extrapolated to the other strengths (2.5  mg,  5.0  mg,  7.5  mg  and  15.0  mg)  submitted  for  the  marketing  authorisation,  according  to  the conditions  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, section 5.4. Pharmacodynamics No studies were submitted. Additional data Comparative dissolution data between the proposed and reference products (all five strengths) have been provided including the biobatchand the batch of the reference productused in the bioequivalence study. In all cases the dissolution was comparable. Discussion on Clinical aspects The efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology of the active ingredient olanzapine are already wellestablished and documented for the original medicinal product Zyprexa. The submitted bioequivalence study is designed and reported in accordance with the relevant EU note for guidance. The data of this study sufficiently demonstrate that the tested formulation intended for marketing is bioequivalent to the  innovator  product.  The  bioequivalence  demonstrated  for  tablets  of  the  strength  10mg  may  be extrapolated  also  to  strengths  2.5,  5,  7.5  and  15  mg.  The  validity  of  the  BE  data  was  confirmed following the positive outcome of a GCP inspection conducted at the clinical and analytical sites. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. Olanzapine Neopharma has not been marketed in any country.

## Pharmacovigilance System

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that the pharmacovigilance activities are in line with the current safety measures applied to the reference medicinal product.

##  PSUR

The  PSUR  submission  schedule  for  Olanzapine  Neopharma  should  follow  the  PSUR  submission schedule for the reference medicinal product.

##  Risk Management Plan

A Risk Management Plan was not submitted. Since the application concerns a generic of reference medicinal product for which no safety concerns requiring additional risk minimisation activities have been identified, a Risk Management Plan was not required.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  results  of  user  consultation  provided  indicates  that  the  Package  leaflet  is  well  structured  and organised, easy to understand and written in a comprehensible manner. The test shows that the leaflet is readable in patients /users are able to act upon the information that it contains. 6. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment The  application  contains  adequate  quality  and  non  clinical  data  and  the  bioequivalence  has  been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Olanzapine Neopharma in the treatment of schizophrenia was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
