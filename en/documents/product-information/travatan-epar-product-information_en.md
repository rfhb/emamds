## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

TRAVATAN 40 micrograms/mL eye drops, solution

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each mL of solution contains 40 micrograms of travoprost.

## Excipient(s) with known effect

Each mL of solution contains polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD) 10 microgram, propylene glycol 7.5 mg, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (HCO-40) 2 mg (see section 4.4.)

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Eye drops, solution. (eye drops)

Clear, colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Decrease of elevated intraocular pressure in adult patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma (see section 5.1).

Decrease of elevated intraocular pressure in paediatric patients aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years with ocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma (see section 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Use in adults, including elderly population

The dose is one drop of TRAVATAN in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily. Optimal effect is obtained if the dose is administered in the evening.

Nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after administration is recommended. This may reduce the systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a decrease in systemic adverse reactions.

If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be administered at least 5 minutes apart (see section 4.5).

If a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. The dose should not exceed one drop in the affected eye(s) daily.

When substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma medicinal product with TRAVATAN, the other medicinal product should be discontinued and TRAVATAN should be started the following day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic and renal impairment

TRAVATAN has been studied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 ml/min). No dosage adjustment is necessary in these patients (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

TRAVATAN can be used in paediatric patients from 2 months to &lt; 18 years at the same posology as in adults. However, data in the age group 2 months to &lt; 3 years (9 patients) is limited (see section 5.1).

The safety and efficacy of TRAVATAN in children below the age of 2 months have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of Administration

For ocular use.

For patients who wear contact lenses, please refer to section 4.4.

The patient should remove the protective overwrap immediately prior to initial use. To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Eye colour change

TRAVATAN may gradually change the eye colour by increasing the number of melanosomes (pigment granules) in melanocytes. Before treatment is instituted, patients must be informed of the possibility of a permanent change in eye colour. Unilateral treatment can result in permanent heterochromia. The long term effects on the melanocytes and any consequences thereof are currently unknown. The change in iris colour occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for months to years. The change in eye colour has predominantly been seen in patients with mixed coloured irides, i.e., blue-brown, grey-brown, yellow-brown and green-brown; however, it has also been observed in patients with brown eyes. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery in affected eyes, but the entire iris or parts of it may be become more brownish. After discontinuation of therapy, no further increase in brown iris pigment has been observed.

## Periorbital and eye lid changes

In controlled clinical trials, periorbital and/or eyelid skin darkening in association with the use of TRAVATAN has been reported in 0.4% of patients. Periorbital and lid changes including deepening of the eyelid sulcus have also been observed with prostaglandin analogues.

TRAVATAN may gradually change eyelashes in the treated eye(s); these changes were observed in about half of the patients in clinical trials and include: increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and/or number of lashes. The mechanism of eyelash changes and their long term consequences are currently unknown.

TRAVATAN has been shown to cause slight enlargement of the palpebral fissure in studies in the monkey. However, this effect was not observed during the clinical trials and is considered to be species specific.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is no experience of TRAVATAN in inflammatory ocular conditions; nor in neovascular, angle-closure, narrow-angle or congenital glaucoma and only limited experience in thyroid eye disease, in open-angle glaucoma of pseudophakic patients and in pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. TRAVATAN should therefore be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation.

## Aphakic patients

Macular oedema has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2a analogues. Caution is recommended when using Travatan in aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular oedema.

## Iritis/uveitis

In patients with known predisposing risk factors for iritis/uveitis, TRAVATAN should be used with caution.

## Contact with the skin

Skin contact with TRAVATAN must be avoided as transdermal absorption of travoprost has been demonstrated in rabbits.

Prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogues are biologically active materials that may be absorbed through the skin. Women who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should exercise appropriate precautions to avoid direct exposure to the contents of the bottle. In the unlikely event of coming in contact with a substantial portion of the contents of the bottle, thoroughly cleanse the exposed area immediately.

## Contact lenses

Patients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to application of TRAVATAN and wait 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion.

## Excipients

TRAVATAN contains propylene glycol which may cause skin irritation. TRAVATAN contains polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 which may cause skin reactions.

## Paediatric population

Efficacy and safety data in the age group 2 months to &lt; 3 years (9 patients) is limited (see section 5.1). No data are available for children below the age of 2 months.

In children &lt; 3 years old that mainly suffer from PCG (primary congenital glaucoma), surgery (e.g. trabeculotomy/goniotomy) remains the first line treatment.

No long-term safety data are available in the paediatric population.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of child-bearing potential/contraception

TRAVATAN must not be used in women of child bearing age/potential unless adequate contraceptive measures are in place (see section 5.3).

## Pregnancy

Travoprost has harmful pharmacological effects on pregnancy and/or the fetus/new-born child. TRAVATAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breastfeeding

It is unknown whether travoprost from the eye drops is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of travoprost and metabolites in breast milk. The use of TRAVATAN by breast-feeding mothers is not recommended.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of TRAVATAN on human fertility. Animal studies showed no effect of travoprost on fertility at doses more than 250 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

TRAVATAN has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines, however as with any eye drop, temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines. If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In clinical trials with TRAVATAN, the most common adverse reactions were ocular hypearemia and iris hyperpigmentation, occurring in approximately 20% and 6% of patients respectively.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions are classified according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to&lt;1/1,000), very rare &lt;1/10,000), or not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency group, adverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of seriousness. The adverse reactions were obtained from clinical studies and postmarketing data with TRAVATAN.

## Paediatric population

In a 3 month phase 3 study and a 7 days pharmacokinetic study, involving 102 paediatric patients exposed to TRAVATAN, the types and characteristics of adverse reactions reported were similar to what has been observed in adult patients. The short-term safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets were also similar (see section 5.1). The most frequent adverse reactions reported in the paediatric population were ocular hyperaemia (16.9%) and growth of eyelashes (6.5%). In a similar 3 month study in adult patients, these events occurred at an incidence of 11.4% and 0.0%, respectively.

Additional adverse drug reactions reported in paediatric patients in the 3 month paediatric study (n=77) compared to a similar trial in adults (n=185) included erythema of eyelid, keratitis, lacrimation increased, and photophobia all reported as single events with an incidence of 1.3% versus 0.0% seen in adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of overdose have been reported. A topical overdose is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity. A topical overdose of TRAVATAN may be flushed from the eye(s) with lukewarm water. Treatment of a suspected oral ingestion is symptomatic and supportive.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals-antiglaucoma preparations and miotics-prostaglandin analogues, ATC code: S01E E04

## Mechanism of action

Travoprost, a prostaglandin F2  analogue, is a highly selective full agonist which has a high affinity for the prostaglandin FP receptor, and reduces the intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour via trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways. Reduction of the intraocular pressure in man starts about 2 hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after 12 hours. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding 24 hours with a single dose.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In a clinical trial, patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were treated with TRAVATAN (polyquaternium-preserved) dosed once-daily in the evening demonstrated 8 to 9 mmHg reductions (approximately 33%) in intraocular pressure from 24 to 26 mmHg baseline. Data on adjunctive administration of TRAVATAN with timolol 0.5% and limited data with brimonidine 0.2% were collected during clinical trials that showed an additive effect of TRAVATAN with these glaucoma medications. No clinical data are available on adjunctive use with other ocular hypotensive medications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary pharmacology

Travoprost significantly increased optic nerve head blood flow in rabbits following 7 days of topical ocular administration (1.4 micrograms, once-daily).

TRAVATAN preserved with polyquaternium-1 induced minimal ocular surface toxicity, compared to eye drops preserved with benzalkonium chloride, on cultured human corneal cells and following topical ocular administration in rabbits.

## Paediatric population

The efficacy of TRAVATAN in paediatric patients from 2 months to less than 18 years of age was demonstrated in a 12-week, double-masked clinical study of travoprost compared with timolol in 152 patients diagnosed with ocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma. Patients received either travoprost 0.004% once daily or timolol 0.5% (or 0.25% for subjects younger than 3 years old) twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the intraocular pressure (IOP) change from baseline at Week 12 of the study. Mean IOP reductions in the travoprost and timolol groups were similar (see Table 1).

In the age groups 3 to &lt; 12 years (n=36) and 12 to &lt; 18 years (n=26), mean IOP reduction at Week 12 in the travoprost group was similar to that in the timolol group. Mean IOP reduction at Week 12 in the 2 months to &lt; 3 years of age group was 1.8 mmHg in the travoprost group and 7.3 mmHg in the timolol group. IOP reductions for this group were based on only 6 patients in the timolol group and 9 patients in the travoprost group where 4 patients in the travoprost group versus 0 patients in the timolol group had no relevant mean IOP reduction at Week 12. No data are available for children less than 2 months old.

The effect on IOP was seen after the second week of treatment and was consistently maintained throughout the 12 week period of study for all age groups.

## Table 1 Comparison of Mean IOP Change from Baseline (mmHg) at Week 12

| Travoprost   | Travoprost   | Timolol   | Timolol   |                   |             |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| N            | Mean (SE)    | N         | Mean (SE) | Mean Difference a | (95% CI)    |
| 53           | -6.4         | 60        | -5.8      | -0.5              | (-2.1, 1.0) |
|              | (1.05)       |           | (0.96)    |                   |             |

SE = Standard Error; CI = Confidence Interval;

a Mean difference is Travoprost - Timolol. Estimates based on least squares means derived from a statistical model that accounts for correlated IOP measurements within patient where primary diagnosis and baseline IOP stratum are in the model.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Travoprost is an ester prodrug. It is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester is hydrolysed to the active free acid. Studies in rabbits have shown peak concentrations of 20 ng/mL of the free acid in aqueous humour one to two hours after topical dosing of TRAVATAN. Aqueous humour concentrations declined with a half-life of approximately 1.5 hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Following topical ocular administration of TRAVATAN to healthy volunteers, low systemic exposure to active free acid was demonstrated. Peak active free acid plasma concentrations of 25 pg/mL or less were observed between 10 and 30 minutes post-dose. Thereafter, plasma levels declined rapidly to below the 10 pg/mL assay quantitation limit before 1 hour post-administration. Due to the low plasma concentrations and rapid elimination following topical dosing, the elimination half-life of active free acid in man could not be determined.

## Biotransformation

Metabolism is the major route of elimination of both travoprost and the active free acid. The systemic metabolic pathways parallel those of endogenous prostaglandin F2  which are characterised by reduction of the 13-14 double bond, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and  -oxidative cleavages of the upper side chain.

## Elimination

Travoprost free acid and its metabolites are mainly excreted by the kidneys. TRAVATAN has been studied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 ml/min). No dosage adjustment is necessary in these patients.

## Paediatric population

A pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years demonstrated very low plasma exposure to travoprost free acid, with concentrations ranging from below the 10 pg/mL assay limt of quantitation (BLQ) to 54.5 pg/mL. In 4 previous systemic pharmacokinetic studies in adult populations, travoprost free acid plasma concentrations ranged from BLQ to 52.0 pg/mL. While most of the plasma data across all studies was non-quantifiable, making statistical comparisons of systemic exposure across age groups unfeasible, the overall trend shows that plasma exposure to travoprost free acid following topical administration of TRAVATAN is extremely low across all age groups evaluated.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In ocular toxicity studies in monkeys, administration of travoprost at a dose of 0.45 microgram, twice a day, was shown to induce increased palpebral fissure. Topical ocular administration of travoprost to monkeys at concentrations of up to 0.012% to the right eye, twice daily for one year resulted in no systemic toxicity.

Reproduction toxicity studies have been undertaken in rat, mice and rabbit by systemic route. Findings are related to FP receptor agonist activity in uterus with early embryolethality, post-implantation loss, foetotoxicity. In pregnant rat, systemic administration of travoprost at doses more than 200 times the clinical dose during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of malformations. Low levels of radioactivity were measured in amniotic fluid and foetal tissues of pregnant rats administered 3 H-travoprost. Reproduction and development studies have demonstrated a potent effect on foetal loss with a high rate observed in rats and mice (180 pg/ml and 30 pg/ml plasma, respectively) at exposures 1.2 to 6 times the clinical exposure (up to 25 pg/ml).

## Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA)

Travoprost is considered a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance. Hence, despite the very small amounts of travoprost used by patients in eye drops, a risk to the environment cannot be excluded.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What TRAVATAN is and what it is used for

TRAVATAN contains travoprost, one of a group of medicines called prostaglandin analogues . It works by reducing the pressure in the eye. It may be used on its own or with other drops e.g. beta-blockers, which also reduce pressure.

TRAVATAN is used to reduce high pressure in the eye in adults, adolescents and children from 2 months old onward. This pressure can lead to an illness called glaucoma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you use TRAVATAN

## Do not use TRAVATAN

- If you are allergic to travoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

Ask your doctor for advice if this applies to you.

## Warning and Precautions

- TRAVATAN may increase the length, thickness, colour and/or number of your eyelashes . Changes in the eyelids including unusual hair growth or in the tissues around the eye have also been observed.
- TRAVATAN may change the colour of your iris (the coloured part of your eye). This change may be permanent. A change in the colour of the skin around the eye may also occur.
- If you have had cataract surgery , talk to your doctor before you use TRAVATAN.
- If you have current or previous history of an eye inflammation (iritis and uveitis), talk to your doctor before you use TRAVATAN.
- TRAVATAN may rarely cause breathlessness or wheezing or increase the symptoms of asthma . If you are concerned about changes in your breathing pattern when using TRAVATAN advise your doctor as soon as possible.
- Travoprost may be absorbed through the skin. If any of the medicinal product comes into contact with the skin, it should be washed off straight away. This is especially important in women who are pregnant or are attempting to become pregnant.
- If you wear soft contact lenses, do not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in.

## Children and adolescents

TRAVATAN can be used in children from 2 months to &lt; 18 years at the same dose as for adults. Use of TRAVATAN is not recommended to those children under 2 months of age.

## Other medicines and TRAVATAN

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or used any other medicines.

## Pregnancy, breast feeding and fertility

Do not use TRAVATAN if you are pregnant. If you think that you may be pregnant speak with your doctor right away. If you could become pregnant you must use adequate contraception whilst you use TRAVATAN.

Do not use TRAVATAN if you are breast feeding . TRAVATAN may get into your milk.

Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine

## Driving and using machines

You may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use TRAVATAN. Do not drive or use machines until this has worn off.

TRAVATAN contains hydrogenated castor oil and propylene glycol which may cause skin reactions and irritation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use TRAVATAN

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or the doctor treating your child has told you. You should check with your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## The recommended dose is

One drop in the affected eye or eyes, once a day - in the evening.

Only use TRAVATAN in both eyes if your doctor told you to. Use it for as long as your doctor or the doctor treating your child told you to.

Only use TRAVATAN for dropping in your or your child's eye(s).

- Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap pouch, take the bottle out ( picture 1 ) and write the date of opening on the carton in the space provided
- Wash your hands
- Twist off the cap
- Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers
- Tilt your head or your child's head gently back. Pull down the eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a 'pocket' between the eyelid and the eye. The drop will go in here ( picture 2 )
- Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use a mirror if it helps
- Do not touch the eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could infect the drops
- Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of TRAVATAN at a time. ( picture 3 )
- After using TRAVATAN, keep the eyelid closed, apply gentle pressure by pressing a finger into the corner of the eye, by the nose ( picture 4 ) for at least 1 minute. This helps to stop TRAVATAN getting into the rest of the body
- If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for the other eye
- Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use
- Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the pouch until you need to use the bottle.

If a drop misses the eye, try again.

If you or your child are using other eye preparations such as eye drop or eye ointment, wait for at least 5 minutes between putting in TRAVATAN and the other eye preparations.

## If you or your child receive more TRAVATAN than you should

Rinse all the medicine out with warm water. Don't put in any more drops until it's time for the next regular dose.

## If you forget to use TRAVATAN

C ontinue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Never use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) in a single day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you stop using TRAVATAN

Do not stop using TRAVATAN without first speaking to your doctor or the doctor treating your child, the pressure in your eye or your child's eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist.

## Now turn over 

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
