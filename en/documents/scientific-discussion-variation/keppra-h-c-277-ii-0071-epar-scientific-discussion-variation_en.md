## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

Keppra (levetiracetam - LEV) is currently authorised in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy. It is also authorised as adjunctive therapy in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation  in  adults  and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy and in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).

The MAH has applied for an extension of the indication for Keppra to include adjunctive therapy in the  treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in adults and children 4 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). The IGEs are those syndromes or diseases that are a primary epilepsy condition and are thought or known to have a genetic cause. The IGEs are estimated to constitute approximately one quarter of the incidence of epilepsy. IGE usually arises in childhood or adolescence, but a large number of patients continue to have seizures in adult life. There are a number of different epilepsy syndromes within the group of IGEs. The main types are childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), JME, and epilepsy with grand mal seizures on  awakening.  In  these  syndromes,  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  (PGTC)  seizures  can  occur  as isolated events or in association with other generalized seizure types (e.g. myoclonic seizures, absence seizures). PGTC seizures have a usual onset during childhood or adolescence, but may appear later. They  occur  without  warning  or  aura.  The  electroencephalogram  pattern  for  PGTC  seizures  is generalised spike-and-wave or polyspike wave.

In addition to section 4.1 of the SPC, the MAH proposed to update section 4.8 to reflect the safety data generated  by  the  pivotal  study  and  to  introduce  minor  grammatical  changes  to  section  4.2.  The Package Leaflet (PL) was revised accordingly.

## 2. Clinical aspects

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP, as stated by the MAH. In addition, the MAH confirmed that the ethical requirements of the clinical trial directive 2001/20/EC were applied for clinical trials conducted outside the EU.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical programme was based on a pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in patients with IGE with PGTC (N01057). A long-term follow-up study (N167), open to enrolment to patients  who  completed  N01057  as  well  as  patients  from  other  studies  with  primary  generalized seizures, was included to provide supportive long-term efficacy and safety in the proposed indication. Further supportive data from Study N166, the primary basis for the authorised indication in patients with myoclonic seizures, were provided (Table I).

## MAIN STUDY N01057: DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, 24-WEEK TREATMENT PERIOD

## METHODS

## Objectives

The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEV as adjunctive treatment (3000 mg/day, given b.i.d. or a target dose of 60 mg/kg/day in children, given b.i.d.) in adults and children (4 to 65 years) with IGE with PGTC seizures.

## Study Participants

Among the inclusion criteria were:

- Male/female aged 4-65 years.
- One or two concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).
- Diagnosis of IGE with uncontrolled PGTC seizures and at least 3 documented PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least 1 PGTC seizure in the 4-week historical baseline period and at least 1 PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

The study consisted of several periods:

- Combined baseline period: 4-week historical baseline followed by 4 weeks single-blind placebo (PBO) prospective baseline.
- Up-titration  period  (4  weeks):  LEV  3000  mg/day  (provided  as  500-mg  tablets)  or  matching PBO.
- Evaluation period (20 weeks): during the first week patients were allowed one dose reduction to 2000 mg/day (and were not allowed to subsequently increase the dose).
- Down-titration or conversion to open label LEV (long-term follow-up study N167).

The  mean  daily  dose  of  levetiracetam  during  the  evaluation  period  (exclusive  of  up-  and  downtitrations) was 2887.2 mg/day which is close to the target dose of 3000 mg/day.

## Randomisation and sample size

Treatments  were  allocated  to  subjects  by  means  of  a  centralised  randomisation  process.  The randomisation  was  stratified  by  region  and  weight  category  [adults,  children  and  adolescents  &lt;  16 years (&gt; 40 kg, 31-40 kg and 20-30 kg)].

The ITT population consisted of 164 individuals (73 male and 91 female) ranging in age from 5 years to 62 years.  Seventy of 84 patients randomised to PBO (82.56 %) and 69 of 79 patients randomised to LEV  (86.3  %)  completed  the  double-blind  evaluation  period.  The  most  common  reason  for discontinuation in the active group was loss to follow-up (5 patients; 6.5 %) and withdrawal of consent (4  patients;  5.2  %).  In  the  PBO  group,  adverse  events  (4  patients,  4.9  %)  and  lack  of  efficacy  (3 patients; 3.8 %) were the most common reasons.

## Endpoints

## Primary efficacy variable

The primary efficacy variable was the percentage reduction from the combined baseline period in the PGTC seizure frequency over the treatment period.

The  percentage  reduction  in  the  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  was  also  assessed  over  the evaluation period.

## Secondary efficacy variables

- Absolute  reduction  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  from  the  combined  baseline  period during the treatment period.
- Percent reduction in seizure days per week (all seizures) from the prospective baseline period during the treatment period.
- Responder  rates  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency,  and  in  seizure  days  (all  seizures)  per  week.  A responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 50% reduction in the applicable measure from the baseline  period  to  the  treatment  period.  The  baseline  seizure  frequency  is  calculated  over  the combined  baseline  period,  and  the  baseline  seizure  days  per  week  calculated  over  the prospective baseline period.
- Categorized response to treatment in PGTC seizures: Subjects were grouped into 4 categories (less  than  -25%,  -25%  to  &lt;25%,  25%  to  &lt;75%  and  75%  to  100%)  according  to  the  percent reduction from the combined baseline period in PGTC seizures frequency during the treatment period. A similar grouping constructed on seizure days for all seizures used only the prospective baseline period.
- Percent of seizure-free subjects, with respect to all seizures, and with respect to PGTC seizures during the evaluation period and the entire treatment period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Because the distributions of percent reductions in seizure frequency / seizure days from baseline were skewed with most values centering around the lower values and the extreme values tailing off to the right, the median difference in absolute and percent reduction between LEV and PBO was estimated with the Hodges-Lehmann method and statistically tested with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test in addition  to  the  originally  planned  ANCOVA  with  rank  transformation.  Responder  rates  in  PGTC seizure  frequency  per  week  were  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  a  logistic  regression analysis with treatment group as factor and the baseline PGTC seizure frequency as the covariate. The treatment  difference  in  categorized  responses  has  been  tested  with  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test based on ranks. Differences in seizure freedom were inferentially tested using Fisher's exact test.

@) Subjects are coumted once in each type/subtype of seizure ever experienced.

() 163 (99.4%) . After database lock it was discovered that one subject (113/103) had a database data entry omission with respect to the historical presence of II E seizures.

## Concomitant AED medication

The  most  commonly  used  AEDs  during  the  treatment  period  were  valproic  acid  (53,2  %)  and lamotrigine (27 % of the patients). At baseline, 50 % of the patients took one concomitant AED and 44 % two AEDs. Of 11 patients who took more than two AEDs during the treatment period, use of lorazepam 'as needed' accounted for all but three.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy variable:

During  treatment,  patients  randomized  to  PBO  had  a  mean  28.30%  (median  44.57%)  reduction  in PGTC seizure frequency per week from a mean of 1.20 (median 0.62) PGTC seizure frequency per week  at  combined  baseline.  In  the  LEV  group  the  mean  percent  reduction  was  56.37%  (median 77.58%) from a mean of 1.27 (median 0.62) PGTC seizure frequency per week at combined baseline. The  difference  between  the  treatment  least-square  means  in  percent  reduction  from  baseline  was statistically significant (p = 0.004).

A  similar  result  was  obtained  when  the  primary  efficacy  hypothesis  of  no  difference  in  mean percentage reduction in PGTC seizure frequency per week was tested using an ANCOVA model with treatment groups as factor and combined baseline PGTC seizure frequency as covariate (TableV).

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

- Responder rate

A subject was defined as a responder if the percent reduction in PGTC seizure frequency per week from combined baseline to treatment period was greater or equal to 50 %. The percentage of responders in the LEV group was 72.2 % vs. 45.2 % in the PBO group (p&lt;0.001).

- Seizure freedom with respect to all seizures and PGTC seizures Seizure  freedom  was  assessed  over  the  evaluation  period  and  the  treatment  period  for  both PGTC seizures and all seizure types. The results are presented in table VII.

## 50  %  responder  rate  in  PGTC  seizure  frequency  per  week  over  the  treatment  period  by  epileptic syndrome

The  fifty  percent  responder  rate  in  percent  reduction  in  PGTC  seizures  was  analysed  from  the combined baseline to treatment period in each of the five specified syndrome groupings. Table VIII summarizes the results.

50 % responder rate over the treatment period in absence, myoclonic and PGTC exclusively subgroups An analysis of responder rates within the subgroups of patients with exclusively PGTC seizures, those who experienced absence seizures during either the combined baseline or the treatment period, and those who experienced myoclonic seizures during the prospective baseline or the treatment period was performed. The results are presented in table IX.

Table IX. 50 % responder rate over the treatment period in absence, myoclonic and PGTC exclusively subgroups

|                                    | PBO n(%)   | LEV n(%)   |

| Myoclonic Responders (Days/Week)   | 8 (25.0%)  | 9 (34.6%)  |

Patients being seizure-free during prospective baseline but with an absence/myoclonic seizure during the treatment period are considered non-responders.

## · Newly occurring seizure types

Some subjects did not experience any episodes of a particular seizure during prospective baseline but presented episodes during the treatment period. Seven patients in the PBO group and 10 in the LEV group had no myoclonic seizures during prospective baseline but presented myoclonic seizures during the treatment period. Likewise, 7 patients in the PBO group and 13 in the LEV group had no absence seizures during prospective baseline but presented absence seizures during the treatment period.

In a further analysis, the set of ITT patients never having experienced myoclonic seizures at any time (in  the  subjects'  life  history  including  combined baseline) before randomization was identified. The numbers and percentages of these subjects experiencing myoclonic seizures for the first time during the treatment period were calculated. An analogous analysis was performed for absence seizures. The results are presented in table X.

## SUPPORTIVE RESULTS FROM STUDY N166 AND OPEN-LABEL FOLLOW-UP STUDY N167

## Study N166



Study  N166  was  intended  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  LEV  as  adjunctive  treatment  of myoclonic seizures at a dose of 3000 mg/day (given twice daily, b.i.d. ) in adolescents (GLYPH&lt;31&gt;12 years) and adults  (GLYPH&lt;31&gt; 65  years)  with  IGE.  It  was  a  16-week  (inclusive  of  4-week  up-titration),  multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on study performed in subjects with  IGE experiencing myoclonic seizures (Type IIB) as their primary seizure type.

A subgroup analysis in N166 was conducted on the PGTC subgroup, defined as all subjects having at least  1  tonic-clonic  seizure  during  the  baseline  and/or  treatment  period.  A  total  of  42  subjects  (20 subjects in the PBO group and 22 subjects in the LEV group) presented tonic-clonic seizures during baseline or treatment. The median percent reduction on tonic-clonic seizure frequency was 48% in the PBO group and 84% in the LEV group. These differences were not statistically significant (p=0.1228).

## Study N167

Study N167 is an ongoing, open-label, long-term follow-up study. The main objective is to evaluate the  safety  and  efficacy  of  LEV  up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  4000  mg/day  (or  80  mg/kg/day  bid  for children and adolescents less than 50 kg). A total of 135 patients with IGE entered N167 from N1057 or N166. These patients who were included from N166 were restricted to those who received LEV and had PGTC seizures either at baseline, during the prior study of participation or in N167.

Mean LEV dose was 2948 mg/day (range 750-4000 mg/day). Most patients remained on the target dose  from  study  N01057,  3000  mg/day,  even  though  dose  modification  was  allowed.  The  primary endpoint is the number and percentage of subjects having at least 6 months of seizure freedom.

All but 4 subjects in the ITT (PGTC) population remained on LEV for at least 6 months. For PGTC seizures, there were 64 subjects (47.4%) seizure free for 6 months at any time and 36 subjects (26.7%) seizure free for 6 months beginning from Visit 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median percent reduction from baseline in PGTC seizure frequency per week during the N167 evaluation period was 82.0%. Overall, 97 subjects (71.9%) were categorized as responders as they had a 50% or greater reduction in PGTC seizure frequency during the evaluation period. When responder rates were evaluated over analysis interval and duration of exposure cohorts, the responder rates were maintained over time during N167. Eleven of 135 subjects (8.1%) had a period of LEV monotherapy of at least 91 days, and the majority remained seizure-free for 90% of their monotherapy periods.

Eight subjects had worsening of seizures ( ≥ 25 % increase in PGTC seizure frequency per week, or days per week with myoclonic or absence seizures). Four of these concerned worsening of myoclonic seizures, two worsening of absence seizures and three worsening of PGTC seizures (in one patients, there was worsening of both PGTC and myoclonic seizures).

## CONCLUSIONS ON CLINICAL EFFICACY

The clinical efficacy programme was based on a pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in patients with IGE with PGTC seizures.

The mean percent reduction in PGTC seizure frequency from the baseline to the treatment period (primary endpoint) was statistically significant in the LEV group (56.5 % in the LEV group vs. 28.2 % for PBO group). The responder rate was also significantly higher in the LEV group (72.2 % vs. 45.2 %). In addition, PGTC seizure freedom was achieved in 24.1 % in the LEV group compared to 7.1 % in the PBO group for the group of completers over the treatment period. The CHMP epilepsy guideline states that the analysis of efficacy should be based on the period when patients are stabilised on a fixed dose of the study drug (i.e. the evaluation period in this case) and not the treatment period (which includes up-titration + evaluation phases). However, the analyses performed showed similar results for both periods. Therefore, the efficacy of LEV as adjunctive therapy for PGTC seizures is considered to be sufficiently demonstrated.

The CHMP noted, however, that the number of children in the main study was very limited as the majority of patients were older than 16 years whilst only one child was below 6 years of age, and 8 children were in the interval 6-12 years. Therefore, the MAH was requested to further justify how the data collected support the treatment of patients aged less than 16 years old in the claimed indication.

Considering the further data submitted, the CHMP concluded that, due to the very limited number of children in Study N01057, a reliable evaluation of safety and efficacy in subjects with PGTC seizures in  this  age  group  is  not  possible.  The  age  limit  of  4  years  proposed  by  the  MAH  is  therefore  not acceptable  to  the  CHMP.    The  Committee  considered  a  lower  age  limit  of  12  years,  which  would restrict  the  new  indication  to  adults  and  adolescents,  consistently  with  the  same  age  groups  as currently  approved  for  Keppra  in  the  treatment  of  myoclonic  seizures.  In  summary,  the  CHMP considered  the  lower  age  limit  for  the  applied  new  indication  to  be  increased  to  12  years,  and recommended  the  corresponding  amendment  to  the  SPC  and  PL.  The  MAH  agreed  with  the conclusions of the CHMP and provided updated Product Information accordingly.

In addition to the above point, the CHMP also noted that an analysis of efficacy within seizure type subgroups indicated no effect of LEV on absence seizures, and newly occurring absence seizure were more frequent in the LEV group (14.9 % vs. 5.7 %). Likewise, 7 patients in the PBO group and 13 in the  LEV group had no absence seizures during prospective baseline but presented absence seizures during the treatment period . The MAH was therefore asked to further discuss this.

In their answer, the MAH performed an analysis of the efficacy within seizure type subgroups for the pivotal  study  N01057.  Considering  the  further  analysis  performed  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  still concluded  that,  in  the  pivotal  study  N01057,  the  results  showed  that  levetiracetam  increased  the proportion  of responders  in  all seizure subtypes  except  for  absence  seizures, indicating that levetiracetam had no effect on the frequency of absence seizures. Therefore, a statement to be added to section  4.4  of  the  SPC  to  this  end  was  provided  by  the  CHMP.  Changes  to  the  proposed  text  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

section  5.1  were  also  recommended  by  the  CHMP.  The  MAH  agreed  with  the  conclusions  of  the CHMP and provided updated Product Information accordingly.

Finally,  the  CHMP  considered  the  analysis  of  responders  showed  a  higher  PBO  response  in  study N01057  (45.2%)  than  has  been  reported  for  add-on  studies  in  partial  epilepsy.  Factors  such  as regression to the mean, and the effects of participating in a clinical trial are likely to contribute to a high PBO response. The MAH was, however, asked to address this issue and discuss in more detail the reasons for the high PBO response.

In their answer, the applicant discussed several factors which are likely to have contributed to the high placebo response in study N01057. The CHMP considered the answer from the MAH satisfactory, and the issue resolved.

## Clinical safety

## PATIENT EXPOSURE

The safety populations included are based on subjects with PGTC seizures. This includes all subjects in N01057 and subsets of subjects in N166 and N167.

- For N01057, the population considered for the safety analysis is the ITT population.
- For N166, the population included corresponds to the subjects who had a PGTC seizure during N166 baseline and/or at any subsequent post-randomization time, either in N166 and/or N167 study participation.
- For N167, the population included is defined as 'all subjects' from studies N01057 and N166 who took at least one dose of LEV in N167 prior to the clinical cut-off date, and who had a PGTC (IIE) seizure at N166 or N01057 Baseline.

This represents a total of 214 subjects, including 164 from N01057 and 50 from N166. Of these, 192 were exposed to LEV and provide on-treatment safety data.

## ADVERSE EVENTS

In  study  N01057,  57  patients  randomized  to  PBO  (67.9%)  and  57  patients  randomized  to  LEV (72.2%)  experienced  one  or  more  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (AEs),  considered  related  to treatment in about one-half of the cases (25 patients randomized to placebo (29.8%) and 31 patients randomized to LEV (39.2%). Most of the events were mild or moderate in intensity.

The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  AEs    (incidence  of  approximately  10%),  were headache, nasopharyngitis,  and  fatigue.  Nasopharyngitis  was  more  common  amongst  patients randomized to LEV (13.9% as compared to 4.8%) but was judged treatment related in only one of the patients randomized to LEV. Irritability and mood swings were the only other AEs in N01057 more common amongst patients  randomized  to  LEV  than  to  PBO  (difference ≥ 3%).  Both  tended  to  be judged  treatment-related  in  patients  randomized  to  LEV.  The  only  treatment-related  AE  occurring more commonly in the PBO group than in the LEV one was nausea.

Somewhat greater proportions in the N166 ITT (PGTC) subset had treatment-emergent AEs (75.0% of patients  randomized  to  PBO  and  92.3%  of  patients  randomized  to  LEV).  Similarly,  approximately one-half had one or more events that were treatment-related (10 patients randomized to PBO [41.7%] and 12 patients randomized to LEV [50.0%]). The majority of the events were mild or moderate in intensity.  Headache  and  fatigue  were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs.  The  most common AEs is given in Table XII.

## SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAES) / DEATHS / OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

One death was reported in N01057, coded as a sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The female patient was found dead in her home, 197 days after having been randomized to LEV. On autopsy, the death was  attributed  to  'poorly  controlled  epilepsy  with  a  grand  mal  seizure.'  The  event  was  judged possibly treatment related by the investigator.

Across all studies (inclusive of the treatment-emergent SAEs in the PBO controlled studies), 26 LEVexposed patients experienced at least one SAE. The most common pertained to seizure-related events (for the most part not treatment related) or were psychiatric in nature (treatment related). An overview of all SAEs is provided in Table XIII.

## Seizure-related SAEs

Eleven  of  the  SAEs  were  seizure-related,  occurring  in  10  patients.  Of  these,  one  was  considered possibly treatment related. One SAE occurred 2 days following the last dose; for the remaining, none resulted  in  discontinuation.  In  1  patient  with  status  epilepticus  and  significant  sequelae  (including coma,  multi-organ  failure,  and  deep  venous  thrombosis),  LEV  was  temporarily  discontinued.  Two additional patients had SAEs that were sequelae of seizures, not treatment related.

## Psychiatric SAEs

## Five patients had SAEs that were psychiatric in nature. All were judged treatment related.

Two were mood disorders: depression followed by a suicide attempt in 1 patient and worsening of preexisting depression that resulted in discontinuation. Two were psychotic disorders: one associated with suicidal ideation and resulted in discontinuation and one described as worsening schizophrenia. One was a behaviour disorder, violent episode, coded as a behaviour disorder.

Of the remaining SAEs, one patient suffered a myocardial infarction that was not treatment-related. One patient  developed  a  diffuse  erythematous  rash  that  required  hospitalization  and  treatment  with intravenous  corticosteroids  and  antihistamines,  with  temporary  treatment  interruption  of  LEV  and, eventually, permanent discontinuation of valproic acid; the event resolved after 24 days.  One woman was reported to be pregnant while down-titrating from LEV. An ultrasound indicated that fetal death occurred  about  3  weeks  after  the  last  dose  and  was  judged  possibly  related  to  treatment  by  the investigator. On follow-up, the final diagnosis of fetal tissues indicated a rare hydropic, degenerating 'chronic' villi.

## CONCLUSIONS ON CLINICAL SAFETY

The spectrum of AEs is similar to that reported previously in studies on partial seizures. A relatively high incidence of CNS-related adverse events and psychiatric adverse events was observed. No new or unexpected safety issues were reported. Section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to reflect the frequency of undesirable effects in the studies.

## 3. PHARMACOVIGILANCE

The CHMP did not require the MAH to submit a risk management plan because the safety profile of Keppra  was  considered  unlikely  to  be  different  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures as compared to the approved epilepsy indications.

## 4. CONCLUSION

On 16 November 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
