Patients with cardiac or cardio-pulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis. If myocarditis is suspected, prompt initiation of a high dose of steroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of myocarditis is established, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be withheld (grade 2 myocarditis) until symptoms resolve and management with corticosteroids is complete or permanently discontinued (grade 3 myocarditis). |

| II/0064 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to add stomatitis to the list of ADRs with a frequency uncommon, to further explain the components of the existing ADR musculoskeletal pain in a footnote and to update safety information based on final results from study CA184143 (A Multi-National, Prospective, Observational Study in Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP (MEA017.11); the Package Leaflet and the RMP have been updated accordingly (version 26.2). In addition, minor changes to improve clarity were introduced in section 5.1 of the SmPC and to the Annex II of the Product Information and minor changes were also made in relation to the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) in the RMP, partly as recommended in conclusion to MEA 036.1. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 03/10/2019 | 17/12/2019 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The safety data for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, treated with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg, with a minimum of 3 year follow up) and enrolled in multi national, prospective, observational study CA184143 (N= 1151) were similar to what has been reported in ipilimumab clinical trials for advanced melanoma. Musculoskeletal pain as an adverse drug reaction of ipilimumab treatment is a composite term which includes back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal discomfort, myalgia, neck pain, pain in extremity, and spinal pain. |

The MAH also provided with this variation application efficacy and safety data from study CA184- 169 in two subgroups: female ≥ 50 years of age and with brain metastases in order to fulfil MEA 015.1. Annex II.D and the RMP (version 14.1) are updated accordingly.

No statistically significant difference in progression free survival (PFS) was observed between the 10 mg/kg and the 3 mg/kg groups. (HR 0.89 with a 95% CI of 0.76, 1.04 and log-rank test P-value = 0.1548). Best overall response rate was similar in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups. Best overall response rate in the 10 mg/kg group was 15.3% (95% CI: 11.8, 19.5) and in the 3 mg/kg group was 12.2% (95% CI: 9.0, 16.0). Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was associated with higher rates of adverse events compared with the 3 mg/kg dose. The frequencies of serious adverse reactions in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups were 37% and 18%, with the 3 most common serious adverse reactions being diarrhea (10.7% vs 5.5%), colitis (8.0% vs 3.0%), and hypophysitis (4.4% versus 1.9%).

Median OS in the subgroup with brain metastases at baseline was 5.67 months at the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg. In addition, patients with ocular melanoma were not included in the CA184-169 clinical trial. However, patients with brain metastases were included in this study, if they were free of neurologic symptoms related to metastatic brain lesions and if they did not require or receive systemic corticosteroid therapy in the 10 days prior to beginning ipilimumab therapy.

| II/0047/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 4.4 to revise the current warning on concurrent administration with vemurafenib to enhance awareness on the potential of hypersensitivity reactions when ipilimumab is used sequentially with vemurafenib as requested by the PRAC following the assessment of PSUSA/00009200/201603. Update of sections 4.8 of the SmPC to amend the frequency of the adverse drug reaction 'Vogt-Konyanagi-Haranda syndrome' from 'not known' to 'rare'. The Package Leaflet and RMP (version 16.1) have been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to implement some editorial changes to sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC to update the dose modification information for hepatotoxicity management guidelines in line with National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) | 01/09/2017 | 08/01/2018 | SmPC | Following a request from the PRAC as part of Yervoy (ipilimumab) PSUSA/00009200/201603, the MAH conducted a review of clinical trials data, post-marketing data and the literature on the risk of sequential administration of Yervoy with vemurafenib. In a Phase 2 trial, the sequential treatment with vemurafenib followed by 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma showed a higher incidence of Grade 3+ skin adverse reactions than with ipilimumab alone. Caution should be used when ipilimumab is administered following prior vemurafenib. In addition, based on a review of the MAH's safety database, the frequency of the adverse drug reaction 'Vogt-Konyanagi-Haranda syndrome' is updated from 'not known' to 'rare'. Finally regarding the grading criteria and numerical threshold criteria for withholding and discontinuation of ipilimumab, sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the ipilimumab SmPC are aligned with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, a standard procedure for drug management. |

C.I.3.z - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Other variation | 30/05/2013   | 31/10/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | In a Phase 1 trial, asymptomatic grade 3 increases in transaminases (ALT/AST > 5 × ULN) and bilirubin (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN) were reported with concurrent administration of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID). Based on these preliminary data, the concurrent administration of ipilimumab and vemurafenib is not recommended. |

| II/0002   | Update of sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC with the results of a pre- and post-natal development study in cynomolgus monkeys conducted at the request of the CHMP (FUM 013). The MAH also took the opportunity to update the product information in line with the QRD template version 8.1 and to make minor corrections to the SmPC. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 24/05/2012   | 21/06/2012   | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL   | At the time of the initial marketing authorisation, the applicant committed to submit the final report for study DN10020, an intravenous study of pre- and post-natal development in cynomolgus monkeys with a 6-month post- natal evaluation (FUM 013). The effects of ipilimumab on prenatal and postnatal development were investigated in a study in cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through delivery, at exposure (AUC) levels either similar to or higher than those associated with the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab. No treatment-related adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third trimester, both ipilimumab groups experienced higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and infant mortality relative to control animals; these findings were dose- dependent. Additionally, developmental external or visceral abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infants exposed in utero to ipilimumab. One female infant had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and one male infant had an imperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal edema. The relationship of these malformations to treatment is unclear. The product information has been updated accordingly.   |
