## 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1.1 Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  Schering-Plough  Europe  submitted  on  1  July  2008  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  Fertavid,  through  the  centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMEA/CHMP on 22 November 2007.

The legal basis for this application refers to Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder N.V. Organon for an authorised medicinal product Puregon (EU/1/96/008/017-031 and EU/1/96/008/038-041) Scientific Advice: The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. Licensing status: The initial product, Puregon, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 3 May 1996. The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP were: Rapporteur: Ian Hudson Co-Rapporteur: Patrick Salmon 1.2 Steps taken for the assessment of the product · The application was received by the EMEA on 2 July 2008. · The procedure started on 27 July 2008. · The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 27 August 2008. The Co-Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 29 August 2008. · During the meeting on 22-25 September 2008, the CHMP agreed on the consolidated List of Questions to be sent to the applicant. The final consolidated List of Questions was sent to the applicant on 25 September 2008. · The  applicant  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CHMP  consolidated  List  of  Questions  on 17 December 2008. · The Rapporteurs circulated the Joint Assessment Report on the applicant's responses to the List of Questions to all CHMP members on 9 January 2009. · During the meeting on 19-22 January 2009, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a Marketing Authorisation to Fertavid on 22 January 2009. The applicant provided the letters of undertaking on the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation on 14 January 2009. 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 2.1 Introduction This application  has  been  submitted  as  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with  Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Puregon  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given access to Module 2 to Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Fertavid medicinal product is identical to the upto-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Puregon. Information on the scientific discussions can be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

found  in  the  Puregon  CHMP  assessment  report  and  in  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report (EPAR).

The  approved  therapeutic  indication  is:  ' In  the  female: Fertavid  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of female infertility in the following clinical situations:

-Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate.

-Controlled  ovarian  hyperstimulation  to  induce  the  development  of  multiple  follicles  in  medically assisted  reproduction  programs  (e.g. in  vitro fertilisation/embryo  transfer  (IVF/ET),  gamete  intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)).

In the male: Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.' Treatment with Fertavid should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems. 2.2 Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Puregon application, the quality data in support of the Fertavid application is identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Puregon dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Puregon  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support  of  the  Fertavid  application  is  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Puregon dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). The CHMP initially raised a concern with regards to the need for an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA). However, it was justified by the applicant that as FSH has a low octanol/water partitioning coefficient, the absorption into fresh water organisms is unlikely and CHMP agreed that an ERA is not needed. 2.4 Clinical aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Puregon application, the clinical data in support of the Fertavid application is identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Puregon dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  initially  raised  some  concerns  regarding  the  procedures  in  place  for  reconciliation  of adverse  events,  quality  control  and  audit  in  pharmacovigilance.  Sufficient  information  has  been provided  during  the  procedure  and  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system,  as described by the applicant in version 1.3 of the Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance system, fulfils  the  legislative  requirements.  However,  the  applicant  committed  to  develop  a  SOP  or  formal procedure for reconciliation of adverse events. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP did not require the marketing authorisation applicant to submit a risk management plan because the reference product Puregon does not have additional risk minimisation activities beyond providing guidance in the prescribing information.

## PSURs

The PSUR cycle of Fertavid will correspond to the one of Puregon and the periodic reports for these two products will be submitted in parallel.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is  an  informed  consent  of the  Puregon  application,  the CHMP  considered by consensus that based on the data submitted, the risk-benefit balance of Fertavid was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

' In the female: Fertavid is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations: -Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate. -Controlled  ovarian  hyperstimulation  to  induce  the  development  of  multiple  follicles  in  medically assisted  reproduction  programs  (e.g. in  vitro fertilisation/embryo  transfer  (IVF/ET),  gamete  intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)). In the male: Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.' · User consultation The  package  leaflet  of  Fertavid  is  identical  to  that  of  Puregon  which  is  currently  undergoing  a readability  test.  The  CHMP  accepted  the  applicant's  commitment  to  update  the  package  leaflet  of Fertavid in accordance with that of Puregon after its update following this user consultation.
