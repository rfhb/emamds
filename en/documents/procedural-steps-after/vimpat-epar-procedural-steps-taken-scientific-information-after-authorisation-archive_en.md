| II/0073/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to include new safety information on cardiac arrhythmias based on safety signal assessment report (SSAR). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to correct the frequency of the adverse event 'coordination abnormal' in section 4.8 of the SmPC from 'common' to 'uncommon' as the frequency of this ADR was erroneously classified as 'common' due to rounded ADR percentages in the initial SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 13.1 has also been submitted.

However, there is some concern for serious arrhythmias with IV administration. In eight cases, the serious arrhythmia occurred during or in close temporal proximity to the infusion. Serious cardiac arrhythmias during or shortly after infusion of lacosamide may actually be especially problematic in non-status epilepticus patients since they are not necessarily monitored as rigorously as patients with refractory status epilepticus, and there may not be the same readiness to treat such life-threatening events outside the intensive care unit. Therefore, in order to ensure adequate detection of serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients not treated in the intensive care unit, serious cardiac arrhythmias is added to section 4.2 of the SmPC: Initiation of lacosamide with a loading dose: 'It |

| Update of sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update clinical efficacy and safety data in the paediatric population with the results from study SP0969: a phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in subjects with epilepsy ≥4 years to <17 years of age with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures; 3 new ADRs (nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, and pyrexia) have been added based on the results of the above mentioned study; Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the pharmacokinetic data in the paediatric population based on results from the CL0430 population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses; Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the incidence of decreased appetite, lethargy, and abnormal behaviour in the paediatric population based on results from the updated safety data for Pool SPX-1 with clinical cut-off date of 01 November 2016. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce some editorial changes in the PI. The MAH also took the opportunity to revise Annex A as requested. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to   | PL   | results were in line with the known efficacy from studies conducted in adult population. These efficacy results in the pediatric population were reflected in section 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. Based on the safety results, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis and pyrexia were added in section 4.8 as new adverse reactions. The incidences of already listed adverse reactions in the paediatric population were updated. The analysis of updated data in Pool SPX-1 yielded results that were similar to those reported in the initial paediatric submission, with the following exceptions: decreased incidence of convulsion, decreased appetite, lethargy, and abnormal behaviour. Results from the CL0430 population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that no significant influence of race, ethnicity, sex, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on the clearance of lacosamide was identified. The results were reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.   |

| Extension of Indication to extend the indication for Vimpat to monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adolescents and children aged 4 to less than 16 years with epilepsy. For the treatment initiation pack, the use was only extended to adolescents weighting 50 kg or more as it is not suitable for the weight-based dosing regimen recommended for patients weighing less. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated including the addition of a warning of the potential for electro-clinical worsening in specific epileptic syndromes. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance. Moreover, section 6.3 of the SmPC of the syrup is updated to reflect the extension of shelf life after first opening from 4 weeks to 2 months. Furthermore, a 10 mL dosing syringe for the 200 ml and the 465 ml syrup bottles is introduced as additional dosing device for paediatric population; section 6.5 of the SmPC of the syrup presentations is updated accordingly. Finally, the PI was also brought in line with the latest QRD template version and editorial amendments were made in several sections. The MAH also took the opportunity to introduce a combined SmPC for the film coated tablets. Moreover, updated RMP version 12.2 has been agreed.

Lacosamide should be administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. Symptoms observed after an accidental or intentional overdose of lacosamide are primarily associated with CNS and gastrointestinal system. Reactions reported after an intake of more than 800 mg are dizziness, nausea, vomiting, seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, shock and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have been reported in patients following an intake of acute single overdose of |

| II/0050 | Update of section 4.9 of the SmPC following a case report of cardiac arrest upon overdose and a MAH cumulative review of cardiac disorders or mortality following acute lacosamide overdose. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. Furthermore, minor editorial changes are introduced throughout the PI. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/10/2014 | 06/02/2015 | SmPC and PL | In clinical trials, the types of adverse events experienced by patients exposed to supratherapeutic doses were not clinically different from those of patients administered recommended doses of lacosamide. Following doses of 1,200 mg/day, symptoms related to the central nervous system (e.g. dizziness) and the gastrointestinal system (e.g. nausea, vomiting) were observed and resolved with dose adjustments. The highest reported overdose for lacosamide was 12,000 mg taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs. The subject was initially comatose with AV block and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae. In post-marketing, following acute single overdoses ranging between 1,000 mg and 12,000 mg, seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus) and cardiac conduction disorders were observed. Fatal cardiac arrest was reported after an acute overdose of 7,000 mg of lacosamide in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors. |

Some of these cases occurred in after start of lacosamide treatment or resolved after treatment stopped. Therefore, the CHMP considered that it was not possible to exclude that lacosamide has caused these events and consequently agreed to add these possible side effects to the product information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Consequently, the Product Information was updated to include agranulocytosis as an adverse event in section 4.8 of the SmPC to reflect the potential risk of severe forms of lowered number of white blood cells in the blood stream. Due to the limited available data, the frequency could not be determined and was therefore indicated as being unknown. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance.   |

The results from these additional studies showed that there is no evidence for a specific interaction of lacosamide with CRMP-2 as being part of the mode of action for lacosamide. Based on these new findings, section 5.1 of the SPC has been amended with deletion of the CRMP-2 related mode of action statement. |

| II/0007 | Update of Section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions) of the SPC based on the result of a new in vivo drug interaction study with midazolam. The MAH has taken the opportunity to make an editorial change in section 4.6 of the SPC. In addition, minor modifications were introduced in the labelling. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Labelling | 19/11/2009 | 21/12/2009 | SmPC and Labelling     | A new in vivo pharmacokinetic drug interaction study with oral midazolam was submitted in this variation application. This study was a single-site, open-label, non-randomised phase 1 trial, including 36 healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of single and repeated administration of lacosamide on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. Apart from a slight increased Cmax of midazolam after repeated dose administration of lacosamide, no change from baseline in the plasma concentration versus time profile was observed during the co-administration of lacosamide. The results of this drug interaction study with midazolan showed that lacosamide does not affect CYP3A4 in vivo to an extent that is clinically relevant. |
