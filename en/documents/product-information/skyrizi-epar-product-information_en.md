## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Plaque psoriasis

Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Skyrizi, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

This medicinal product is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Skyrizi is indicated.

## Posology

The recommended dose is 150 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter (either as two 75 mg pre-filled syringe injections or one 150 mg pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe injection).

Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment. Some plaque psoriasis patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks.

## Missed dose

If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be resumed at the regular scheduled time.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). There is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

No specific studies were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab. These conditions are generally not expected to have any significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of risankizumab in children and adolescents aged 5 to less than 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

There is no relevant use of risankizumab in children aged below 6 years for the indication of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or in children aged below 5 years for the indication of psoriatic arthritis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Overweight patients

No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).

## Method of administration

Skyrizi is administered by subcutaneous injection.

The injection should be administered in the thigh or abdomen. Patients should not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated, or affected by psoriasis.

Patients may self-inject Skyrizi after training in subcutaneous injection technique. Patients should be instructed to read the 'Instructions for use' provided in the package leaflet before administration.

Administration of Skyrizi in the upper, outer arm may only be performed by a healthcare professional or caregiver.

Skyrizi 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

Two pre-filled syringes should be injected for the full 150 mg dose. The two injections should be administered at different anatomic locations.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection.

In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Patients treated with risankizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy for the infection, the patient should be closely monitored and risankizumab should not be administered until the infection resolves.

## Tuberculosis

Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunisations

Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment (see section 5.2).

## Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with use of risankizumab (see section 4.8). If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of risankizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

## Excipients with known effect

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Risankizumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. Interactions between risankizumab and inhibitors, inducers, or substrates of medicinal product metabolising enzymes are not expected, and no dose adjustment is needed (see section 5.2).

## Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy

The safety and efficacy of risankizumab in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics or phototherapy, have not been evaluated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of risankizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of risankizumab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether risankizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which decreases to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. A decision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain from risankizumab therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of risankizumab therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

The effect of risankizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Risankizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections (13.0% in psoriasis).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions for risankizumab from clinical studies (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class and are based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

The rate of infections was 75.5 events per 100 subject-years from the psoriasis clinical studies and 43.0 events per 100 subject-years from the psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, including long-term exposure to risankizumab. The majority of cases were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of risankizumab. The rate of serious infections was 1.7 events per 100 subject-years from the psoriasis studies and 2.6 events per 100 subject-years from the psoriatic arthritis studies (see section 4.4).

## Immunogenicity

For subjects treated with risankizumab at the recommended clinical dose for up to 52 weeks in psoriasis clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were detected in 24% (263/1 079) and 14% (150/1 079) of evaluated subjects, respectively. For subjects exposed to long term treatment of risankizumab in the extension study, the immunogenicity profile observed up to 204 weeks of treatment was consistent compared to the first 52 weeks of treatment.

For most subjects with psoriasis, antibodies to risankizumab including neutralising antibodies were not associated with changes in clinical response or safety. Among the few subjects (approximately 1%; 7/1 000 at week 16 and 6/598 at week 52) with high antibody titres (&gt;128), clinical response appeared to be reduced. The incidence of injection site reactions is numerically higher in the anti-drug antibodypositive groups compared with anti-drug antibody-negative groups over short-term (16 weeks: 2.7% vs 1.3%) and longer-term treatment (52 weeks: 5.0% vs 3.3%). The injection site reactions were all mild to moderate in severity, none were serious, and none led to discontinuation of risankizumab.

For subjects treated with risankizumab at the recommended clinical dose for up to 28 weeks in psoriatic arthritis clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were detected in 12.1% (79/652) and 0% (0/652) of evaluated subjects, respectively. Antibodies to risankizumab were not associated with changes in clinical response or safety for psoriatic arthritis.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with risankizumab was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with plaque psoriasis.

## Elderly

There is limited safety information in subjects aged ≥65 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC18

## Mechanism of action

Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL12 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In a study of subjects with psoriasis, expression of genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis was decreased in the skin after single doses of risankizumab. Reductions in epidermal thickness, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and expression of psoriatic disease markers were also observed in psoriatic lesions.

In a study of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline was observed at week 24 in IL-23 and IL-17-associated biomarkers, including serum IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 following treatment with risankizumab 150 mg subcutaneously at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Plaque Psoriasis

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab was assessed in 2 109 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in four multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies (ULTIMMA-1, ULTIMMA-2,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IMMHANCE, and IMMVENT). Enrolled subjects were 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥10%, a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of ≥3 in the overall assessment (plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling) of psoriasis on a severity scale of 0 to 4, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12, and who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

Overall, subjects had a median baseline PASI score of 17.8, a median BSA of 20.0%, and a median baseline DLQI score of 13.0. Baseline sPGA score was severe in 19.3% of subjects and moderate in 80.7% of subjects. A total of 9.8% of study subjects had a history of diagnosed psoriatic arthritis.

Across all studies, 30.9% of subjects were naïve to any systemic therapy (including non-biologic and biologic), 38.1% had received prior phototherapy or photochemotherapy, 48.3% had received prior non-biologic systemic therapy, 42.1% had received prior biologic therapy, and 23.7% had received at least one anti-TNF alpha agent for the treatment of psoriasis. Patients who completed these studies and other Phase 2/3 studies had the opportunity to enrol in an open-label extension study, LIMMITLESS.

## ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2

ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 enrolled 997 subjects (598 randomised to risankizumab 150 mg, 199 to ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg [according to baseline weight], and 200 to placebo). Subjects received treatment at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The two co-primary endpoints in ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 were the proportion of subjects who achieved 1) PASI 90 response and 2) sPGA score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0 or 1) at week 16 versus placebo. The results for the co-primary and other endpoints are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1.

Anxiety and depression, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), improved in the risankizumab group at week 16 compared with the placebo group.

## Maintenance of response

In an integrated analysis of subjects receiving risankizumab in ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 for PASI 100 responders at week 16, 79.8% (206/258) of the subjects who continued on risankizumab maintained the response at week 52. For PASI 90 responders at week 16, 88.4% (398/450) of subjects maintained the response at week 52.

Of the patients who received risankizumab in ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2, 525 continued to receive risankizumab every 12 weeks in LIMMITLESS. Of these, 376 (71.6%) completed an additional 252 weeks of open-label treatment. Among subjects remaining in the study, improvements achieved with risankizumab in rates of PASI 90 and sPGA of clear or almost clear at week 52 were maintained through week 304.

Of the patients who received ustekinumab in ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2, 172 received risankizumab every 12 weeks in LIMMITLESS. Of these, 116 (67.4%) completed the study, including 252 weeks of open-label risankizumab treatment and end of study follow-up. Among subjects remaining in the study, rates of PASI 90 and sPGA response of clear or almost clear increased from week 52 through week 76 and were then maintained through week 304.

Figures 2 and 3 show the response rates for PASI 90 and sPGA of clear or almost clear, respectively, in subjects who completed 252 weeks of open-label treatment in LIMMITLESS.

Improvements in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI 0 or 1) were maintained in patients receiving continuous risankizumab treatment through week 304 in the open label extension study LIMMITLESS.

The safety profile of risankizumab with more than 5 years of exposure was consistent with the profile observed up to 16 weeks.

## IMMHANCE

IMMHANCE enrolled 507 subjects (407 randomised to risankizumab 150 mg and 100 to placebo). Subjects received treatment at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects who were originally on risankizumab and had a sPGA of clear or almost clear at week 28 were re-randomised to continue risankizumab every 12 weeks through week 88 (with follow-up 16 weeks after last risankizumab dose) or have treatment withdrawn.

At week 16, risankizumab was superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of sPGA of clear or almost clear (83.5% risankizumab vs 7.0% placebo) and PASI 90 (73.2% risankizumab vs 2.0% placebo).

Of the 31 subjects from the IMMHANCE study with latent tuberculosis (TB) who did not receive prophylaxis during the study, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 55 weeks on risankizumab.

Among subjects with sPGA of clear or almost clear at week 28 in IMMHANCE, 81.1% (90/111) of subjects re-randomised to continued treatment with risankizumab maintained this response at week 104 compared with 7.1% (16/225) who were re-randomised to withdrawal from risankizumab. Of these subjects, 63.1% (70/111) of subjects re-randomised to continued treatment with risankizumab achieved a sPGA clear response at week 104 compared with 2.2% (5/225) who were re-randomised to withdrawal from risankizumab.

Among subjects who achieved sPGA of clear or almost clear at week 28 and relapsed to sPGA of moderate or severe following withdrawal from risankizumab, 83.7% (128/153) regained sPGA of clear or almost clear after 16 weeks of retreatment. Loss of sPGA of clear or almost clear was observed as early as 12 weeks after a missed dose. Of those subjects who were re-randomised to withdraw from treatment, 80.9% (182/225) relapsed, and the median time to relapse was 295 days. No characteristics were identified to predict the time to loss of response or likelihood of regaining response at the individual patient level.

## IMMVENT

IMMVENT enrolled 605 subjects (301 randomised to risankizumab and 304 to adalimumab). Subjects randomised to risankizumab received 150 mg of treatment at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects randomised to adalimumab received 80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at week 1, and 40 mg every other week through week 15. Starting at week 16, subjects who were receiving adalimumab continued or switched treatment based on response:

- &lt;PASI 50 were switched to risankizumab
- PASI 50 to &lt;PASI 90 were re-randomised to either continue adalimumab or switch to risankizumab
- PASI 90 continued to receive adalimumab

Results are presented in Table 4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In 270 subjects who switched from adalimumab to risankizumab without a washout period, the safety profile of risankizumab was similar to that in subjects who initiated risankizumab after washout of any prior systemic therapies.

## Plaque psoriasis involving the scalp or genital area

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab was assessed in a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (UNLIMMITED) that enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis (UNLIMMITED-S), defined as Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) ≥12, scalp Investigator Global Assessment (scalp IGA) ≥3, and ≥30% of the scalp affected, or moderate to severe genital psoriasis (UNLIMMITED-G), defined as static Physician's Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA-G) ≥3 at baseline. All subjects had BSA ≥1% and sPGA ≥3 at baseline.

In UNLIMMITED, subjects were randomised to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or placebo subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4. Starting at week 16, all subjects received risankizumab 150 mg every 12 weeks until the last dose at week 40.

## Scalp area (UNLIMMITED-S)

UNLIMMITED-S enrolled 105 subjects. Baseline BSA involvement was ≥10% for 61.9% of the subjects and &lt;10% for 38.1% of the subjects. Mean baseline BSA involvement was 16.8%. At baseline, 76.2% of subjects had sPGA = 3 and 23.8% had sPGA = 4.

At baseline, 54.3% of subjects were naïve to any systemic therapy (including non-biologic and biologic), 0% of subjects had received prior phototherapy, 15.2% had received prior non-biologic systemic therapy, and 37.1% had received prior biologic therapy.

The results for the primary and key secondary endpoints are presented in Table 6.

UNLIMMITED-G enrolled 109 subjects. Baseline BSA involvement was ≥10% for 63.3% of the subjects and &lt;10% for 36.7% of the subjects. Mean baseline BSA involvement was 17.2%. At baseline, 80.7% of subjects had sPGA = 3 and 19.3% had sPGA = 4.

At baseline, 61.5% of subjects were naïve to any systemic therapy (including non-biologic and biologic), 2.8% of subjects had received prior phototherapy, 16.5% had received prior non-biologic systemic therapy, and 25.7% had received prior biologic therapy.

The results for the primary and all secondary endpoints are presented in Table 7.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Risankizumab has been shown to improve signs and symptoms, physical function, health-related quality of life, and the proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

The safety and efficacy of risankizumab were assessed in 1 407 subjects with active PsA in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (964 in KEEPSAKE1 and 443 in KEEPSAKE2).

Subjects in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months based on the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR), a median duration of PsA of 4.9 years at baseline, ≥ 5 tender joints and ≥ 5 swollen joints, and active plaque psoriasis or nail psoriasis at baseline. 55.9% of subjects had ≥ 3% BSA with active plaque psoriasis. 63.4% and 27.9% of subjects had enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively. In KEEPSAKE1, where nail psoriasis was further assessed, 67.3% had nail psoriasis.

In both studies, subjects were randomised to receive risankizumab 150 mg or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 16. Starting from week 28, all subjects received risankizumab every 12 weeks.

In KEEPSAKE1, all subjects had a previous inadequate response or intolerance to non-biologic DMARD therapy and were biologic naïve. In KEEPSAKE2, 53.5% of subjects had a previous inadequate response or intolerance to non-biologic DMARD therapy and 46.5% of subjects had a previous inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therapy.

In both studies, 59.6% of subjects were receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), 11.6% were receiving concomitant non-biologic DMARDs other than MTX, and 28.9% were receiving risankizumab monotherapy.

## Clinical response

Treatment with risankizumab resulted in significant improvement in measures of disease activity compared with placebo at week 24. For both studies, the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24. The key efficacy results are shown in Table 8.

## Response over time

In KEEPSAKE1, a greater ACR20 response was observed in the risankizumab group compared to placebo as early as week 4 (25.7%) and the treatment difference continued over time to week 24 (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Percent of subjects achieving ACR20 responses in study KEEPSAKE1 through week 24

<!-- image -->

A greater ACR20 response for risankizumab versus placebo was seen as early as week 4 in 19.6% of subjects in KEEPSAKE2.

Responses observed in risankizumab groups were similar regardless of concomitant non-biologic DMARD use, number of prior non-biologic DMARDs, age, gender, race, and BMI. In KEEPSAKE2, responses were seen regardless of prior biologic therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile of risankizumab with up to 52 weeks of exposure was consistent with the profile observed up to 24 weeks.

In both studies, the proportion of subjects achieving modified PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) at week 24 was higher in subjects receiving risankizumab compared with placebo. In addition, subjects receiving risankizumab achieved greater improvement in Disease Activity Score (28 joints) using CRP (DAS28-CRP) compared with placebo at week 24. Improvements were maintained through week 52 for PsARC and DAS28-CRP.

Treatment with risankizumab resulted in improvements in individual ACR components, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), pain assessment, and high-sensitivity Creactive protein (hsCRP) compared with placebo.

Treatment with risankizumab resulted in statistically significant improvement in the skin manifestations of psoriasis in subjects with PsA.

Treatment with risankizumab resulted in statistically significant improvement in the modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) and the 5-point Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scores in subjects with nail psoriasis at baseline (67.3%) in KEEPSAKE1. This improvement was maintained through week 52 (see Table 9).

## Radiographic response

In KEEPSAKE1, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as the change in modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at week 24, compared with baseline. The mTSS score was modified for PsA by addition of hand distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. At week 24, the mean progression of structural damage with risankizumab (mean mTSS 0.23) compared with placebo (mean mTSS 0.32) was not statistically significant. At week 24, the proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression (defined as a change from baseline in mTSS ≤ 0) was higher

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with risankizumab (92.4%) compared with placebo (87.7%). This response was maintained through week 52.

## Physical function and health related quality of life

In both studies, subjects treated with risankizumab showed statistically significant improvement from baseline in physical function as assessed by HAQ-DI at week 24 (KEEPSAKE1 (-0.31) compared with placebo (-0.11) (p ≤0.001)), (KEEPSAKE2 (-0.22) compared with placebo (-0.05) (p ≤0.001)). At week 24, a greater proportion of subjects achieved a clinically meaningful reduction of at least 0.35 in HAQ-DI score from baseline in the risankizumab group compared with placebo. Improvements in physical function were maintained through week 52.

In both studies, subjects treated with risankizumab demonstrated significant improvements in the SF-36 V2 physical component summary scores and in FACIT-Fatigue scores at week 24, compared with placebo, with improvements maintained through week 52.

At baseline, psoriatic spondylitis was reported in 19.6% (7.9% diagnosed by radiograph or MRI) of subjects in KEEPSAKE1 and 19.6% (5% diagnosed by radiograph or MRI) of subjects in KEEPSAKE2. Subjects with clinically assessed psoriatic spondylitis who were treated with risankizumab showed improvements from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores compared with placebo at week 24. Improvements were maintained through week 52. There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of risankizumab in subjects with radiograph- or MRI-confirmed ankylosing spondylitis-like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of subjects studied.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Skyrizi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab was similar between subjects with plaque psoriasis and subjects with psoriatic arthritis.

## Absorption

Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure across dose ranges of 18 to 300 mg and 0.25 to 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously, and 200 to 1 200 mg and 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously.

Following subcutaneous dosing of risankizumab, peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 3-14 days after dosing with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 89%. With dosing of 150 mg at week 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, estimated steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations are 12 and 2 µg/mL, respectively.

Bioequivalence was demonstrated between a single risankizumab 150 mg injection and two risankizumab 75 mg injections in pre-filled syringe. Bioequivalence was also demonstrated between risankizumab 150 mg pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

The mean (±standard deviation) steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of risankizumab was 11.4 (±2.7) L in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis, indicating that the distribution of risankizumab is primarily confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces.

## Biotransformation

Therapeutic IgG monoclonal antibodies are typically degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. Risankizumab is not expected to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Elimination

The mean (±standard deviation) systemic clearance (CL) of risankizumab was 0.3 (±0.1) L/day in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. The mean terminal elimination half-life of risankizumab ranged from 28 to 29 days in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis.

As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is not expected to be filtered by glomerular filtration in the kidneys or to be excreted as an intact molecule in the urine.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with approximately dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in the evaluated dose ranges of 18 to 300 mg or 0.25 to 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration in healthy subjects or subjects with psoriasis.

## Interactions

An interaction study was conducted in subjects with plaque psoriasis to assess the effect of repeated administration of risankizumab on the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) sensitive probe substrates. The exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A substrate) following risankizumab treatment were comparable to their exposures prior to risankizumab treatment, indicating no clinically meaningful interactions through these enzymes.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that risankizumab exposure was not impacted by concomitant treatment used by some subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis during the clinical studies.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab in paediatric subjects has not been established.

## Elderly

Of the 2 234 subjects with plaque psoriasis exposed to risankizumab, 243 were 65 years or older and 24 subjects were 75 years or older. Of the 1 542 subjects with psoriatic arthritis exposed to risankizumab, 246 were 65 years or older and 34 subjects were 75 years or older. No overall differences in risankizumab exposure were observed between older and younger subjects who received risankizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with renal or hepatic impairment

No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance, or hepatic function markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin) did not have a meaningful impact on risankizumab clearance in subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.

As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and is not expected to undergo metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes or renal elimination.

## Body weight

Risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases which may result in reduced efficacy in subjects with high body weight (&gt;130 kg). However, this observation is based on a limited number of subjects. No dose adjustment based on body weight is currently recommended.

## Gender or race

The clearance of risankizumab was not significantly influenced by gender or race in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. No clinically meaningful differences in risankizumab exposure were observed in Chinese or Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects in a clinical pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies including safety pharmacology evaluations, and an enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (producing exposures of about 70 times the clinical exposure at maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]).

Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with risankizumab. In a 26-week chronic toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (about 70 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD), there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed and no adverse immunotoxicity or cardiovascular effects were noted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection.

In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Patients treated with risankizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy for the infection, the patient should be closely monitored and risankizumab should not be administered until the infection resolves.

## Tuberculosis

Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

## Immunisations

Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment (see section 5.2).

## Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with use of risankizumab (see section 4.8). If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of risankizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbate

This medicinal product contains 2 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 600 mg dose and 4 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1 200 mg dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Risankizumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. Interactions between risankizumab and inhibitors, inducers, or substrates of medicinal product metabolising enzymes are not expected and no dose adjustment is needed (see section 5.2).

## Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy

The safety and efficacy of risankizumab in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, have not been evaluated.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of risankizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of risankizumab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether risankizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which decreases to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. A decision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain from risankizumab therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of risankizumab therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

The effect of risankizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Risankizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Psoriasis

## Infections

Over the entire psoriasis programme including long-term exposure to risankizumab, the rate of infections was 75.5 events per 100 subject-years. The majority of cases were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of risankizumab. The rate of serious infections was 1.7 events per 100 subject-years (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Crohn's disease

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with Crohn's disease treated with risankizumab was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients across indications.

## Infections

The rate of infections in the pooled data from the 12-week induction studies was 83.3 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 600 mg intravenously compared to 117.7 events per 100 subject-years in placebo. The rate of serious infections was 3.4 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 600 mg intravenously compared to 16.7 events per 100 subject-years in placebo (see section 4.4).

The rate of infections in the 52-week maintenance study was 57.7 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 76.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction. The rate of serious infections was 6.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 5.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction (see section 4.4).

## Ulcerative colitis

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with risankizumab was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients across indications.

## Infections

The rate of infections in the pooled data from the 12-week induction study was 78.3 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 1 200 mg intravenously compared to 74.2 events per 100 subject-years in placebo. The rate of serious infections was 3.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 1 200 mg intravenously compared to 5.4 events per 100 subject-years in placebo (see section 4.4).

The rate of infections in the 52-week maintenance study was 67.4 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and 56.5 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 64.6 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction. The rate of serious infections was 1.1 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and 0.6 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 2.3 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction (see section 4.4).

## Immunogenicity

For subjects with Crohn's disease treated with risankizumab at the recommended intravenous induction and subcutaneous maintenance doses for up to 64 weeks in CD clinical trials, treatmentemergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3.4% (2/58) and 0% (0/58) of evaluated subjects, respectively.

For subjects with ulcerative colitis treated with risankizumab at the recommended intravenous induction and subcutaneous maintenance doses (180 mg or 360 mg) for up to 64 weeks in ulcerative colitis clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were detected in 8.9% (8/90) and 6.7% (6/90) for the 180 mg subcutaneous dose, or 4.4% (4/91) and 2.2% (2/91) for the 360 mg subcutaneous dose, of evaluated subjects, respectively.

Antibodies to risankizumab including neutralizing antibodies were not associated with changes in clinical response or safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V .

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC18

## Mechanism of action

Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL12 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In a study of subjects with psoriasis, expression of genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis was decreased in the skin after single doses of risankizumab. Reductions in epidermal thickness, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and expression of psoriatic disease markers were also observed in psoriatic lesions.

In a Phase 2 study of subjects with Crohn's disease, expression of genes associated with the IL23/Th17 axis were decreased in gut tissue after multiple doses of risankizumab. Reductions in faecal calprotectin (FCP), serum C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-22 were also observed after multiple doses in Phase 3 induction studies in Crohn's patients. Decreases in FCP, CRP and serum IL-22 were maintained out to week 52 of the maintenance study.

In a Phase 2b/3 study of subjects with ulcerative colitis, statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline was observed in the inflammatory biomarkers, FCP and CRP, and in the IL-23 pathway-associated biomarker, serum IL-22, at week 12 of the induction study. Decreases in FCP, CRP and serum IL-22 were maintained out to week 52 of the maintenance study.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Crohn's disease

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab were assessed in 1 419 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies. Enrolled subjects were 16 years of age or older with a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 220 to 450, an average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥4 and/or average daily abdominal pain score (APS) ≥2, and a Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) of ≥6, or ≥4 for isolated ileal disease, excluding the narrowing component and confirmed by a central reviewer.

There were two 12-week intravenous induction studies (ADVANCE and MOTIVATE), which included a 12-week extension period for subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response (≥ 30% decrease in SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in APS and both not worse than baseline) at week 12. ADVANCE and MOTIVATE were followed by a 52-week randomised withdrawal study of subcutaneous maintenance treatment (FORTIFY) that enrolled subjects with SF/APS clinical response to intravenous induction treatment, representing at least 64 weeks of therapy.

## ADVANCE and MOTIVATE

In studies ADVANCE and MOTIVATE, subjects were randomised to receive risankizumab at either 600 mg (recommended dose), 1 200 mg, or placebo, at week 0, week 4, and week 8.

In ADVANCE, 58% (491/850) subjects had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more biologic therapies (prior biologic failure), and 42% (359/850) had failed or were intolerant to therapy with conventional therapies but not biologic therapies (without prior biologic failure). In ADVANCE, among the subjects without prior biologic failure, (87%) 314/359 were naïve to biologic therapy and the remaining 13% had received a biologic but never failed or demonstrated intolerance. All patients in MOTIVATE had prior biologic failure.

In both studies, a greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieved the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission at week 12 and endoscopic response at week 12 compared to placebo. Enhanced SF/APS clinical response and clinical remission were significant as early as week 4 in subjects treated with risankizumab and continued to improve through week 12 (Table 2).

At week 12, a higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieved a decrease of at least 100 points in baseline CDAI compared to placebo (ADVANCE, risankizumab =60%, placebo=37%, p&lt;0.001; MOTIVATE, risankizumab =60%, placebo=30%, p&lt;0.001).

At week 12, a higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieved both enhanced SF/APS clinical response and endoscopic response at week 12 compared to placebo (ADVANCE, risankizumab =31%, placebo=8%, p&lt;0.001; MOTIVATE, risankizumab =21%, placebo=7%, p&lt;0.001).

The results for the co-primary endpoints for the subgroups (without allowing for multiplicity) of subjects with and without prior biologic failure are presented in Table 3.

In ADVANCE, a higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab with and without prior biologic failure achieved CDAI&lt;150 compared to placebo (With prior biologic failure, risankizumab =42%, placebo=26%; Without prior biologic failure, risankizumab =49%, placebo=23%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CD-related hospitalisations

Rates of CD-related hospitalisations through week 12 were lower in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo (ADVANCE, risankizumab =3%, placebo=12%, p&lt;0.001; MOTIVATE, risankizumab =3%, placebo=11%, p≤0.01).

## FORTIFY

The maintenance study FORTIFY evaluated 462 subjects with SF/APS clinical response to 12 weeks of risankizumab intravenous induction treatment in studies ADVANCE and MOTIVATE. Subjects were randomised to continue to receive a maintenance regimen of risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously (recommended dose), or risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks, or to withdraw from risankizumab induction and receive placebo subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks.

The co-primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 52 and, endoscopic response at week 52. Co-primary endpoints were also measured in subjects with and without prior biologic failure (see Table 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Deep remission (clinical remission and endoscopic remission) at week 52 was observed at higher rates in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously / risankizumab subcutaneously compared to subjects who received risankizumab intravenously/placebo subcutaneously (28% vs. 10%, respectively, nominal p&lt;0.001).

At week 52, a higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously / risankizumab subcutaneously achieved CDAI &lt; 150 compared to risankizumab intravenously /placebo subcutaneously (52% vs. 41%, respectively, nominal p≤0.01). A higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously / risankizumab subcutaneously achieved a decrease of at least 100 points in baseline CDAI score compared to subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously /placebo subcutaneously (62% vs. 48%, respectively, nominal p≤ 0.01).

91 subjects who did not demonstrate SF/APS clinical response 12 weeks after risankizumab induction in studies ADVANCE and MOTIVATE received subcutaneous 360 mg dose of risankizumab at week 12 and week 20. Of these subjects, 64% (58/91) achieved SF/APS clinical response at week 24; 33 of the subjects achieving SF/APS clinical response enrolled in FORTIFY and continued receiving risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks. Among these subjects, 55% (18/33) achieved clinical remission and 45% (15/33) achieved endoscopic response at week 52.

During FORTIFY, 30 subjects had loss of response to risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously treatment and received rescue treatment with risankizumab (1 200 mg intravenous single dose, followed by 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks). Of these subjects, 57% (17/30) achieved SF/APS clinical response at week 52. In addition, 20% (6/30) and 34% (10/29) of subjects achieved clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 52, respectively.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Improvement in fatigue was evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale. Work productivity was assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment CD (WPAI-CD) Questionnaire.

At week 12 of ADVANCE and MOTIVATE, subjects treated with risankizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in IBDQ total score, all IBDQ domain scores (bowel symptoms, systemic function, emotional function, and social function), SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary Score, FACIT-Fatigue and WPAI-CD compared to placebo. For WPAI-CD greater reductions in impairment while working, overall work impairment, and activity impairment were demonstrated in ADVANCE; and greater reduction in activity impairment was demonstrated in MOTIVATE. These improvements were maintained in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/ risankizumab subcutaneously in FORTIFY through week 52.

## Ulcerative colitis

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab was assessed in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies. Enrolled subjects were ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age with adapted Mayo Score (aMS) of 5 to 9 (using the Mayo scoring system, excluding Physician's Global Assessment) with an endoscopic subscore (ES) of 2 or 3 on screening endoscopy, confirmed by central review.

The 12-week intravenous induction study (INSPIRE) included a 12-week extension period for subjects who did not achieve clinical response [defined as a decrease from baseline in the aMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline, and a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1] at Week 12. INSPIRE was followed by a 52-week randomised withdrawal study of subcutaneous maintenance treatment (COMMAND) that enrolled subjects with clinical response to 12 weeks of risankizumab intravenous induction treatment, representing at least 64 weeks of therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## INSPIRE

In study INSPIRE, 975 subjects were randomised and received either risankizumab 1 200 mg or placebo, at week 0, week 4, and week 8.

In INSPIRE, 52% (503/975) of subjects had failed (inadequate response or intolerance) one or more biologics therapies, JAK inhibitors, and/or S1P receptor modulators. Of these 503 subjects, 488 (97%) failed biologics and 90 (18%) failed JAK inhibitors.

Enrolled subjects were permitted to use a stable dose of oral corticosteroids (up to 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), immunomodulators, and aminosalicylates. At baseline in INSPIRE, 36% of subjects received corticosteroids, 17% of subjects received immunomodulators and 73% of subjects received aminosalicylates. Patient disease activity was moderate (aMS ≤7) in 58% of subjects and severe (aMS &gt;7) in 42% of subjects.

In INSPIRE, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per aMS [defined as stool frequency subscore (SFS) ≤ 1, and not greater than baseline, RBS = 0, and ES ≤ 1 without evidence of friability] at week 12 compared to placebo (Table 5). Results of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints are listed in Table 5.

Clinical disease activity and symptoms

The partial adapted Mayo score (paMS) is composed of SFS and RBS. Clinical response per paMS is defined as a decrease of ≥1 point and ≥30% from Baseline and a decrease in RBS ≥1 or an absolute RBS ≤1. The results of clinical response per paMS over time in INSPIRE are shown in Figure 1. Onset of efficacy was rapid with a greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieving clinical response as early as week 4 compared to placebo (52% vs 31%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

A significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo had no abdominal pain (36% vs 26%, respectively, p &lt; 0.01) and no bowel urgency (44% vs 28%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001) at week 12.

## Other UC Symptoms

Number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was reduced in a significantly greater amount in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (change from baseline in risankizumab = -3.8, placebo = -2.2, p = 0.00003).

The proportion of subjects who had no nocturnal bowel movements was significantly greater in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (67% vs 43%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

The proportion of subjects who had no tenesmus was significantly greater in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (49% vs 30%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Number of days with sleep interruption due to UC symptoms per week were reduced in a significantly greater amount in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (change from baseline in risankizumab = -2.5, placebo = -1.5, p &lt; 0.00001).

## UC-related hospitalisations

Rates of UC-related hospitalisations through week 12 were significantly lower in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo (1% vs 6%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

## Extended treatment in week 12 non-responders

A total of 141 subjects who did not demonstrate clinical response at week 12 of risankizumab induction in INSPIRE received either subcutaneous 180 mg or 360 mg dose of risankizumab at week 12 and week 20. Of the 71 subjects who received risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and 70 subjects who received risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously, 56% and 57% achieved clinical response at week 24, respectively.

## COMMAND

The maintenance study COMMAND evaluated 548 subjects with clinical response after 12 weeks of risankizumab intravenous induction treatment in study INSPIRE. Subjects were randomised to receive a maintenance regimen of risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks, or to withdraw from risankizumab induction and receive placebo subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks.

In COMMAND, 75% (411/548) of subjects had failed (inadequate response or intolerance) one or more biologics therapies, JAK inhibitors, and/or S1P receptor modulators prior to induction baseline. Of these 411 subjects, 407 (99%) failed biologics and 78 (19%) failed JAK inhibitors.

In COMMAND, a significantly greater proportion of the above 548 subjects treated with risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously or risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per aMS at week 52 compared to placebo (see Table 6). Results of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints are listed in Table 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

week 52. A greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously /risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo had no bowel urgency (49% vs 31%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001) at week 52, and a numerically higher proportion of subjects had no abdominal pain compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo (38% vs 30%, respectively, p = 0.0895) at week 52.

## Other UC symptoms

The proportion of subjects who had no nocturnal bowel movements was greater in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo at week 52 (42% and 43% vs 30%, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

The proportion of subjects who had no tenesmus was greater in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo at week 52 (37% and 37% vs 23%, respectively, p &lt; 0.01).

## UC-related hospitalisations

Occurrence of UC-related hospitalisations through week 52 were numerically lower in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo (0.6 per 100 subject-years and 1.2 per 100 subject-years vs 3.1 per 100 subject-years, p = 0.0949 and p = 0.2531, respectively).

## Endoscopic and histologic assessment

Endoscopic remission (normalisation of the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa) was defined as ES of 0. At week 12 of INSPIRE, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo achieved endoscopic remission (11% vs 3%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001). At week 52 of COMMAND, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo achieved endoscopic remission (23% and 24% vs 15%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05).

Deep mucosal healing was defined as ES of 0 and Geboes score &lt; 2.0 (indicating no neutrophil in crypts or lamina propria and no increase in eosinophil, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations or granulation tissue). At week 12 of INSPIRE, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo achieved deep mucosal healing (6% vs 1%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001). At week 52 of COMMAND, a numerically higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo achieved deep mucosal healing (13% and 16% vs 10%, p = 0.2062 and p = 0.0618, respectively).

In COMMAND, maintenance of mucosal healing at week 52 (ES ≤1 without friability) was seen in a greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo among subjects who achieved mucosal healing at the end of induction (74% and 54% vs 47%, p &lt; 0.01 and p = 0.5629, respectively).

## Rescue treatment

During COMMAND, subjects who had loss of response to risankizumab subcutaneously treatment received rescue treatment with risankizumab (a single intravenous induction dose, followed by 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks). Among these subjects, in the risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneous and risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneous treatment group, 85% (17/20) and 74% (26/35) achieved clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

response at week 52, respectively. In addition, 24% (6/25) and 35% (13/37) of subjects achieved clinical remission per aMS, and 38% (10/26) and 45% (17/38) of subjects achieved endoscopic improvement at week 52 in the risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneous and risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneous treatment group, respectively.

## Week 24 responders

A total of 100 subjects did not demonstrate clinical response after 12 weeks of induction treatment, received either subcutaneous 180 mg (N=56) or 360 mg (N=44) dose of risankizumab at week 12 and week 20, demonstrated clinical response at week 24, and continued receiving risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks in COMMAND. Among these subjects, 46% and 45% achieved clinical response per aMS at week 52, and 18% and 23% achieved clinical remission per aMS at week 52, for risankizumab 180 mg and 360 mg subcutaneously respectively.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Subjects treated with risankizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) (bowel symptoms, systemic function, emotional function, and social function) compared to placebo. Changes from baseline in IBDQ total score at week 12 with risankizumab compared to placebo were 42.6 and 24.3, respectively. Changes from baseline in IBDQ total score at week 52 were 52.6, 50.3 and 35.0 in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously, risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/placebo, respectively.

Subjects receiving risankizumab experienced significantly greater improvement from baseline in fatigue, as measured by FACIT-F score at week 12 compared to placebo. Changes from baseline in FACIT-F score at Week 12 with risankizumab compared to placebo were 7.9 and 3.3, respectively. Changes from baseline in FACIT-F score at week 52 were 10.9, 10.3 and 7.0 in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously, risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/placebo, respectively.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Skyrizi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab was similar between plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

## Absorption

Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure across dose ranges of 18 to 360 mg and 0.25 to 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously, and 200 to 1 800 mg and 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously.

Following subcutaneous dosing of risankizumab, peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 3-14 days after dosing with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 74-89%. With dosing of 150 mg at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter, estimated steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations are 12 and 2 µg/mL, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In subjects with Crohn's disease treated with 600 mg intravenous induction dose at weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 360 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose at week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter, maximum median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 156 and 38.8 µg/mL respectively during the induction period (weeks 8-12) and steady-state median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 28.0 and 8.13 µg/mL respectively during the maintenance period (weeks 40-48).

In subjects with ulcerative colitis treated with 1 200 mg intravenous induction dose at weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose at week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter, maximum median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 350 and 87.7 µg/mL respectively during the induction period (weeks 8-12) and steady-state median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 19.6 and 4.64 µg/mL for the 180 mg subcutaneous dose and 39.2 and 9.29 µg/mL for the 360 mg subcutaneous dose, respectively, during the maintenance period (weeks 40-48).

## Distribution

The mean (±standard deviation) steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of risankizumab was 11.4 (±2.7) L in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis, indicating that the distribution of risankizumab is primarily confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces. In a typical 70 kg subject with Crohn's disease, Vss was 7.68 L.

## Biotransformation

Therapeutic IgG monoclonal antibodies are typically degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. Risankizumab is not expected to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Elimination

The mean (±standard deviation) systemic clearance (CL) of risankizumab was 0.3 (±0.1) L/day in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. The mean terminal elimination half-life of risankizumab ranged from 28 to 29 days in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. For a typical 70 kg subject with Crohn's disease, CL was 0.30 L/day and terminal elimination half-life was 21 days.

As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is not expected to be filtered by glomerular filtration in the kidneys or to be excreted as an intact molecule in the urine.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with approximately dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in the evaluated dose ranges of 18 to 360 mg or 0.25 to 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration and 200 to 1 800 mg and 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously in healthy subjects or subjects with psoriasis, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

## Interactions

Interaction studies were conducted in subjects with plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis to assess the effect of repeated administration of risankizumab on the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) sensitive probe substrates. The exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A substrate) following risankizumab treatment were comparable to their exposures prior to risankizumab treatment, indicating no clinically meaningful interactions through these enzymes.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that risankizumab exposure was not impacted by concomitant medicinal products used by some subjects with plaque psoriasis during the clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies. Similar lack of impact by concomitant medicinal products was observed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses in Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab in paediatric subjects under 16 years of age has not been established. Of the 1 574 subjects with Crohn's disease exposed to risankizumab, 12 were 16 to 17 years old. Risankizumab exposures in 16 to 17 year-old subjects with Crohn's disease were similar to those in adults. Age was not found to have any significant impact on risankizumab exposures based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses.

## Elderly

Of the 2 234 subjects with plaque psoriasis exposed to risankizumab, 243 were 65 years or older and 24 subjects were 75 years or older. Of the 1 574 subjects with Crohn's disease exposed to risankizumab, 72 were 65 years or older and 5 subjects were 75 years or older. Of the 1 512 subjects with ulcerative colitis exposed to risankizumab, 103 were 65 years or older and 8 subjects were 75 years or older. No overall differences in risankizumab exposure were observed between older and younger subjects who received risankizumab.

## Patients with renal or hepatic impairment

No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance, or hepatic function markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin) did not have a meaningful impact on risankizumab clearance in subjects with psoriasis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis.

As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and is not expected to undergo metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes or renal elimination.

## Body weight

Risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases which may result in reduced efficacy in subjects with high body weight (&gt;130 kg). However, this observation is based on a limited number of subjects with plaque psoriasis. Body weight had no clinically meaningful impact on risankizumab exposure or efficacy in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis. No dose adjustment based on body weight is currently recommended.

## Gender or race

The clearance of risankizumab was not significantly influenced by gender or race in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. No clinically meaningful differences in risankizumab exposure were observed in Chinese or Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects in clinical pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies including safety pharmacology evaluations and an enhanced pre- and post- natal developmental toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week, producing exposures 10 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 600 mg intravenous every 4 weeks and 39 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for Crohn's disease. For ulcerative colitis, exposures were 5 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 1 200 mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intravenously every 4 weeks and 65 or 32 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 180 or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks.

Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with risankizumab. In a 26-week chronic toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (7 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 600 mg intravenous every 4 weeks and 28 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for Crohn's disease and 3 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 1 200 mg intravenously every 4 weeks and 45 or 23 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 180 or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for ulcerative colitis), there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed and no adverse immunotoxicity or cardiovascular effects were noted.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection.

In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Patients treated with risankizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy for the infection, the patient should be closely monitored and risankizumab should not be administered until the infection resolves.

## Tuberculosis

Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

## Immunisations

Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment (see section 5.2).

## Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with use of risankizumab (see section 4.8). If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of risankizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of risankizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of risankizumab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether risankizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which decreases to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. A decision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain from risankizumab therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of risankizumab therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

The effect of risankizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Risankizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections (15.6% in Crohn's disease and 26.2% in ulcerative colitis).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Psoriasis

## Infections

Over the entire psoriasis programme including long-term exposure to risankizumab, the rate of infections was 75.5 events per 100 subject-years. The majority of cases were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of risankizumab. The rate of serious infections was 1.7 events per 100 subject-years (see section 4.4).

## Crohn's disease

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with Crohn's disease treated with risankizumab was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients across indications.

## Infections

The rate of infections in the pooled data from the 12-week induction studies was 83.3 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 600 mg intravenously compared to 117.7 events per 100 subject-years in placebo. The rate of serious infections was 3.4 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 600 mg intravenously compared to 16.7 events per 100 subjectyears in placebo (see section 4.4).

The rate of infections in the 52-week maintenance study was 57.7 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 76.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rate of serious infections was 6.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 5.0 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction (see section 4.4).

## Ulcerative colitis

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with risankizumab was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients across indications.

## Infections

The rate of infections in the pooled data from the 12-week induction study was 78.3 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 1 200 mg intravenously compared to 74.2 events per 100 subject-years in placebo. The rate of serious infections was 3.0 events per 100 subjectyears in subjects treated with risankizumab 1 200 mg intravenously compared to 5.4 events per 100 subject-years in placebo (see section 4.4).

The rate of infections in the 52-week maintenance study was 67.4 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and 56.5 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 64.6 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction. The rate of serious infections was 1.1 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and 0.6 events per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously after risankizumab induction compared to 2.3 events per 100 subject-years in subjects who received placebo after risankizumab induction (see section 4.4).

## Immunogenicity

For subjects with Crohn's disease treated with risankizumab at the recommended intravenous induction and subcutaneous maintenance doses for up to 64 weeks in CD clinical trials, treatmentemergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3.4% (2/58) and 0% (0/58) of evaluated subjects, respectively.

For subjects with ulcerative colitis treated with risankizumab at the recommended intravenous induction and subcutaneous maintenance doses (180 mg or 360 mg) for up to 64 weeks in ulcerative colitis clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were detected in 8.9% (8/90) and 6.7% (6/90) for the 180 mg subcutaneous dose, or 4.4% (4/91) and 2.2% (2/91) for the 360 mg subcutaneous dose, of evaluated subjects, respectively.

Antibodies to risankizumab including neutralizing antibodies were not associated with changes in clinical response or safety.

## Elderly

There is limited safety information in subjects aged ≥65 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V .

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC18

## Mechanism of action

Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL12 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In a study of subjects with psoriasis, expression of genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis was decreased in the skin after single doses of risankizumab. Reductions in epidermal thickness, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and expression of psoriatic disease markers were also observed in psoriatic lesions.

In a Phase 2 study of subjects with Crohn's disease, expression of genes associated with the IL23/Th17 axis were decreased in gut tissue after multiple doses of risankizumab. Reductions in faecal calprotectin (FCP), serum C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-22 were also observed after multiple doses in Phase 3 induction studies in Crohn's patients. Decreases in FCP, CRP and serum IL-22 were maintained out to week 52 of the maintenance study.

In a Phase 2b/3 study of subjects with ulcerative colitis, statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline was observed in the inflammatory biomarkers, FCP and CRP, and in the IL-23 pathway-associated biomarker, serum IL-22, at week 12 of the induction study. Decreases in FCP, CRP and serum IL-22 were maintained out to week 52 of the maintenance study.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Crohn's disease

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab were assessed in 1 419 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies. Enrolled subjects were 16 years of age or older with a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 220 to 450, an average daily stool frequency (SF) ≥4 and/or average daily abdominal pain score (APS) ≥2, and a Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) of ≥6, or ≥4 for isolated ileal disease, excluding the narrowing component and confirmed by a central reviewer.

There were two 12-week intravenous induction studies (ADVANCE and MOTIVATE), which included a 12-week extension period for subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response (≥ 30% decrease in SF and/or ≥ 30% decrease in APS and both not worse than baseline) at week 12. ADVANCE and MOTIVATE were followed by a 52-week randomised withdrawal study of subcutaneous maintenance treatment (FORTIFY) that enrolled subjects with SF/APS clinical response to intravenous induction treatment, representing at least 64 weeks of therapy.

## ADVANCE and MOTIVATE

In studies ADVANCE and MOTIVATE, subjects were randomised to receive risankizumab at either 600 mg (recommended dose), 1 200 mg, or placebo, at week 0, week 4, and week 8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In ADVANCE, 58% (491/850) subjects had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more biologic therapies (prior biologic failure), and 42% (359/850) had failed or were intolerant to therapy with conventional therapies but not biologic therapies (without prior biologic failure). In ADVANCE, among the subjects without prior biologic failure, (87%) 314/359 were naïve to biologic therapy and the remaining 13% had received a biologic but never failed or demonstrated intolerance. All patients in MOTIVATE had prior biologic failure.

In both studies, a greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieved the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission at week 12 and endoscopic response at week 12 compared to placebo. Enhanced SF/APS clinical response and clinical remission were significant as early as week 4 in subjects treated with risankizumab and continued to improve through week 12 (Table 2).

In ADVANCE, a higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab with and without prior biologic failure achieved CDAI&lt;150 compared to placebo (With prior biologic failure, risankizumab =42%, placebo=26%; Without prior biologic failure, risankizumab =49%, placebo=23%).

## CD-related hospitalisations

Rates of CD-related hospitalisations through week 12 were lower in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo (ADVANCE, risankizumab =3%, placebo=12%, p&lt;0.001; MOTIVATE, risankizumab =3%, placebo=11%, p≤0.01).

## FORTIFY

The maintenance study FORTIFY evaluated 462 subjects with SF/APS clinical response to 12 weeks of risankizumab intravenous induction treatment in studies ADVANCE and MOTIVATE. Subjects were randomised to continue to receive a maintenance regimen of risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously (recommended dose), or risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks, or to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

withdraw from risankizumab induction and receive placebo subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks.

The co-primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 52 and, endoscopic response at week 52. Co-primary endpoints were also measured in subjects with and without prior biologic failure (see Table 4).

0.

Deep remission (clinical remission and endoscopic remission) at week 52 was observed at higher rates in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously / risankizumab subcutaneously compared to subjects who received risankizumab intravenously /placebo subcutaneously (28% vs. 10%, respectively, nominal p&lt;0.001).

At week 52, a higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously / risankizumab subcutaneously achieved CDAI &lt; 150 compared to risankizumab intravenously /placebo subcutaneously (52% vs. 41%, respectively, nominal p≤0.01). A higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/ risankizumab subcutaneously achieved a decrease of at least 100 points in baseline CDAI score compared to subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously /placebo subcutaneously (62% vs. 48%, respectively, nominal p≤ 0.01).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

91 subjects who did not demonstrate SF/APS clinical response 12 weeks after risankizumab induction in studies ADVANCE and MOTIVATE received subcutaneous 360 mg dose of risankizumab at week 12 and week 20. Of these subjects, 64% (58/91) achieved SF/APS clinical response at week 24; 33 of the subjects achieving SF/APS clinical response enrolled in FORTIFY and continued receiving risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks. Among these subjects, 55% (18/33) achieved clinical remission and 45% (15/33) achieved endoscopic response at week 52.

During FORTIFY, 30 subjects had loss of response to risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously treatment and received rescue treatment with risankizumab (1 200 mg intravenous single dose, followed by 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks). Of these subjects, 57% (17/30) achieved SF/APS clinical response at week 52. In addition, 20% (6/30) and 34% (10/29) of subjects achieved clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 52, respectively.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Improvement in fatigue was evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale. Work productivity was assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment CD (WPAI-CD) Questionnaire.

At week 12 of ADVANCE and MOTIVATE, subjects treated with risankizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in IBDQ total score, all IBDQ domain scores (bowel symptoms, systemic function, emotional function, and social function), SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary Score, FACIT-Fatigue and WPAI-CD compared to placebo. For WPAI-CD greater reductions in impairment while working, overall work impairment, and activity impairment were demonstrated in ADVANCE; and greater reduction in activity impairment was demonstrated in MOTIVATE. These improvements were maintained in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously / risankizumab subcutaneously in FORTIFY through week 52.

## Ulcerative colitis

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab was assessed in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies. Enrolled subjects were ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age with adapted Mayo Score (aMS) of 5 to 9 (using the Mayo scoring system, excluding Physician's Global Assessment) with an endoscopic subscore (ES) of 2 or 3 on screening endoscopy, confirmed by central review.

The 12-week intravenous induction study (INSPIRE) included a 12-week extension period for subjects who did not achieve clinical response [defined as a decrease from baseline in the aMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline, and a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1] at Week 12. INSPIRE was followed by a 52-week randomised withdrawal study of subcutaneous maintenance treatment (COMMAND) that enrolled subjects with clinical response to 12 weeks of risankizumab intravenous induction treatment, representing at least 64 weeks of therapy.

## INSPIRE

In study INSPIRE, 975 subjects were randomised and received either risankizumab 1 200 mg or placebo, at week 0, week 4, and week 8.

In INSPIRE, 52% (503/975) of subjects had failed (inadequate response or intolerance) one or more biologics therapies, JAK inhibitors, and/or S1P receptor modulators. Of these 503 subjects, 488 (97%) failed biologics and 90 (18%) failed JAK inhibitors.

Enrolled subjects were permitted to use a stable dose of oral corticosteroids (up to 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), immunomodulators, and aminosalicylates. At baseline in INSPIRE, 36% of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects received corticosteroids, 17% of subjects received immunomodulators and 73% of subjects received aminosalicylates. Patient disease activity was moderate (aMS ≤7) in 58% of subjects and severe (aMS &gt;7) in 42% of subjects.

In INSPIRE, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per aMS [defined as stool frequency subscore (SFS) ≤ 1, and not greater than baseline, RBS = 0, and ES ≤ 1 without evidence of friability] at week 12 compared to placebo (Table 5). Results of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints are listed in Table 5.

## Clinical disease activity and symptoms

The partial adapted Mayo score (paMS) is composed of SFS and RBS. Clinical response per paMS is defined as a decrease of ≥1 point and ≥30% from Baseline and a decrease in RBS ≥1 or an absolute RBS ≤1. The results of clinical response per paMS over time in INSPIRE are shown in Figure 1. Onset of efficacy was rapid with a greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab achieving clinical response as early as week 4 compared to placebo (52% vs 31%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

A significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo had no abdominal pain (36% vs 26%, respectively, p &lt; 0.01) and no bowel urgency (44% vs 28%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001) at week 12.

## Other UC symptoms

Number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was reduced in a significantly greater amount in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (change from baseline in risankizumab = -3.8, placebo = -2.2, p = 0.00003).

The proportion of subjects who had no nocturnal bowel movements was significantly greater in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (67% vs 43%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

The proportion of subjects who had no tenesmus was significantly greater in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (49% vs 30%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

Number of days with sleep interruption due to UC symptoms per week were reduced in a significantly greater amount in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo at week 12 (change from baseline in risankizumab = -2.5, placebo = -1.5, p &lt; 0.00001).

## UC-related hospitalisations

Rates of UC-related hospitalisations through week 12 were significantly lower in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo (1% vs 6%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Extended treatment in week 12 non-responders

A total of 141 subjects who did not demonstrate clinical response at week 12 of risankizumab induction in INSPIRE received either subcutaneous 180 mg or 360 mg dose of risankizumab at week 12 and week 20. Of the 71 subjects who received risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and 70 subjects who received risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously, 56% and 57% achieved clinical response at week 24, respectively.

## COMMAND

The maintenance study COMMAND evaluated 548 subjects with clinical response after 12 weeks of risankizumab intravenous induction treatment in study INSPIRE. Subjects were randomised to receive a maintenance regimen of risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks, or to withdraw from risankizumab induction and receive placebo subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks.

In COMMAND, 75% (411/548) of subjects had failed (inadequate response or intolerance) one or more biologics therapies, JAK inhibitors, and/or S1P receptor modulators prior to induction baseline. Of these 411 subjects, 407 (99%) failed biologics and 78 (19%) failed JAK inhibitors.

In COMMAND, a significantly greater proportion of the above 548 subjects treated with risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously or risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per aMS at week 52 compared to placebo (see Table 6).

## Clinical disease activity and symptoms

A significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo had no abdominal pain (47% vs 30%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001) and no bowel urgency (54% vs 31%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001) at week 52. A greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo had no bowel urgency (49% vs 31%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001) at week 52, and a numerically higher proportion of subjects had no abdominal pain compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo (38% vs 30%, respectively, p = 0.0895) at week 52.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other UC symptoms

The proportion of subjects who had no nocturnal bowel movements was greater in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo at week 52 (42% and 43% vs 30%, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

The proportion of subjects who had no tenesmus was greater in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo at week 52 (37% and 37% vs 23%, respectively, p &lt; 0.01).

## UC-related hospitalisations

Occurrence of UC-related hospitalisations through week 52 were numerically lower in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo (0.6 per 100 subject-years and 1.2 per 100 subject-years vs 3.1 per 100 subject-years, p = 0.0949 and p = 0.2531, respectively).

## Endoscopic and histologic assessment

Endoscopic remission (normalisation of the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa) was defined as ES of 0. At week 12 of INSPIRE, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo achieved endoscopic remission (11% vs 3%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001). At week 52 of COMMAND, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo achieved endoscopic remission (23% and 24% vs 15%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05).

Deep mucosal healing was defined as ES of 0 and Geboes score &lt; 2.0 (indicating no neutrophil in crypts or lamina propria and no increase in eosinophil, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations or granulation tissue). At week 12 of INSPIRE, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo achieved deep mucosal healing (6% vs 1%, respectively, p &lt; 0.00001). At week 52 of COMMAND, a numerically higher proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo achieved deep mucosal healing (13% and 16% vs 10%, p = 0.2062 and p = 0.0618, respectively).

In COMMAND, maintenance of mucosal healing at week 52 (ES ≤1 without friability) was seen in a greater proportion of subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously compared to risankizumab intravenously/placebo among subjects who achieved mucosal healing at the end of induction (74% and 54% vs 47%, p &lt; 0.01 and p = 0.5629, respectively).

## Rescue treatment

During COMMAND, subjects who had loss of response to risankizumab subcutaneous treatment received rescue treatment with risankizumab (a single intravenous induction dose, followed by 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks). Among these subjects, in the risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously treatment group, 85% (17/20) and 74% (26/35) achieved clinical response at week 52, respectively. In addition, 24% (6/25) and 35% (13/37) of subjects achieved clinical remission per aMS, and 38% (10/26) and 45% (17/38) of subjects achieved endoscopic improvement at week 52 in the risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously treatment group, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Week 24 responders

A total of 100 subjects did not demonstrate clinical response after 12 weeks of induction treatment, received either subcutaneous 180 mg (N=56) or 360 mg (N=44) dose of risankizumab at week 12 and week 20, demonstrated clinical response at week 24, and continued receiving risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for up to 52 weeks in COMMAND. Among these subjects, 46% and 45% achieved clinical response per aMS at week 52, and 18% and 23% achieved clinical remission per aMS at week 52, for risankizumab 180 mg and 360 mg subcutaneously respectively.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Subjects treated with risankizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) (bowel symptoms, systemic function, emotional function, and social function) compared to placebo. Changes from baseline in IBDQ total score at week 12 with risankizumab compared to placebo were 42.6 and 24.3, respectively. Changes from baseline in IBDQ total score at week 52 were 52.6, 50.3 and 35.0 in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenous/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously, risankizumab intravenous/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenous/placebo, respectively.

Subjects receiving risankizumab experienced significantly greater improvement from baseline in fatigue, as measured by FACIT-F score at week 12 compared to placebo. Changes from baseline in FACIT-F score at week 12 with risankizumab compared to placebo were 7.9 and 3.3, respectively. Changes from baseline in FACIT-F score at week 52 were 10.9, 10.3 and 7.0 in subjects treated with risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 180 mg subcutaneously, risankizumab intravenously/risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously and risankizumab intravenously/placebo, respectively.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Skyrizi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab was similar between plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

## Absorption

Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure across dose ranges of 18 to 360 mg and 0.25 to 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously, and 200 to 1 800 mg and 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously.

Following subcutaneous dosing of risankizumab, peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 3-14 days after dosing with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 74-89%. With dosing of 150 mg at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter, estimated steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations are 12 and 2 µg/mL, respectively.

In subjects with Crohn's disease treated with 600 mg intravenous induction dose at weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 360 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose at week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter, maximum median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 156 and 38.8 µg/mL respectively during the induction period (weeks 8-12) and steady-state median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 28.0 and 8.13 µg/mL respectively during the maintenance period (weeks 40-48).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In subjects with ulcerative colitis treated with 1 200 mg intravenous induction dose at weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose at week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter, maximum median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 350 and 87.7 µg/mL respectively during the induction period (weeks 8-12) and steady-state median peak and trough concentrations are estimated to be 19.6 and 4.64 µg/mL for the 180 mg subcutaneous dose and 39.2 and 9.29 µg/mL for the 360 mg subcutaneous dose, respectively, during the maintenance period (weeks 40-48).

## Distribution

The mean (±standard deviation) steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of risankizumab was 11.4 (±2.7) L in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis, indicating that the distribution of risankizumab is primarily confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces. In a typical 70 kg subject with Crohn's disease, Vss was 7.68 L.

## Biotransformation

Therapeutic IgG monoclonal antibodies are typically degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. Risankizumab is not expected to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Elimination

The mean (±standard deviation) systemic clearance (CL) of risankizumab was 0.3 (±0.1) L/day in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. The mean terminal elimination half-life of risankizumab ranged from 28 to 29 days in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. For a typical 70 kg subject with Crohn's disease, CL was 0.30 L/day and terminal elimination half-life was 21 days.

As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is not expected to be filtered by glomerular filtration in the kidneys or to be excreted as an intact molecule in the urine.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with approximately dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in the evaluated dose ranges of 18 to 360 mg or 0.25 to 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration and 200 to 1800 mg and 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously in healthy subjects or subjects with psoriasis, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

## Interactions

Interaction studies were conducted in subjects with plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis to assess the effect of repeated administration of risankizumab on the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) sensitive probe substrates. The exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A substrate) following risankizumab treatment were comparable to their exposures prior to risankizumab treatment, indicating no clinically meaningful interactions through these enzymes.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that risankizumab exposure was not impacted by concomitant medicinal products used by some subjects with plaque psoriasis during the clinical studies. Similar lack of impact by concomitant medicinal products was observed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses in Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab in paediatric subjects under 16 years of age has not been established. Of the 1 574 subjects with Crohn's disease exposed to risankizumab, 12 were 16 to 17 years old. Risankizumab exposures in 16 to 17 year-old subjects with Crohn's disease were similar to those in adults. Age was not found to have any significant impact on risankizumab exposures based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses.

## Elderly

Of the 2 234 subjects with plaque psoriasis exposed to risankizumab, 243 were 65 years or older and 24 subjects were 75 years or older. Of the 1 574 subjects with Crohn's disease exposed to risankizumab, 72 were 65 years or older and 5 subjects were 75 years or older. Of the 1 512 subjects with ulcerative colitis exposed to risankizumab, 103 were 65 years or older and 8 subjects were 75 years or older. No overall differences in risankizumab exposure were observed between older and younger subjects who received risankizumab.

## Patients with renal or hepatic impairment

No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance, or hepatic function markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin) did not have a meaningful impact on risankizumab clearance in subjects with psoriasis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis.

As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and is not expected to undergo metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes or renal elimination.

## Body weight

Risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases which may result in reduced efficacy in subjects with high body weight (&gt;130 kg). However, this observation is based on a limited number of subjects with plaque psoriasis. Body weight had no clinically meaningful impact on risankizumab exposure or efficacy in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis. No dose adjustment based on body weight is currently recommended.

## Gender or race

The clearance of risankizumab was not significantly influenced by gender or race in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. No clinically meaningful differences in risankizumab exposure were observed in Chinese or Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects in clinical pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies including safety pharmacology evaluations and an enhanced pre- and post- natal developmental toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week, producing exposures 10 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 600 mg intravenous every 4 weeks and 39 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for Crohn's disease. For ulcerative colitis, exposures were 5 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 1 200 mg intravenously every 4 weeks and 65 or 32 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 180 or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with risankizumab. In a 26-week chronic toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (7 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 600 mg intravenous every 4 weeks and 28 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for Crohn's disease and 3 times the clinical exposures during induction at a dose of 1 200 mg intravenously every 4 weeks and 45 or 23 times the clinical exposures for maintenance when given 180 or 360 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks for ulcerative colitis), there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed and no adverse immunotoxicity or cardiovascular effects were noted.

## B. PACKAGE LEAFLET

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Skyrizi 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen risankizumab

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Skyrizi
3. How to use Skyrizi
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Skyrizi
6. Contents of the pack and other information
7. Instructions for use

## 1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for

Skyrizi contains the active substance risankizumab.

Skyrizi is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases:

- Plaque psoriasis
- Psoriatic arthritis

## How Skyrizi works

This medicine works by stopping a protein in the body called 'IL-23', which causes inflammation.

## Plaque psoriasis

Skyrizi is used to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Skyrizi reduces inflammation and can therefore help reduce symptoms of plaque psoriasis such as burning, itching, pain, redness, and scaling.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Skyrizi is used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a disease that causes inflamed joints and psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis, you may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Skyrizi either alone or in combination with other medicines to treat your psoriatic arthritis.

Skyrizi reduces inflammation and can therefore help to reduce pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around your joints, pain and stiffness in your spine, psoriatic skin rash, psoriatic nail damage, and it may slow down damage to the bone and cartilage in your joints. These effects can ease your normal daily activities, reduce tiredness, and improve your quality of life.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you use Skyrizi

## Do not use Skyrizi

It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Skyrizi.

Every time you get a new pack of Skyrizi, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot') and keep this information in a safe place.

## 3. How to use Skyrizi

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

This medicine is given as an injection under your skin (called a 'subcutaneous injection').

## 1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for

Skyrizi contains the active substance risankizumab.

Skyrizi is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases:

- Plaque psoriasis
- Psoriatic arthritis

## How Skyrizi works

This medicine works by stopping a protein in the body called 'IL-23', which causes inflammation.

## Plaque psoriasis

Skyrizi is used to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Skyrizi reduces inflammation and can therefore help reduce symptoms of plaque psoriasis such as burning, itching, pain, redness, and scaling.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Skyrizi is used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a disease that causes inflamed joints and psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis, you may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Skyrizi either alone or in combination with other medicines to treat your psoriatic arthritis.

Skyrizi reduces inflammation and can therefore help to reduce pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around your joints, pain and stiffness in your spine, psoriatic skin rash, psoriatic nail damage, and it may slow down damage to the bone and cartilage in your joints. These effects can ease your normal daily activities, reduce tiredness, and improve your quality of life.

## 7. Instructions for use

## Please read all of section 7 before using Skyrizi

<!-- image -->

## Important information to know before you inject Skyrizi

- You should receive training on how to inject Skyrizi before giving an injection. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you need help
- Mark the dates on your calendar so you know when to inject Skyrizi
- Keep Skyrizi in the original carton to protect the medicine from light until it is time to use it
- Do not inject if the liquid is cloudy or contains flakes or large particles. The liquid should look clear to slightly yellow and may contain tiny white or clear particles
- Do not shake the syringe
- Wait to remove the needle cover until just before the injection

## Return this medicine to the pharmacy

- if the expiry date (EXP) has passed
- if the liquid has ever been frozen (even if thawed)
- if the syringe has been dropped or damaged
- if the syringe paper tray cover is broken or missing

For a more comfortable injection: Take the carton out of the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Skyrizi should not be warmed in any other way (for example, in a microwave or in hot water)
- Keep the syringes in the carton until ready to inject

## Follow the steps below each time you use Skyrizi

STEP 1

<!-- image -->

## STEP 2

Areas to inject

<!-- image -->

Place the following items on a clean, flat surface:

- 2 pre-filled syringes and 2 alcohol pads (included in the carton)
- 2 cotton balls or gauze pads (not included in the carton)
- Special disposal container (not included in the carton)

Wash and dry your hands.

Start with one syringe for the first injection.

## For a full dose, 2 injections are required, one after the other.

Choose from these 3 areas to inject:

- front of left thigh
- front of right thigh
- your belly (abdomen) at least 5 cm from your belly button (navel)

For the second syringe, inject at least 3 cm away from the first injection. Do not inject into the same place.

Before each injection, wipe where you will inject in a circular motion with an alcohol pad.

- Do not touch or blow on the injection site after it is cleaned. Allow the skin to dry before injecting
- Do not inject through clothes
- Do not inject into skin that is sore, bruised, red, hard, scarred, or has stretch marks
- Do not inject into areas affected by psoriasis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

STEP 3

Check liquid

<!-- image -->

STEP 4

<!-- image -->

STEP 5

<!-- image -->

Hold the syringe with the covered needle pointing down, as shown.

Check the liquid in the syringe.

- It is normal to see bubbles in the window
- The liquid should look clear to slightly yellow and may contain tiny white or clear particles
- Do not use if the liquid is cloudy or contains flakes or large particles

Removing the needle cover:

- Hold the syringe in one hand between the finger grip and needle cover
- With the other hand, gently pull the needle cover straight off
- Do not hold or pull the plunger rod when removing the needle cover
- You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal
- Throw away the needle cover
- Do not touch the needle with your fingers or let the needle touch anything

Hold the body of the syringe in one hand between the thumb and index finger, like you would a pencil.

Gently pinch the area of cleaned skin with your other hand and hold it firmly.

Insert the needle all the way into the skin at about a 45-degree angle using a quick, short movement. Keep the syringe steady at the same angle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

STEP 6

Needle guard

<!-- image -->

STEP 7

2 Injections Required

<!-- image -->

## STEP 8

<!-- image -->

Slowly push the plunger rod all the way in until all of the liquid is injected.

Pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the syringe at the same angle.

Slowly take your thumb off the plunger rod. The needle will then be covered by the needle guard.

- The needle guard will not activate unless all the liquid is injected
- Speak to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you think you have not given a full dose

Press a cotton ball or gauze pad where you have injected and hold for 10 seconds.

Do not rub the skin where you have injected. You may have slight bleeding from where you injected. This is normal

## For a full dose, two injections are needed, one after the other.

- Repeat Steps 2 through 6 with the second syringe
- Inject the second syringe straight after the first injection but at least 3 cm away from the first injection

Throw away used syringes in a special disposal container straight after use.

- Do not throw away used syringes in the household waste
- Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will tell you how to return the full special disposal container

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given Skyrizi
3. How Skyrizi will be given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Skyrizi
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for

Skyrizi contains the active substance risankizumab.

## Skyrizi is used to treat adult patients with:

- moderate to severe Crohn's disease
- moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

## How Skyrizi works

This medicine works by stopping a protein in the body called 'IL-23', which causes inflammation.

## Crohn's disease

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. If you have active Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Skyrizi to treat your Crohn's disease.

## Ulcerative colitis

Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large bowel. If you have active ulcerative colitis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough or if you cannot take these medicines, you will be given Skyrizi to treat your ulcerative colitis.

Skyrizi reduces the inflammation and can therefore help to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Skyrizi

## You should not be given Skyrizi

- if you are allergic to risankizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have an infection, including active tuberculosis, which your doctor thinks is important.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before and during the use of Skyrizi:

- if you currently have an infection or if you have an infection that keeps coming back.
- if you have tuberculosis (TB).
- if you have recently received or plan to receive an immunisation (vaccine). You should not be given certain types of vaccines while using Skyrizi.

It is important that your doctor or nurse keep a record of the batch number of your Skyrizi. Every time you get a new pack of Skyrizi, your doctor or nurse must note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot').

## Serious allergic reactions

Skyrizi can cause serious side effects, including serious allergic reactions ('anaphylaxis').

Tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs of an allergic reaction while you are taking Skyrizi such as:

- difficulty breathing or swallowing
- swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat
- low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness or light-headedness
- severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps

## Children and adolescents

Skyrizi is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because the use of Skyrizi has not been confirmed in this age group.

## Other medicines and Skyrizi

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse:

- if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
- if you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of vaccines while using Skyrizi.

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before and during the use of Skyrizi.

## Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. This is because it is not known how this medicine will affect the baby.

If you are a woman who can become pregnant, you should use contraception while using this medicine and for at least 21 weeks after your last dose of Skyrizi.

If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

Skyrizi is not likely to affect your driving and use of machines.

## Skyrizi contains polysorbate and sodium

This medicine contains 2 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 600 mg dose and 4 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1 200 mg dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 600 mg dose and 1 200 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for

Skyrizi contains the active substance risankizumab.

Skyrizi is used to treat adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

## How Skyrizi works

This medicine works by stopping a protein in the body called 'IL-23', which causes inflammation.

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. If you have active Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Skyrizi to treat your Crohn's disease.

Skyrizi reduces the inflammation and can therefore help to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Skyrizi

## You should not be given Skyrizi

- if you are allergic to risankizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have an infection, including active tuberculosis, which your doctor thinks is important.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before and during the use of Skyrizi

- if you currently have an infection or if you have an infection that keeps coming back.

## Instructions for use

This medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional. Administer each pre-filled syringe subcutaneously as follows:

## STEP 1

<!-- image -->

## STEP 2

## Injectable areas

Before injecting, remove the carton from the refrigerator without removing the pre-filled syringes from the carton.

- Do not use this medicinal product if the carton seal is broken or missing, or if any of the components are damaged.

Allow Skyrizi to reach room temperature out of direct sunlight (15 to 30 minutes).

Do not shake the pre-filled syringes.

Place the following items on a clean, flat surface:

- 4 pre-filled syringes and 4 alcohol pads (not included in the carton)
- 4 cotton balls or gauze pads (not included in the carton)
- Special disposal container (not included in the carton)

Wash and dry your hands.

## For a full dose, 4 injections are required, one after the other.

Choose an injection site.

- Inject one pre-filled syringe after the other in the following anatomic location(s):
- o front of left thigh or right thigh

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

## STEP 3

Check liquid

<!-- image -->

STEP 4

<!-- image -->

- o abdomen (belly) at least 5 cm from the navel (belly button)
- Use a new injection site for each injection.
- For each syringe, inject at least 3 cm away from the previous injection. Do not inject into the same place.

Before each injection, wipe where you will inject in a circular motion with an alcohol pad.

- Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated or affected by any lesions.

Hold the syringe with the covered needle pointing down, as shown.

Check the liquid in the syringe.

- It is normal to see bubbles in the window
- The liquid should look clear to slightly yellow and may contain tiny white or clear particles
- Do not use if the liquid is cloudy or contains flakes or large particles

Removing the needle cover:

- Hold the syringe in one hand between the finger grip and needle cover
- With the other hand, gently pull the needle cover straight off
- Do not hold or pull the plunger rod when removing the needle cover
- You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal
- Throw away the needle cover
- Do not touch the needle with your fingers or let the needle touch anything

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## STEP 5

<!-- image -->

## STEP 6

For a full dose, 4 injections are required

<!-- image -->

Hold the body of the syringe in one hand between the thumb and index finger, like you would a pencil.

Gently pinch the area of cleaned skin with your other hand and hold it firmly.

Insert the needle all the way into the skin at about a 45-degree angle using a quick, short movement. Keep the syringe steady at the same angle.

Slowly push the plunger rod all the way in until all of the liquid is injected.

Pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the syringe at the same angle.

Slowly take your thumb off the plunger rod. The needle will then be covered by the needle guard.

The needle guard will not activate unless all the liquid is injected.

Press a cotton ball or gauze pad where you have injected and hold for 10 seconds.

Use four 90 mg pre-filled syringes to subcutaneously administer the maintenance dose of 360 mg.

- Repeat Steps 2 through 5 with the subsequent syringes.

If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time.

## 1. What Skyrizi is and what it is used for

Skyrizi contains the active substance risankizumab.

Skyrizi is used to treat adult patients with:

- moderate to severe Crohn's disease
- moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

## How Skyrizi works

This medicine works by stopping a protein in the body called 'IL-23', which causes inflammation.

## Crohn's disease

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. If you have active Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Skyrizi to treat your Crohn's disease.

## Ulcerative colitis

Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large bowel. If you have active ulcerative colitis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough or if you cannot take these medicines, you will be given Skyrizi to treat your ulcerative colitis.

Skyrizi reduces the inflammation and can therefore help to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

Hold the body of the syringe in one hand between the thumb and index finger, like you would a pencil.

Gently pinch the area of cleaned skin with your other hand and hold it firmly.

Insert the needle all the way into the skin at about a 45-degree angle using a quick, short movement. Keep the syringe steady at the same angle.

Slowly push the plunger rod all the way in until all of the liquid is injected.

Pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the syringe at the same angle.

Slowly take your thumb off the plunger rod. The needle will then be covered by the needle guard.

- The needle guard will not activate unless all the liquid is injected.
- Speak to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you think you have not given a full dose.

Press a cotton ball or gauze pad where you have injected and hold for 10 seconds.

Do not rub the skin where you have injected. You may have slight bleeding from where you injected. This is normal.

1 injection is required.

## For the 360 mg dose

2 injections are required

- Repeat Steps 2 through 6 with the second syringe.
- Inject the second syringe straight after the first injection but at least 3 cm away from the first injection.
