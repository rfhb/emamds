## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 17 November 2023 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I, IIIA and IIIB   |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update information on paediatric population based on final results from study DINAMO 1218-0091; this is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The company evaluated clinical data on the use of linagliptin/metformin in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The applicant mentioned that the documentation provided was already submitted for product Trajenta ® within type II variation EMEA/H/C/002110/II/0049. The changes proposed for the SmPC have been aligned with the finally approved texts from the variation for Trajenta ® .

## Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis

In support of the variation, linagliptin PK was assessed in the paediatric population in the two studies (1218-0056 and 1218-0091 (DINAMO)). Linagliptin PK was assessed using descriptive analysis per study, and also by the use of a sufficiently validated popPK model. In summary, these popPK analyses support the comparability of the linagliptin PK between paediatric and adult T2DM patients.

## Exposure-effect

The relationship between linagliptin exposure and HbA1c was investigated using a sufficiently validated PK/PD model, which was modified from a previously developed model to which the new paediatric data were added. In summary, a smaller effect of linagliptin treatment was observed in children compared to adults.

## Dose finding study

Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dose-finding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children and adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM.

## Phase III trial

In the 26-week Phase III trial 1218.91 in adolescents, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin was not associated with a relevant reduction in HbA1c.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable, as were the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs. With the exception of hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-controlled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups.

No unexpected safety concerns were identified for linagliptin in the paediatric programme. However, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin was not associated with a relevant benefit.

The benefit-risk balance of Jentadueto in adolescents is negative. However, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated in order to update information on paediatric population based on final results from study DINAMO 1218-0091. These proposed changes have been aligned with the finally approved texts of the SmPC of Trajenta (linagliptin monocomponent) within type II variation EMEA/H/C/002110/II/0049, and are therefore acceptable.

The benefit-risk balance of Jentadueto in adults remains unchanged.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update information on paediatric population based on final results from study DINAMO 1218-0091; this is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks, in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

is recommended for approval.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB are recommended.

## 4. Introduction

Linagliptin is a potent inhibitor of DPP-4 activity and prolongs the half-life of GLP-1. It is an orally available compound with a low risk for hypoglycaemic episodes. Linagliptin for the treatment of T2DM in adults is approved in over 90 countries, including the European Union, the USA, and Japan.

The company evaluated clinical data on the use of linagliptin in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were treated with metformin and/or insulin or who were not tolerating metformin. This clinical overview summarises the results from trials 1218.91 and 1218.56.

These data were already submitted for the medicinal product of Trajenta within type II Variation EMEA/H/C/002110/II/0049 (as mentioned above). The changes proposed for the SmPC have been aligned with the finally approved texts from this variation for Trajenta.

## 5. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

The clinical development program for linagliptin in children and adolescents 10-17 years of age with T2DM consisted of two clinical trials.

The Phase I study 1218-0056 [c02827550-01] was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, parallelgroup trial to evaluate the PK and PD of linagliptin after single and multiple doses of 1 and 5 mg linagliptin. Sparse and rich PK/PD (Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), DPP-4 inhibition, and Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)) sampling up to 24 hours post-drug administration was performed in 39 patients. Based on the results of this study, the dose of 5 mg linagliptin for the subsequent Phase III DINAMO study (12180091, [c38245139]) was selected.

The Phase III DINAMO study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5 mg linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks in children and adolescents 10-17 years of age with T2DM. As a measure of systemic exposure to linagliptin, steady state trough and 1.5 h post-dose PK samples were taken. The DINAMO study also included the administration of the selective sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin in separate treatment arms.

## 5.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Analysis of linagliptin

Specific and sensitive HPLC-MS/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry) methods were developed and validated to support the clinical linagliptin development program.

Sufficiently validated methods [n00194391, n00240725] were used for studies 1218-0056 and 12180091. While method n00194391 had been validated for the determination of linagliptin and its metabolite CD 1750 XX, it was used for the analysis of linagliptin alone in Phase I trial 1218-0056. Method n00240725 had been validated for the determination of linagliptin alone using unchanged extraction procedure and LC-MS/MS conditions and was employed for Phase III trial 1218-0091.

Overall (inter-) assay performance data for linagliptin are shown in Table 1.

c assay validation report linagliptin in human plasma [n00240725]

d bioanalytical report, Appendix 16.1.9.1 of study 1218-0091 [c38245139]

The accuracy and precision of all validated bioanalytical assays used during the paediatric clinical development of linagliptin were within the acceptance criteria of ≤ 20% for the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and ≤ 15% for all other concentrations , in line with The FDA Guidance for industry: bioanalytical method validation and the EMA guideline on bioanalytical method validation.

Linagliptin proved to be stable in human plasma for at least 24 h at room temperature, 4 freeze/thaw cycles and 416 days freezer storage at -20°C.

The incurred samples reanalysis (ISR) pass rate was 97.1% for Study 1218-0056 and 94.8% for Study 1218-0091 and, therefore, demonstrates good assay reproducibility.

## Population PK analysis

Data manipulation, visualization, and simulations were conducted using version 4.1 of R. Population PK and ER analyses for repeated-measures endpoints were conducted via nonlinear mixed effects modelling with a qualified installation of the NONMEM ®  software, Version 7.5 (ICON PLC, Ireland). All code was maintained using the version control system Subversion. All analyses were conducted on a computer grid with multiple compute nodes. Each node runs the Linux operating system that utilized the gfortran ® Fortran Compiler (version 7.5.0 for Linux).

Data from Phase III Study 1218-0091 was used to develop the popPK model (c39218172), starting from a popPK model (c37380493) that was previously developed with data from several studies in adults and from the multiple-dose Phase IIb study 1218-0056 in children and adolescents with T2DM from 10 to 17 years of age. This structural model c37380493 was re-estimated using the data from study 1218-0091 under a Bayesian framework in study c39218172.

The parameter estimates from the previous linagliptin population PK model were used as priors to inform the model parameters without direct support from the sparse paediatric data. For parameters of primary interest, namely apparent clearance after oral dosing (CL/F), apparent central volume of distribution after oral dosing (V2/F), and CL/F by sex, weakly informative priors were used. All parameter estimates were reported as point estimates from NONMEM ®  with 95% credible intervals derived from the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates. Additional effects for covariates were explored graphically and estimated as necessary to explain potential biases in the characterization of PK observed in the paediatric population.

A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and a saturable binding sub-model in the central compartment was used based on the results of previous analyses. The model was parameterized with CL/F, V2/F, apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), the apparent peripheral volume of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

distribution after oral dosing (V3/F), absorption rate constant (ka), and parameters relating to saturable binding (binding affinity (KSS) and total DPP-4 concentration (RMAX)). Weight (WT) was used to scale clearances and volumes according to fixed allometric exponents between adult and paediatric study patients. The final PopPK model parameters are shown in Table 2. The structure of the two-compartment model with first-order absorption and a saturable binding submodel in the central compartment, as described before, was retained in the final model, and no additional covariates were included.

The previous model estimated interindividual variability (IIV) on CL/F and ka. IIV could not be estimated on ka in the current model due to the limited number of PK observations available in the absorption phase. Interoccasion variability was estimated in the previous model but not estimated in the current model, given the limited number of observations per sampling occasion. Therefore, using an exponential variance model, the final model only included IIV on CL/F. The residual error model was also adjusted to include two separate error terms, with one for outlier PK trough observations, which was defined as concentrations more than 5-fold smaller than the median concentration 24 hours post-dose at steady state, and one for all remaining observations. The residual error was described with an additive error model in the logarithmic scale, which corresponds to using proportional error in the linear scale.

The final model provided a reasonable description of the data, as judged by visual inspection of model diagnostic plots. No systemic bias was noted in expected weighted residual (EWRES) or NPDE versus time and population predicted concentration or time after dose. There were also no obvious trends in plots of IIV random effects versus continuous or categorical covariates. Visual predictive checks (VPCs) indicated that the current model reasonably fit steady-state concentrations in paediatric patients across covariates of interest in Study 1218.56 and 1218-0091 (DINAMO).

## Exposure response analysis

In a previous analysis, a population ER model was developed for longitudinal HbA1c using data from several studies in adults and from the multiple-dose Phase IIb study 1218-0056 in children and adolescents with T2DM from 10 to 17 years of age. This ER model was re-estimated for the new paediatric data from study 1218-0091 using full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian estimation methods, with prior distributions defined from the point estimates and uncertainty of the adult ER model for model parameters without direct support from the paediatric data. Specifically, the AUCss producing half maximal inhibitory effect (AUC50) was estimated with an informative prior, while all other parameters were estimated with weakly informative priors. Additional effects for covariates were explored graphically and estimated as necessary to explain potential biases in the characterization of change in HbA1c observed in the paediatric population.

The previous model was used as a starting point and consisted of a simple HbA1c turnover process with an effect of a wash-out as an additive zero-order process. Linagliptin was allowed to inhibit the production of HbA1c through an inhibitory maximum effect (Emax) model. Linagliptin AUCss was simulated for all PK patients to drive the ER model using their individual parameter estimates. Specifically, AUCss were derived by integrating over the individual concentration-time profile for an interval of 24 hours, under steady-state conditions, and their assigned linagliptin dose. Metformin and insulin were modelled as simple time-invariant effects that proportionally adjusted the zero-order production of HbA1c and baseline HbA1c. Given Study 1218-0091 includes a 2-week run-in period with an open-label placebo, the effect of washout was not estimated in the current analysis (i.e., no wash-out effect in current data).

The final ER model parameters are shown in Table 3. Model performances were evaluated by using predictive checks and Bayesian diagnostics with prior insulin co-therapy than those without.

The final model provided a reasonable description of the data, as judged by visual inspection of model diagnostic plots. VPCs demonstrated that the model provided an adequate description of HbA1c over time across all dose levels, treatment arms, and covariates of interest in Study 1218.56 and 1218-2019 (DINAMO).

Parameter estimates were compared between the previous and current models with paediatric data from Study 1218.91. Using the previous and current models, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare population-level placebo-adjusted HbA1c change from baseline at 26 weeks in adults and paediatric patients.

## 5.2. Results

## Descriptive and population PK (popPK) analysis

The PK results in children and adolescents from Phase III study 1218-0091 and Phase I study 1218-0056 were compared to the data previously obtained in adult T2DM patients by (i) descriptive analysis and (ii) based on a population PK (popPK) model, which included data from both studies in paediatric T2DM patients as well as several studies in adult T2DM patients [c39218172].

In Study 1218-0056, steady-state linagliptin trough levels in the linagliptin 5 mg group were higher than in the linagliptin 1 mg group, with gMean trough levels of 7.42 nmol/L (gCV 98.5%) and 3.80 nmol/L (gCV 69.9 %), respectively (see Figure 1). Linagliptin plasma levels increased less than dose proportional. For the 4 patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group for whom rich PK sampling data were available for non-compartmental PK analysis, AUC τ, ss values were between 152 nmol·h/L and 306 nmol·h/L. The accumulation-based half-lives ranged from 8.15 h to 29.4 h. For the 2 patients in the linagliptin 1 mg group with rich PK sampling the AUC τ, ss values were 142 nmol·h/L and 148 nmol·h/L. The accumulation-based half-lives were 29.1 h and 108 h, respectively.

<!-- image -->

In Phase III Study 1218-0091, in total, there were 164 valid plasma samples available for the PK analysis of linagliptin. Variability of linagliptin plasma concentrations was considerably higher for samples taken pre-dose (week 26: gCV 124%; week 52: gCV 213%) than for samples taken post-dose (week 26: gCV 42.3%; and week 52: gCV 53.2%); hence, post-dose levels may better reflect potential inter-patient variability. Plasma concentrations at Week 52 were used for all descriptive subgroup analyses.

## Influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on linagliptin exposure.

The effect of demographic and baseline characteristics, including renal function (eGFR calculated by the Zappitelli-formula), age, body weight, BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical region, and country on linagliptin exposure was investigated descriptively in Study 1218-0091.

In addition, the impact of the most relevant co-medications, such as metformin and insulin, on linagliptin plasma concentrations was evaluated. Furthermore, the relationship between drug plasma concentrations and the occurrence of certain AEs was analysed descriptively.

Despite slight differences in gMean plasma concentrations, individual exposure values were largely overlapping between subgroups, suggesting no influence of renal function, age, sex, race, and region on linagliptin exposure within the investigated range. Exposure slightly increased with a body weight below 70 kg (see Figure 2). There was no influence of baseline medication on linagliptin exposure. Linagliptin exposure did not seem to have an influence on the occurrence of hypoglycaemia (see Figure 3).

Plasma concentrations of linagliptin in children and adolescents with T2DM were generally comparable to those previously observed in adult patients with T2DM.

## Population PK model c39218172

The popPK model c39218172 for paediatric patients with T2DM included the following covariates with an influence on the PK: linagliptin exposure was characterized as increasing with decreasing weight following allometric scaling; The parameter estimate for sex effect on CL/F suggested that linagliptin CL/F appeared to be higher in females, but the 95% CDIs included the null value (146 (94.4, 226)%) (Table 2).

Individual CL/F estimates for paediatric patients in the current model were consistent with individual CL/F estimates for paediatric patients in the previous model (Figure 4). Both groups of paediatric patients had lower individual CL/F estimates relative to adult patients in the previous model. Consistent with lower CL/F estimates for paediatric patients, Monte Carlo simulations indicated paediatric patients had slightly higher AUC ss values (19.9% higher) relative to adults. However, there was substantial overlap in the distribution of AUC ss between adult and paediatric patients, indicating that generally similar exposure can be achieved in the two patient populations given a linagliptin 5 mg dose (Figure 5).

The results of the popPK analysis were in line with the results from the descriptive analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Descriptive comparison of exposure by subgroups of covariates suggested no difference of the PK between children/adolescents and adults with respect to body weight, sex, and antidiabetic background therapy at baseline.

In summary, these analyses support the comparability of the PK between paediatric and adult T2DM patients.

## Exposure-response (ER) analysis

The final, re-estimated ER model was a disease progression model, and linagliptin effect was assumed to inhibit kin via an Emax model. The model was parameterized with a zero-order HbA1c synthesis rate (kin), and a constant HbA1c first-order degradation rate (HbA1c degradation rate constant (kout)). Paediatric patients requiring insulin showed higher HbA1c baseline as well as a more pronounced disease progression. This resulted in a larger simulated magnitude of placebo-adjusted change of HbA1c in patients requiring insulin. To account for the apparent disease progression observed in the paediatric data, the model was updated by including a time-dependent change in the synthesis process. Specifically, the synthesis rate (kin) changed over time by a zero-order process. Linagliptin effect was parameterized to inhibit kin via an Emax model. Insulin was included as a covariate, and insulin co-therapy at baseline was associated with a higher baseline HbA1c and a faster disease progression. Inter-individual variability (IIV) was included on baseline HbA1c and the disease progression parameter. A proportional residual error was also included.

In the comparison of paediatric and adult patients, paediatric patients had slightly lower maximum inhibition (Imax) compared to adults. In Monte Carlo simulations, the simulated placebo-adjusted change from baseline HbA1c in adults was larger than that of paediatric patients both without prior insulin use (median adult: -0.614%; paediatric: -0.409%), and with prior insulin use (median adult: -0.647%; paediatric: -0.527%), thus indicating a smaller drug effect for paediatric compared to adult patients. Variability in response was higher in paediatric patients.

At week 26 (timepoint of primary efficacy endpoint in 1218-0091), the difference in response between patients with and without prior insulin use was much larger in paediatric subjects compared to adults (median difference placebo corrected change from baseline adult: 0.033%; paediatric: 0.118%).

## 5.3. Discussion

In support of the variation, linagliptin PK was assessed in the two studies (1218-0056 and 1218-0091 (DINAMO)). The methods used for the quantification of linagliptin in plasma have been sufficiently validated. Method n00194391, used for analysis of samples from Phase I study 1218-0056, was also used in studies provided with the initial MAA for linagliptin. The robustness of the analysis was shown by the ISR results. It was indicated that the stability period covers the maximum storage period of the samples.

Linagliptin PK was assessed using descriptive analysis per study, and also by the use of a popPK model. The popPK model was developed based on a prior model containing PK data in adults and appears sufficiently validated.

Based on information from Phase II Study 1218-0056, total linagliptin exposure increased less than doseproportional between the 1 and 5 mg dose. This has also been observed for adults, and is thought to be due to the concentration dependent binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. As discussed and accepted in a previous Type II variation EMEA/H/C/WS1162, linagliptin 5 mg in the paediatric population showed superiority over 1 mg about trough DPP-4 inhibition and a numerically larger reduction concerning the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c.This provided support for the use of the 5 mg dose in the subsequent Phase III Study 1218-0091.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effect of demographic and baseline characteristics, including renal function, age, body weight, BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical region, and country, on linagliptin exposure was investigated descriptively in Study 1218-0091. Despite slight differences in mean plasma concentrations, individual exposure values were largely overlapping between subgroups, suggesting no influence of renal function, age, sex, race, and region on linagliptin exposure within the investigated range. Exposure slightly increased with a body weight below 70 kg. There was no influence of baseline medication on linagliptin exposure, and linagliptin exposure did not seem to have an influence on the occurrence of hypoglycaemia.

Of note, renal function was determined using the Zappitelli formula. This CysC-based GFR prediction equation is not often used but is reported to provide accurate estimations of GFR in comparison with the Schwartz method. It is known that the Cockcroft-Gold formula is suboptimal for estimating GFR in children. Also, in light of the limited importance of renal excretion for linagliptin (only 5% eliminated in urine), this aspect will not be pursued.

In the popPK model, descriptive comparison of exposure by subgroups of covariates suggested no difference in the PK between children/adolescents and adults concerning body weight, sex, and antidiabetic background therapy at baseline. In summary, these popPK analyses support the comparability of the linagliptin PK between paediatric and adult T2DM patients.

## Exposure-effect

The relationship between linagliptin exposure and HbA1c was investigated using a PK/PD model, which was modified from a previously developed model to which the new paediatric data were added. The model appears sufficiently validated.

In the comparison of paediatric and adult patients, paediatric patients had lower maximum inhibition (Imax) compared to adults. In Monte Carlo simulations, the simulated placebo-adjusted change from baseline HbA1c in adults was larger than that of paediatric patients both without prior insulin use (median adult: -0.614%; paediatric: -0.409%), and with prior insulin use (median adult: -0.647%; paediatric: 0.527%), thus indicating a smaller drug effect for paediatric compared to adult patients. Variability in response was higher in paediatric patients.

In summary, there was a smaller effect of linagliptin treatment observed in children compared to adults.

## 6. Clinical Efficacy aspects

This overview summarises the results from trials 1218.91 and 1218.56 (Table 1: 1). Trial 1218.91 (DINAMO TM ) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in children from 10 to ≤17 years of age (

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 : 1). Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., nonresponders) were re-randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg empagliflozin. The trial included a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg). Trial 1218.91 includes the main trial DINAMO TM  (presented in this dossier), and the ancillary trial DINAMO TM  Mono which is still ongoing. DINAMO TM  Mono includes treatment-naïve patients or patients who are not on active treatment and are treated with trial drug as monotherapy. The recruitment for DINAMO TM  Mono has been terminated early in agreement with the FDA due to recruitment challenges and because current information suggested no clinically meaningful difference between monotherapy versus add-on to metformin and/or insulin.

Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dose-finding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children and adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM.

The majority of the treated patients in 1218.91 (91.1%, 143 of 157) and 29.7% of the treated patients (11 of 37) in 1218.56 took metformin as background antidiabetic medication at baseline. In trial 1218.91, 63 of the 143 patients on metformin also took insulin as an antidiabetic background medication (in total 63 of 157 treated patients, 40.1%). In addition, 5 of 157 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication.

Based on the results of the paediatric clinical programme, BI intends to seek to include results into the product information (information on clinical trials) for linagliptin and linagliptin/metformin for the treatment of paediatric patients with T2DM.

Figure 1: 1 Overview of the trial design for 1218.91

<!-- image -->

Data of these 2 trials were not pooled for efficacy analyses. Reasons were the different time point of primary endpoint assessment (1218.91: at 26 weeks; 1218.56: at 12 weeks) and because trial 1218.56 was discontinued prior to complete recruitment based on a predefined interim analysis to allow early elimination of the potentially ineffective lowest dose of linagliptin 1 mg.

## Assessors comments

Trial 1218.91 (DINAMO TM ) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in children from 10 to ≤17 years of age. The design is complex but acceptable because it answered the call from regulators and experts for multi-arm efficacy and safety studies in paediatric patients, given the recruitment challenges in this population.

Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., non-responders) were rerandomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increased to 25 mg empagliflozin. The trial also included a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg).

Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dosefinding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children and adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM.

In addition to the safety analyses of trials 1218.91 and 1218.56 presented in the CTRs, safety data of the 2 trials were pooled into 2 groupings:

- SAF-p1 (all patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg up to Week 52) provides a complete account of observed safety data for linagliptin 5 mg over the entire treatment duration
- SAF-p2 (placebo-controlled trials up to Week 26) provides a comprehensive comparison of linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo

## Bayesian analysis

In December 2021, BI performed a blinded variability assessment of the primary endpoint in trial 1218.91 with available data for 141 patients. The observed blinded standard deviation (SD = 1.65%) was considerably higher than the anticipated covariate-adjusted SD = 0.9% in the sample size determination in the CTP. Consequently, reduced power could be expected for the primary analysis of DINAMO TM  unless a greater treatment effect than anticipated was to be observed. Therefore, BI performed supplemental

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyses to trial 1218.91 using Bayesian borrowing from simulated paediatric patients with T2DM based on exposure-response analyses of historical adult and paediatric patients with T2DM treated with linagliptin [c39218174]. The objective was to provide supportive evidence for the effectiveness of linagliptin in paediatric patients. Linagliptin has been extensively studied in adult populations, and welldeveloped PK/PD models supported inference in a paediatric population.

Bayesian analyses were performed using 2 different methods to derive the prior distribution for the placebo-corrected treatment effect. One method was to use pharmacometric modelling of the exposureresponse relationship of linagliptin based on available historical data in adult and paediatric patients with T2DM by simulating individual and placebo-corrected mean changes in HbA1c in a paediatric population with baseline characteristics matching the DINAMO TM  population in relevant covariates.

The second approach used the placebo-corrected treatment effects reported for paediatric populations with T2DM treated with sitagliptin to inform the prior distribution. In both approaches, the prior distribution was robustified with a weakly-informative mixture component to allow for the possibility of prior-data conflict. The decision rule to conclude superior efficacy was a posterior probability of 97.5% of the placebo-corrected treatment effect being less than 0, as measured by the change in HbA1c.

## EMA and compliance with the PIP

The PIP (EMEA-000498-PIP01-08-M10) for linagliptin contains waivers for children &lt;10 years and requires clinical trials to investigate T2DM in the paediatric population. For trial 1218.56, the PDCO confirmed that BI had conducted and performed the trial according to the agreed PIP 000498-PIP01-08 and the respective key binding elements. A statement of compliance with the agreed completed PIP is pending at the time of finalisation of this document.

## FDA and compliance with the post-marketing requirement and written request

Based on the medical need of paediatric patients with T2DM and to address the Pediatric Research Equity Act requirements, trials in paediatric patients have been agreed with the FDA as post-marketing requirements (1218.91 and 1218.56). Furthermore, the FDA issued a written request (trial 1218.91). All trial elements are met as agreed with the FDA as part of the paediatric post-marketing requirements and written request.

All trials were performed in compliance with GCP and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and BI standard operating procedures. All CTPs were approved by institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. In accordance with GCP and according to the local regulatory and legal requirements, informed consent/assent was obtained from all patients/parent(s) or the patient's legally accepted representative.

## Efficacy endpoints and analysis methods

Trial 1218.91

The following efficacy endpoints were defined for the pivotal phase III trial 1218.91 (DINAMO TM ). All HbA1c values were obtained from an NGSP-certified laboratory.

Primary confirmatory endpoint: the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks

Secondary endpoints:

- Change in FPG (mg/dL) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks
- Change in body weight (kg) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Change in SBP (mmHg) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks
- Change in DBP (mmHg) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks
- Proportion of patients who achieve HbA1c &lt;6.5% at the end of 26 weeks
- Proportion of patients who achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0% at the end of 26 weeks

Further endpoints:

- Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to the end of 12 and 52 weeks
- Change in FPG (mg/dL) from baseline to the end of 52 weeks
- Change in body weight (kg) from baseline to the end of 12 and 52 weeks
- Change in SBP (mmHg) from baseline to the end of 12 and 52 weeks
- Change in DBP (mmHg) from baseline to the end of 12 and 52 weeks

•

Proportion of patients who achieve HbA1c &lt;6.5% at the end of 52 weeks

- Proportion of patients who achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0% at the end of 52 weeks
- Proportion of patients who achieve HbA1c reduction of &gt;0.5% at the end of 26 and 52 weeks (introduced with Global Amendment 1)
- Proportion of patients who initiate glycaemic rescue therapy up to 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Any new antidiabetic therapy, any dose increase of basal insulin of more than 0.1 IU/kg above the baseline prescribed dose for more than 21 consecutive days was considered rescue therapy
- Change in fasting serum C-peptide from baseline to the end of 26 and 52 weeks
- Change in urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) (mg/g creatinine) from baseline to the end of 26 and 52 weeks
- Change in eGFR (mL/min/1.73m²) from baseline to the end of 26 and 52 weeks
- Change in HbA1c (%) from Week 12 to the end of 26 weeks in patients randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg and not achieving glycaemic target at Week 12

The primary endpoint was analysed based on an ANCOVA model using multiple imputation with consecutive 'wash-out' (primary hypotheses for TG1; see Figure 4: 1 box with dashed red borderline) and 'inverse probability weighting' approaches (secondary hypotheses for TG2 and TG3; see Figure 4: 1 box with dashed red borderline). The 'wash-out' approach imputed missing off-treatment values in active treatment groups based on the primary endpoint distribution in the placebo group. The hypotheses were tested hierarchically in a confirmatory setting. The primary family of hypotheses consisted of 2 pairwise comparisons of the treatment effect of empagliflozin pooled doses versus placebo and linagliptin versus placebo (TG1), followed by the secondary family of hypothesis comparing the effect of each empagliflozin dose regimen with placebo (TG2 and TG3). To test the primary hypotheses, the effect of linagliptin and of empagliflozin was compared with placebo at an overall α of 0.05 (2-sided) using the Hochberg method to account for multiple testing. Only after achieving statistically significant results for both comparisons in the 'wash-out' approach, were the secondary hypotheses (ANCOVA with 'wash-out' plus 'inverse probability weighting' approach) tested to compare the individual empagliflozin doses versus placebo.

Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses were based on the mITT set and included all treated patients who had a baseline HbA1c value. Patients were analysed as randomised and including all HbA1c measurements regardless of adherence to treatment or the use of rescue medication.

Baseline was defined as the last observed measurement prior to administration of any initially randomised trial medication at Day 1.

## Assessors comments

In trial 1218.56, the primary endpoint of the final analysis was the change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 12 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoint of the final analysis was the PD endpoint DPP-4 inhibition (%) at the trough at steady state.

In trial 1218.91, the primary confirmatory endpoint was the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks. Secondary endpoints include the change in fasting glucose (mg/dL) and change in body weight (kg) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks.

## Trial 1218.56

The primary endpoint of the final analysis was the change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 12 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoint of the final analysis was the PD endpoint DPP-4 inhibition (%) at trough at steady state. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in FPG after 12 weeks of treatment.

## Patient characteristics

Although this clinical overview focuses on data for linagliptin compared with placebo, the entire patient population is described in this section, including the empagliflozin pooled group, to provide the characteristics of all patients in this trial.

Trial 1218.91

Trial 1218.91 was carried out at 78 clinical sites in 13 countries in Asia, Europe, North and South America. In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled (52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment (

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 : 1). The initial randomisation was stratified by age and sex. The re-randomisations at Week 14 and Week 26 were stratified by the age documented at the initial randomisation. All but 1 randomised patient (linagliptin group, withdrawal from trial) were treated with at least 1 dose of trial medication.

The majority of patients (140 patients, 89.2%) completed the planned observation time of 55 weeks (regardless of completion of planned treatment with trial medication). The majority of patients remained on treatment with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 (130 patients, 82.8%). The frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations were generally comparable across treatment groups. The most common reason for premature discontinuation of trial medication was the withdrawal by the patient (Week 26: 10 patients, 6.4%; Week 52: 16 patients, 10.2%). Based on TG6 (complete active treatment period excluding placebo), the median exposure to active trial medication up to Week 52 was 362 days (about 12 months; min: 1 day, max: 393 days), with 58.3% of patients treated for at least 46 weeks with active trial medication.

As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were &lt;15 years of age (i.e., 76 patients, 48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e., 97 patients, 61.8%). The mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9). More than half of the patient population participated in North America (mostly USA). Most patients were White (78 patients, 49.7%) or Black/African American (49 patients, 31.2%).

About half of the patients (80 patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced distribution across treatment groups. Thus, the majority of the treated patients in trial 1218.91 (91.1%, 143 of 157) took metformin as antidiabetic background medication at baseline.

Patients with insufficient glycaemic control of HbA1c ≥6.5% and ≤10.5% could participate in this trial. About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of &lt;8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 25.5%) or of &gt;9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean baseline FPG was 158.70 mg/dL (SD 55.56). As per the inclusion criteria, patients had to be negative for both islet cell antigen auto-antibodies and glutamic acid decarboxylase auto-antibodies. Most patients had been diagnosed with T2DM for 1 to 3 years (66 patients, 42.0%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m 2  (SD 8.33). The mean body weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric population. The mean fasting C-peptide values at baseline were 0.9932 nmol/L. The mean eGFR was 129.79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Normal UACR (&lt;30 mg/g crea) was reported for 73.9% of patients, while 21.0% of patients had microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/g crea), and 3.8% had macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg/g crea). The modified Tanner staging was used to assess the patient's pubertal stage; a total of 93 patients (59.2%) had a Tanner stage of 5 (i.e., fully developed) and 64 patients (40.8%) had a Tanner stage of 2 to 4 (i.e., partially developed). Demographic and clinical characteristics were generally balanced between the randomised treatment groups.

## Trial 1218.56

Overall, 83 patients were enrolled. Of those, 39 patients were randomised and treated (placebo: 15 patients; linagliptin 1 mg: 10 patients; linagliptin 5 mg: 14 patients). Three of the treated patients (7.7%) prematurely discontinued trial medication; none of these patients discontinued because of AEs.

Of the 39 patients, 21 patients (53.8%) were female. Most of the patients were from study centres in Europe (18 patients, 46.2%) or South America (12 patients, 30.8%). The majority of patients were White (23 patients, 59.0%). The mean age at screening was 14.0 years (SD 1.9 years). The mean baseline weight was 79.8 kg (SD 22.2 kg; range: 47 to 139 kg); Almost all pa tients were obese (BMI SDS ≥2: 25 patients, 64.1%) or overweight (BMI SDS 1.28 to &lt;2: 8 patients, 20.5%). The mean HbA1c at baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was 7.86% (SD 0.95%). The mean baseline FPG was 152.7 mg/dL (SD 45.6 mg/dL). Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. Mean baseline HbA1c (%) was numerically greater in the linagliptin 1 mg group (8.22 [SD 0.93]) than in the placebo group (7.60 [SD 0.92]) and linagliptin 5 mg group (7.87 [SD 0.98]). Slight differences between treatment groups were not unexpected due to the small sample size.

Overall, 29.7% of the treated patients (11 of 37) in 1218.56 took metformin as background antidiabetic medication at baseline.

## Assessors comments

## Trial 1218.91

In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled (52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. The majority of patients remained on treatment with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 (130 patients, 82.8%).The frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations were generally comparable across treatment groups.

As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were &lt;15 years of age (i.e., 76 patients, 48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e., 97 patients, 61.8%). The mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9). About half of the patients (80 patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced distribution across treatment groups.

Although the study was done in multiple geographic regions (North America, South America, Europe, and Asia), most participants were enrolled in the Americas, which limits generalizability to the broader worldwide population of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes.

About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of &lt;8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 25.5%) or of &gt;9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric population.

## Trial 1218.56

Overall, 83 patients were enrolled. Of those, 39 patients were randomised and treated (placebo: 15 patients; linagliptin 1 mg: 10 patients; linagliptin 5 mg: 14 patients). Three of the treated patients (7.7%) prematurely discontinued trial medication; none of these patients discontinued because of AEs.

Of the 39 patients, 21 patients (53.8%) were female. The mean age at screening was 14.0 years (SD 1.9 years). The mean baseline weight was 79.8 kg (SD 22.2 kg; range: 47 to 139 kg); Almost all patients were obese (BMI SDS ≥2: 25 patients, 64.1%) or overwei ght (BMI SDS 1.28 to &lt;2: 8 patients, 20.5%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.86% (SD 0.95%). The mean baseline FPG was 152.7 mg/dL (SD 45.6 mg/dL). Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. Mean baseline HbA1c (%) was numerically greater in the linagliptin 1 mg group (8.22 [SD 0.93]) than in the placebo group (7.60 [SD 0.92]) and linagliptin 5 mg group (7.87 [SD 0.98]). We agree with the MAH that slight differences between treatment groups were not unexpected due to the small sample size.

Overall, 29.7% of the treated patients (11 of 37) in 1218.56 took metformin as background antidiabetic medication at baseline.

Several subgroups may be too small to establish efficacy.

## 6.2. Results

## Trial 1218.91 (DINAMO TM )

Although this clinical overview focuses on data for linagliptin compared with placebo, the entire patient population (including the empagliflozin pooled group) is described for certain endpoints in this section to mirror the primary analyses which included testing of both active substances versus placebo.

## Primary confirmatory endpoint

The hierarchical testing results for DINAMO TM  are shown in Figure 4: 2. Based on TG1 (box with dashed red borderline in Figure 4: 2), the treatment effect of linagliptin 5 mg compared with placebo was not statistically significant, while the effect of empagliflozin treatment (pooled) was clinically meaningful and statistically superior to placebo in lowering HbA1c from baseline after 26 weeks (Table 4: 1). Since the primary hypotheses based on TG1 could not be both rejected, the hierarchical testing for TG2 and TG3 was not continued (Table 4: 1).

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint

Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint showed results consistent with the primary analyses (Figure 4: 3). For linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo, the primary analysis results were consistent across the subgroups, as the point estimates of all subgroups were included in the 95% CI of the overall population [c38245139, Figure 15.2.1.3: 1].

## Bayesian borrowing analysis

Population simulations based on the previously-fitted pharmacometric models resulted in a population mean treatment effect estimate for linagliptin of -0.64%, with a standard error of the mean of 0.02%. Prior standard deviations were set at values in excess of the simulation-based standard errors in order to conform to the prespecified effective sample size constraint. Prior distributions were updated with the DINAMO TM  data (trial 1218.91) to obtain posterior distributions.

The posterior mean of the placebocorrected treatment effect for linagliptin was -0.51% (95% credible interval: -0.92%, -0.05%), and there was a 98% posterior probability of superior efficacy. This result provided evidence for superior efficacy at the prespecified evidence threshold using the prespecified weight (65%) for the informative component of the prior based on the pharmacometric simulation results. In the tipping point sensitivity analysis, the posterior probability of superior efficacy decreased with decreasing weight used for the informative component of the prior, but point estimates showed a numerically beneficial effect across all sensitivity analyses.

In conclusion, the Bayesian borrowing analysis based on the exposure-response provided evidence for superior efficacy of linagliptin with an overall probability for superiority of 0.98, with a point estimate of -0.51% and 95% credible interval (-0.92%, -0. 05%) [c39218174].

Fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure

All secondary endpoints were exploratory; a summary of the results is provided in Table 4: 2. The trend for changes in FPG was consistent with HbA1c. For linagliptin, the analysis of FPG did not show a relevant difference at Week 26 when compared with baseline values. The sensitivity analysis for FPG based on OC instead of OC-AD-BOCF showed the same trend [c38245139, Table 15.2.2: 7].

No obvious changes over time in body weight, SBP, and DBP were observed for linagliptin versus placebo (Table 4: 2).

## Endpoints related to HbA1c

The proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c &lt;6.5% or &lt;7.0% at the end of 26 weeks and 52 weeks and the proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c reduction of &gt;0.5% in absolute value at the end of 26 and 52 weeks are summarised in Figure 4: 4.

At Week 26, there were only small differences between linagliptin 5 mg and placebo in the proportion of patients reaching a response based on HbA1c (&lt;6.5% or &lt;7.0%).

Source data: [c38245139, Tables 15.2.2: 5 and 6; Appendix 16.1.13.1, Tables 8.2 to 8.5]

In the placebo group, mean HbA1c increased over the 26 weeks by 0.68%, indicating rapid disease progression despite that the majority of patients (94.3%) had background metformin and/or insulin treatment at baseline. The reduction in HbA1c in the linagliptin group was apparent at the first assessment (Week 4) and the difference to placebo appeared to be maintained up to Week 26. From Week 26 to 52, no control using placebo was available due to the trial design; the trend in the linagliptin group was consistent with that from Week 12 to 26 (Figure 4: 5).

## Glycaemic rescue therapy

The use of rescue therapy was defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria:

- Any new addition of antidiabetic therapy introduced after the first dose of study treatment
- Any total daily dose increase of basal insulin of more than 0.1 IU/kg above the baseline prescribed dose for more than 21 consecutive days

Up to Week 26, the proportion of patients who initiated glycaemic rescue therapy was comparable between placebo (6 patients, 11.3%) and linagliptin 5 mg (4 patients, 7.7%). Up to Week 52 (long-term analysis for the active substances based on the initial randomisation), 11 patients (21.2%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group initiated glycaemic rescue therapy; 7 of these 11 patients initiated glycaemic rescue after Week 26.

## C-peptide, UACR, and eGFR

No obvious changes over time in fasting serum C-peptide, UACR, or eGFR were observed for any treatment group in this trial.

## Assessors comments

For the primary end point, the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -0.34% (95% CI -0.99 - 0.30, p=0.2935).

For the secondary outcomes, the adjusted mean change in FPG was -5.4 mg/dL (-0.3 mmol/L; 28-49 to 17.67 [-1-58 to 0-98)) for linagliptin versus placebo. At Week 26, there were only small differences between linagliptin 5 mg and placebo in the proportion of patients reaching a response based on HbA1c (&lt;6.5% or &lt;7.0%).

The adjusted mean change in bodyweight from baseline to week 26 was 1.46 kg (-0.48 to 3.41 in the linagliptin versus placebo group. The adjusted mean change in systolic blood pressure with linagliptin versus placebo was 0.91 mm Hg (-2.40 to 4.22). No decreases in diastolic blood pressure from baseline were observed.

## Trial 1218.56

There was a dose-dependent, placebo-corrected median HbA1c change from baseline at Week 12 of 0.55% with linagliptin 1 mg and of -0.80% with linagliptin 5 mg in trial 1218.56 [c02827550]. Furthermore, there was a placebo-corrected median FPG change from baseline at Week 12 of +10.0 mg/dL with linagliptin 1 mg and of -24.5 mg/dL with linagliptin 5 mg; the reduction in FPG in the linagliptin 5 mg group is considered clinically meaningful.

Linagliptin at a dose of 5 mg once daily showed an inhibition of DPP-4. In the linagliptin 5 mg group, median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 78.9% (interquartile range 67.7 to 84.0%). This degree of DDP-4 inhibition is in line with the data obtained for linagliptin in adults at the therapeutic dose regimen of 5 mg once daily. In studies 1218.5 [U08-3761] and 1218.6 [U08-1056], the median DPP-4 inhibition after 12 weeks of treatment at 5 mg once daily was 82.5% and 85.0%, respectively. In trial 1218.56, the degree of DPP-4 inhibition by linagliptin 1 mg once daily (median inhibition: 38.4% [interquartile range 26.9 to 48.8%]) was clearly lower than by linagliptin 5 mg once daily. The inhibition observed for the 1 mg dose in the current trial was lower than the inhibition observed in 2 studies in adults evaluating the 1 mg dose level. In trial 1218.6 [U08-1056] and trial 1218.2 [U06-1139], the median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 62.0% and 60.0%, respectively.

## Assessors comments

There was a dose-dependent, placebo-corrected median HbA1c change from baseline at Week 12 of -0.55% with linagliptin 1 mg and of -0.80% with linagliptin 5 mg. In addition, in the linagliptin 5 mg group, median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 78.9% (interquartile range 67.7 to 84.0%). This degree of DDP 4 inhibition is in line with the data obtained for linagliptin in adults. Overall, the efficacy and PD data obtained in the paediatric trial 1218.56 were consistent with those in adults with T2DM.

## 6.3. Discussion

## Dose finding study

Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dose-finding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children and adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM.

In trial 1218.56, the primary endpoint of the final analysis was the change from baseline in HbA1c (%) after 12 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoint of the final analysis was the PD endpoint DPP-4 inhibition (%) at trough at steady state. Trial 1218.91

Overall, 83 patients were enrolled. There was a dose-dependent, placebo-corrected median HbA1c change from baseline at Week 12 of -0.55% with linagliptin 1 mg and of -0.80% with linagliptin 5 mg. In addition, in the linagliptin 5 mg group, median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 78.9% (interquartile range 67.7 to 84.0%). This degree of DDP 4 inhibition is in line with the data obtained for linagliptin in adults.

## Design phase 3 trial

Trial 1218.91 (DINAMO TM ) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in children from 10 to ≤17 years of age. The design is complex, but acceptable, because it answered the call from regulators and experts for multi-arm efficacy and safety studies in paediatric patients, given the challenges of recruitment in this population.

Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., non responders) were rerandomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg empagliflozin. The trial also included a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg).

## Endpoints

In trial 1218.91, primary confirmatory endpoint was the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks. Secondary endpoints include the change in fasting glucose (mg/dL) and change in body weight (kg) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks.

## Patients

In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled (52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment.

As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were &lt;15 years of age (i.e., 76 patients, 48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e., 97 patients, 61.8%). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9). About half of the patients (80 patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced distribution across treatment groups.

Although the study was done in multiple geographic regions (North America, South America, Europe, and Asia), most participants were enrolled in the Americas, which limits generalizability to the broader worldwide population of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes.

About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of &lt;8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 25.5%) or of &gt;9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric population.

## Results

For the primary end point, the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -0.34% (95% CI -0.99 - 0.30, p=0.2935).

For the secondary outcomes, the adjusted mean change in FPG was -5.4 mg/dL (-0.3 mmol/L; -28-49 to 17.67 [-1-58 to 0-98)) for linagliptin versus placebo. At Week 26, there were only small differences between linagliptin 5 mg and placebo in the proportion of patients reaching a response based on HbA1c (&lt;6.5% or &lt;7.0%).

The adjusted mean change in bodyweight from baseline to week 26 was 1.46 kg (-0.48 to 3.41 in the linagliptin versus placebo group. The adjusted mean change in systolic blood pressure with linagliptin versus placebo was 0.91 mm Hg (-2.40 to 4.22). No decreases in diastolic blood pressure from baseline were observed.

Several factors might explain the reduced responsiveness to Linagliptin in young people with type 2 diabetes. First, there is a combination of the early development of insulin resistance and more rapid deterioration of beta-cell function in children and adolescents compared with adults with type 2 diabetes. Further, the added physiological insulin resistance of puberty is present in adolescents and not adults. Last, BMI in youth onset type 2 diabetes is often higher than in adults with type 2 diabetes.

## Conclusion

The 12-week dose-finding trial 1218.56 showed clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c at Week 12 in the linagliptin 5 mg group. However, in the 26-week Phase III trial 1218.91, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin was not associated with a relevant reduction in HbA1c (-0.34%, p = 0.2935).

## 7. Clinical Safety aspects

## 7.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Analyses for SAF-p1 and SAF-p2

In addition to the safety analyses in the individual trials (see Table 1: 1), the safety data of the 2 trials were pooled as SAF-p1 and SAF-p2 and described below with a focus on SAF-p2 (placebo-controlled trials up to Week 26).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety analyses followed the 'treatment-emergent' principle and included all treated patients. Unless otherwise specified, treatment was assigned as randomised, and the analyses of AEs were based on the number of patients with AEs. AE analyses were restricted to on-treatment AEs, defined as AEs with an onset date between the first trial medication intake and 7 days after the last intake, unless otherwise stated. Exposure-adjusted AEs were also displayed as incidence rates per 100 patient-years.

## Standard AE summaries

In SAF-p2, the median exposure to the trial medication was 181.5 days for placebo and 180.5 days for linagliptin 5 mg, in the placebo-controlled period. In SAF-p1, the median exposure to linagliptin 5 mg was 359.0 days, with a maximum of 378 days. Total exposure to linagliptin 5 mg was 58.5 years. Most patients in SAF-p1 (82.9%) and SAF-p2 (78.4%) came from trial 1218.91.

In SAF-p2, the rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable, as were the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs (Table 5: 1).

Source data: [c39747995, Table 5.1.1.1]

## Most frequently reported AEs

In SAF-p2, on the PT level, the most frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache (8 patients, 11.8%) and hypoglycaemia, vitamin D deficiency, diarrhoea, and cough (each reported for 5 patients, 7.4%). In the linagliptin 5 mg group, the most frequently reported AEs by PT were headache (13 patients, 19.7%), hypoglycaemia (11 patients, 16.7%), vomiting (5 patients, 7.6%), and abdominal pain and increased blood ketone body (each 4 patients, 6.1%).

The only imbalance in rates of AEs by PT between the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups was in the rate of hypoglycaemia, which was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. For other AEs, by PT, there were no relevant differences in rates for placebo compared with the linagliptin 5 mg group.

The rates and pattern of AEs reported for the linagliptin 5 mg group (by SOC and PT) in SAF-p1 were comparable with the rates of AEs reported for the linagliptin 5 mg group in SAF-p2.

## Adverse events by intensity

In SAF-p2, the majority of adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, and rates of AEs by intensity were generally comparable between placebo and the linagliptin 5 mg groups. Severe AEs were reported for 3 patients (4.4%) on placebo and 1 patient (1.5%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group. In the linagliptin 5 mg group, the severe AE abdominal pain was not considered to be drug-related and was not an SAE. No severe AE was reported for &gt;1 patient in either treatment group. The results based on SAFp1 were generally comparable with SAF-p2.

## Drug-related adverse events

In SAF-p2, few AEs were reported as drug-related AEs and there were no relevant differences between the treatment groups with regard to rates or the pattern of reporting of drug-related AEs. On the PT level, few drug-related AEs were reported by &gt;1 patient. On placebo, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia were each reported for 2 patients (2.9%). Drug-related AEs reported for &gt;1 patient in the linagliptin 5 mg group were: hypoglycaemia (5 patients, 7.6%) and nausea and vulvovaginal mycotic infection (each reported for 2 patients, 3.0%). The results based on SAF-p1 were generally comparable with SAF-p2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## AEs leading to discontinuation

In SAF-p2, there were no AEs leading to discontinuation for patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group and 2 patients (2.9%) discontinued from placebo (PTs: acute pancreatitis, polyuria, and irregular menstruation, each reported for 1 patient [1.5%]). The results based on SAF-p1 were generally comparable with SAF-p2.

## SAEs

Based on SAF-p2, there was no relevant difference between groups with regard to SAEs. Three patients (4.4%) on placebo and 2 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group had SAEs. Hyperglycaemia was reported as an SAE for 2 patients (2.9%) on placebo. No other SAE (on the PT level) was reported for &gt;1 patient in either treatment group.

No patient had any fatal AE (Table 5: 1). One patient (on placebo) had 6 SAEs that were considered to be life-threatening (PTs: acute pancreatitis [onset Day 24], and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, and hypovolaemic shock; all with an onset on Day 25).

Based on SAF-p1, SAEs were reported for 8 patients (9.8%) on linagliptin 5 mg. Diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in 2 patients (2.4%); all other SAEs were each reported for 1 patient (1.2%) (PTs: asthma, increased blood glucose, breast abscess, chorioretinitis, hyperglycaemia, and pneumomediastinum).

## Assessors comments

## Exposure

The median exposure to the trial medication was 181.5 days for placebo and 180.5 days for linagliptin 5 mg, in the placebo-controlled period.

## AEs

The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable. The most frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache (8 patients, 11.8%) and hypoglycaemia, vitamin D deficiency, diarrhoea, and cough (each reported for 5 patients, 7.4%).

patient in the linagliptin 5 mg group were: hypoglycaemia (5 patients, 7.6%) and nausea and vulvovaginal mycotic infection (each reported for 2 patients, 3.0%).

## AEs leading to discontinuation

There were no AEs leading to discontinuation for patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group and 2 patients (2.9%) discontinued from placebo.

## SAEs

There was no relevant difference between groups with regard to SAEs. Three patients (4.4%) on placebo and 2 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group had SAEs. Hyperglycaemia was reported as an SAE for 2 patients (2.9%) on placebo. No other SAE (on the PT level) was reported for &gt;1 patient in either treatment group.

No patient had any fatal AE.

## AESIs and specific AEs

AESIs (adverse events of special interest) and specific AEs that represent medical concepts were analysed in trials 1218.91 and 1218.56. Those AESIs common to both trials were analysed for the pooled safety. In addition, specific AEs for the pooled safety analyses were defined in the SCS SAP. For SAF-p1 and SAFp2, these medical concepts were analysed by MedDRA queries (SMQ, BIcMQ, HLGT, or HLT; or identified by the investigators.

In SAF-p2, with the exception of hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-controlled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups (Table 5: 3). In SAF-p2, the rate of hypoglycaemic events was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. However, based on data from trial 1218.91 (which comprised the majority of patients included in SAF-p2), there was no relevant difference between treatment groups with regard to rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. In SAF-p2, most patients with hypoglycaemic events had at least 1 event with plasma glucose values &lt;54 mg/dL. No patient had an event that required assistance. Note that most of the patients in SAF-p2 were on background antidiabetic medication. In SAF-p1, there was no relevant increase in rates of investigator-defined hypoglycaemia for patients on linagliptin 5 mg (16 patients, 19.5%) when compared with SAF-p2 (11 patients, 16.7%). No patient had any severe event that required assistance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In SAF-p2, no events were reported in the linagliptin group for pemphigoid in bullous conditions (HLTprimary path) and for pancreatitis (Table 5: 3).

## CEC-adjudicated events in trial 1218.91

Up to Week 26, 4 patients had events that met the criteria for adjudication for ketoacidosis and 1 event was confirmed as certain ketoacidosis (placebo). Four patients had events that met the criteria for adjudication for myocardial infarction and hospitalisation for heart failure; in all cases the outcome was not confirmed. No events met the criteria for adjudication for stroke or TIA, death, or hepatic injury.

Up to Week 52, 2 patients on linagliptin 5 mg had events that met the criteria for adjudication for ketoacidosis and were confirmed by the CEC (a further 5 patients had events that were not confirmed as diabetic ketoacidosis). One confirmed event was an AESI (the patient had a BMI of 42.9 kg/m 2  and had missed a week of insulin treatment before the diabetic ketoacidosis) and the other confirmed event was identified on the basis of elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate. No corresponding AE of increased betahydroxybutyrate or AESI of diabetic ketoacidosis was reported for this event. No further details, including laboratory results, therapy, and action taken with the trial medication, were available in the eCRF. This laboratory-related event was confirmed by the CEC as certain, moderate ketoacidosis.

One event met the criteria for adjudication for hepatic injury and was confirmed as mild to moderate hepatic injury (linagliptin 5 mg active); the CEC assessed the causality of hepatic injury as unlikely, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the event was mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and the patient recovered. Three patients had events that met the criteria for adjudication for myocardial infarction and hospitalisation for heart failure; no event was confirmed by the CEC. No events met the criteria for adjudication for stroke or TIA, or death.

## Clinical laboratory evaluation

The pooled analysis of safety laboratory data was limited to frequency of possibly clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) based on BI standard criteria. There were no relevant differences between placebo and linagliptin 5 mg with regard to changes in safety laboratory parameters.

In trial 1218.91, there were no notable changes in cholesterol or triglyceride values from baseline to Week 52 in any treatment group and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups. There were no notable changes in IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and markers of bone turnover from baseline to Week 52 in any treatment group and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups. NTx, P1NP, IGF-1, and IGF-BP3 were analysed in subgroups according to sex and Tanner staging score at baseline. There were no relevant differences among treatment groups in subgroup analyses by sex and baseline Tanner score. For other safety laboratory parameters, differences between placebo and active treatment were consistent with the known safety profile of linagliptin. There were no notable differences with regard to frequencies of PCSAs between placebo and linagliptin.

In trial 1218.56, there were no clinically relevant findings concerning laboratory assessments.

## Vital signs

SBP and DBP are described as efficacy endpoints in trial 1218.91. No obvious changes over time in body SBP or DBP were observed for linagliptin versus placebo. There were no relevant differences between placebo and linagliptin in trial 1218.91 with regard to heart rate and growth assessments (weight, height, BMI, and growth velocity).

In trial 1218.56, there were no clinically relevant findings concerning vital signs.

## Safety in special situations

## Post-marketing experience

Linagliptin is not registered for commercial use in paediatric patients in any part of the world. Information on the post-marketing experience in adults is provided in the current PBRER.

Until the data lock point of 02 May 2022, off-label use of linagliptin in paediatric patients was documented for 44 patients. Off-label use of linagliptin/metformin (fixed-dose combination) in paediatric patients was documented for 9 patients. No relevant difference in the safety profile was observed between adults and paediatric patients below 18 years of age.

## Assessors comments

## AEs of special interest and specific AEs

AEs of special interest and specific AEs were hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema, angioedema like events, and anaphylaxis), skin lesions, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, hepatic injury, decreased renal function, hypoglycaemia, arthralgia, and pemphigoid in bullous conditions.

Except for hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebocontrolled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups.

The rate of hypoglycaemic events was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. However, based on data from trial 1218.91, there was no relevant difference between treatment groups concerning rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. No patient had an event that required assistance.

One event was confirmed as certain ketoacidosis (placebo).

No events were reported in the linagliptin group for pemphigoid in bullous conditions (HLTprimary path) and for pancreatitis.

One event met the criteria for adjudication for hepatic injury and was confirmed as mild to moderate hepatic injury (linagliptin 5 mg active); the CEC assessed the causality of hepatic injury as unlikely, and the event was mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and the patient recovered.

## Safety laboratory parameters

There were no relevant differences between placebo and linagliptin 5 mg with regard to changes in safety laboratory parameters In trial 1218.91, there were no notable changes in cholesterol or triglyceride values from baseline to Week 52 in any treatment group, and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups. There were no notable changes in IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and markers of bone turnover from baseline to Week 52 in any treatment group, and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups.

## 7.2. Discussion

## Exposure

The median exposure to the trial medication was 181.5 days for placebo and 180.5 days for linagliptin 5 mg, in the placebo-controlled period.

## AEs

The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable. The most frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache (8 patients, 11.8%) and hypoglycaemia, vitamin D deficiency, diarrhoea, and cough (each reported for 5 patients, 7.4%). In the linagliptin 5 mg group, the most frequently reported AEs by PT were headache (13 patients, 19.7%), hypoglycaemia (11 patients, 16.7%), vomiting (5 patients, 7.6%), and abdominal pain and increased blood ketone body (each 4 patients, 6.1%).

The only imbalance in rates of AEs by PT between the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups was in the rate of hypoglycaemia, which was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo.

## Severe AEs

Severe AEs were reported for 3 patients (4.4%) on placebo and 1 patient (1.5%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group.

## Drug-related AEs

Few AEs were reported as drug-related AEs and there were no relevant differences between the treatment groups with regard to rates or the pattern of reporting of drug-related AEs. On the PT level, few drug-related AEs were reported by &gt;1 patient. On placebo, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia were each reported for 2 patients (2.9%). Drug-related AEs reported for &gt;1 patient in the linagliptin 5 mg group were: hypoglycaemia (5 patients, 7.6%) and nausea and vulvovaginal mycotic infection (each reported for 2 patients, 3.0%).

## AEs leading to discontinuation

There were no AEs leading to discontinuation for patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group and 2 patients (2.9%) discontinued from placebo

## SAEs

There was no relevant difference between groups with regard to SAEs. Three patients (4.4%) on placebo and 2 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group had SAEs. Hyperglycaemia was reported as an SAE for 2 patients (2.9%) on placebo. No other SAE (on the PT level) was reported for &gt;1 patient in either treatment group. No patient had any fatal AE.

## AEs of special interest and specific AEs

AEs of special interest and specific AEs were hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema, angioedema like events, and anaphylaxis), skin lesions, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, hepatic injury, decreased renal function, hypoglycaemia, arthralgia, and pemphigoid in bullous conditions.

With the exception of hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebocontrolled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups.

The rate of hypoglycaemic events was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. However, based on data from trial 1218.91, there was no relevant difference between treatment groups with regard to rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. No patient had an event that required assistance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No events were reported in the linagliptin group for pemphigoid in bullous conditions (HLT-primary path) and for pancreatitis.

One event met the criteria for adjudication for hepatic injury and was confirmed as mild to moderate hepatic injury (linagliptin 5 mg active); the CEC assessed the causality of hepatic injury as unlikely, and the event was mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and the patient recovered.

## Safety laboratory parameters

There were no relevant differences between placebo and linagliptin 5 mg with regard to changes in safety laboratory parameters In trial 1218.91, there were no notable changes in cholesterol or triglyceride values from baseline to Week 52 in any treatment group and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups.

## Conclusion

The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable, as were the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs. Except for hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-controlled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups. No unexpected safety concerns were identified for linagliptin in the paediatric programme.
