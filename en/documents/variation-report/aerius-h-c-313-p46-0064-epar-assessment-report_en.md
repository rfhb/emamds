## 1. Introduction

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:

It concerns a submission according to the P-46 article of the EU Paediatric Regulation (EC No 1901/2006) i.e. the results of two clinical studies (P201 - P202) conducted in Japan with desloratadine as these studies included subjects that were younger than 18 years old.

These studies are not being submitted in support of a new pediatric indication for desloratadine in the EU.

## 2. Assessment of the post-authorisation measure P46-064

## P201

Study design: multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of desloratadine (DL) tablets in Japanese subjects 12 years and older with chronic urticaria.

Participants: 239 randomized subjects, including 11 subjects 12-17 years of age

Study medication: after the screening period, subjects meeting all eligibility criteria received study treatment orally for 2 weeks in a double-blinded manner. They were randomized to one of 3 treatments:

-  DL 10 mg once daily (10 mg group)
-  DL 5 mg once daily (5 mg group)
-  Placebo once daily (placebo group)

Primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in sum of pruritus/itch (either day- or nighttime whichever was higher than the other) and rash (overall assessment of rash) scores, as assessed by the (sub-) investigator at Week 2.

+ Study medication withdrawn.

Determined by the investigator to be related to the drug.

ASaT: All-subjects-as-treated.

DL: Desloratadine.

Treatment period starts from the first dose day of study medication until 14 follow-up days after the last dose day of study medication.

The incidence of adverse events was 30.0% (24/80 subjects) for DL 5 mg group, 22.8% (18/79 subjects) for DL 10 mg group and 20.3% (16/79 subjects) for placebo group. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 8.8% (7/80 subjects) for DL 5 mg group, 13.9% (11/79 subjects) for DL 10 mg group and 2.5% (2/79 subjects) for placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of drug-related somnolence was generally low : 3.8% (3/80) in DL 5 mg, 6.3% (5/79) in DL 10 mg and 2.5% (2/79) in the placebo group. Recovery occurred during the study drug treatment period or within 2 days from the final dose.

## No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.

The incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 0.0% for the DL 5 mg group, 0.0% for DL 10 mg group and 2.5% (2/79 subjects) for placebo group i.e. because of dermatitis contact and seasonal allergy.

One of the subjects 12-17 years old experienced 2 non serious adverse events, that were mild in intensity and resolved after completion of treatment i.e. pyrexia and nasopharyngitis. The investigator considered these events to be unrelated to the study drug.

## Conclusion on safety:

DL 10 mg and 5 mg administered once daily for 14 days were generally safe and well-tolerated.

## P202

Study design: multi-center, open-label long-term Phase III trial to study the safety and efficacy of desloratadine (DL) tablets in Japanese subjects 12 years and older with eczema/dermatitis and dermal pruritus who were treated up to 8 to 12 weeks.

Participants: 94 enrolled and treated subjects, including 10 subjects 12-17 years of age in the eczema/dermatitis group and 4 in the dermal pruritus group.

Study medication: after the screening period, subjects meeting all eligibility criteria received openlabel DL 5 mg once daily in an unblinded way.

After 4 weeks, an up-titration to DL up to 10 mg once daily was possible if the (sub-)investigator judged there was insufficient anti-pruritic efficacy and no safety concern. Only one dose increase was allowed from Week 4 (Visit 6) to Week 8 (Visit 8).

When DL was increased, the higher dose was maintained, but if the (sub-)investigator determined that there was a safety concern of the subject, dose reduction to DL 5 mg/day was allowed, depending on symptoms and the degree of severity of itching. After a dose reduction, no new increase of the dose was allowed.

Primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in the sum pruritus/itch scores (day- and nighttime), as assessed by the (sub-) investigator at Week 2.

## Efficacy Results: Primary endpoint:

Change from Baseline in Sum Pruritus/Itch Score (Sum of Daytime and Nighttime) Assessed by (Sub-) Investigator at Week 2 (FAS) (P202)

## Conclusion on efficacy :

A significant improvement from baseline in the primary endpoint sum score of pruritus/itch (sum of day- and nighttime) was observed both in the eczema/dermatitis group and the dermal pruritus group.

However, the significance of these data is limited as it concerned an open-label trial.

Study medication withdrawn.

Determined by the investigator to be related to the drug.

ASaT: All-subjects-as-treated.

Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences, a subject is counted only once within a category. The same subject may appear in different categories.

Treatment period starts from the first dose day of study medication until 14 follow-up days after the last dose day of study medication.

The incidence of adverse events was 53.8% (35/65 subjects) in the eczema/dermatitis group and 48.3% (14/29 subjects) in the dermal pruritus group.

The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 10.8% (7/65 subjects) in the eczema/dermatitis group and 3.4% (1/29 subjects) in the dermal pruritus group.

The most commonly reported drug-related adverse event was somnolence : 6.2% (4/65 subjects) in the eczema/dermatitis group, 0.0% (0/29 subjects) in the dermal pruritus group; all of them resolved during the study drug administration.

## No serious drug-related adverse events or deaths were reported.

One serious adverse event of mild skin neoplasm requiring hospitalization was reported in 1 subject in the eczema/dermatitis group which was considered as unrelated to study drug. The subject was recovered after surgical removal of the neoplasm.

Other AEs leading to discontinuation included acarodermatitis, gastroenteritis, and headache (in one subject each) in the eczema/dermatitis group and asteatotic eczema and back pain (in one subject each) in the dermal pruritus group. Among them, only the asteatotic eczema was considered as a drug-related AE. The event was mild and resolved after the discontinuation of the study drug.

## Dose increase

The dose of the study drug was increased to 10 mg once daily after Week 4 in 66 of 94 subjects (47 in the eczema/dermatitis group and 19 in the dermal pruritus group) in the trial. The incidence of an AE with and without dose up-titration in the groups was 51.5% (34/66 subjects) and 53.6% (15/28 subjects), respectively. Drug-related AEs developing after increased dose included laboratory adverse events in 3 subjects, one of whom was associated with dose reduction due to increased hepatic enzymes. All events were mild and resolved after completion of treatment.

In the eczema/dermatitis group, 6 of the subjects 12-17 years old experienced 9 non serious adverse events, most were mild in intensity and all resolved during study drug administration.

In the dermal pruritus group, 2 of the subjects 12-17 years old experienced 2 non serious adverse events, all were mild in intensity and most resolved during study drug administration.

The investigator considered all of these events to be unrelated to the study drug.

## Conclusion on safety:

DL 10 mg (increased dose) and 5 mg administered once daily for up to 8 to 12 weeks days were generally safe and well-tolerated.

## Assessment of the necessity for an update of the EU SmPC:

The 2 discussed studies (P201 and P202) have provided limited additional data on the efficacy and safety of desloratadine in a total of 25 subjects that were 12-17 years old.

The SmPC already contains the following information in this context:

-  4.2 'There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age'.
-  5.1 'The efficacy of Aerius/Azomyr/Neoclarityn has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients 12 through 17 years of age.'

The results of the study are covered by what is already mentioned in the SmPC about the efficacy of desloratadine in adolescent patients. Therefore, it is concluded that no update to the EU SmPC is necessary.
