## Introduction

Focetria  is  a  pandemic  H1N1v  vaccine.  The  strain  change  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  from  H5N1  to H1N1v was approved on 29/09/09 (EMEA/H/C/710/PU/05).

The current posology reflected in the product information was based initially on data from the mockup  H5N1  vaccine  and  data  from  clinical  trials  with  the  H1N1  vaccine  strain.  The  marketing authorisation  holder  (MAH)  continues  with  the  programme  of  H1N1  studies  to  fulfil  the  specific obligations  agreed  and  results  are  submitted  at  regular  timepoints.  In  this  framework,  the  CHMP assessed the interim analysis including immunogenicity and safety data as available on 28 October 2009 for  the  study  V111\\_03  in  children  and  adolescents.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  data,  the Committee considered that a type II variation should be submitted to update the product information (PI).  The  MAH applied for a variation to reflect the results of this study in the PI and to include a correction to the warning on subcutaneous use.

| 15ug_0       | 15µg HA H1N1sw       | without MF59      | (group C)   |

The primary objective of the study is to identify the preferred vaccine formulation (with or without MF59), dosage (1/2 vs 1 dose of antigen and adjuvant) and schedule (one or two administrations) of the  egg-derived  H1N1sw  monovalent  vaccine  in  healthy  children  and  adolescents  based  on  CHMP criteria and pairwise statistical comparisons for immunogenicity, safety and tolerability.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Clinical immunogenicity and safety Study design Study V111\\_03 is an ongoing, randomised, single-blind, dose-ranging study in infants, children and adolescents  from  6  months  to  17  years  of  age  aimed  to  evaluate  immunogenicity,  safety  and tolerability of different formulations of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted egg-derived, inactivated novel swine origin A/H1N1 monovalent subunit influenza virus vaccine in healthy subjects. The study includes 4 cohorts and recruitment started in parallel for subjects of cohorts 1-3 (17-9 years of age, 9-3 years of age, 3-1 year of age, respectively). Enrolment of the subjects in cohort 4 (children aged 6 to 11 months) started after 7-day safety and reactogenicity data of the first dose administered to the first 120 subjects enrolled in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 was assessed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Two doses of vaccine were administered intramuscularly (IM) three weeks apart. After approximately 12  months  from  the  first  vaccination,  all  subjects  will  receive  a  third  vaccine  dose  (booster).  All subjects will be analysed for safety and immunogenicity. Subjects will be followed until approximately 6 months after the last (booster) dose, for safety assessment. The vaccination groups were defined as noted below: Immunogenicity  analyses  were  based  on  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  and  subjects  were  analysed  as randomised.  Measurements  were  made  against  CHMP  criteria  as  determined  by  hemagglutination inhibition  (HI).  The  MAH  also  presented  data  for  measures  of  immunogenicity  as  determined  by microneutralisation (MN). Objectives

Secondary objectives include the evaluation of immunogenicity of a booster dose of the egg-derived H1N1sw monovalent influenza vaccine administered 12 months after the primary course with respect to  CHMP  criteria;  and  the  evaluation  of  the  non-inferiority  of  the  post-vaccination  (day  43)  HI, geometric  mean  titer  (GMT)  of  the  half  dose  (3.75  µg  of  HA  +  half  MF59)  of  the  egg  derived

1 HA = haemagglutinin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

H1N1sw monovalent vaccine to the corresponding GMTs of the full dose (7.5 µg of HA + full MF59) of the egg derived H1N1sw monovalent vaccine, after two doses administered 3 weeks apart in the pooled children population.

Safety  objectives  include  the  evaluation  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  egg-derived  H1N1sw monovalent vaccine for 3 weeks after first and second vaccination and up to 6 months after the last (booster) vaccination.

## Study population

The study population included healthy males and females aged 6 months to 17 years on the day of enrollment.  The  demographic  characteristics  of  the  different  cohorts  were  presented  and  no  major difference was detected across vaccination groups.

** available in database at cut-off for data inclusion (28 October 2009)

The data provided were used for the interim assessment of the effect of vaccination at day 22. Data were considered insufficient in the younger cohorts, while data for cohort 1 (children and adolescents aged 9-17 years of age) was considered sufficient. For cohort 1 some data at day 43 are also reported, however this was not considered for this assessment as they are presently very limited. Results for cohorts other than 1 are sometimes reported for completeness.

## GMR (HI)

The CHMP criteria were met with both formulations of the adjuvated vaccines. At day 22 GMRs are higher  in  subjects  seronegative  at  baseline.  Subjects  seropositive  at  baseline  show  higher  GMRs following  the  administration  of  the  full  dose  of  Focetria.  However  the  clinical  meaning  of  these observations is currently unclear.

## Safety

For  subjects  aged  3  to  17  years  (cohorts  1  and  2)  local  reactions  included  ecchymosis,  erythema, induration,  swelling  and  pain  at  injection  site  and  systemic  reactions  headache,  arthralgia,  chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, nausea and sweating.

For subjects aged 6 to 35 months (cohorts 3 and 4) local reactions comprised ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling and tenderness and systemic reactions sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting, irritability, change in eating habits, shivering and unusual crying.

There was no potentially life threatening event reported.

An overview on local and systemic reaction after the 1st and the 2nd vaccination is provided in the table below.

There was 1 subject in the group 3.75ug\\_50 (cohort 1) with a serious adverse event (mild appendicitis) reported  at  study  day  21  and  not  considered  related  to  study  vaccine.  The  second  vaccination  was delayed for this subject.

After the first dose (where more observations are available) the rates ranged from 31% to 58%. Data also suggested that local  reactions  are  slightly  higher  in  the  older  children  and  in  the  groups  receiving  the  full  dose, although the figures do not allow a conclusion to be made. The use of reduced dose of vaccine seems to  be  associated  with  a  slight  reduction  of  local  reactogenicity  in  subjects  above  3  years  of  age.  In younger  subjects  the  difference  is  not  observed.  Reactogenicity  at  the  second  dose  seemed  lower compared to the first  one,  however  data  are  too  scarse,  especially  in  the  younger  cohorts  to  allow conclusions in the reported events, such as fever. Body temperature will be reported with the threshold of ≥ 38-≥ 40 in the final report.

The proposed correction regarding subcutaneous (SC) use in section 4.4 of the SPC, labelling and PL was noted. No clinical data have been generated with the seasonal adjuvanted (Fluad) or pandemic adjuvanted (Focetria) vaccines with respect to the SC route of administration.

The  committee  noted  that  H1N1  data  in  adults  after administration of one dose of Focetria, and also in children and adolescents aged 9-17 years suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. Immunogenicity data from younger cohorts is also reassuring and reaching  CHMP criteria, although  numbers  are too small  to  allow any  definitive  conclusion at  this point  in  time.  This  is  in  line  with  the  evidence  seen  in  adults.  The  posology  section  was  therefore slightly reworded. The respective changes were introduced in the package leaflet (PL). A revision of the wording was submitted taking into account the results of the assessment and this was agreed with by the CHMP.

Adjuvanted  vaccines  are  known  to  have  a  higher  local  reactogenicity  than  the  unadjuvanted conventional  vaccines  and  when  Fluad  was  initially  licensed  in  Italy  in  1997  there  was  no contraindication for a SC injection. Such precaution was introduced during the mutual recognitition procedure in 2000 to reduce the theoretical risk of local reaction like e.g. pain or enduration which could be intensified if the injection is performed less deeply in the muscle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  27  reports  of  Fluad  given  SC  were  received  between  1998  and  2009,  an  average  of  1  to 5 reports per year:

- 1) 13 of these cases reported local adverse events, in most of them the size was not specified. In three of these 13 reports, the size of the local reaction was above 10 cm in diameter.
- 2)  Two  other  cases  showed  no  adverse  events  but  were  only  reported  because  of  the  incorrect administration route (i.e. SC instead of the recommended IM).
- 3) 3 reports were a report of fever and other systemic reactions which in MAH view has nothing to do with the SC route.
- 4)  9  reports  showed  features  like  cardiac  decompensation,  Henoch-Schoenlein-Purpura  and  others which may have not been linked with the SC route of administration.

Based on the exposure of several million subjects these reports were not considered a concern.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment Preliminary results from study V111\\_03 showed that the CHMP criteria were met, and in particular results were considered relevant for children and adolescents aged 9-17 years. In this cohort, 95% of subjects  were  seroprotected,  with  92%  seroconversion  or  significant  increase  and  GMR  of  43.  The subgroup analyses by baseline serostatus were reassuring with seronegative subjects also reaching the CHMP criteria. Therefore the data presented are reassuring in the fact that the use of a single full dose of Focetria in subjects aged 9-17 years may be sufficient. This is in line with the results seen in adults. Study V111\\_03 is on-going and further results will provide indications about the effect of the second dose and its potential benefit. The preliminary safety data after the first dose in children and adolescents 9-17 years of age suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation. Regarding reactogenicity,  it  is  noted  that  local  reactions  are  frequently  reported.  The  use  of  reduced  dose  of vaccine seems to be associated with a slight reduction of local reactogenicity in subjects above 3 years of age. In younger subjects the difference is not present. Reactogenicity after the second dose seemed lower  compared  to  the  first  one,  but  the  numbers  are  too  small  to  allow  definitive  conclusions. However, immunogenicity results of a second dose have not yet been completed and submitted. These data are awaited. Data  in  the  younger  cohorts  and  with  the  half  dose  were  still  considered  very  scarse  to  propose  a change in the posology, especially taking into account the results of the detailed subgroup analysis performed in adults. Based on the evidence submitted by the MAH regarding the amendment of the information on the SC administration, the revision of the wording of the product information to allow an alternative route of administration  to  be  considered  in  subjects  with  a  blood  disorder  or  under  a  therapy  for  which  IM injection is contraindicated was agreed with.
