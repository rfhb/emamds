## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

AGLU03606/LTS12869 : A Long-Term Study to Evaluate Growth and Development  Outcomes in Patients with Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease Who Are Receiving Alglucosidase Alfa  Long-Term Growth and Development Study of Alglucosidase Alfa.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## AGLU03606/LTS12869

## Description

## Methods

AGLU03606/LTS12869 was a Phase IV multicenter study of patients with IOPD who began alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to 1 year of age. Patients were followed in this study for up to 10 years.

## Study participants

## Main inclusion Criteria:

Confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease as determined by deficient endogenous GAA activity or GAA mutation analysis.

The patient must be &lt;1 year of age at time of study enrolment (and receive alglucosidase alfa treatment before 1 year of age),

Or the patient must be between 1 year and 24 months of age and must have initiated alglucosidase alfa treatment prior to turning 1 year of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exclusion criteria

The patient is participating in another clinical study using alglucosidase alfa or any investigational therapy.

## Treatments

Alglucosidase alfa was not provided by the Sponsor as part of the study.

## Objective(s)

The overall objective was to evaluate long-term growth and development of patients with infantile onset Pompe disease who begin treatment with alglucosidase alfa before 1 year of age. Patients were followed for a 10-year period.

An additional objective was to collect long-term safety data on patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease. As an exploratory objective, the effect of alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) was evaluated.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy : The following efficacy assessments were performed at scheduled visits during the study:

- Growth as measured by recumbent length/height, weight and head circumference
- Motor development and function, as measured by changes in the motor subscale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) and Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI)
- Cognitive Development, as measured by the cognitive and language subscales of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), change in the Brief IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale -Revised (Leiter-R) and/or the change in the Nonverbal IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale -3 rd  Edition (Leiter-3) (starting at the final assessment of the Bayley-III before 42 months of age).

For patients treated with alglucosidase alfa prior to age 1 (prior to study entry), available retrospective growth and development data were collected. Parameters for retrospective data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

collection included available standard-of-care growth (height, weight, head circumference) and motor milestone information (e.g., head support, sitting, standing, and walking ability) from the time of treatment initiation.

Safety : The following safety assessments were performed during the study: AE monitoring, laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), anti-rhGAA antibody (immunoglobulin G [IgG]) collection, neuroimaging (at the discretion of the Investigator), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), hearing testing and visual screening.

Additional safety evaluations included the assessment of: (1) immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum tryptase, complement activation and skin testing, when clinically indicated following moderate, severe, or recurrent IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity; and (2) circulating immune complex detection when clinically indicated by symptoms suggestive of immune complex disease.

Inhibitory antibody (activity and uptake) were to be assessed when clinically indicated (e.g., requirement for new invasive ventilator use, plateau or decline in response in the presence of adequate dosing).

## Sample size

No formal statistical sample size calculation was performed. The number of patients followed in this study was not limited prospectively.

## Randomisation and blinding

Not Applicable

## Statistical Methods

The statistical analysis of all growth and development parameters and other efficacy outcomes and safety measurements were conducted on all patients who received alglucosidase alfa. All data collected in this study were documented using summary tables, figures and patient data listings.

For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were presented. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) were presented.

Besides standard safety analyses of the incidence of AEs and SAEs, additional analyses were carried out to examine the trends in incidence and prevalence of AEs, SAEs and other relevant safety parameters over time. Key safety analyses were also carried out by gender.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 12 patients were screened, enrolled, and treated in the study. Eleven patients (91.7%) discontinued the study due to withdrawal of consent (6 patients [50.0%]), death (3 patients [25.0%]), and non-compliance with the study drug (2 patients [16.7%]) ( TABLE 2 ).

## Recruitment

Study initiation date: 26 August 2008 (first patient signed informed consent).

Study completion date: 23 November 2021 (last patient last visit).

This study was conducted at 3 centres that enrolled patients in the United States.

## Baseline data

The baseline for this study was defined as the value measured at the screening/baseline visit prior to the first infusion during the study.

The median age of patients at first Pompe diagnosis was 3.11 months, and 4.01 months at the time of first alglucosidase alfa infusion (Table 4). Of the 12 patients, 5 patients (41.7%) were male and 7 patients (58.3%) were female. Seven patients (58.3%) were White and 5 (41.7%) were Black; most were not Hispanic or Latino (11 patients [91.7%]).

Nine patients (75.0%) were CRIM positive, 2 patients (16.7%) were CRIM negative, and for 1 patient (8.3%) CRIM status was not evaluated.

## Motor development

## GMFM-88 Total Percent Score

The GMFM-88 was developed specifically to detect quantitative changes in gross motor function through the evaluation of 88 items that represent motor functions typically performed by children without motor impairment by 5 years of age. Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater motor skills. The GMFM-88 was administered by a trained physical therapist.

Of the 12 patients, 10 patients had GMFM-88 data at more than 1 time point. Changes in GMFM-88 scores were observed over the course of the study, which ranged from nearly 10 months (2 patients) to nearly 8 years (1 patient). Compared to baseline, 6 patients had improved GMFM-88 total percent scores at the last available assessment ranging from 5.45 to 85.88-point increase. Of the 2 patients with CRIM negative status, 1 had improved GMFM-88 total percent score by 31.67-points and the other patient had a decline in score by -6.85-points.

## Pompe PEDI Functional Skills Scale

The Pompe PEDI is a caregiver reported measure of clinically relevant functional skills for children with Pompe disease. A trained physical therapist administered the Pompe PEDI to the patients' parents/caregivers. Results for the Mobility, Self-care, and Social domains were reported as scaled scores, which were calculated from the raw scores and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better function

- Pompe PEDI Functional Skills Scale, Mobility

Of the 12 patients, 11 had multiple assessments for comparison across time ranging from 10 months (1 patient) to 8 years (1 patient). At the last available assessment, 7 patients had improvement in Pompe PEDI Functional Skills Scale Mobility domain, 3 patients had a decrease in scores from baseline while 1 patient experienced no change from the lowest possible score. The patient with only the baseline assessment had a Pompe PEDI Functional Skills Scale Mobility scaled score of 19.75.

## Bayley-III Fine Motor Raw Scores

The Bayley-III is a standardized assessment of infant and child development utilized to assess cognitive, language, and motor development. The Bayley-III was administered to patients up to 42 months of age or until the maximum score on each of the scales had been obtained. Data were reported by change in raw score on the 5 administered subtests (cognitive, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor, and gross motor). Normative scores for the cognitive, language, and motor scales were also reported, with attention to scores that fall within 2 SDs of the composite score mean (mean = 100, SD = 15). Composite scores that fell below 70 were classified as ' Extremely Low ' by the Bayley-III.

Eleven of 12 patients had Bayley-III Fine Motor data at multiple assessments. At the last available assessment at which the Bayley-III was administered (per protocol), 10 patients had an improvement in Bayley-III Fine Motor raw score, and 1 patient had a decrease in score from baseline. Both CRIM negative patients had an improvement in Bayley-III Fine Motor raw score from baseline.

## Leiter-R Brief IQ

The modified Leiter-R Scale was administered by a trained clinician to assess intellectual ability. The Leiter-R was administered to patients starting at the last assessment of the Bayley-III

Cognitive and Language Scales prior to the patient reaching 42 months of age. During the study, the Leiter-R was replaced by the Leiter-3 (due to upgrade from developer). Leiter-R Brief IQ scores were available only for 5 patients, of which 2 had the Leiter-R for multiple time points. The Leiter-R captured a range of Brief IQ scores, with 2 patients falling below 70 and 3 patients had scores between 70 and 130 (within 2 SDs from the mean).

## Leiter-3 Nonverbal IQ

Leiter-3 Nonverbal IQ scores were available only for 3 patients, only 2 of which had assessments at multiple time points. All 3 patients had scores above 90 at the first assessment but the scores decreased gradually over the course of the study, but did not fall below 70.

## CHMP comments on efficacy:

The objectives of this Phase IV AGLU03606/LTS12869 open-label study was to evaluate long-term growth and development of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease who began treatment with alglucosidase alfa before 1 year of age at the dose of 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients were followed in this study for up to 10 years.

Long-term growth was assessed by change of length/height, weight, and head circumference .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long term motor and cognitive development was evaluated using the Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3 rd  Edition (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88), the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), the Brief intelligence quotient (IQ) score of the Leiter International Performance Scale -Revised (Leiter-R) or the change in the Nonverbal IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale 3 rd  Edition (Leiter-3).

All 12 patients were only included in the USA and were treated with the commercial product as prescribed by the treating physician (i.e., Lumizyme).

Overall, 12 patients were included in the FAS population. Only 1 patient completed the study, 11 patients (91.7%) discontinued due to withdrawal of consent (6 patients), death (3 patients), and noncompliance (2 patients).

The mean (SD) duration of alglucosidase alfa exposure was 4.43 (3.46) years (range: 0.5 to 10.1 years).

Regarding growth, most patients maintained or improved their scores and all patients had height and head circumference above the 3rd percentile at last evaluation.

Regarding motor development, 10 patients had GMFM-88 data of which 6 improved their score and 3 had a decrease. Of the 11 patients with multiple assessments, 7 patients had improvement in Pompe PEDI Functional Skills Scale Mobility domain and 3 patients had a decrease .

Regarding cognitive development, of the 11 patients with multiple assessments, at last available assessment, 3 patients had Bayley-III cognitive composite scores &gt;85, 2 patients had score between ≥ 70 and ≤ 85, suggesting low average/borderline performance in cognitive function and 7 patients had composite scores &lt;70, indicating extremely low performance. Leiter-R Brief IQ and Leiter-3 Nonverbal IQ scores were available only for 2 patients with multiple evaluation.

Considering the size of the population (12 patients) the number of patients who discontinued the study (11), the mean duration of treatment (4.43 years) and the observational nature of the study, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion regarding the effect of alglucosidase alfa on long term growth and development of IOPD patients. However, taking into account the rarity and the seriousness of the pathology, the benefit of alglucosidase alfa in patients with IOPD remains positive.

## Adverse events

## Brief summary of adverse events

A total of 28 pre-treatment AEs were experienced by 8 patients (66.7%) enrolled in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 512 AEs were experienced by 12 patients enrolled in the study. Eleven patients (91.7%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), of which 4 patients (33.3%) had related TEAEs and 7 patients (58.3%) had unrelated TEAEs. Nine patients (75.0%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE. No treatment-related treatment-emergent SAEs were reported. No patients discontinued treatment with the study drug due to TEAE (Table 10). The most frequently (&gt;50%) reported TEAEs by preferred terms (PTs) were pyrexia (10 patients [83.3%]); pneumonia and cough (8 patients [66.7%] each); atelectasis and vomiting (7 patients [58.3%] each) (16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.3]).

## Adverse events by severity

Overall, the majority of TEAEs experienced during the study were considered to be of mild intensity (292 events). A total of 145 TEAEs were moderate in intensity, and 47 were severe (16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.8]). The most frequently reported severe TEAEs were atelectasis and respiratory failure (5 patients [41.7%] each), and pneumonia (4 patients [33.3%]).

## Treatment-related TEAEs

One patient (8.3%) reported TEAEs which were considered as possibly related to the study drug; 2 patients (16.7%) reported TEAEs which were considered as probably related to the study drug. One patient (8.3%) reported TEAEs of urticaria and rash, which were considered as definitely related to the study drug (Table 11).

## Deaths, serious adverse events, and other significant adverse events

## Death

Three (25.0%) patients (all 3 patients were CRIM positive) died during the study; these fatal TEAEs included respiratory failure, glycogen storage disease type II, and cardio-respiratory arrest. All fatal TEAEs were considered unrelated to the study drug (Table 10 and Table 13).

Further details are provided in the patient narratives (8-3-3-narratives-death).

## Serious adverse events

A total of 85 treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by 9 patients (75.0%) during the study. The most frequently (&gt;50%) reported SAEs by System Organ Class (SOC) were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and infections and infestations (8 patients [66.7%] each) and by PT was pneumonia (7 patients [58.3%]). One patient with CRIM negative status reported SAEs of atelectasis, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure; another CRIM negative patient had SAEs of bacteraemia, pyrexia, hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory failure. (16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.4]). No SAEs were considered as related to the study drug ([16.2.7.1.5]).

Further details are provided in the patient narratives (8-3-3-narratives-sae).

## Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation

No TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study drug were reported (16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.17]).

## Adverse events of special interest

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) included protocol-defined IARs, algorithm-defined potential IAR, potential immune mediated reactions, anaphylaxis, and hypersensitivity events.

## Protocol-defined infusion-associated reactions

Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs that occurred during the infusion or within up to 24 hours after the start of infusion and were considered as related or possibly related to the ERT by the Investigator or the Sponsor. At the discretion of the Investigator, AEs occurring ≥ 24 hours after the start of the infusion that were assessed as related may also have been considered IARs.

A total of 58 protocol-defined IARs were reported by 4 patients (33.3%) during the infusion with the most frequently reported IARs of urticaria (3 patients [25.0%]); rash, vomiting, and tachycardia (2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients [16.7%] each). Protocol-defined IARs of tachycardia, vomiting, and swelling face were reported by 1 patient (8.3%) day after the infusion (16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.6]). Further details are provided in the patient narratives (8-3-3-list-narratives). The peak ADA titer value of these 4 patients were: 800 (2 patients), 3200 (1 patient), and 12800 (1 patient) (16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.2.6]).

A by-patient listing of IARs is provided in 16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.13].

## Algorithm-defined potential IAR

An alternative definition of IAR which does not rely on the Investigator's assessment of an AE's relationship to the treatment was also employed. It included potential IARs (all AEs started on the day of infusion and those started the day following the infusion).

A total of 107 algorithm-defined potential IARs were reported by 11 patients (91.7%) during the infusion with the most frequently reported IARs of cough (4 patients [33.3%]); urticaria, upper respiratory tract infection, and device malfunction (3 patients [25.0%] each); rash, vomiting, ear infection, flushing, arthralgia, pyrexia, body temperature increased, and tachycardia (2 patients [16.7%] each). Thirty-one algorithm-defined potential IARs were reported by 7 patients (58.3%) the day after the infusion with the most frequently reported IARs of pyrexia (4 patients [33.3%]); vascular device infection, and vomiting (2 patients [16.7%] each) (16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.7]). A by-patient listing of IARs is provided in 16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.13].

## Potential immune mediated reactions

Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities query (SMQ) criteria were used to identify TEAEs that were potentially immune mediated reactions and those identified are listed in 16-2-7-aedata [16.2.7.1.15].

During the study, 3 patients met composite criteria of the SMQ for potential immune mediated reactions. Of these, 1 patient had mild TEAEs of oral ulceration and arthralgia while 2 patients (1 patient was CRIM negative) had arthralgia. Further details are provided in the patient narratives (8-33-narratives-sae).

## Anaphylaxis

Standard MedDRA query criteria used to identify TEAEs that were potentially associated with symptoms of anaphylactic reactions and those identified are listed in 16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.14].

During the study, 1 patient (with peak ADA titer 3200) met composite criteria of the SMQ for anaphylaxis. The patient experienced 3 TEAEs that matched anaphylaxis SMQ, flushing (mild), urticaria (moderate), and cough (mild) all on Day 1954. All of the events were considered recovered/resolved. The events were considered possibly related to the study drug, which was interrupted as a result of the events. Further details are provided in the patient narratives (8-3-3-narratives-sae).

## Hypersensitivity

Standard MedDRA query criteria for hypersensitivity used to identify TEAEs that were potentially associated with symptoms of hypersensitivity and those identified are listed in 16-2-7-ae-data [16.2.7.1.16].

Overall, 11 patients experienced 89 TEAEs that met the criteria of the SMQ for hypersensitivity reactions. The most frequent TEAEs meeting the criteria for hypersensitivity included rash and urticaria. The majority of the events were mild or moderate in intensity. Of the 2 CRIM negative patients, 1 had TEAEs of bronchospasm, respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and gingival swelling and the other CRIM negative patient had respiratory failure that met the criteria of the SMQ for hypersensitivity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further details are provided in the patient narratives (8-3-3-list-narratives).

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

## Laboratory value over time and individual participant changes in laboratory values

Descriptive statistics across visits on treatment for clinical parameters are provided in 16-2-8-clin-labdata. Summaries of change from baseline in biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters are presented in [16.2.8.1.1], [16.2.8.1.2], and [16.2.8.1.3], respectively.

The potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSA) for clinical laboratory tests are summarized in 16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.1.4].

## Hematology

A by-patient listing of hematology parameters is provided in 16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.1.6].

Clinically significant values for hematology were reported for 2 patients. One patient had abnormal hematocrit and hemoglobin values at baseline and events of decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit (both mild) were reported. The events were considered as not related to the study drug by the Investigator. Another patient had abnormal hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, erythrocyte count, basophils, lymphocyte count, and neutrophil count at Week 468.

## Clinical chemistry

A by-patient listing of clinical chemistry parameters is provided in 16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.1.5].

Clinically significant values for clinical chemistry were reported for 2 patients. One patient had abnormal alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase values at baseline. Another patient had abnormal sodium and glucose levels at Week 364 and was reported with an SAE of diabetes mellitus. The event was considered as not related to the study drug by the Investigator.

## Urinalysis

A by-patient listing of urinalysis is provided in 16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.1.7]. Clinically significant values for urinalysis were reported for 1 patient. The patient had abnormal urine bacteria and urine occult blood values at Week 208 and AEs of bacterial test positive and blood urine present (both mild) unrelated to the study drug were reported.

## Vital signs, ECG, physical findings, and other safety observations

## Vital signs

A by-patient listing of vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) by visit and time point is provided in 16-2-7-other-safety [16.2.7.1.1]. The PCSA for vital signs are summarized in [16.2.7.1.2].

Clinically significant vital sign assessments were recorded for 2 patients. For 1 patient who had increased heart rate at Week 12 post infusion, an event of tachycardia (moderate) probably related to the study drug was reported. The patient also had increased heart rate and body temperature at Week 68 and events of tachycardia (moderate) and pyrexia (mild) probably related to the study drug were reported. Both the events resolved on the same day. Another patient had increased body temperature at Week 80 and the event of pyrexia (moderate) not related to the study drug was reported.

## Electrocardiograms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Individual patient ECG results with clinically significant abnormalities are provided in 16-2-7-othersafety [16.2.7.3.3]. Summaries of ECG parameters and PCSA for ECG are provided in [16.2.7.3.1], [16.2.7.3.2], and [16.2.7.3.4], respectively.

Conduction abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, and to a lesser extent right ventricular hypertrophy were prevalent at baseline and decreased over time. Abnormal sinus node rhythm and arrhythmias occurred throughout follow-up (16-2-7-other-safety [16.2.7.3.3]).

## Physical examination findings

All physical examination results are listed for each patient in 16-2-7-other-safety [16.2.7.2.1].

Findings from physical examinations generally reflected the various manifestations of Pompe disease, including abnormalities in neurological; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; skin, extremities/joints; abdomen, heart, lungs; and general appearance in the majority of patients.

## Other observations related to safety

## Neuroimaging assessment

Three patients in the study had abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings mostly related to white matter changes. These abnormal findings are summarized in 16-2-7-other-safety [16.2.7.4.1].

## Hearing testing

Tympanometry assessments were abnormal from baseline for the majority of patients (16-2-7-othersafety [16.2.7.5.1]). Audiometry revealed abnormalities in most of the patients at baseline and at Weeks 52, 104, 156, 208, 260, and 416 [16.2.7.5.2].

## Visual screening

By-patient listings of visual testing are provided in 16-2-7-other-safety [16.2.7.6.1], [16.2.7.6.2], [16.2.7.6.3], [16.2.7.6.4], [16.2.7.6.5], and [16.2.7.6.6].

Abnormal visual assessments reported in the study (16-2-7-other-safety [16.2.7.6.1]) were:

- Conjunctival melanosis: 1 patient (baseline, Week 52, study completion/discontinuation visit)
- Ptosis: 2 patients (at Weeks 52156/not recorded thereafter, and Weeks 156 -260)
- Left eyelid bru ising from recent trauma (1 patient), right eye posterior synechiae versus persistent vasculature (1 patient) (at Week 52).

## Immunogenicity

Of the 12 patients with baseline ADA status, 8 patients (66.7%) with positive titer had persistent ADA response. Of these, 3 patients (25.0%) had high ADA response (Table 14).

The overall median peak titer from time of study entry for the IgG positive patients was 3805.5 (range of 800 to 25600) (Table 15). Three (1 patient was CRIM negative) of 8 patients had a peak titer of ≥ 12800.

The overall median last titer was 800 (range of 100 to 12800) (Table 16) for the patients who were IgG positive. Only 1 of 8 patients had a last titer of ≥ 12800. Most patients showed decreased titers by last assessment (16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.2.5]).

A by-patient listing of anti-rhGAA ADA data is provided in 16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.2.6] and neutralizing antibody testing data is provided in [16.2.8.2.8]. Individual plots of anti-alglucosidase alfa titers over time for patients with at least 1 antibody positive titer is provided in [16.2.8.2.7].

Complement Activation, Serum Tryptase, and Serum Immunoglobulin E Antibody Testing

No patients met the protocol criteria for immunology testing due to IARs. However, 1 patient tested positive for complement activation and was within normal range for serum tryptase (16-2-8-clin-labdata [16.2.8.2.9]).

One patient had a positive result for intradermal skin testing (wheal longest diameter of 7 mm, and erythema longest diameter of 12 mm) (16-2-8-clin-lab-data [16.2.8.2.10]).

## CHMP comments on safety:

The  secondary  objective  of  this  Phase  4  long-term  study  of  growth  and  development  outcomes  in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) receiving alglucosidase alfa (AGLU03606/LTS12869) was to collect long-term safety data. This study was ongoing during the last PBRER for alglucosidase alfa. The 12 participants were already enrolled at that time.

According to the currently submitted data, the safety population of AGLU03606/LTS12869 study was the  same  as  the  full  analysis  set  which  included  the  12  patients  who  began  alglucosidase  alfa (Myozyme®) infusions prior to 1 year of age at a dose of 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks and were followed for up to 10 years.

Only a single patient completed the study. There were no TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of  the  study  drug.  Primary  reasons  for  study  discontinuation  were  mainly  wishes  to  withdraw  by parents/guardians (half of patients -from  Day 393 to Day 2876), death in 3 patients (25.0%) and non-compliance with study drug in 2 patients (16.7% - both discontinued at Day 2851).

In  the  3  patients  (all  CRIM  positive,  &lt;2  years  old)  who  died  during  the  study,  cause  of  death  was either  reported  as  respiratory  insufficiency/failure  due  to  underlying  Pompe  disease  on  Day  218, Pompe disease and complications on Day 538, or cardio-respiratory arrest on Day 1228. The deaths were  assessed  as  unrelated  to  alglucosidase  alfa  by  the  investigators.  No  safety  concern  could  be identified from the available reported information.

All  patients  but  one  experienced  TEAEs,  i.e.,  a  total  of  484  TEAEs  reported  during  the  study.  The majority of TEAEs were non-serious (427/484, 88.2% of total TEAEs), and mild to moderate in severity (437/484, 90.3%) all but two patients (81.8% of patients) experienced TEAEs assessed as severe. Regardless of causality, TEAEs belonged to the main following SOCs: Infections and infestations (all patients); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; General disorders and administration site conditions  (10/11  patients  each);  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (9/11);  Skin  and subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  Investigations  (8/11  each);  Ear  and  labyrinth  disorders,  Nervous system  disorders,  Cardiac  disorders,  Eye  disorders  (6/11  each);  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

complications  (5/11);  Vascular  disorders,  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (4/11);  Product  issues (3/11).  Most  events  were  consistent  with  the  manifestations  and  complications  of  the  underlying Pompe disease or device related issues.

According to available information from the MAH, 63 TEAEs (13.0%), all non-serious, were related to alglucosidase alfa in 4 patients.  No laboratory-related TEAEs were reported. All but 2 of the related TEAEs were characterized as protocol-defined IARs (96.8%). The related TEAEs were all listed/reflected in  Myozyme  PI:  tachycardia,  flushing*,  cough*,  vomiting,  urticaria*,  rash,  angioedema,  pyrexia, swelling face, oxygen saturation decreased, and body temperature increased. *anaphylaxis

Among AESI , the potential immune mediated reactions of ulceration (1) and arthralgia (3) identified in 3 patients were all assessed as unrelated to study drug by the investigator.

No safety issue in physical findings, ECG parameters and other safety observations have been identified. The changes observed during the study were generally consistent with manifestations of the underlying Pompe disease.

All patients had baseline ADA status , of which 8 with positive titers had persistent ADA response (incl. 3 with high ADA response ≥ 12800, 3 with intermediate ADA titer 1600-6400, and 2 with low ADA titer 100-800).  No  patient  had  tolerized  ADA  response.  One  patient  tested  positive  for  complement activation and skin testing. Neutralizing antibody testing were performed in 3 patients (1 at withdrawal from the study, 1 at W26, and the remaining at W12) which were negative.

Based on the data provided by the MAH dealing with the final results of study AGLU03606/LTS12869, notably including reviews of case narrative information, no new safety concerns have been identified with alglucosidase alfa as compared to previous studies and experiences in IOPD patients treated with alglucosidase alfa at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow.  No safety issue which could alter the known safety profile  of  alglucosidase  alfa  in  IOPD  patient  population  has  been  found.  However,  very  few  patients (12) were enrolled in this study, hampering any meaningful conclusion.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Considering the size of the population (12 patients) the number of patients who discontinued the study (11),  the  mean  duration  of  treatment  (4.43  years),  the  observational  nature  of  the  study,  and  the paucity of the data, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion regarding the effect of alglucosidase alfa on long term growth and development of IOPD patients.

The treatment-related AEs reported in 4 patients treated with alglucosidase alfa were consistent with its  known  safety  profile.  Based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  regarding  the  final  results  of  this study, no new safety concerns have been identified as compared to previous studies and experiences in infantile-onset Pompe patients treated with alglucosidase alfa at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow.

Taking  into  account  the  rarity  and  the  seriousness  of  the  pathology,  the  known  safety  profile  of alglucosidase  alfa,  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  alglucosidase  alfa  at  a  dose  of  20  mg/kg  qow  remains positive in patients with IOPD.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Based on the data provided by the MAH regarding the final results of study AGLU03606/LTS12869 IOPD study, no new safety concerns have been identified as compared to previous studies and experiences in IOPD patients treated with alglucosidase alfa at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow.
