## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dolutegravir, dolutegravir / abacavir / lamivudine, dolutegravir / lamivudine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data mostly on spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between dolutegravir and 'panic attack' is at least a reasonable possibility.

The data available indicate that not only patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders are affected from this problem but also patients without any previously diagnosed psychiatric problems as well. Since there is enough evidence supporting a causal relationship between the administration of DTG-containing medicinal products and the onset of panic attack, the PRAC concluded the product information of product containing DTG should include 'panic attack' as an ADR with a frequency allocation of 'uncommon'.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dolutegravir, dolutegravir / abacavir / lamivudine, dolutegravir / lamivudine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dolutegravir, dolutegravir / abacavir / lamivudine, dolutegravir / lamivudine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
