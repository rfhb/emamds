## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Tygacil  (tigecycline)  belongs  to  the  glycylcycline  class  of  antimicrobial  agents.  As  a  bacteriostatic agent, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, it inhibits the growth of multiple resistant grampositive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .

It  was  authorized  in  the  EU  through  the  centralized  procedure  on  24  April  2006  and  is  currently approved for the following indications:

- Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI), excluding diabetic foot infections
- Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)

A  variation  application  to  extend  the  therapeutic  indications  to  include  treatment  of  community acquired pneumonia (CAP) was withdrawn in the EU in April 2008.

The Marketing Authorisation was renewed by the European Commission on 6 May 2011 following a positive  CHMP  Opinion  of  17  February  2011.  As  a  consequence  of  the  benefit-risk  assessment  the indications have been restricted by adding the following wording in section 4.1 of the Tygacil SmPC:

'Tygacil should be used only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives are not suitable (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tygacil is available in single-dose 5-mL glass vials containing 50 mg lyophilized powder for infusion.

This  type  II  variation  application  initially  aimed  to  update  section  5.2  of  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics (SmPC) with PK information for Tygacil in the paediatric population following a request from  CHMP  of  20  January  2011.  The  PK  information  to  be  added  originated  from  the  completed paediatric  studies  3074K4-2207-WW  and  3074A1-110-US,  both  previously  submitted  and  assessed. (study 2207 was submitted to the EMA in April 2010, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006,  study 3074A1-110-US was provided in the FU2 052.1.)

However, in its Request for Supplementary Information adopted on 23 June 2011, CHMP requested the MAH to also update sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the Tygacil SmPC with safety information in the paediatric population originating from the same two paediatric studies mentioned above.

This variation was classified as follows:

| Variation requested   | Type                                                                                                                                                                         |    |

## 3.2. Clinical aspects

The  MAH  conducted  and  completed  two  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric population: study 3074A1-110-US (study 110) and study 3074K4-2207-WW (study 2207).

Study 3074A1-110-US was an open label, single, ascending dose study conducted in children aged 8-16  years and  aiming to characterize the pharmacokinetics  and  safety/tolerability of single intravenous doses (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) of tigecycline.  The Clinical Study Report (CSR53874) containing the study results was provided and assessed with the responses to the first Request for Supplementary Information to the P46 052 procedure (FU2 056.1). At the time when the Paediatric Investigation Plan for tigecycline was agreed with the PDCO, this study was already completed.

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  single  doses  of tigecycline administered as an IV infusion to children.  The secondary objective was to determine the PK of single ascending doses of tigecycline in children.  Each subject participated in the study for up to 6 days, including a 3-day screening period, followed by a minimum 12-hour inpatient period and a 2day follow-up period.

50  subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study;  25  subjects  were  enrolled,  and  24  subjects completed the study and were included in the analysis.  Six dose groups were planned, but the study was stopped (as per study protocol) after 2 subjects in the 1 mg/kg dose group (ages 8 to 11 years) vomited.  The final dose group planned (2 mg/kg dose in subjects ages 8 to 11 years) was omitted, and the remainder of the 1 mg/kg dose group (ages 8 to 11 years) did not complete the study.

For more details on the study design and its results please refer to the Rapporteur assessment report of procedure P46 052 from 5 July 2010 (Attachment 5).

A summary of PK parameter data by dose group and age group is shown in the table below.

Tigecycline administered to children showed initially high concentrations, followed by rapid distribution and slower elimination.  Similar to adults, CLr was relatively small compared with total CL. As has been reported for other medications, including antibiotics, in older children, CL and Vss values were lower, even when normalized for weight.  The younger children also had shorter t½ values compared with older children and adults.

The clinical efficacy of tigecycline appears to be most closely related to the AUC to MIC ratio and so a reasonable dose to use in children would be one that would result in the AUC observed in adults.  The MAH also presented individual listings on the PK parameters. After the recommended dose of 100 mg loading and 50 mg every 12 hours, the AUC0 24h observed in adults was approximately 5.0 mg·h/L; thus for AUC0-12H, the target would be 2.5 mg·h/L.  As may be seen in Figure 1-2, children less than 12 years of age appear to need higher doses than children older than 12 years of age.  For almost all children ages 12 years and older, a dose of 1 mg/kg would be expected to produce exposures of 2.5 mg·h/L or higher.  Given that most children ages 12 years and older weigh at least 50 kg, the adult dose of 50 mg every 12 hours would be expected to provide appropriate exposure.

<!-- image -->

In children less than 12 years of age, a 50-mg dose would be too much, given the smaller size of such children.  Simulating exposures based upon the children studied, 1-mg/kg doses would be expected to result in a median AUC of 3.2 mg·h/L (range: 1.4-10.5 mg·h/L).  In children ages 12 years and older, doses  shown  to  be  effective  in  adults  (a  100-mg  loading  dose  followed  by  50  mg  every  12  hours) would be predicted to provide a similar exposure to what was observed in adults.  In children ages 8 to

Abbreviations: AUC = area under the concentration-time curve; CL = clearance; C

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

11 years, doses of 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 50 mg) every 12 hours would be predicted to provide a similar exposure to what was observed in adults.

The approved dose regimen for adults with cSSTI or cIAI is an initial loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. The AUC0-24h observed in adults is approximately 5.0 mg·h/L; thus, for AUC 0-12h, the target would be 2.5 mg·h/L. Dose reduction is considered necessary only for patients with severe hepatic impairment (C-P C), who receive 25 mg every 12 hours following the 100 mg loading dose.

The reasons for omitting the loading dose in children are: first, the apparently long half-life observed in adults is misleading and does not reflect the effective half-life governing the amount of accumulation observed with multiple doses.  Second, the pharmacodynamic parameter predictive of clinical efficacy is  AUC/MIC, which is achieved with the first dose, and does not suggest that a loading dose would provide additional effectiveness; and third, the dosing regimen in children is anticipated to be more complex than in adults and a loading dose is likely to increase the complexity further increasing dosing errors, and finally a loading dose is likely to result in tolerability issues in children.  With regard to the tolerability  issues,  it  was  shown,  in  an  integrated  study  of  data  from  adult  subjects,  both  healthy volunteers and patients with cSSSI, that higher doses and exposures were associated with decreased tolerability  compared  with  lower  doses    Population  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic  analyses  of tigecycline efficacy in patients with complicated skin and ski-structure infections and safety in patients and  subjects.    Wyeth  Research,  RPT-54411,  2004;  Rubino  CM,  Forrest  A,  Bhavnani  S,  et  al. Toxicodynamic  analysis  in  patients  with  hospital-  or  community-acquired  pneumonia.    47th  ICAAC 2007;Abstract A-584). The PDCO agreed that the loading dose in paediatric studies can be omitted.

The MAH initial proposal for dose recommendation based on the results of this study was to administer 50 mg every 12 hours (the same as the adult maintenance dose) to children aged 12 to 17 years old, and 1 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours to patients 8 to 11 years old. However, CHMP could  not  agree  on  this  (please  refer  to  section  'Discussions,  conclusions  and  Benefit  /  Risk Assessment').

## Safety

Eight  subjects (32%) had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), the most frequent of which were nausea (12%), vomiting (16%), and headache (8%), with the nausea and vomiting occurring in the higher dose groups (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) and considered to be possibly related to tigecycline. No deaths occurred during the study.  One subject had an SAE, vomiting with associated dehydration, which resolved during a brief period of hospitalization; and 1 subject was withdrawn from the study because of a mild injection site reaction.

## Study 3074K4-2207-WW

This was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, ascending multiple-dose study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of tigecycline  in  paediatric  patients  from  8  to  less  than  12 years of age with selected serious infections: complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI), complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed with the PDCO and for which a positive opinion was issued by the EMA in May 2009 (date of last modification of the agreed PIP).

Eligible subjects received intravenous (IV) tigecycline at a dosage of 0.75, 1, or 1.25 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours infused over approximately 30 minutes. Omitting the loading dose  for  the  paediatric  population  was  considered  acceptable  for  the  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO) mainly  due  to  tolerability  issues.  All  subjects  received  IV  tigecycline  for  a  minimum  of  3  days  to  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maximum of 14 consecutive days. On or after day 4, it was possible to switch to oral antibiotics (IV plus oral switch). Escalation to the next dose cohort occurred only after the following: 1) safety and tolerability  data  at  the  preceding  dose  through  the  last  day  of  therapy  (tigecycline  LDOT)  had  been reviewed by the sponsor, 2) at least 5 of the 6 properly processed PK samples were received by the central laboratory from at least 12 subjects ('PK evaluable'), and 3) all available efficacy data were reviewed.

For details on the design and results of the study please refer to the Rapporteur assessment report of procedure P46 052 from 5 July 2010 (Attachment 5).

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 59 subjects who were screened and randomized to treatment. Of these subjects, 58 subjects received at least 1 dose of tigecycline and were included in the  modified  intent-to-treat  (mITT)  population.  The  disposition  of  subjects  by  treatment  group  and diagnosis in the mITT population is provided in the following table:

Although concentration data were available, PK parameters could not be determined for 7 children (one child in the 0.75-mg/kg group, one child in the 1-mg/kg group, and five children in the 1.25-mg/kg group). When Cmax and tmax could be reliably determined, they were. The resulting mean ± SD PK parameters determined in the 47 children who were PK evaluable are shown in Table 4-2.

Steady-state tigecycline AUC0-24h versus dose in adults and pediatric subjects is shown in Figure 112.  As  may  be  seen  in  the  figure,  the  AUC0-24h  is  slightly  higher  in  children  in  the  1.25-mg/kg treatment groups, and slightly lower in children in the 1-mg/kg treatment group than the AUC0-24h observed in adult subjects with cSSSI or cIAI participating in phase 2 and 3 studies.

The selection of 1.2 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg per dose) BID as dosing recommendation for children 8 to 11 years old for phase 3 trials is based on the results plotted in the figure above. As AUC/MIC ratio is  the  PK/PD  index  that  has  been  shown  to  correlate  with  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this approach was acceptable.

Plotting weight, body surface area (BSA) or body mass index (BMI) versus Clearance (CL) shows that smaller children have lower CL than larger children, but when weight, BSA, or BMI are plotted against Weight-Normalised  Clearance  (CLW),  the  apparent  relationship  between  size  and  CL  goes  away, supporting the choice of dosing based on weight for children as may be seen in Supportive Figure 7.1 and Supportive Figure 7.2, showing weight vs CL and CLW respectively.

Although  the  MAH  conclusion  was  that  1.2  mg/kg  twice  daily    would  be  an  appropriate  dose  to  be tested in further clinical studies in children the CHMP was not convinced and the MAH was requested to address  several  other  issues  (please  refer  to  section  'Discussions,  conclusions  and  Benefit  /  Risk Assessment').

## Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event Data (TEAEs)

An AE was considered treatment emergent if it emerged during the on-therapy period but was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs that occurred  within  5  days  after  the  last  test  article  administration  were  attributed  to  the  on-therapy period.

Overall,  44  (75.9%)  subjects  were  reported  with  1  or  more  TEAEs.  TEAEs  were  most  commonly associated with the digestive system. The most frequently occurring TEAE was nausea, reported in 28 (48.3%) subjects overall, and in a significantly higher percentage of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group (60.0%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6%; p=0.018), and in the 1 mg/kg group (61.9%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6%; p=0.009). Vomiting was the second mostly frequently reported  TEAE,  reported  in  27  (46.6%)  subjects  overall.  Vomiting  was  reported  in  the  0.75-mg/kg group in 5 children (29%) while in the 1-mg/kg and 1.25-mg/kg groups these figures were 11 (52.4%) and 11 (50%), respectively.

Nine subjects with CAP (47.4%) were reported with 1 or more TEAEs. The most frequently occurring TEAE was nausea, reported in 8 (42.1%) subjects overall, and in a significantly higher percentage of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group (100.0%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (14.3%; p=0.015). Vomiting,  reported  in  5  (26.3%)  subjects  overall,  was  reported  significantly  more  frequently  in  the 1.25-mg/kg group (75.0%) compared with the 0.75-mg/kg group (0%; p=0.024).

Twenty  (20,  83.3%)  subjects  with  cIAI  were  reported  with  1  or  more  TEAEs.  The  most  frequently occurring  AEs  were  vomiting,  reported  in  15  (62.5%)  subjects  overall,  and  nausea,  reported  in  9 (37.5%) subjects overall.

One  (1)  or  more  TEAEs  were  reported  in  all  15  subjects  with  cSSSI  (100%).  TEAEs  were  most commonly associated with the digestive system. The most frequently occurring TEAEs were nausea, reported in 11 (73.3%) subjects overall, and vomiting, reported in 7 (46.7%) subjects overall. Nausea was  reported  significantly  more  frequently  in  the  1-mg/kg  group  (100%)  compared  with  the  0.75mg/kg group (25.0%; p=0.024).

Overall, significantly more subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg (60.0%) and 1-mg/kg (61.9%) groups reported TEAEs of nausea compared with subjects in the 0.75-mg/kg group (17.6%; p=0.018 and p=0.009, respectively).  Among  subjects  with  CAP,  significantly  more  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group compared  with  subjects  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  group  reported  TEAEs  of  nausea  (100%  versus  14.3%,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

p=0.015) and vomiting (75.0% versus 0%, p=0.024). Among subjects with cSSSI, significantly more subjects in the 1-mg/kg group reported TEAEs of nausea (100%) compared with subjects in the 0.75mg/kg  group  (25.0%,  p=0.024).  Among  subjects  with  cIAI,  there  were  no  significant  differences between treatment groups in the incidences of nausea or vomiting.

The  incidences  of  nausea  and  vomiting  across  treatment  groups  is  summarized  overall  and  by diagnosis in Table 10-2 below.

## Deaths

No subjects died during the study.

## Serious Adverse Events

A summary of SAEs by body system and diagnosis is provided in Table 10-3 below. A total of 3 (5.2%) subjects were reported with SAEs during the study. No SAEs were reported in subjects with CAP. One (1; 4.2%) subject with cIAI receiving 0.75 mg/kg of tigecycline had an SAE of postoperative wound infection. Two (2; 13.3%) subjects with cSSSI had SAEs: 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group had an SAE of anal fistula and 1 subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group had an SAE of abdominal pain. All SAEs were resolved.

## Safety-Related Discontinuations

A summary of AEs resulting in withdrawal from the study is provided in Table 10-4 overall and by diagnosis. Overall, 2 (3.4%) subjects were withdrawn from the study because of AEs. Among subjects with  cIAI,  1  subject  in  the  1-mg/kg  group  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  AEs  of pancreatitis, blood amylase increased, and lipase increased, and 1 subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group was withdrawn from the study because of an AE of lipase increased.

The pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the children age 8 to 11 years were comparable between the 2 studies. Study 110-US was a small study and enrolled only 7 children aged 8 to 11, one of whom had a very high Cmax (19980 ng/mL) that may have been due to a contaminated sample. Three (3) of the 16 children aged 12 to 16 years had very high Cmax values as well, leading to the highly variable estimates of Cmax. The AUC values observed in the 8 to 11 year olds were comparable when the high values were excluded.

The CHMP also requested the MAH to provide a population pharmacokinetic analysis with the two PK studies conducted in the paediatric population. A model of tigecycline pharmacokinetics was derived from the pooled data. The pharmacokinetic data were best described using a linear two compartment model with an effect of weight on clearance. No other covariates were identified as being predictive of tigecycline pharmacokinetics. The data were variable, particularly peak concentrations which gave rise to high residual variability in the final model. The model under-predicts Cmax, i.e. the experimental Cmax concentrations are higher than those predicted by the model. The evaluation of the final model showed no overall bias or substantial model misspecification.

The  identification  of  weight  on  clearance  is  supportive  of  a  weight  based  dose  regimen  for  the paediatric population although the relationship between weight and clearance (and hence AUC) is not linear. According to the MAH, paediatric subjects receiving 1 mg/kg doses would be predicted to show increasing exposure of approximately 40%, over the range of body weights of 20 to 50 kg, followed by gradually decreasing exposure due to the dose capping at 50 mg.

In the answers to CHMP's second RSI, the MAH has clarified clarified that the simulated mean AUC024h following a dose of 0.75 mg/kg is below the adult AUC0-24h target of 5 mg·h/L while for the dose of 1.2 mg/kg the mean values are usually above this target and has confirmed that 1.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg twice daily) administered every 12 hours infused over 30 to 60 minutes is the dose to be further tested in children and adolescents 8 to less than 18 years old. The CHMP considered this to be acceptable, although modelling and simulation along with the safety data may have supported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 1 mg/kg dose, but agreed that appropriate measures were already agreed with the PDCO to be put in  place  in  the  planned  phase  3  studies  in  children  (DSMB,  stopping  rules)  to  limit  the  exposure  of children to inappropriate doses.

## Changes to the Product Information

Following the assessment of CHMP the MAH agreed to update the Tygacil SmPC as follows:

## Section 4.2

[…]

Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Tygacil in children below 18 years have not yet been established  No data are available (see sections 5.2 and 4.4). (see section 4.4). Only pharmacokinetic data are available (see section 5.2).

## Section 4.8

[…]

Paediatric population

Very limited safety data were available from a multiple dose PK study (see section 5.2). No new or unexpected safety concerns were observed with tigecycline in this study.

## Section 5.2.

Paediatric Population

The pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in patients less than 18 years of age has not been established (see section 4.2). The safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the paediatric population 8 to &lt;18 years of age have not been established.

Tigecycline pharmacokinetics was investigated in two studies. The first study enrolled children aged 816 years (n=24) who received single doses of tigecycline (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg, with no dose limitation) administered intravenously over 30 minutes. The second study was performed in children aged 8 to 11 years (n=47) who received multiple doses of tigecycline (0.75, 1, or 1.25 mg/kg up to a maximum dose  of  50  mg)  every  12  hours  administered  intravenously  over  30  minutes.  No  loading  dose  was administered in these studies. The pharmacokinetic parameters may be observed in the table below.

## Discussions, conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

This  type  II  variation  initially  aimed  at  amending  section  5.2  of  the  approved  SmPC  for  Tygacil  by providing  PK  data  on  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric  population  and  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  in January 2011, during the assessment of study 3074K4-2207-WW. The initial proposal made by the MAH to update section 5.2 of the Tygacil SmPC was not considered acceptable by the CHMP. CHMP adopted on 23 June 2011 a RSI requesting the MAH to also update sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC with a summary of the safety data of the paediatric PK studies.

The MAH initial proposal for dose recommendation based on the results of 3074A1-110-US study for the planned phase 3 trials in children was to administer 50 mg every 12 hours (the same as the adult maintenance dose) to children aged 12 to 17 years old, and 1 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours to patients 8 to 11 years old. However, the CHMP could not agree on this due to the following issues:

-  there were only 8 subjects aged 8-11 years enrolled of which two received the 1 mg/kg dose and the other six received 0.5 mg/kg. The observed Cmax and AUCs were lower with 1 mg/kg than with 0.5 mg/kg  in  this  age  group  (see  table  above),  but  this  observation  is  not  explored  (e.g.  in  terms  of subject demographics) in the study report. Because the differences in CL and weight-normalized CL values  were  greater  than  the  change  in  weight-normalized  Vss  values,  the  λz  was  also  higher  in younger  children  and  so  t½  was  longer.  Age,  weight  and  BMI  were  significant  factors  for  weightnormalised clearance, but not for weight-normalised Vss, in the univariate regression model analyses.

- for the US children enrolled in this study the mean weight in the 8-11 years group was around 50 kg (max 64 kg) and the mean weight in the older subjects was 60-70 kg. Also, the modelling suggested that in those aged 8-11 years 1 mg/kg every 12 hours would give a median AUC of 3.2 mg·h/L but with a range from 1.4-10.5 mg·h/L.

Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  evidence  to  support  the  dose  regimen  proposed  for  future trials  enrolling  children  aged  &lt;  12  years  and/or  &lt;  50  kg  was  weak  and  needed  much  more investigation. As a consequence, the MAH performed study 3074K4-2207-WW (study 2207) in children from 8 to less than 12 years old. The CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal not to develop a specific formulation for the paediatric population, but to use the one currently marketed for adults in study 2207.

Regarding  study  2207,  although  the  MAH  conclusion  was  that  1.2  mg/kg  twice  daily    would  be  an appropriate dose to be tested in further clinical studies in children the CHMP was not convinced and the MAH was requested to  address  several  issues.  First,  the  issue  of  the  linearity  of  Cmax,  as  this  PK parameter increases more than proportionally with higher doses (e.g. from a mean of 456 ng/ml in the 0.75  mg/kg  group  to  2599  ng/ml  in  the  1.25  mg/kg  group).  The  appropriateness  of  normalising clearance by body weight, i.e. weight-normalized clearance (CLW) was consequently raised by CHMP, taking into account the lack of proportionality in Cmax and other issues related to the calculation of AUC0-24h such as the lack of sampling times at 12 hours (as AUC0-24h was calculated by doubling the AUCτ).  Similarly,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  the  individual  clearance  values  (CL)  by  dosing group and overall, and plots of weight, BMI and age vs. CL and CLW by dosing group. Furthermore, a population pharmacokinetic analysis of both paediatric trials was requested by CHMP.

According  to  the  information  provided  by  the  MAH  in  its  responses  to  the  first  CHMP  RSI,  no  firm conclusion on linearity could be drawn based on the Cmax values reported from study 2207, due to sample timing issues. As Cmax values higher than expected have been observed in both paediatric PK

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

trials,    incomplete  distribution  as  a  consequence  of  the  short  time  of  infusion  could  also  be  an alternative explanation. The CHMP considered that it was advisable to prolong the time of infusion to 60  minutes  in  further  paediatric  trials.  Additional  data  provided  in  response  to  the  CHMP  questions suggested that clearance is not dependent on the dose administered, but is mainly related to body weight (i.e. in smaller children clearance is lower), although the variability in clearance explained by body weight seems limited, while no influence of age or dose is observed (within the narrow age range and dosing regimens studied in study 2207).

From a safety perspective CHMP agreed that no new safety signals have arisen with regards to what had been observed in adults with the exception of QTc prolongation in a child in the 1-mg/kg group that has been reported as probably related to tigecycline. At CHMP request, the MAH provided the case narrative. As QTc prolongation is considered as a potential risk in the safety specifications of the Risk Management Plan of Tygacil, the CHMP agreed that no further actions were necessary as this adverse event is reviewed in the PSURs.

The  MAH  performed  an  exposure-safety  relationship  analysis  and  concluded  that  there  is  no contribution of tigecycline Cmax or AUC0-24h to the occurrence of nausea or vomiting. However, CHMP considers that what the raw data show is that nausea and vomiting are dose-dependent.

Based  on  the  data  presented  by  the  MAH  the  CHMP  agreed  to  the  inclusion  of the  above pharmacokinetic and safety data from the PK paediatric trials in sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Tygacil SmPC.

Considering  the  newly  available  data  on  the  adverse  events  from  the  above  paediatric  studies  in connection with an appropriate update of the Product information to reflect them, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk remains positive.

## 4. Conclusion

On  21  July  2011  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics

-  To update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Tygacil SmPC with paediatric PK and safety information based  on  the  assessment  of  paediatric  studies  3074K4-2207-WW  and  3074A1-110-US,  both previously submitted and assessed. This variation was requested by the CHMP on 20 January 2011.

## 5. EPAR changes

The  EPAR  will  be  updated  following  Commission  Decision  for  this  variation.  In  particular  the  EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## EPAR scope:

To update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Tygacil SmPC with paediatric PK and safety information based on the results of paediatric studies 3074K4-2207-WW and 3074A1-110-US, both submitted and assessed in previous procedures. This variation was requested by the CHMP on 20 January 2011.

## Summary / scientific discussion:

Additional data from an open label, single, ascending dose study conducted in children aged 8-16 years and  aiming  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety/tolerability  of  single  intravenous  doses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) of tigecycline and a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, ascending multiple-dose study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of tigecycline in paediatric patients from  8  to less than  12  years  of age  with  selected serious infections:  complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI), complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community acquired pneumonia(CAP) lead to an update of the Tygacil SmpC with a synopsis of the PK parameters from the two studies and with the information that the safety data observed in the multiple-dose PK study, (although limited due to the small number of children enrolled and to the fact that 3 doses were tested)  was  consistent  with  the  type  of  adverse  events  already  reported  by  adult  patients  such  as nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis etc. Overall, the CHMP agreed that safety and efficacy of tigecycline in children needs to be demonstrated and agreed to include the new paediatric data in the Tygacil SmPC.
