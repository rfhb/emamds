## I. ASSESSMENT

## Introduction

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: results of the final clinical study report (CSR) for Study CN138603.1

Study CN138603 was a United States Food and Drug Administration post-approval commitment designed to assess whether paediatric subjects who maintained a response for 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment for their  symptoms  of  irritability  associated  with  autistic  disorder  would  experience  a  relapse  significantly later when continuing therapy with aripiprazole than subjects treated with placebo.

## Methodology

This  was  a  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled  study  with  2  parallel  treatment groups designed to assess the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the long-term maintenance treatment of pediatric subjects with irritability associated with autistic disorder. The study included 2 phases: Phase 1 (stabilization  phase)  -  13  -  26  weeks  of  single-blind  aripiprazole  treatment  and  Phase  2  (randomization phase) - 16 weeks of double-blind treatment with aripiprazole or placebo.

The study design is presented graphically in Figure below:

Figure 4.1: Study Design

<!-- image -->

The population included male or female subjects 6 to 17 years  of age at the time of the  baseline visit meeting  DSM-IV-TR  diagnostic  criteria  for  autistic  disorder  and  demonstrating  behaviors  such  as tantrums,  aggression,  self-injurious  behavior,  or  a  combination  of  these  problems.  The  diagnosis  of autistic disorder was to be confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Subjects were to have Clinical Global Impressions-Severity( CGI-S) scores ≥ 4 AND an Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) Subscale score ≥ 18 at the screening and baseline visits and to have a mental age of at least 24 months, as assessed by the investigators. A total of 215 subjects were enrolled in the study, and 157 (73%) completed the screening phase and entered Phase 1. Eighty-five subjects (54%) completed Phase 1 and were randomized in Phase 2 (41 and 44 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively).

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  compared  with  placebo  to  prevent relapses in pediatric subjects who maintained a response for 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment for their symptoms of irritability associated with autistic disorder as measured by the time from randomization to relapse.

Secondary objectives of the study were:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To  evaluate  the  long-term  effect  of  aripiprazole  on  the  mean  change  from  end  of  Phase  1  to endpoint on the Irritability subscale of the ABC-I score
- To  evaluate  the  long-term  effect  of  aripiprazole  on  the  mean  Clinical  Global  ImpressionsImprovement Scale (CGI-I) score at endpoint

## Statistical Considerations

The analysis populations included the following:

- The Enrolled Sample comprised all subjects who signed informed consent.
- The  Phase  1  Safety  Sample  comprised  all  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  single-blind aripiprazole in Phase 1 (Stabilization Phase), as indicated on the study therapy form.
- The Phase 1 Efficacy Sample comprised all subjects who were in the Phase 1 Safety Sample and had at least 1 efficacy evaluation after the start of Phase 1 study drug.
- The Randomized Sample comprised all subjects who were randomized in Phase 2 (Randomization Phase).
- The Phase 2 Safety Sample comprised all subjects in the Randomized Sample who took at least 1 dose of double-blind medication in Phase 2, as indicated on the study therapy form.
- The Phase 2 Efficacy Sample comprised all subjects who were in the Phase 2 Safety Sample and had at least 1 efficacy evaluation after the start of Phase 2 study drug.

## Analysis Data Sets:

- The last observation carried forward (LOCF) data set included data recorded at a given visit or, if no observation was recorded at that visit, data carried forward from the previous visit.
- Baseline data of either Phase 1 or Phase 2 was not carried forward or averaged with on treatment data to impute missing values for the LOCF data set.
- The Observed Case (OC) data set consisted of the actual observation at each visit.

The LOCF data set was the primary data set. The analyses of the OC data set were considered secondary, and were performed to corroborate those analyses on the LOCF data set.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was the time from randomization to relapse. A total of 30 relapses would  have  provided  80%  power  to  detect  a  significant  difference  in  time  to  relapse  between  the  2 treatment groups using the log-rank test. This assumed a relapse rate of 25% in the aripiprazole group, a relapse rate of 55% in the placebo group, and a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.

The hazard ratio for these assumed relapse rates was 0.36.

The primary efficacy outcome measure above was evaluated by a survival analysis using the Randomized Sample. The survivorship function and estimated survivorship curves were obtained from Kaplan-Meier estimates. Survival distributions of the 2 treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test, stratified by  baseline  body  weight  (2  categories:  ≥  40  kg  and  &lt;  40  kg).  The  estimated  hazard  ratio  and  95% confidence  interval  (CI)  was  obtained  from  the  Cox  regression  model,  with  baseline  body  weight  (2 categories: ≥ 40 kg and &lt; 40 kg) as a stratification factor and with treatment group as a covariate.

The secondary outcome measures were mean change from baseline (end of Phase 1) to Week 16 endpoint (LOCF)  in  the  ABC-I,  and  mean  CGI-I  score  at  Week  16  endpoint  (LOCF).  The  mean  change  from baseline in the Irritability Subscale score was evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included the end of Phase 1 Irritability score as covariate, and treatment and baseline body weight (2 categories: ≥ 40 kg and &lt; 40 kg) as main effects.

The mean CGI-I score was evaluated using an ANCOVA model, with CGI-S end of Phase 1 score as covariate and treatment and baseline body weight (2 categories: ≥ 40 kg and &lt; 40 kg) as main effects.

Analysis  of  the  secondary  efficacy  measures  was  performed  on  the  Phase  2  Efficacy  Sample,  and  was repeated utilizing the OC data set.

For the analysis of the secondary outcome measures, a hierarchical testing procedure was used in order for the overall experiment-wise type I error rate to be kept at ≤ 0.05.

## Disposition

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total  of  215  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study,  and  157  (73%)  completed  the  screening  phase  and entered Phase 1 (Table below). Eighty-five subjects (54%) completed Phase 1 and were randomized in Phase 2 (41 and 44 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively).

Overall, 54% and 43% of aripiprazole and placebo subjects, respectively, completed Phase 2, and the most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy in both treatment groups.

(a) Percentages are based on the number of patients enrolled.

(C) Percentages are based on the number of patients randomized using the randomized treatment.

(q) Percentages are based on the number of patients completed Screening Phase and entered Phase 1 (Stabilization Phase) .

## Demographics

Demographic characteristics for the randomized sample were comparable across treatment groups (Table 4.3-1). The majority of subjects were male and White, and the median age was 10 years.

Baseline Disease Characteristics

In the Phase 1 safety sample, 81.3% of subjects were ≤ 12 years of age, 79.4% were male, and 69.0% were White.

Psychiatric evaluation of the randomized sample: at baseline, overall mean ABC  Irritability, Hyperactivity,  Stereotypy,  Social  Withdrawal,  and  Inappropriate  Speech  Scores  appeared  to  be  slightly higher  in  the  aripiprazole  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Mean  CGI-S  Scores  were  similar  in  both groups. In the Randomization Sample, the mean (median) time in stabilization was 135.0 (129.0) days and 125.3 (125.5) days in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively:

## Efficacy Results

There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  (p  =  0.097)  between  aripiprazole  and  placebo  for  the primary endpoint (time from randomization to relapse) (Randomized Sample). The Kaplan-Meier relapse rates  at  Week  16  were  32%  for  aripiprazole  and  50%  for  placebo  (hazard  ratio  of  0.57;  95%  CI:  0.28, 1.12).

The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample) was 5.2 and 9.6 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -4.4; 95% CI: -8.8, 0.0). The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (OC data set, Phase 2 efficacy sample) was improved in the aripiprazole group (-1.0) compared with the placebo group (3.6) (treatment difference of -4.55; 95% CI: -8.62, -0.48). The mean endpoint, CGI-I Score at Week 16 (LOCF  data  set,  Phase  2  Efficacy  Sample),  was  4.2  and  4.8  in  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups, respectively (treatment difference of -0.6; 95% CI: -1.3, 0.1).

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  (p  =  0.097)  between  aripiprazole  and  placebo  for  the primary endpoint (time from randomization to relapse) (randomized sample) (Figure 4.5 below and Figure S.5.1 and Table S.5.1 of the CN138603 final CSR). The Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at Week 16 were 32% for aripiprazole and 50% for placebo (hazard ratio of 0.57; 95% CI: 0.28, 1.12).

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

## ABC Irritability (ABC-I) Subscale Scores

The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample) was 5.2 and 9.6 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -4.4; 95% CI: -8.8, 0.0). The mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (OC data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample) was improved in the aripiprazole group (-1.0) compared with the placebo group (3.6) (treatment difference of -4.55; 95% CI: -8.62, -0.48). The median change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample) was improved in the aripiprazole group  (2.0)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (10.0)  (95%  CI:  0.0,  10.0).  At  Phase  1  endpoint,  the unadjusted mean change from baseline in ABC-I Subscale Score (OC data set, Phase 1 Efficacy Sample) was improved (-15.5).

## Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Score

The mean endpoint, CGI-I Score at Week 16 (LOCF data set, Phase 2 Efficacy Sample), was 4.2 and 4.8 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -0.6; 95% CI: -1.3, 0.1). At the Phase 1 endpoint, the unadjusted mean CGI-I Score (LOCF data set, Phase 1 Efficacy Sample) was 2.1.

## Additional Efficacy Endpoints

Time from Randomization to Relapse by Subgroups: The Cox proportional hazards model relapse rates at Week 16 for subjects ≤ 12 years were 37.5% and 48.5% for aripiprazole and placebo, respectively (hazard ratio  of  0.68;  95%  CI:  0.32,  1.43)  (Table  S.5.6  of  the  CN138603  final  CSR1).  The  Cox  proportional

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hazards model relapse rates at Week 16 for subjects &gt; 12 years were 11.1% (1 subject) and 54.5% for aripiprazole and placebo, respectively (hazard ratio of 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.51).

## SAFETY

No deaths were reported in this study.

## Phase 2 Safety Sample

No subjects  had  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  One  subject  had  an  adverse  event  (AE)  that  started  in Phase 1 and was randomized in error in Phase 2; this subject did not receive treatment in Phase 2. No treated subjects discontinued due to AEs.

The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was higher in the aripiprazole group (56.4%) than in the placebo group (32.6%).

Treatment-emergent  AEs  in  ≥  5%  of  subjects  in  either  the  aripiprazole  or  placebo  groups  were  upper respiratory tract infection (10.3% vs 2.3%), constipation and movement disorder (5.1% each vs 0% each), and vomiting (5.1% vs 4.7%).

Three subjects (7.7%) in the aripiprazole group had treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptom (EPS)related  AEs  (movement  disorder  in  2  subjects  and  akathisia,  extrapyramidal  disorder,  and  tremor  in  1 subject each). In the placebo group, 3 subjects (7.0%) had treatment-emergent EPS-related AEs (akathisia, muscle twitching, and tremor in 1 subject each).

The median changes from baseline in laboratory values to endpoint were generally similar between the aripiprazole and placebo groups; however, numerical differences were observed for relative eosinophils, creatine kinase, prolactin, and uric acid. Few clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were observed, except for non-fasting triglycerides and combined triglycerides: there were potentially significant changes in 6/20 in placebo (withdrawal) and 10/17 in aripiprazole group.

(a) Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used for all comparisons.

The adjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin (OC data set and Week 16 LOCF) was -0.2 and 4.6 ng/mL in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively.

The median changes from baseline in vital signs to endpoint were similar in both treatment groups. Few potentially  clinically  relevant  vital  sign  abnormalities  were  observed,  except  for  a  decrease  in  supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and a decrease in standing DBP. The adjusted mean change from baseline to  Week  16  (LOCF)  in  weight  was  significantly  greater  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (2.2  kg)  than  in  the placebo group (0.6 kg). Only 2 subjects (both in the placebo group) had relevant weight loss.

## Phase 1 Safety Sample

One subject had an SAE (aggression) that was not considered related to aripiprazole by the investigator. Thirteen  subjects  (8.4%)  had  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation;  the  only  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation reported in &gt; 1 subject were aggression and weight increased (1.3% each). Eighty percent of subjects had treatment-emergent AEs, and the most common events were weight increased, somnolence, and vomiting. Twenty-seven  subjects  (17.4%)  had  treatment-emergent  EPS-related  AEs,  and  the  only  treatmentemergent EPS-related AE reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was tremor (6.5%).

Few clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were observed, except for non-fasting triglycerides and combined  triglycerides,  which  have  changed  from  a)  nonfasting:  a  median  101  at  baseline  to  112  at

The unadjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin at endpoint was -4.7 ng/mL. Potentially clinically relevant vital sign abnormalities observed in ≥ 10% of subjects were a decrease in sitting DBP, sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP), standing SBP and DBP, and supine SBP and DBP and an increase in

Protocol:CN138603

Page 6 of 6

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sitting DBP. Mean and median changes from baseline to Week 26 in weight generally increased over time. Eleven subjects had potentially clinically relevant electrocardiogram (ECG)  abnormalities (sinus tachycardia in 3 subjects, ventricle premature beat in 1 subject, and other abnormalities in 7 subjects).

## Other Serious Adverse Events

## No subjects in the Phase 2 Safety Sample had SAEs.

In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  1  subject  (CN138603-37-47)  had  Grade  3  aggression  that  was  not considered  related  to  aripiprazole  by  the  investigator.  Aripiprazole  was  discontinued,  and  the  event resolved with sequela.

One enrolled subject (CN138603-1-2) had SAEs that started before or during the screening phase of the study (Grade 3 worsening of aggression and Grade 3 delusions) that were not considered related to the study drug by the investigator; the events resolved without treatment.

## Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy

One subject had an AE that started in Phase 1 and was randomized in error in Phase 2; this subject did not receive treatment in Phase 2. None of the treated subjects in the Phase 2 Safety Sample discontinued due to AEs. In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, 13 subjects (8.4%) had AEs that led to discontinuation. Adverse events that led to discontinuation reported in &gt; 1 subject were aggression and weight increased (2 subjects [1.3%] each). No subjects discontinued due to AEs with onset before or during the screening phase.

## Overall Adverse Events

In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  higher  in  the aripiprazole  group  (56.4%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (32.6%).  Treatment-emergent AEs in ≥ 5% of subjects  in  either  the  aripiprazole  or  placebo  groups  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (10.3%  vs 2.3%), constipation and movement disorder (5.1% each vs 0% each), and vomiting (5.1% vs 4.7%).

In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, 80.0% of subjects had treatment-emergent AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs reported  in  ≥  5%  of  subjects  were  weight  increased  (25.2%),  somnolence  (14.8%),  vomiting  (14.2%), increased appetite (12.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.3%), fatigue and insomnia (8.4% each), diarrhea  (7.1%),  tremor  (6.5%),  aggression  and  nasopharyngitis  (5.8%  each),  headache,  lethargy,  and pyrexia (5.2% each).

## Treatment-related Adverse Events

In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-related  AEs  was  higher  in  the aripiprazole group (23.1%) than in the placebo group (14.0%). All treatment-related AEs were reported in &lt; 5% of subjects in either treatment group (Table below).

In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  59.4%  of  subjects  had  treatment-related  AEs.  Treatment-related  AEs reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were weight increased (23.9%), increased appetite and somnolence (12.9% each), fatigue (7.7%), tremor (6.5%), and insomnia (5.8%).

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Intensity

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the majority of treatment-emergent AEs were mild in intensity. No Grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs were reported. Two subjects had Grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs (sinusitis in 1 subject in the aripiprazole group and aggression and irritability in 1 subject in the placebo group). In the Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  the  majority  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  were  mild  in  intensity.  No  Grade  4 treatment-emergent  AEs  were  reported.  Six  subjects  had  Grade  3  treatment-emergent  AEs  (weight increased in 4 subjects and aggression in 2 subjects).

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events During Phase 2 by Subgroup

By Gender

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was lower in male subjects in  the  aripiprazole  group  (42.9%)  than  in  female  subjects  (90.9%).  In  the  placebo  group,  the  overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was similar in male and female (32.4% and 33.3%, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## By Age

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was greater in subjects &gt; 12 years in the aripiprazole group (62.5%) than in subjects 'T 12 years (54.8%). In the placebo group, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was also greater in subjects &gt; 12 years (36.4%) than in subjects ≤ 12 years (31.3%).

## By Race

In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  the  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  greater  in  White subjects in the aripiprazole group (62.1%) than in non-White subjects (40.0%). In the placebo group, the overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  also  greater  in  White  subjects  (35.7%)  than  in  non-

## White subjects (26.7%).

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the median changes from baseline in laboratory values to endpoint were generally  similar  between  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups;  however,  differences  were  observed  for relative eosinophils, creatine kinase, prolactin, and uric acid. Few  clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities were observed, except for non-fasting triglycerides and combined triglycerides. In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin (OC data set and Week 16 LOCF) was -0.2 and 4.6 ng/mL in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively (treatment difference of -4.81; CI: -6.77, -2.85).

In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  the  median  changes  from  baseline  in  laboratory  values  to  endpoint  are summarized in Table S.7.6. Few  clinically  relevant  laboratory  abnormalities  were  observed,  except  for non-fasting triglycerides (32.3%) and combined triglycerides (23.1%).

In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the unadjusted mean change from baseline in serum prolactin at endpoint was -4.7 ng/mL.

## Electrocardiograms

In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the mean change from baseline in ECG parameters is summarized in Table S.7.11 of the CN138603 final CSR1:

## Vital Signs and Physical Findings

## Vital Signs

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the median changes from baseline in vital signs to endpoint were similar in both treatment groups. Few potentially clinically relevant vital sign abnormalities were observed, except for a decrease in supine DBP (15.6% and 16.7% in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively) and a decrease in standing DBP (13.5% and 12.2% in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively). In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the median changes from baseline in vital signs to Week 26 are summarized in Table S.7.17 of the CN138603 final CSR1. Potentially clinically relevant vital sign abnormalities observed in ≥10% of subjects were a decrease in sitting DBP (53.5%), a decrease in sitting SBP (46.5%), a decrease in standing SBP and DBP (20.4% each), a decrease in supine SBP and DBP (17.4% each), and an increase in sitting DBP (11.6%).

## Physical Examination Findings

In  the  Phase  2  Safety  Sample,  no  differences  in  height  were  observed  between  the  aripiprazole  and placebo groups. The change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at Week 16 was significantly greater in the aripiprazole group than in the placebo group across all analyses, except for the median percentile change in BMI.

In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  mean  and  median  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  26  in  height  varied slightly  over  time.  An  may  reflect  the  challenges  of  securing  subject  cooperation  with  a  height measurement  in  this  patient  population.  Mean  and  median  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  26  in  BMI varied slightly over time.

## Tanner Staging

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the number of subjects who advanced a Tanner stage for pubic hair was 3 and 4 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively. The number of subjects who advanced a Tanner stage for breast/genitals was 5 and 4 in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively. In the Phase 1

Safety  Sample,  24  and  21  subjects  advanced  a  Tanner  stage  for  pubic  hair  and  breast/genitals, respectively.

## Other Observations Related to Safety

## Weight Increase or Loss

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 16 (LOCF) in weight z-score was significantly greater in the aripiprazole group (0.1 kg) than in the placebo group (-0.0 kg) (treatment difference of 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.24):

## Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS)-related Side Effects

EPS-related side effects of dyskinesias, akathisia, parkinsonism, and other unwanted  effects of psychotropics were evaluated with the following standardized and generally recognized scales: Abnormal Involuntary  Movement  Scale  (AIMS),2  Barnes  Akathisia  Rating  Scale  (BARS),3  and  Simpson  Angus Scale (SAS).4

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, 3 subjects (7.7%) in the aripiprazole group had treatment-emergent EPSrelated  AEs  (movement  disorder  in  2  subjects  and  akathisia,  extrapyramidal  disorder,  and  tremor  in  1 subject each). In the placebo group, 3 subjects (7.0%) had treatment-emergent EPS-related AEs (akathisia, muscle twitching, and tremor in 1 subject each):

## Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in AIMS Total Score to Week 16 (OC  data  set  and  LOCF)  was  similar  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (-0.1)  and  the  placebo  group  (0.1) (treatment difference of -0.15; 95% CI: -0.50, 0.19). In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the unadjusted mean change from baseline in AIMS Total Score to Week 26 (LOCF) was -0.4.

Simpson Angus Scale (SAS)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in SAS Score to Week 16 (OC data set and LOCF) was significantly greater in the aripiprazole group (-0.3) than in the placebo group (0.0) (treatment difference of -0.37; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.00;). In the Phase 1 Safety Sample, the unadjusted mean change from baseline in SAS Score to Week 26 (LOCF) was -0.4.

## Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)

In the Phase 2 Safety Sample, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BARS Score to Week 16 (OC data set and LOCF) was similar in the aripiprazole group (-0.1) and the placebo group (0.0) (treatment difference  of  -0.10;  95%  CI:  -0.23,  -0.03).  In  the  Phase  1  Safety  Sample,  the  unadjusted  mean  change from baseline in BARS Score to Week 26 (LOCF) was -0.1.

## OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

Aripiprazole did not achieve statistical significance vs placebo on the primary outcome measure, the time to relapse. The effect size observed was smaller than what was used to power the study. Similar findings were observed on the 2 secondary outcome  measures:  mean change from baseline (end of Phase 1) to Week 16 endpoint (LOCF) in ABC-I score, and mean CGI-I score at Week 16 endpoint (LOCF). No SAEs or discontinuations of treatment due to AEs occurred during the randomized phase. AEs were as expected  with  aripiprazole  in  pediatric  subjects.  The  Week  16  LOCF  mean  change  in  weight  z-score during Phase 2 was -0.0 in the placebo group and 0.1 in the aripiprazole group. During Phase 2, median changes were small in both the aripiprazole and placebo groups on fasting total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides.

## BENEFITS AND RISKS CONCLUSIONS

The results from Study CN138603 do not change the overall benefit/risk profile of aripiprazole.

## Assessment

MAH has presented the final results of a randomised withdrawal study to assess safety / maintenance of efficacy  beyond  3  months  (12  weeks)  for  paediatric  patients  with  irritability  associated  with  autistic disorder with ages 6 to 17 years old, requested by FDA as a post approval commitment.

Analysis of data do not raise particular concerns in efficacy beyond 12 weeks in the presented indication, although  some  tolerance  seem  to  develop.  Presented  efficacy  data  do  not  jeopardise  any  of  the  EU approved indications.

Regarding safety, there were relevant adverse events occurring in paediatric population, both in frequency and in severity, as compared to the adult population, namely concerning weight gain and EPS.

These  however  are  in  line  with  the  adverse  event  profile  observed  in  the  main  studies  which  led  to approval of the paediatric indications.

Regarding the cardiac effects and the changes in QTc since there was at least a case with QTc increase above &gt; 30 msec, the MAH should continue monitoring effects on ECG and cardiac AEs and present the data in the PSURs.

The  drop  out  rate  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  and  /  or  adverse  events  is  very  high  (46%).  These  values however,  are  within  the  range  of  both  aripiprazole  in  other  indications  and  age  ranges  and  of  other antipsychotics in autism. During stabilization phase most patients / caregivers may withdraw their consent without further notice, and lack of efficacy vs intolerance cannot be disentangled. On the other hand, in phase  2,  when  caregivers  know  that  the  pt  may  be  under  placebo,  drop  out  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  is expected. Thus we would also not consider this high drop out rate as unexpected.

The MAH has received the initial proposal of SmPC change where we proposed for Section 5.1: Where it reads:

'Irritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2):

Aripiprazole  was  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  years  in  two  8-week,  placebo-controlled  trials  [one flexible-dose  (2-15  mg/day)  and  one  fixed-dose  (5,  10,  or  15  mg/day)]  and  in  one  52-week  open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile  included  weight  gain  and  changes  in  prolactin  levels.  The  duration  of  the  long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (&lt;3 ng/ml) and males (&lt;2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298 (86.6%), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole.'

Should read (appended text underlined):

'Irritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2):

Aripiprazole  was  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  years  in  two  8-week,  placebo-controlled  trials  [one flexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] in one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile  included  weight  gain  and  changes  in  prolactin  levels.  The  duration  of  the  long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (&lt;3 ng/ml) and males (&lt;2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298 (86.6%), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole.

Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  a  placebo-controlled  withdrawal  safety  study,  after  a  13-26  week stabilisation on aripiprazole 2-15 mg; after this period, patients were either maintained on aripiprazole or switched  to  placebo  for  further  16  weeks.  The  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole compared with placebo to prevent relapses in pediatric subjects who maintained a response for 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment. Relapse rates at Week 16 were 32% for aripiprazole and 50% for placebo (non statistically significant difference).There was an increase in median weight of 2.5 Kg in the stabilisation phase on aripiprazole, and a further median increase on aripiprazole (1.5 Kg) as compared to placebo (0.3  Kg)  in  the  second  phase  of  the  study.  Extrapyramidal  symptoms  were  also  reported  in  17%  of patients, with tremor totalling 6.5%.'

## The MAH has proposed the new version:

Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  years  in  a  placebo-controlled,  long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week stabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on aripiprazole or switched to placebo for further 16 weeks. KaplanMeier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo and the hazard ratio for relapse (aripiprazole/placebo)  was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). In this growing paediatric population, the mean weight gain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were reported during the open  stabilisation  phase  in  17%  of  patients,  with  tremor  accounting  for  6.5%.  During  the  placebo substitution phase, extrapyramidal symptoms were equally reported in aripiprazole patients 3/39 (7.7%) and patients on placebo 3/43 (7.0%).

## Applicant's Rationale for Changes:

The Applicant is in agreement to amend SmPC section 5.1 with information on study CN138-603.

Besides  some  editorial  changes  on  the  study  design,  the  Applicant  would  like  to  clarify  the  proposed modifications related to the primary endpoint:

The relapse rates quoted of 32% for aripiprazole and 50% for placebo reported in the clinical study report (CSR) synopsis and Efficacy Results and Discussion sections of the CSR were mislabelled as KaplanMeier rates, when in fact they are the simple proportions (Number of Events/Number of Patients) from Table  S.5.1.  The  simple  proportions  are  not  adjusted  for  censoring  in  the  time  from  randomization  to relapse analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint. The actual Kaplan-Meier relapse rates are estimated from the product-limit survival estimates at Week 16 from Table S.5.3. Kaplan-Meier rates are calculated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as 1 minus the proportion of subjects not experiencing relapse, which works out to 35% for aripiprazole and  52%  for  placebo.  These  Kaplan-Meier  rates  reflect  the  impact  of  censored  observations  in  the estimates of probability of no relapse at a given point in time.

With regard to the observed weight gain the Applicant would like to highlight that given the investigated age range (6-17 years) this is a growing paediatric population.

Please note that the EPS rate (17%) reported during the open stabilisation phase corresponds to the overall randomised population and not just to the responder population from the subsequent double-blind placebo substitution phase.

## Assessors comments:

It  makes  no  sense  to  repeat  the  sentence Aripiprazole  was  also  studied  in  patients  aged  6  to  17  ye ars, because  it  is  previously  stated  above.  Moreover,  it  reports  to  this  special  autistic  population,  and  not children in any indication. The string 'long term study' is acceptable, since it follows the Guideline for long  term  studies  in  schizophrenia  -  the  randomised  withdrawal  design  is  not  accompanied  by  a description of a minimal duration to be considered a long term study.

The introduction ' In this growing paediatric population' is compelling and induces readers to think that these children are growing and is therefore normal to put up 5,4 Kg within 32 to 40 weeks on aripiprazole treatment - and this is simply not the case. Therefore this must not be introduced.

The wording regarding Kaplan Meyer curve analysis is accepted, but the timeframe of relapse should be highlighted.

The sentence 'During the placebo substitution phase, extrapyramidal symptoms were equally reported in aripiprazole patients 3/39 (7.7%) and patients on placebo 3/43 (7.0%)' may be misleading: in the second phase  there  was  a  selection  bias,  since  the  patients  that  had  significant  EPS  in  the  stabilisation  phase possibly did not continue to the substitution phase (there was a significant reduction in the sample from phase 1 to phase 2). Moreover, the 3 patients in each arm that constituted the 7.7 and 7.0% were described as 'treatment emergent AEs', meaning that these were 'de novo' EPS, and not patients continuing from one phase to the other with EPS. Therefore we propose not to include this statement. In conclusion, it is proposed the text below:

Aripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week stabilisation  on  aripiprazole  (2-15  mg/day)  patients  with  a  stable  response  were  either  maintained  on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks (aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17% of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5%.

## II. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ACTION IF REQUIRED

This randomised withdrawal study for the study of maintenance of effect / possible rebound phenomena upon discontinuation of abilify in irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 years old, requested by FDA as a post approval commitment did not raise new efficacy or safety concerns.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study involved a population and indication not approved in Europe. Although no new safety issues have  arisen  in  comparison  with  the  AE  profile  of  EU  approved  indications,  there  is  information  on Irritability associated with autistic disorder in the SPC that can be updated. Therefore a change to SPC is proposed.

Regarding the cardiac effects and the changes in QTc since there was at least a case with QTc increase above &gt; 30 msec, the MAH should continue monitoring effects on ECG and cardiac AEs and present the data in the PSURs.

## PAC No. P46-065

Overall Conclusion:

The  results  from  Study  CN138603  do  not  change  the  paediatric  or  the  overall  benefit/risk  profile  of aripiprazole.

- PAC not fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled but further action required):

As outcome of this assessment, the MAH is requested to update the Product Information as follows and to submit the corresponding variation by one month:

Proposed changes to the SPC:

## Section 5.1:

Where it reads:

'Irritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2): Aripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one flexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (&lt;3 ng/ml) and males (&lt;2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298 (86.6%), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole.'

In the placebo-controlled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole.

Aripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week stabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks

(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17% of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5%.

Note: no change is proposed to Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration.
