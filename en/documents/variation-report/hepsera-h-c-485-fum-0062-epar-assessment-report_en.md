## 1 INTRODUCTION

In accordance with the letter of undertaking generated at the time of the Hepsera renewal, Gilead is submitting its response to the following Follow-up Measure, which details data generated from study GS-00-494 (a NIH study) for Hepsera:

## Follow-upMeasure:

Of the 41 patients enrolled, 31 were HBeAg-positive and 31 were naïve to prior treatment. At 192 weeks, 30 patients remained on ADV alone or ADV+LAM. The results clearly demonstrate that mean reduction in HBV DNA at week 48 was significantly higher in patients taking ADV+LAM compared  with  ADV  monotherapy. Furthermore,  a  greater proportion  of patients receiving combination  therapy  had  a  combined  response  of  additive  antiviral  response  and  prevention  of antiviral  resistance  at  1  year  (59%  versus  26%,  p  =  0.06)  compared  with  those  receiving  ADV monotherapy, and this was significant at 4 years (68%versus 31% respectively, p = 0.03).

2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION At  the  time  of  the  Hepsera  (adefovir  dipivoxil)  marketing  authorisation  approval  in  March  2003,  a study was ongoing and being conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA. Study GS-00-494  examined  the  benefit  of  combination  therapy  with  adefovir  and  lamivudine  for  the treatment of chronic hepatitis B when compared with adefovir therapy alone. The results of this study formed one of the commitments made by the MAH (Gilead Sciences International Ltd) in the resulting MA Letter of Undertaking. The final data from study GS-00-494 (a National Institutes of Health, NIH, study) were provided in full as two peer-reviewed references (eCTD seq 25) and were also discussed by the MAH within the response to FUM document and are summarized below. The first reference of Ghany et al (2012) presents the first 4 years of safety and efficacy data, whilst the  second  reference  Gara  et  al  (2012),  presents  up  to  10  years  of  long-term  follow-up  on  patients enrolled in GS-00-494. 2.1.  Randomised  Clinical  Trial:  The  Benefit  of  Combination  therapy  With  Adefovir  and Lamivudine for Chronic Hepatitis B (Ghany et al , 2012) Ghany et  al  drew  upon  the  benefits  observed  with  combination  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and proposed the same hypothesis to the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In theory, the benefits of combination therapy are heightened antiviral activity and prevention of drug  resistance.  Therefore,  in  the  NIH  study  (GS-00-494) 41  patients were enrolled with  chronic hepatitis  B  that may,  or  may  not,  have  been  previously  treated  with  LAM . Patients  were randomized to receive ADV alone (10 mg/day) or ADV (10 mg/day) + LAM (100 mg/day) for up to 192 weeks. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

In this study, combination therapy lowered the rate of virological breakthrough and antiviral resistance such that no patient on ADV+LAM developed genotypic resistance compared to 32% of those on

ADV monotherapy. The advantages of preventing antiviral resistance by using combination therapy was evident at the end of 192 weeks, and consisted of a significantly higher rate of complete viral suppression and HBeAg loss in the combination group compared to the monotherapy group. However, the rate of HBsAg loss was low (1 patient only).

Patients had 3 liver biopsies throughout the course of the study which revealed that there is substantial histological benefit to maintaining undetectable HBV DNA levels for 4 years.

There  were  significant  improvements  in  fibrosis,  including  reversal  of  cirrhosis  compared  with baseline. Moreover, at week 192 a third of patients had complete resolution of fibrosis and a quarter had a normal liver biopsy. There was no significant difference between treatment paradigms.

The second follow-on safety study examined renal tubular dysfunction (RTD) observed as a result of up to 10 years treatment with ADV+LAM, ADV, TDF or TDF following ADV therapy. This safety study was limited by patient numbers and the lack of pre-treatment assessment of urinary phosphate transport  and  lack  of  bone  and  renal  biopsies  to  assess  osteomalacia  and  structural  renal  damage. However, it was reported that up to 15% of patients (n=7) in the study experienced symptoms of RTD, only one of which was initially on TDF monotherapy. Of the others, 5 were on ADV+LAM and 1 was on ADV followed by TDF. It is recommended within the respective ADV and TDF SmPCs to closely monitor renal function whilst on treatment.

2.2. Renal Tubular Dysfunction during Long-Term Adefovir or Tenofovir Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis B (Gara et al, 2012) The  majority  of  patients  enrolled  in  NIH  study,  GS-00-494,  were  enrolled  into  a  follow-on  safety study to examine patients with chronic hepatitis B on therapy with either ADV or tenofovir (TDF) between  2002  and  2007.  Of  the  51  patients,  42  were  treated  with  ADV  (most  on  ADV+LAM combination  therapy),  4  with  TDF  or  ADV  followed  by  TDF  (n=5)  for  up  to  10  years  (mean  7.4 years). Patients were examined for evidence of renal tubular dysfunction (RTD) using a new definition which required de novo appearance of at least 3 of 5 features: hypophosphataemia, hypouricaemia, serum creatinine elevation, proteinuria or glucosuria. Seven patients developed RTD (14%) and time to onset ranged from 22 to 94 months. The estimated 10-year cumulative rate was 15%. Patients with RTD were older (58 versus 44 years; p = 0.01) and had lower baseline glomerular filtration rates compared to those without. All  other  features  did  not  differ.  Six  patients  with  RTD  were  switched  to  entecavir  and  had improvements in serum phosphate, creatinine, uric acid levels and proteinuria. 2.3. MAH's conclusion The original NIH study (GS-00-494) demonstrated that significant clinical benefit can be achieved by administering  a  combination  of  ADV+LAM  to  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B.  Not  only  is combination  therapy  synergistic  and  additive  in  terms  of  efficacy,  virological  breakthrough  and antiviral resistance is minimized  when  using  two  distinct  nucleoside/nucleotide analogues  in combination when compared to monotherapy. This is in accordance with the current Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) SmPC. Furthermore,  in-line  with  data  recently  reported  and  included  in  the  Viread  (tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate) SmPC, long-term suppression of HBV DNA results in significant histological benefits, such as improvements in fibrosis and reversal of cirrhosis. This  study  began  prior  to  the  availability  of  second  generation  nucleoside  analogues,  such  as TDF and entecavir, which are more potent and have a better resistance profile (0% at 5 years for TDF, and 1% over 6 years for entecavir; see TDF and entecavir SmPCs) when compared to either ADV or LAM monotherapy (29% and 69%, respectively). However, the study demonstrated value in highlighting alternative treatment paradigms should monotherapy treatment fail. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

In  conclusion,  the  initial  NIH  and  subsequent  follow-on  safety  study  did  not  reveal  any  new information on the use of ADV in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The MAH proposed at this time not to amend the current SmPC for ADV.

## 3 DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CHMP CONCLUSIONS

The scope of the present FUM was the submission of the NIH study (also identified as GS-00-494) comparing  ADV  monotherapy  versus  de  novo  LAM+ADV  in  CHB-infected  patients.  The  study included 41 patients, 31 of which were treatment-naïve patients. The study results show that adefovir should not be used as monotherapy since maintenance of viral suppression was more common with combination ADV+LAM therapy.

Of  note,  the  advantage  of  ADV+LAM  combination  therapy  (as  compared  to  switch  to  ADV monotherapy) in terms of reducing the risk for resistance in patients with lamivudine-resistance has been fully acknowledged and this strategy was recommended in the Hepsera SmPC in 2008 (through Hepsera Type II33 variation). Whether de novo combination rather than monotherapy would be also of interest in naïve patients might have been a topic for discussion at the time of the study start (2001), notably since at this time the HBV armamentarium was limited to drugs with low to moderate genetic barrier  of  resistance.  However,  nowadays,  the  availability  of  more  potent  agents  with  high  genetic barrier for resistance has markedly changed the situation. As stressed by the authors and reflected in the  EASL  guidelines,  with  the  availability  of  more  potent  agents  with  high  genetic  barrier  for resistance, there is no evidence to favour de novo combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs in naïve patients over monotherapy with entecavir or tenofovir.

Since the initial  MA,  the  resistance  profile  of  ADV  has  proven  to  be  worse  than  established  at  the stage of the initial approval. Thus, available long term data have shown a 25% cumulative probability of  emergence  of  resistance  at  5  years.  Moreover,  even  though  the  two  key  mutations  that  confer resistance  to  ADV  remain  rtN236T  and  rtA181V,  a  signal  towards  a  possible  impact  of  the  single rt181T mutation on ADV resistance has been more recently identified. As a consequence of the above, change of therapy was recommended in patients with partial virologic response (&gt;1000 copies/ml at or beyond 1 year) and the combined use of ADV and LAM was recommended for the management of LAM-R patients to delay the appearance of ADV resistance and virological breakthrough.

However, beyond this discussion on mono- versus bi-therapy, the critical issue for Hepsera pertains to its current inappropriate 'unqualified' indication in monotherapy. As a reminder, Hepsera was authorised in Europe for the treatment of chronic HBV infected patients in March 2003. The clinical development programme for adefovir dipivoxil enrolled a wide range of patients. More than 1000 patients were included in supportive and pivotal studies that encompassed naives  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  (HBeAg  positive  and  HBeAg  negative,  respectively)  and compensated  liver  disease,  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  failing  lamivudine  therapy  who  have received a liver transplantation or who are waiting for a transplantation, patients with lamivudineresistant chronic hepatitis B infection, including studies in patients with compensated/decompensated liver disease, and in patients co-infected with HIV. In  pivotal  studies  (in  naïve  patients)  the  superiority  of  adefovir  dipivoxil  versus  placebo  was demonstrated regardless of baseline characteristic. The efficacy was consistently observed whatever the type of response: histological, virological biochemical, serological or clinical) the disease subtype (HBeAg positive, negative, compensated or not) and the virus subtype (wild type or YMDD mutants associated with lamivudine resistance). Those data have been reflected in the SmPC at the time of the MA. Of note, the genotypic and phenotypic data derived from the MA clinical studies did not show any mutation  induced  resistance  associated  with  the  use  of  adefovir  dipivoxil  but  the  risk  of  delayed emergence of resistance was stressed.

As regards the safety, it is worth mentioning that the safety concern for Hepsera mainly pertains to its renal toxicity (risk of renal failure and proximal renal tubulopaty) and adverse events having possible mitochondrial  toxicity  involvement  such  as  myoptahy,  pancreatitis.  As  for  tenofovir,  there  are remaining uncertainties pertaining to the long term safety data in particular renal events and impact on the bone due to progressive loss of phosphate.

The publication from Gara et al. provided in the current submission adds further to this concern since the authors found that 'renal tubular dysfunction develops in 15% of patients treated with adefovir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(n=42) or tenofovir (n=4) or adefovir followed by tenofovir (n=5) for 2 to 9 years and is partially reversible with change to other antivirals'.

Moreover, since the MA of Hepsera was granted, the standard of care has evolved. Two medicinal products  with  both  high  potency  and  high  genetic  barrier  to  resistance  have  become  the  'gold standard'  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  infection  in  Europe.  Those  are  Baraclude (entecavir) and Viread (tenofovir). Those medicinal products may be considered as major advance for HBV-infected patients and have changed the therapeutic management of patients, at least in Europe. They are recommended as first-line monotherapy in EASL guidelines and have become the medicinal products of choice for initiation of treatment. It is however acknowledged that ADV may still have a role  in  clinical  practice  in  patients  where  more  recently  approved  agents  are  not  yet  available  or affordable and in patients who may be intolerant to TDF or ETV.

To this purpose, it appears misleading that the indication for Hepsera puts artificially adefovir at the same level as second-generation nucleoside analogues. Therefore, as previously stated by the CHMP, the SmPC for Hepsera should reflect the fact that ADV can no longer be regarded as an optimal first line monotherapy besides tenofovir or entecavir. Therefore, the indication of Hepsera should be revised to recommend the initiation of Hepsera only as a second line option. This  is  consistent  with  the  attitude  adopted  for  Zeffix  and  Sebivo  and  fully  in  line  with  expert recommendation such as those given in the EASL guidelines. For this purpose, it is proposed to revise the SmPC as follows : '4.1 Therapeutic indications Hepsera is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with: · compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  levels  and  histological  evidence  of  active  liver  inflammation and fibrosis. Initiation of Hepsera treatment should only be considered when the use of an alternative  antiviral  agent  with  a  higher  genetic  barrier  to  resistance  is  not  available  or appropriate. · decompensated liver disease in combination with a second agent without cross-resistance to Hepsera . 4.2 Posology and method of administration Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B. Adults: The  recommended  dose  of  Hepsera  is  10 mg  (one  tablet)  once  daily  taken  orally  with  or without food. Higher doses must not be administered. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

In patients with decompensated liver disease, adefovir should always be used in combination with a second agent, without cross-resistance to adefovir, to reduce the risk of resistance and to achieve rapid viral suppression.'

Changes in other sections of the SPC are not deemed necessary.

Moreover, with the submission of data from study GS-00-494, the condition in annex II (obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures) has been fulfilled and can therefore be deleted.
