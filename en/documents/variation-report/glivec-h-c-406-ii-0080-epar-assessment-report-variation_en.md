## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement:

Acute  leukaemia,  the  most  common  form  of  cancer  in  children,  comprises  approximately  30%of  all childhood malignancies, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) being five times more common than acute myeloid leukaemia. Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) is characterised  by  the  presence  of  the  Philadelphia  chromosome,  a  reciprocal  translocation  between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t(9;22)(q34;q11)) resulting in the fusion  of  the  break  cluster  region  (bcr) gene  on  chromosome  22  with  c-abl  gene  sequences  translocated  from  chromosome  9  and  the expression of the BCR-ABL protein. BCR-ABL fusion proteins are constitutively active tyrosine kinases that  can  alter  multiple  signalling  pathways,  which  contribute  to  tumour  growth  and  proliferation. Ph+ALL accounts for 15-30% of adult ALL and up to 5% of paediatric ALL.

Survival  rates  for  ALL  have  improved  dramatically  since  the  1980s,  with  a  current  five-year  overall survival  rates  estimated  at  greater  than  85  percent.  In  children,  long-term  survival  rates  are approximately 80%. This improvement in survival is due to treatment of a large number of children on sequential standardised research protocols.

Unfortunately, with chemotherapy alone, only 20-30% of children with Ph+ ALL are cured. Allogeneic hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  (HSCT)  with  a  closely  matched  donor  in  first  complete remission cures 60% of patients. A review of 326 documented cases of Ph+ ALL diagnosed and treated by  ten  study  groups  and  institutions  from  1986  to  1996  described  estimated  5  year  disease-free survival ranging from 49% to 20%, for patients with the best and worst prognosis, respectively (Arico, 2000).

Treatment  of  children  with  ALL  involves  administration  of  a  multidrug  regimen  that  is  divided  into several  phases  (ie,  induction,  consolidation,  and  maintenance)  and  includes  therapy  directed  to  the central nervous system (CNS). Most treatment protocols take two to three years to complete, although the specific regimen varies depending upon immunophenotype and risk category.

Induction therapy is the initial phase of treatment and is designed to place the patient in remission. More  than  90%  of  children  and  adolescents  with  ALL  enter  CR  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy regardless  of  their  initial  risk  grouping.  Induction  therapy  usually  involves  weekly  administration  of vincristine for three to four weeks, daily corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone), and asparaginase, either in its pegylated form or as 6 to 12 doses of L-asparaginase. A fourth agent such as an anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin or daunorubicin) may be added to the three-dose regimen, particularly  for  high-risk  patients.  Early  clearance  of  lymphoblasts  from  the  bone  marrow  and  the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 15 and the end of induction therapy are the best indicators of outcome. Patients who respond rapidly to the induction regimen appear to have a more favorable  outcome,  whereas  those  who  have  a  slow  response  or  who  fail  induction  therapy  have  a more guarded prognosis. Induction failure, which occurs in fewer than 5%of cases, is defined by the persistence of leukemic blasts in the blood, bone marrow, or any extramedullary site after four to six weeks of remission-induction therapy. Induction failure has historically been considered a particularly ominous sign and an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

Leukemic involvement of the CNS at the time of diagnosis is an uncommon finding, occurring in fewer than 5% of patients. However, before the use of preventive CNS therapy, up to 80 percent of children with  ALL  who  were  in  complete  bone  marrow  remission  relapsed  with  \"leukemic  meningitis\".  The routine use of preventive CNS therapy is a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of childhood ALL. CNS treatment usually begins during the induction phase and continues throughout the remainder of the treatment regimen.

Consolidation or intensification therapy is the second phase of ALL treatment and is initiated soon after attainment  of  CR.  Ongoing  treatment  is  required  because  small  numbers  of  leukemic  lymphoblasts

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(referred  to  as  MRD)  remain  in  the  bone  marrow  despite  histologic  evidence  of  CR  after  induction therapy. In such cases, relapse occurs quickly if therapy is not continued.

The  goal  of  post-induction  chemotherapy  is  to  prevent  leukemic  regrowth,  reduce  residual  tumour burden, and prevent the emergence of drug-resistance in the remaining leukemic cells.

Consolidation therapy usually lasts from four to six months. It commonly involves the use of several different drug combinations and drugs with mechanisms of action that differ from those used during the induction phase. The MRD status is one of the most important predictor of disease-free and overall survival. Patients with detectable MRD have an increased risk of relapse after conventional therapy. As a general rule, the higher the risk for treatment failure, the more aggressive the intensification therapy plan.

Selected patients with high-risk disease have an increased incidence of relapse during intensification chemotherapy  (eg,  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  ALL,  severe  hypodiploid  ALL  (less  than  46 chromosomes), infants with ALL, and those who have failed initial induction therapy). These patients are candidates for receiving HCT during first remission.

In  the  maintenance  therapy, the  overall  treatment  duration  for  most  children  with  ALL  is  24  to  36 months. After completion of the consolidation or intensification phase of therapy, patients often receive a less intensive continuation regimen using daily oral 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and weekly methotrexate with periodic intrathecal therapy.

Approximately 20 to 25 percent of children with ALL fail initial treatment. Patients with relapsed ALL require aggressive reinduction therapy and intensification, often using agents not administered in the original treatment protocol. Nelarabine and clofarabine have been used for the treatment of relapsed ALL. Although patients in first relapse usually attain a second remission with induction chemotherapy, they often relapse after short periods despite aggressive treatment. These patients are candidates for HCT once they have attained second remission

## About the product

Imatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase (TK) and of several other receptor TKs, including KIT, the stem cell factor (SCF)  receptor,  the  discoidin  domain  receptors  (DDR1  and  DDR2),  the  colony  stimulation  factor receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β (PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β). The inhibitory effects of imatinib on primary ALL blasts expressing p190BCR-ABL are similar to those observed on primary chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) blasts expressing p210BCR-ABL.

Glivec  is  currently  approved  in  over  110  countries  for  the  treatment  of  both  haematological malignancies  and  solid  tumours.  Glivec  is  already  approved  in  a  paediatric  indication  (paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase after failure of interferonalpha therapy) at a recommended dose of 340 mg/m2 daily. Glivec is currently approved in the EU for the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  integrated  with  chemotherapy  at  a recommended  dose  of  600  mg/day.  Glivec  is  also  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL.

The present application is intended to seek approval for the following indication: 'Glivec, integrated with chemotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia'.

A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) was developed in accordance with Article 8 of the European Regulation (EC) 1901/2006. A final opinion from the EMA PDCO was received on 27 January 2012 on the acceptance of a modification of an agreed paediatric investigation plan for imatinib mesilate (Glivec) (EMEA-000463-PIP01-08-M03).

In the context of the PIP, the Company was asked to submit the results of three studies:

- -Study 1: Open-label, multi-centre, non-randomised, dose-escalation trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of chemotherapy, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and imatinib in children from 1 year to less than 18 years (and young adults) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Study 2: Open-label, multi-centre, randomised trial to evaluate safety, activity and efficacy of imatinib on top of chemotherapy and in combination with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children from 1 year to less than 18 years with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
- -Study 3: Development and validation of an integrated physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and population pharmacokinetics model

Overall, the PIP agreed by the PDCO has been followed and the PDCO has issued an opinion that the studies were completed in compliance with the PIP and that the timelines have been respected.

The Company has submitted the three studies.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical studies were submitted.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The maximum anticipated daily dose foreseen for imatinib in paediatric patients is 600 mg.

Imatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is a substrate of CYP3A4, resulting in one main metabolite, the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, with similar pharmacological activity as the parent substance. Excretion of imatinib as unchanged parent substance accounts for 25% with 5% and 20% excreted in urine and faeces,  respectively.  Results  from  a  new  study  on  toxicity  to  sedimentdwelling organisms (OECD219) have been reported and a Tier B assessment was conducted.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

The pharmacologic properties and the toxicological profile of imatinib mesylate have been adequately described  and  assessed  in  previous  applications.  No  additional  non-clinical  studies  are  considered necessary.

Imatinib mesylate is not a PBT substance. The calculation of the PECsediment using the equation R1635 and the study following the OECD219 guidance are considered appropriate. A risk for sediment organisms has been identified. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements (see SmPC sections 5.3, 6.6).

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

Imatinib is available as two different dosage forms: hard gelatin capsules and film-coated tablets. For paediatric  patients  who  are  unable  to  swallow  the  capsules,  the  capsules  may  be  opened  and  the contents should be dissolved either in water or in apple juice. For paediatric patients who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablets, the tablets may be dispersed in a glass of mineral water or apple juice per instruction of SmPC.

## 2.3.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

This  application  included  two  modelling  study  reports  [pooled  population  pharmacokinetic  modelling report update] and [PBPK modelling report update]. The pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted in paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years with haematological disorders including CML, Ph+ALL, or other imatinib indicated haematological disorders in four clinical studies: CSTI571A0103, CSTI57103001, CSTI571A2108, and CSTI571A2110. Since the 100 mg and 400 mg tablet formulations were bioequivalent with the 100 mg hard gelatin capsule, it is appropriate to pool PK data from the above 4 studies into a single popPK analysis.

- [CSTI571A2108] was a phase II non-randomised single arm study to determine the response rate of imatinib in paediatric CML and delineate its toxicity and PK in paediatric patients. Imatinib was administered orally, at 340mg/m2, rounded to the nearest 100 mg increment, once daily. In the absence  of  dose-limiting  toxicities,  there  was  no  planned  interruption  of  therapy.  Each  28-day period was considered a treatment course.
- [CSTI57103001] was a phase 1 dose-finding study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and PD profiles of imatinib in patients with CML resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN). Six children received 175 to 260 mg/m2 daily dose and had evaluable PK data for the popPK analysis.
- [CSTI57A10103] was a phase 1 dose-finding study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK/PD and efficacy of imatinib in paediatric patients with Ph+ leukaemia. The starting dose was 260 mg/m2 daily and dose was escalated to 340, 440, 570 mg/m2.
- Study [CSTI571A2110] was a non-randomised, open-label study in which patients diagnosed with CML, Ph+ ALL or other imatinib indicated  haematological  disorders  between  the  ages  of  1  to  4 years  were  administered  a  daily  dose  of  STI571  ranging  from  260  mg/m2  to  340  mg/m2.  The duration of this study was a maximum of 21 days, during which 2 sets of PK profiles were collected from each patient. This study was discontinued early as agreed by PDCO due to the lack of patient population and accrual.

## Pooled Population Pharmacokinetics Modeling

Experimental methods and data: Data from subjects between 2 and 18 years of age were pooled from studies  CSTI571A2110,  CSTI571A2108,  CSTI57103001,  and  CSTI5710103.  Plasma  concentrations were measured for imatinib and the major pharmacologically active metabolite CGP74588.

Data analysis and modeling methods: Nonlinear mixed-effects models for the popPK of imatinib and CGP74588 were developed using NONMEM Version VI Level 2.0 with METHOD=1 INTERACTION. The likelihood function and diagnostic plots were used to assess goodness of fit and to suggest refinements to the model.

As part of the model validation, the final model was refitted by excluding the subjects younger than 4 years. The parameter estimates were compared to the corresponding estimates from the full dataset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The concentration-time course of the 9 excluded subjects was predicted and compared to the observed concentrations.

The final model was used to assess clearance across body surface area (BSA), body weight and age. The  clearance  relationship  with  body  weight  from  the  final  model  was  compared  to  a  previously reported adult model.

The final model was then used to simulate PK parameters and related PK exposure measures (AUC, Cmax,  Cmin)  for  the  proposed  paediatric  doses  of  260  and  340  mg/m2,  as  well  as  for  various alternative dosing schemes, including those designed to match the AUC for children with adults.

The  target  exposures  used  in  the  model-based  simulations  for  dosing  schemes  MODELAUC40  and MODELAUC60 were derived from previous population PK analysis in adult CML patients. The previous adult CML patient modeling suggested that CL is approximately 10 L/h and AUCs were approximately 40 and 60 h×mg/L for adult 400 mg and 600 mg dose, respectively, from an integrated popPK report in adult patients.

## Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) Modeling Report

PBPK model reflects current knowledge about pharmacological processes that are known to be well characterised. Therefore poor characterisation of some physiological or pharmacological process with respect to imatinib  in  younger  children  aged 1-2  years  may  lead  to  a  sub-optimal  estimation  of  PK behaviour of imatinib in this age group. Therefore it is important to consider the validity of some model assumptions  and  uncertainty  of  model  parameters  when  one  interprets  the  results  from  PBPK modelling.

Objectives:

-  To predict pediatric AUC at steady-state using PBPK approach based on imatinib clearance in adult population, then compare the results with the experimentally observed AUC values, with specific focus on children age 1 year and older.
-  To  predict  imatinib  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  in  plasma  and  tissue  in  pediatric subjects, and to assess the effect of pediatric growth processes using a PBPK model
-  To evaluate factors influencing imatinib exposure in pediatric patients

Experimental methods and data: Paediatric growth database was obtained from the literature, such as organ size, blood flow, enzyme and plasma protein maturation. No clinical data were used for modelbased simulation. Clinical data from pooled studies were used as references to compare with model predictions.

Data analysis and modeling methods: A PBPK model previously developed for imatinib was used, and the  model  parameters  were  modified  using  growth  and  maturation  database  obtained  from  the literature. Clearance range observed in phase III trial in adult population was used as reference for paediatric  scaling.  Two  separate  approaches  were  employed:  1)  steady-state  (SS-Model)  approach scaling  only  clearance  to  predict  steady-state  AUC,  and  2)  dynamic  (Dyn-Model)  PK  simulation  to assess the imatinib concentration-time profile within a dosing interval. The effects of body size and blood perfusion on the PK profiles were evaluated in addition to maturation in clearance. The model evaluations  were  conducted  by  comparing  the  predicted  steady-state  AUC  and  predicted  imatinib concentration-time profile with noncompartmental AUC computed by the trapezoidal rule and observed data from the pooled clinical studies, respectively. Dyn-Model simulation was performed with SimuSolv on a VAX cluster.

## 2.3.2.2. Results

## Pooled Population Pharmacokinetics Modeling

The popPK of imatinib was characterised by a one-compartment model with zero- order absorption and first-order elimination. The model was parameterised in terms of apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F), and duration of zero-order input (D1). Inter-individual variability in CL/F and  V/F  were  characterised  by  lognormal  distributions  and  the  residual  error  by  a  combined  error model.  Analysis  of  covariate  effects  revealed  that  CL/F  and  V/F  increased  with  body  surface  area (BSA). After correcting for the BSA effect, the following covariates were not found to have clinically significant effects on the exposure of imatinib: age, gender, race, WBC, hemoglobin, body weight, BMI, and disease type. The clearance for a subject whose BSA=1.73 m2 was 9.06 L/h, which corresponds with the estimates from previous works in adult populations.

There was no statistically significant difference in imatinib clearance among disease types Ph+ CML, Ph+  ALL  and  Other  (Figure  01).  Clearance  for  patients  with  Ph+  ALL  were  estimated  to  have  an imatinib clearance 9.7% (SE=15.9%) less than that for Ph+ CML.

Comparison of the relation between clearance and body weight in the final model with a previously developed adult model shows that the models are consistent with each other for body weights of 60 kg and  higher.  Refitting  the  final  model  without  the  subjects  younger  than  4  years  led  to  similar parameter estimates. Prediction of concentration-time profiles for the excluded subjects showed that the  observed  concentrations  were  generally  within  the  predicted  90%  variability  bands.  The  popPK model was used to extrapolate AUC for one year old children. The uncertainty was greater for one year than two year old. Slightly lower exposures were observed for 1 year old as compared to 2 year and above.

The popPK of CGP74588 was characterised by a two-compartment model parameterised in terms of apparent  clearance  (CLM/F),  apparent  volumes  of  the  central  compartment  (VCM/F)  and  peripheral compartment  (VPM/F),  and  the  apparent  inter-compartmental  clearance  (QM/F).  The  fraction  of imatinib metabolised to CGP74588, a scaling factor in parent/metabolite modeling, was fixed to 0.13 or 13%. The final popPK model for CGP74588 includes BSA as a covariate with clearances and volumes increasing with BSA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  exposure  of  18-year  old  subjects  (dosing  scheme  of  340  mg/m2  not  to  exceed  600  mg)  was simulated using the adult model by Schmidli et al. (2005). As can be seen in Figure 02, the exposure of children in different age groups (simulated from the final popPK model in this report) for 340 mg/m2 capped at 600 mg corresponds closely to the exposure of adults simulated using the model by Schmidli et al. (2005).

Model-based simulation of various dosing schemes showed that doses of 260 mg/m2 not to exceed 400 mg or 340 mg/m2 not to exceed 600 mg lead to relatively constant exposures (AUC, Cmax, and Cmin) across the range of observed body surface areas and ages. The AUCs achieved by these doses are similar to adult AUCs.

## Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) Modeling Report

The SS-Model simulations showed that the majority of actual steady-state AUC values (94%; 29/31) normalised  to  340  mg/m2  in  paediatric  patients  fell  within  the  0.5  and  99.5  percentiles  of  model projected  range  scaled  from  adult  measurements.  Based  on  the  Dyn-  Model,  the  predicted  plasma concentration-time profiles were generally in good agreements for most paediatric subjects, except for younger subjects ≤ 2 years old, for which the exposure appeared to be over-predicted. The predicted deviation from adult was higher for the first dose than at steady state (Day 28). The largest deviation was observed for Cmax. The predicted age effect on AUC and trough (Cmin) were less than that on Cmax. The differences in predictions of children and adults seem to be the mixed results of changing distribution  volume  and  blood  circulating  turnover,  in  addition  to  clearance  maturation  with  age. Improvement of model prediction could be achieved for the young subjects by refining certain model assumptions or parameters, such as assuming different plasma protein maturation in cancer patients from healthy subjects, or a lower extent of oral absorption for those age groups instead of a complete absorption, considering the immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract. Nonetheless, taking a 'conservative approach' for the model assumptions, the prediction was only 1.5-fold of the adult value at 1 year age, suggesting a safe application of PBPK approach in scaling imatinib clearance down to children at 1 year of age.

## 2.3.3. Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology

The  dosing  scheme  for  paediatric  Ph+  ALL  derives  from  the  pooled  population  pharmacokinetic analysis, the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, experience from paediatric CML population  and  extrapolation  from  adult  Ph+  ALL  population.  To  achieve  comparable  exposures  in paediatric patients corresponding to target exposure in adult patients, body surface area (BSA) based dosing should be employed in the dose administration of imatinib in paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL. The  proposed  posology  of  340  mg/m 2   in  paediatric  patients  from  1  to  18  years  of  age  seems appropriate.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

Studies  STI571I2301  (Schultz  et  al.  2008;  Schultz  et  al.,  2009)  and  STI571AIT07  supporting  this application were conducted and monitored by cooperative groups in the US and Europe, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.1. Main study

A Children's Oncology Group pilot study for the treatment of very high risk (VHR) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children and adolescents (COG AALL0031, STI571I2301).

## Methods

## Study participants

The study population consisted of paediatric patients with VHR ALL, defined as those patients who have an expected 5-year EFS of &lt; 45% (Schultz et al., 2007. Criteria identified for VHR were:

-  Ph+ ALL identified by
-  BCR-ABL expression by PCR or fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH)
-  t(9;22)(q34;q31) by cytogenetics
-  Hypodiploidy (chromosomes &lt;44) by cytogenetics
-  DNA index &lt;0.81 by flow cytometry
-  MLL gene rearrangement with slow early response (SER); SER is defined as M3 (&gt;25% blasts) bone  marrow  (BM)  on  day  7  (high  risk  patients)  or  an  M2  (5%-25%  blasts)  /M3  (&gt;25%) marrow on day 14 (standard risk patients) of induction.

Other patients presumed to have a poor outcome and classified as VHR were those with persistent measurable disease following induction in a frontline study defined by bone marrow and MRD status at the end of induction.

Eligibility for entry into the COG AALL0031 protocol for VHR ALL required a central confirmation of Ph+ ALL, hypodiploidy or MLL rearrangement with slow early response (SER).

Patients were included who met the following criteria:

- Male  or  female  patients,  aged  1  to  &lt;  22  years,  who  themselves  or  the  legally  authorised representatives have given informed consent
- Ph+ ALL:
- BCR/ABL by FISH or RT-PCR
- t(9;22)(q34;q11) detected by cytogenetics
- Chromosomes &lt; 44 by cytogenetics
- DNA index &lt; 0.81 by flow cytometry
- Any  rearrangement  of  chromosome  11  that  resulted  in  disruption  of  MLL  (gene  11q23)  by cytogenetics and slow early response (SER).
- Induction failures were defined prior to study entry as:
- Patients with a bone marrow (BM) status of M3 (&gt; 25% blasts) at the end of standard induction therapy, enrolled within 42 days of diagnosis
- Patients with a BM status of M2 (5-25% blasts) or MRD ≥ 1% (by flow cytometry) at the end of induction therapy who still had M2 (or M3) or MRD ≥ 1 % at the end of extended  induction,  enrolled  within  14  days  of  their  last  day  of  extended  induction therapy

Those who failed induction therapy or extended induction therapy were allowed to enrol into this study, irrespective  of  haematological  values  provided  there  was  no  active  infection  or  immediate  lifethreatening organ malfunction.

Patients  were  enrolled  after  receiving  a  3  -  4  drug  Induction  regimen  either  on,  or  identical  to,  a frontline  COG,  POG,  or  CCG  trial  for  ALL.  These  induction  regimens  included  intravenous  (iv) vincristine, a corticosteroid such as prednisone or dexamethasone p.o., L-asparaginase (either native or pegylated) iv, and with or without an anthracycline such as daunorubicin iv. Additionally, patients received  intrathecal  therapy  with  methotrexate,  with  or  without  cytarabine,  and  with  or  without  a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone.

## Removal of patients from therapy or assessment

The Study Chair of COG was to be contacted prior to removing any patient from protocol therapy for toxicity.

The following criteria for removal from protocol treatment were pre-defined:

- M2 (5-25%) or M3 (&gt; 25% blasts) bone marrow at the end of Consolidation 2
- Relapse (BM, CNS, testicular or other) at any site, during the study
- Secondary malignancy during the study
- Refusal of further protocol therapy

After  removal  from  protocol  therapy  (chemotherapy  with  imatinib  or  HSCT  with  imatinib),  patients went into study follow-up. The following criteria for removal from study follow-up, referred to as 'off study' were pre-defined in the protocol:

- Confirmed as lost to follow-up
- Withdrawal of informed consent for further follow-up
- Entry into another COG therapeutic study
- Death

Imatinib was supplied as 100 mg tablets in polyethylene bottles and was given orally. Imatinib was given on a daily dosing schedule for 21 days or continuously, depending on the cohort and treatment blocks.  Treatment  blocks  started  when  the  following  criteria  were  met:  ANC  ≥  750/μL;  platelets  ≥ 75,000/μL; ALT &lt; 20x the upper limit of normal; direct bilirubin and creatinine normal for age. After count recovery was met, then patients continued the next treatment block and resumed imatinib.

The tolerability of the addition of imatinib to the chemotherapy regimen was unknown prior to the start of the trial. Thus, the tolerability of imatinib was assessed by incorporating it into 5 sequential cohorts of  patients  that  incorporated  it  both  earlier  in  the  course  of  treatment  and  during  more  treatment blocks. (Figure 2, see below). The duration of imatinib increased from 42 days (cohort 1) to 210 days (cohort 5) prior to maintenance cycles.

## Dose selection

The imatinib dose selection was made based on results from a previous phase I study (Champagne et al., 2004). In this study oral imatinib was administered daily at dose levels ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m2.  There  were  31  children  who  received  479  courses  of  imatinib  and  a  maximum  tolerated dosage was not defined. The authors concluded that daily oral imatinib was well tolerated in children at doses ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m2. Doses of 260 and 340 mg/m2 provided systemic exposures similar to those of adults who were treated with daily doses of 400 and 600 mg, respectively.

The  imatinib  dose  given  was  340  mg/m2/d  or  230  mg/m2/d.  Paediatric  doses  were  calculated according to body surface area. The dosing increment of 50 mg, as was the case for the 150 mg and 250 mg doses, was accomplished by dividing a divisible 100 mg film-coated tablet.

## Imatinib dose adjustments

The individual imatinib dose of 340 mg/m2/d was reduced to 230 mg/m2/d for patients who could not tolerate  340  mg/m2/d.  In  addition,  the  decision  to  reduce  the  dose  from  340  mg/m2/d  to  230 mg/m2/d was taken at interim  monitoring,  if  dose  limiting  toxicities  (DLT)  were  observed  within  a cohort  or  within  a  specific  treatment  block.  According  to  the  protocol,  a  DLT  was  monitored continuously and administered imatinib was to be decreased by 30% (230 mg/m2/d) if grade 3 or 4 nonhematopoietic toxicity was observed in 2 of the first evaluable 6 patients within a cohort. If at any time for the remaining patients in the cohort, the percentage of DLT for the full group of evaluable patients reached 33%, this also resulted in dose modification. If DLTs were observed within a specific

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  block,  then  reduction  of  dose  would  only  apply  to  that  specific  treatment  block  where unacceptable toxicity had been observed.

## Imatinib treatment post-HSCT

Per protocol HSCT was performed by a COG-approved HSCT/ Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) center. The HSCT regimen consisted of a 1-week preparative regimen including Total Body Irradiation (TBI), CPM,  etoposide,  and  GVHD  prophylaxis  (of  MTX  and  cyclosporine).  Patients  with  an  HLA-matched related donor could proceed with HSCT after Consolidation 2.

Imatinib (230 mg/m2/d) started between weeks 16-24 post-HSCT when ANC ≥ 750/μL, platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL, and non-haematological toxicities had resolved to ≤ Grade 1. Imatinib dose increased to 340  mg/m2/d  between  weeks  20-28  post-HSCT,  after  no  toxicities  of  ≥  Grade  3  toxicities  were observed (Table 03). The total duration of imatinib treatment post-HSCT was 24 weeks.

## HSCT

In this study, patients with HLA-matched related donors or 1 antigen mismatched (excluding HLA-DR mismatch) related donors were eligible to receive HSCT  after the two initial consolidation chemotherapy blocks if a matched related donor was available.

At any time during the protocol therapy, patients and their families had an option to be removed from protocol treatment to obtain off protocol HSCT (that did not meet per protocol HSCT criteria).

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study as defined by the COG in the actual protocol was to determine the feasibility of patient accrual and toxicity of an intensified chemotherapeutic regimen (including imatinib for  Ph+  ALL  patients)  for  treatment  of  children  and  adolescents  with  VHR  ALL.  Over  time  it  was apparent that both patient accrual and the toxicity profile were feasible. It was observed that the Ph+ ALL patients appeared to have improved EFS compared to what the expected outcome was based on historical control data from clinical trials performed by COG and its precursor organisations. Thus the primary focus of the trial shifted to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of imatinib and chemotherapy for patients with Ph+ ALL

For  this  report,  in  order  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  imatinib  integrated  into  an  intense  chemotherapy regimen in Ph+ ALL patients the following objectives were defined:

## Primary objective

The primary objective was to assess the event-free survival (EFS; events defined as relapse at any site, secondary malignancy, or death from any cause) in Ph+ ALL paediatric patients in cohort 5, from study entry, including the option of HSCT treatment.

## Secondary objectives

The secondary objectives were:

- To assess the overall survival (OS; event: death from any cause) in Ph+ ALL patients, from study entry, including the option of HSCT treatment.
- To evaluate the exposure-response of imatinib per cohort, and combined cohort groups, at endpoints EFS and OS.
-  To  compare  EFS  and  OS  in  patients  receiving  chemotherapy  plus  imatinib  in  cohort  5  versus  all patients undergoing HSCT (on and off protocol), including and excluding induction failures in all groups
-  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  adding  imatinib  to  intensive  chemotherapy  in  Ph+  ALL patients  (including  HSCT),  specifically  in  cohort  5;  stating  the  impact  of  imatinib  in  addition  to chemotherapy.

·  To  compare  the  safety  profile  in  patients  receiving  intensive  chemotherapy  plus  imatinib  versus patients undergoing per protocol HSCT.

Additional exploratory evaluations (i.e. EFS and OS from start of diagnosis; prognostic effect of MRD, etc.) and sensitivity analyses (i.e. EFS including induction failure as an event) were performed.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint is event free survival for both the COG analyses (Schultz et al 2007b, Schultz et al 2009) and the Novartis analyses. EFS, defined as the time between study entry and the earliest of the  following  events:  leukemic  relapse  (BM,  CNS,  testicular,  or  other)  at  any  site,  secondary malignancy, or death. OS, a secondary endpoint, was defined as the time between study entry and death due to any cause. However, there is some variation in the definition of EFS used by COG and Novartis,  in  terms  of  inclusion/exclusion  of  patients  who  failed  induction  therapy  and  considering induction failure (IF) as an 'event.' Table 04 shows how data from induction failures were handled in different documents.

Study STI571I2301 included patients failing induction therapy as well as patients who responded to initial induction treatment, whereas the historical control group did not include any induction failures. Novartis conducted EFS analyses including induction failure patients and provided the results in two ways:  first,  by  not  treating  these  patients  as  having  had  an  event  and  second,  by  treating  these patients who failed induction treatment as having an event. This latter definition of EFS was aligned with the analysis performed by Schultz et al (2009).

The predictive value of MRD (by multi-parameter flow cytometry) to EFS was also an exploratory endpoint. MRD was assessed at study entry (after induction) and after the first and second blocks of consolidation. Measurements were performed at a single central reference laboratory.

## Sample size

Sample size considerations were based on practical grounds such as recruitment time. It was planned to recruit 12 patients into each of the 5 cohorts. Accrual into Cohort 1 was stopped at 7 patients because data became available that showed that imatinib could be administered in combination with high-dose methotrexate in the Hyper-CVAD regimen. Cohort 5 was expanded to accrue a total of 50 patients in order to provide a more precise estimate of outcome once it became clear that the combination of imatinib and chemotherapy was tolerable and appeared to be improving patient outcome based on the improved EFS observed in Cohorts 3 plus 4 compared to Cohorts 1 plus 2. According to the COG original protocol the estimation of precision was as follows: with the original cohort size of 12, a 90% confidence interval provides a half-width of approximately 24% that was the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

true EFS result could be 24% higher or lower depending upon the observed estimate. Increasing the size of the final cohort to 50 patients reduced the half-width of the confidence interval to 12% to provide reasonable precision.

## Randomisation

N/A

## Blinding (masking)

The study was open-label

## Statistical methods

The analyses described in this section are those performed for the purpose of the analysis of Ph+ ALL patients who received imatinib integrated into the chemotherapy regimen as defined in the protocol for this study designed by COG for VHR ALL patients

## Data cut-off

A snapshot of the data as of 5-Sep-2009 was received from COG and used for the analyses presented in  this  report.  Last  patient  last  visit  (LPLV)  for  Ph+  ALL  patients  who  completed  protocol  treatment occurred on 8-Jan-2009, hence all protocol treatment visits were included. In addition, the follow-up data for patients in the study follow-up period (up to the data cutoff date of 5-SEP-2009) was included in this dataset.

## Populations

The  following  analysis  sets  were  defined  and  are  based  on  all  Ph+  patients  who  consented  to participate in this study:

- Enrolled set: All eligible Ph+ patients enrolled into the study. Data of one Ph+ patient from cohort 1 was inevaluable according to COG, because this patient was inadvertently dosed with imatinib during consolidation 1.  Per protocol, patients in cohort 1 do  not receive imatinib in consolidation  1.  According  to  COG,  very  limited  information  was  entered  by  the  site.  COG decided to remove patient's data from their analyses and did not provide this patient's data to Novartis.
- Safety set: All patients from the enrolled set who received at least one dose of chemotherapy and/or imatinib starting at Consolidation 1.
- Efficacy set: All patients from the safety set qualified for the efficacy analyses

## Definition of primary efficacy endpoint

The primary endpoint was EFS calculated as the time (months) from the date of first treatment with study medication in Consolidation 1 (study entry) to first event or last contact (assuming that the date of last contact is equivalent to the last disease assessment), where an event was defined as: relapse at any site, secondary malignancy, death from any cause.

Patients who did not fail were censored as of the date of last EFS assessment, which was the date of last contact, since it was assumed that relapse was assessed at every visit. Table 03 summarises the definition of EFS and the censoring algorithm.

The primary objective was to show efficacy of chemotherapy plus imatinib with the option of HSCT. A secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy on chemotherapy plus imatinib alone.

## Efficacy analysis

The analysis of EFS was conducted on the efficacy population using data received from COG (with data cut-off date of 05-Sep-2009). All efficacy analyses were performed on the efficacy set and in subgroups as indicated. The primary patient group for efficacy was cohort 5.

There was no formal comparison with the historical control data because COG did not provide the individual  patient  data.  Instead,  COG  provided  the  respective  results  for  the  efficacy  endpoint,  by sending  the  yearly  estimated  EFS  rates  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (based  on  Kaplan  Meier method) to Novartis. The historical control data (n=120) were from previous POG studies (ALinC 14: POG 8602, ALinC15:  POG  9005  and  9006,  ALinC16:  POG  9201,  9405,  9406  and  9605).  Historical control  data  that  were  obtained  consisted  of  Ph+  ALL  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  with  or without HSCT between 1988 and 1995. Only estimated EFS rates were provided to Novartis; no data on OS or other subgroup data from the historical control was provided by COG.

The following comparisons for EFS and OS were performed as appropriate (including induction failures for the main analyses if not otherwise stated).

- by cohort: cohort 5 vs. cohorts 1+2, cohort 5 vs. cohorts 3+4, and cohort 5 vs. cohorts 1 to 4
-  by  HSCT:  cohort  5  chemotherapy  +  imatinib  vs.  per  protocol  HSCT  and  vs.  off  protocol  HSCT; cohort 5 chemotherapy + imatinib vs. overall HSCT (per protocol and off protocol HSCT)
- by risk groups:
- NCI risk group: standard risk vs. high risk
- Baseline age: &lt; 10 vs. ≥ 10 years
- WBC at diagnosis: &lt; 50,000/μL vs. ≥ 50,000/μL; &lt; 100,000/μL vs. ≥ 100,000/μL
- Induction failure: no vs. yes
- MRD at study entry: ≤ 0.01% vs. &gt; 0.01%; ≤ 0.1% vs. &gt; 0.1%; ≤ 1.0% vs. &gt; 1.0%.

The  primary  endpoint  analysis  was  performed  on  all  patient  data  for  cohort  5;  no  comparison  was foreseen  for  the  primary  endpoint.  Therefore,  respective  results  were  presented  using  descriptive statistics  only.  The  EFS  rates  were  calculated  from  date  of  study  entry.  Cohort  5  efficacy  results (estimated  EFS  rates)  were  presented  side  by  side  with  the  historical  control  estimated  EFS  rates including 95 % confidence intervals. No induction failures were included in the historical control data; however, cohort 5 included patients who failed induction therapy.

Overall survival was calculated in months from the date of study entry (as the start date) to the date of death (due to any cause) or date of last contact (for those who are still alive). For any comparisons the log-rank test was applied

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 160 paediatric VHR ALL patients were enrolled in this study between 14-Oct-2002 and 20Oct-2006. Ninety-three (93) were Ph+ patients and received imatinib in addition to the chemotherapy regimen. There was one Ph+ patient from cohort 1 that COG considered not evaluable because this patient was inadvertently dosed with imatinib during consolidation 1. Per protocol, patients in cohort 1 do not receive imatinib in consolidation 1. Data for this patient was not provided to Novartis because very limited information was entered by the site when COG decided to remove this patient from all study analyses. Hence 92 patients were included in this analysis.

## Recruitment

## Conduct of the study

The study protocol was amended seven times. The main amendments were:

-  Amendment 1 (13-Jul-2003) modified the AALL0031 design for Ph+ patients to investigate a more accelerated integration of imatinib into the therapeutic blocks. Also, the overall number of cohorts of Ph+ patients was reduced. Following the implementation of this amendment, four cohorts of Ph+ patients (cohorts 2-5) were studied, and the last of these cohorts (if reached) was to use 'continuous' dosing with imatinib (i.e., given in each of the blocks: Consolidation 1 and 2, Reinduction 1 and 2, Intensification 1 and 2, and each Maintenance cycle).
-  In Amendment 5B (23-May-2005) the following changes were implemented:
- an expanded definition of patient categories eligible for the study (MLL patients with a slow  early  response  determined  by  day  15  marrow  or  end  induction  MRD),  and  a modification of the low hypodiploid criterion to be those with &lt; 44 chromosomes,
- an extended study duration by approximately 16 months in order to expand the last cohort of Ph+ patients,

## Numbers analysed

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy results

Continuous  exposure  to  imatinib  improved  the  outcome  in  cohort  5  patients.  Fourteen  patients  in cohort 5 showed any event for EFS: 9 patients had a relapse at any site; and 5 patients died (without a  relapse  prior  to  death).  Of  these  5  patients  who  died,  4  underwent  HSCT  and  1  patient  received chemotherapy plus imatinib.

## Ancillary analyses

1. Event free survival was analysed for cohort 5 and the historical control population considering the  baseline  characteristics  of  age  at  study  start,  gender,  WBC  at  diagnosis,  and  CNS involvement (standard factors to assess risk of relapse in this population) and the results are summarised in Table 13. All EFS results are presented with hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) comparing cohort 5 with historical control using the Kaplan Meier method

2. A multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis for EFS comparing cohort 5 with historical control  was  performed  using  baseline  characteristics  of  age,  gender  and  WBC  as  covariates which could have potentially influenced the EFS results.

The exclusion of IFs from the historical control group contributed to a conservative approach for comparisons because IFs have a higher risk of events. MRD status was not available for the historical control group, therefore, it was not considered in the analysis. Since few patients in either group had CNS involvement, this factor was not considered in the analysis. Therefore, despite being considered important parameters for risk assessment, IF status, MRD status, and CNS  involvement  could  not  be  included  in  the  multivariate  Cox  regression  analysis  for  EFS between the historical control group and cohort 5.

When  adjusting  for  all  factors  to  account  for  any  imbalances  between  cohort  5  and  the historical control group, the hazard ratio for EFS remains in favour of cohort 5 compared with the historical control (HR=0.28, log-rank p&lt;0.0001)

- Prognostic factors for EFS in cohort 5 chemotherapy plus imatinib only

In addition, the following parameters were assessed as prognostic factors for EFS: sex (female / male), race (white / other, age group (&lt; 10 years / ≥ 10 years), MRD status at study entry (≤ 0.01% / &gt;0.01%) and WBC (&lt; 50,000/μL / ≥ 50,000/μL). CNS status could not be used as a prognostic factor for these analyses due to the low number of patients with CNS2 and CNS3 status  at  study  entry.  All  of  the  above  parameters  were  examined  for  their  effect  on  EFS (univariate).  Only  those  parameters  who  showed  a  significant  effect  of  p  ≤  0.1  were  to  be entered into a multivariate model and keeping only those in the final multivariate model which showed a significant effect on EFS with p ≤ 0.05 using a step-wise selection procedure.

As a result, only the WBC at study entry was independently prognostic, showing a significant effect  in  the  univariate  case  with  a  hazard  ratio  of  14.28  with  p=0.0142  by  the  Wald-test. Since none of the other parameters were significant for entering into the multivariate model, the multivariate model was left only with WBC count as a prognostic factor resulting in a lower risk of EFS events for patients in the group WBC &lt; 50,000/μL at study start.

- Prognostic factors for Event-Free Survival

In addition, the following parameters were assessed as prognostic factors for EFS: sex (female / male), race (white / other, age group (&lt; 10 years / ≥ 10 years), MRD status at study entry (≤ 0.01% / &gt; 0.01%) and WBC (&lt; 50,000/μL / ≥ 50,000/μL). CNS status could not be used as a prognostic factor for these analyses due to the low number of patients with CNS2 and CNS3 status at study entry. Only the WBC at study entry was prognostic, showing a hazard ratio of 14.28 with a p-value of 0.0142 by the Wald-test

5. Effect of HSCT on EFS and OS

The estimated EFS at 4 years following per protocol HSCT was lower than the EFS in cohort 5 with an estimated rate of 65.3% vs. 73.7%, respectively; the log-rank test yielded a HR=0.62 and a p-value of 0.374. A similar result was observed when comparing the estimated EFS at 4 years following off protocol HSCT with an estimated EFS rate of 50.5%; this difference showed a HR=0.38 and a p-value of 0.0732

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate any baseline risk factors which might have biased the  EFS  result  for  the  comparison  of  treatment  options:  HSCT  (per  protocol  HSCT  or  off protocol HSCT) vs. cohort 5 chemotherapy + imatinib. EFS was evaluated by multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis by entering HSCT status (yes/no) as a time dependent covariate into the model in addition to age (&lt;10 years / ≥10 years), sex, race, MRD status (≤0.01% / &gt;0.01%)  and  WBC  count  at  study  entry  (&lt;  50,000/μL  /  ≥  50,000/μL).  Event  time  was calculated both from date of diagnosis in and from date of study entry using HSCT as not timedependent in.

Due  to  missing  values  in  some  baseline  factors  (e.g.  MRD  at  baseline),  data  from  only  56 patients were kept for the Cox regression model. When the comparison of HSCT vs. cohort 5 chemotherapy + imatinib was adjusted for all baseline factors, the result was not different.

7. EFS of cohort 5 by induction failure status

The comparison by log-rank test was statistically significant (p=0.054) but this result has to be seen in the light that some patients underwent HSCT and therefore may have contributed to the treatment effect. Only six patients in cohort 5 were classified as induction failures; 3 of them  did  not  show  an  EFS  event  at  the  time  of  analyses.  The  estimated  EFS  rates  at  36 months were 81.4% in patients who did not fail the induction treatment and 44.4% in patients who failed the induction treatment.

8. EFS by MRD

The impact of MRD at ≤ 0.01% vs. &gt; 0.01% at end induction on estimated EFS rate for cohort 5 was: (88.2% vs. 76.9%) at 3 years and (88.2% vs. 64.0%) at 4 years

Overall  results  of  all  cohorts  showed  that  there  was  a  trend  over  time  of  an  increasing percentage of patients having a non-measurable MRD of ≤ 0.01%: 29.9% of patients at study entry; 66.7% patients at end of Consolidation 1; and 71.9% at end of Consolidation 2

For cohort 5: 10 out of 44 patients (22.7%) had &gt; 1% MRD at study entry, only 2 out of 36 patients (5.6%) still had &gt; 1% MRD at the end of Consolidation 1. The remaining 31 patients had ≤ 1% MRD (and none had &gt; 1% MRD) at end of Consolidation 2.

9. EFS by NCI risk

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

EFS in cohort 5 revealed a significant difference between standard and high-risk (NCI) group. No event was recorded in the 13 patients of the standard risk group of cohort 5 resulting in estimated EFS at 3 years of 100% and a non estimable hazard ratio.

2. EFS of cohort 5 from diagnosis

The Kaplan-Meier analysis of EFS in cohort 5 revealed identical estimated EFS rates at 4 years in  both  analyses:  when  using  either  date  of  diagnosis  or  date  of  study  entry  for  EFS calculation; with 4-year EFS being 69.6%

## Updated efficacy data:

COG conducted analyses with 5 year follow-up and a manuscript with these data is being prepared. COG confirmed their 5 year analyses contain only efficacy data and there is no update on safety. Upon request, COG provided the 5 year Kaplan-Meier estimates comparing EFS in patients receiving imatinib and chemotherapy with patients receiving related or unrelated bone marrow transplant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 09 compares patients in cohort 5 without HSCT with patients in all cohorts with related or unrelated HSCT. Figure 10 compares patients exclusively within cohort 5-those without HSCT and those with related or unrelated HSCT. Please note the terms related and unrelated bone marrow transplant (BMT) used by COG in the figures below, correspond to the definition of per protocol and off-protocol definitions in STI571I2301 study, respectively. Per protocol HSCT are HSCT with a HLAmatched related donor or 1 antigen mismatched and off-protocol HSCT are the rest.

The 5 year update on efficacy shows that the probability of EFS is comparable between patients receiving only imatinib + chemotherapy vs patients receiving related HSCT vs patients receiving unrelated HSCT. With one additional year of follow-up it is confirmed that the addition of imatinib to chemotherapy results in comparable long term outcomes to those with HSCT.

Upon request, COG provided the following table describing EFS (from time of diagnosis) analyses comparing cohorts 1+2, cohorts 3+4, cohort 5, Ph negative patients and historical controls.

## Supportive study(ies)

## Study STI571AIT07

This study was designed and conducted by 10 participating national paediatric leukaemia study groups in Europe (EsPhALL). Study STI571AIT07 was initially designed as an open-label, randomised study to determine  whether  the  addition  of  imatinib  to  standard  chemotherapy  extended  DFS  in  paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL.

Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) following frontline induction therapy were defined as Good risk and were randomised to receive imatinib + chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Patients who  did  not  achieve  CR  following  frontline  induction  therapy  were  defined  as  Poor  risk,  were  not randomised,  and  all  of  these  patients  received  imatinib  +  chemotherapy.  However,  after  the publication  of  interim  results  from  Study  STI571I2301  by  Schultz  et  al  (2009)  which  showed  the benefit  of  adding  imatinib  to  chemotherapy  to  paediatric  patients  of  all  risk  with  Ph+  ALL,  the participating groups no longer considered it acceptable to randomise patients into a chemotherapy only arm. Therefore the protocol was amended so that all patients would receive imatinib regardless of risk category. As a result of the amendment, the study enrolled an insufficient sample size to properly test for the primary efficacy analysis. Additional factors confounding efficacy results included the following: the  impact  of  the  therapeutic  effect  of  HSCT  since  a  high  percentage  (85.2%)  of  patients  were transplanted within the study; and 12/44 (27%) patients randomised to receive no imatinib switched arms to receive imatinib prior to the amendment, thus diluting treatment effects.

Consequently, data from study [STI571AIT07] are included to provide additional safety data and are considered to be supportive only.

Patients  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  Ph+  ALL  were  enrolled  into  the  study  after  receiving  initial induction chemotherapy according to national group protocols (Phase IA). Patients were stratified as Poor risk (i.e. poor prognosis) or Good risk (i.e. good prognosis), as defined below:

- Poor risk group: patients who were prednisone-poor responders, i.e. blast cell count ≥ 1000/ μ l  in peripheral blood after 7 days of prednisone given in combination with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX), or having a M3 bone marrow (BM) at day 15 or M2/M3 (see definitions below) BM at day 21 or lack of a complete remission (CR) after the induction course.
- Good risk group: patients who were prednisone-good responders, i.e. blast cell count &lt;1000/μl in peripheral blood after 7 days of prednisone given in combination with IT MTX, or having M1/M2 (see definitions below) BM at day 15 or M1 BM at day 21 and achieved CR after the induction course.

M1, M2, M3 are defined as follows:

-  M1:  &lt;5%  blasts,  counting  all  nucleated  cells,  including  erythropoiesis.  In  case  of  regenerating marrow with a high erythropoietic predominance, at least a total count of 100 non-erythropoietic cells should be counted.
-  M2:  5-25%  blasts,  counting  all  nucleated  cells,  including  erythropoiesis.  In  case  of  regenerating marrow with a high erythropoietic predominance, at least a total count of 100 non-erythropoietic cells should be counted.
- M3: &gt;25% blasts in a BM aspirate.

All Poor risk patients received imatinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy. Good risk patients were randomised to receive either imatinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy or intensive chemotherapy alone. After induction therapy, all patients continued with three consecutive blocks of Consolidation therapy (high risk consolidation blocks HR1, HR2, and HR3), for a total of 20 days of chemotherapy per treatment block. After consolidation therapy, patients who received HSCT did not continue with imatinib therapy regardless of group. After consolidation therapy, patients who did not undergo  HSCT  and  who  were  considered  suitable  to  receive  further  chemotherapy  continued  with 'Protocol II' which consisted of two reinduction phases (Phase IIA and Phase IIB). Phase IIA started 14 days  after  completion  of  consolidation  therapy,  and  Phase  IIB  started  36  days  after  completion  of consolidation therapy. After reinduction therapy, patients received maintenance antimetabolite-based low  intensity  chemotherapy  and  cranial  irradiation  therapy.  After  cranial  irradiation,  the  reinduction phases  (Phase  IIA  and  Phase  IIB)  were  repeated.  Continuation  therapy  started  2  weeks  after completion of delayed intensification (Protocol II), after which the maximum duration of chemotherapy was 24 months. Figure 12 and Figure 13 present the overall study design and treatment blocks for Good and Poor risk groups, respectively.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The justification  for  a  non-randomised  study  design  in  the  VHR  ALL  subpopulation  investigated  was based on the following characteristics of the patient population: 1) overall poor prognosis (5-year EFS &lt;  45%);  2)  lack  of  a  generally  accepted  standard  of  care;  3)  limited  population  of  patients  for enrollment within an acceptable timeframe; and 4) presence of historical control data for comparison of efficacy and safety.

The  main  doubt  would  not  be  the  regimen  administered  but  if  the  addition  of  imatinib  to  other chemotherapy regimens could provide similar outcomes. There are several paediatric chemotherapy regimens used for  Ph+  ALL;  the  one  used  by  COG  in  Study  STI571I2301  is  considered  a  standard regimen as included in NCCN guidelines.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoint of the main study has been clearly positive, EFS for cohort 5 (69.6%) was more than  twice  historical  controls  (31.6%).  Estimated  OS  rate  at  48  months  was  83.6%  in  cohort  5 compared to 44.8% in the historical control group. In addition, several sensitivity analyses and subset of patients have supported the main results, which highlights the robustness of the outcomes.

Risk  factors  (age,  cytogenetics,  immunophenotype,  and  response  to  induction  therapy)  were  not evenly distributed among the study cohorts and this might have contributed to an unknown extent on the most favourable results seen in cohort 5.

The historical controls used in this study allow to compare and put into perspective the results of this trial.

The  control  group  consisted  in  a  data  set  of  patients  from  several  protocols  for  B-precursor  ALL between  January  1986  and  November  1999.  The  introduction  of  imatinib  in  combination  with  high intensive backbone chemotherapy has given an impressive result in terms of EFS and OS at 48 months. This result appears to be independent of HSCT role in the study, since the results in the population excluding HSCT patients were similar to the whole population (HSCT vs Chemo+Glivec alone).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results appear better than other treatments (excluding HSCT) assessed so far in Ph+ ALL children.

There are uncertainties on the impact of Glivec on transplantation and there is a need to generate additional data by a non-randomised single arm clinical trial or alternatively a registry. This requirement has been addressed by the MAH proposing a registry collecting data on interventions and outcomes in paediatric Ph+ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT. The CHMP reviewed the concept sheet submitted by the MAH and requested input from the PDCO (see appendix 01).

The CHMP finally agreed to the concept sheet of a European observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT (as reflected in the RMP). Approximately 100 male or female paediatric patients with a documented diagnosis of newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL (within 6 months of diagnosis) treated or on treatment with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT, would be recruited in this registry. For each patient enrolled in the registry, information will be collected according to the standard practice of the site with a minimum of once yearly update. Long term safety and efficacy data will be collected such that the follow-up for efficacy and safety will be at least 5 years.

## 2.4.3. Conclusion on clinical efficacy

In  comparison  to  historical  controls,  the  introduction  of  imatinib  in  combination  with  high  intensive backbone chemotherapy showed clinically meaningful results in terms of EFS and OS at 48 months. In order to address the uncertainties related to the impact of Glivec on HSCT, the CHMP considers the following measure necessary:

To conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## 2.5.1. Introduction

Studies STI571I2301 and STI571AIT07 provide data in support of the assessment of safety in Ph+ ALL paediatric  patients.  Both  studies  were  conducted  in  full  compliance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice  and were closely monitored by the cooperative groups, COG and EsPhALL, respectively. The  two  studies  (STI571I2301  and  STI571AIT07)  present  substantial  differences  in  terms  of  study design, dose and duration of imatinib, as well as differences in chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, the data from the two studies are presented separately. In both studies, the safety set was defined as the set of patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The safety population comprised 93 Ph+ patients (92 analysed by Novartis) in Study [STI571I2301] and 159 Ph+ patients (128 imatinib and 31 no imatinib) in Study [STI571AIT07]. All analyses of study STI571AIT07 were performed by the EsPhALL trial data centre in Italy. No data from this study was transferred to Novartis. Therefore, the exposure data could not be pooled with the STI571I 2301 study.

## Patient exposure

## Study STI571I2301

For Ph+ ALL patients, duration of imatinib exposure was calculated as the sum of the time from start to end of imatinib treatment per block. Imatinib-free treatment blocks were not included. Of the 92 Ph+ ALL patients included in the study, 34 underwent HSCT, 21 patients on study and 13 following withdrawal from the study.  The exposure in patients who did not undergo HSCT is described in table 20.

Exposure is the sum of the times from start to the end of the imatinib within each treatment block. Imatinib-free treatmentblocksarenotincluded.

Source:[STl57112301-Appendix 16.5-Table 14.3-1.1]

Among the Ph+ ALL patients receiving per protocol HSCT the overall median imatinib exposure prior to HSCT was 42 days (range, 21 to 77 days) and the median exposure to imatinib following HSCT was 169 days (range, 14 to 192 days). Among the Ph+ patients the overall median imatinib exposure prior to patients receiving off protocol HSCT was 53 days (range, 28 to 165 days)

Study  STI571I2301  permitted  the  imatinib  dose  to  be  reduced  from  340  mg/m2/day  to  230 mg/m2/day  for  patients  who  could  not  tolerate  the  higher  dose.  However,  imatinib  dose  and  dose modifications were not systematically entered in the dose administration record and therefore are not presented.  Only  overall  treatment  of  imatinib,  including  start  and  stop  dates,  were  captured  in  the CRF. Longer imatinib treatment did not correspond to higher number of patients with dose delays, as illustrated by the fact that the highest percentage of patients with dose delays were in cohorts 3 and 4, instead of in cohort 5.

The  protocol  permitted  modification  of  dose  and  dose-delay  for  the  management  of  toxicity. Unexpected non-haematological grade 3- 4 toxicities, grade 3-4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with clinically  significant  bleeding  or  infection  required  that  treatment  be  withheld  for  a  period  of  time. Following a dose-interruption, treatment with imatinib was restarted at a reduced dose (240 mg/m2 daily) once the event resolved to grade 2 or lower.

## Adverse events

## Study STI571I2301

The following were identified by COG as 'targeted toxicities:'

- Coagulation [partial thromboplastin time (PTT)]

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Coagulation [prothrombin time (PT)]
- Haemorrhage [Haemorrhage/ bleeding with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia]
- Haemorrhage [Haemorrhage/ bleeding without Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia]
- Haemorrhage [CNS haemorrhage/ bleeding]
- Hepatic [aspartate aminotransferase/ glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT)]
- Hepatic [SGPT (ALT)]
- Blood Bilirubin

It was required that non-targeted AEs be reported by the investigators if they were grade 3 or higher and recorded in the COG database. However, in practice, there were cases of AEs less than grade 3 that were reported. AEs that met the criteria for expedited reporting were expedited via the AdEERs reporting guidelines.

The incidence of non-targeted AEs of at least grade 3 by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term in  Ph+  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  +  imatinib  as  well  as  Ph-  patients  who  received chemotherapy alone is summarised in Table 24.

## Study STI571AIT07

Most patients experienced at least one AE during the study. The AEs reported were consistent with the established  safety  profile  of  imatinib.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  across  the  treatment  arms were decreased WBC count, haemoglobin, platelet count, and granulocyte count as well as infections (Table 29).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

## Study STI571I2301

Four deaths occurred on therapy or within 30 days of the last day of treatment. Of these, two patients received chemotherapy + imatinib. For both patients, Grade 5 AEs were reported and infection was the major  cause  of  death,  as  determined  by  the  investigator.  Both  infection  events  were  reported  as suspected  to  be  related  to  study  medication  by  investigator.  However,  neither  of  these  deaths  was reported as suspected to be related to study medication (neither imatinib nor chemotherapy).

The other 2 patient deaths on therapy were in the Ph- control group and did not receive imatinib.

As expected for the nature of the underlying disease, the most common primary cause of death was malignant disease progression, followed by infection and multi-organ failure. The proportion of patients who died due to malignant disease progression was 3 times higher in Ph- patients (27.7%) receiving chemotherapy alone compared to Ph+ ALL patients (8.7%) receiving chemotherapy + imatinib (Table 31).

## Laboratory findings

In  both  studies,  laboratory  reference  values  were  not  entered  during  the  study  in  the  CRF  on  a continuous scale and no normal ranges were available from these studies.

In addition, ANC and platelet decrease below a minimum threshold level (&lt;750/μL for ANC counts and &lt;75000/μL for platelet counts) were marked in the CRF and the date of recovery was noted.

Other laboratory evaluations such as ALT, AST, bilirubin increased, PTT prolonged, haemorrhage, PT prolonged, were captured as pre-specified targeted toxicities.

Laboratory data were not available from the Ph- ALL population.

In study [STI571AIT07], laboratory abnormalities for pre-specified assessments were collected on the CRF toxicity form according to investigator assignment using NCI-CTC grade (version 2, adopted for the  use  of  paediatric  oncology  patients).  Information  was  collected  on  the  following  laboratory parameters: haematological, renal, and pancreatic/liver and coagulation toxicities.

## Haematology Results-Study STI571I2301

As expected for the treatment regimen, most Ph+ ALL patients had a drop in ANC &lt;750/μL at some time,  regardless  of  imatinib  administration.  The  percentages  of  patients  with  a  decrease  in  ANC &lt;750/μL  in  Consolidation  1  were  85.7%  (cohort  1),  58.3%  (cohort  2),  54.5%  (cohort  3),  72.7% (cohort 4) and 82.0% (cohort 5). Most patients recovered from this degree of neutropenia with the exception of one patient in cohort 1 and one patient in cohort 5. The median time to recovery (ANC ≥ 750/μL) in Consolidation 1 ranged from 5 to 8 days for all cohorts. Across all treatment blocks, the time to recovery was similar in cohort 5 compared to all cohorts combined, ranging from 3 days to 35

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days.  In  general,  during  earlier  treatment  courses  recovery  occurred  within  7  days  and  in  later courses, in particular during Maintenance courses, the time to recovery to ≥ 750/μL was 8 to 14 days or longer.

There is no apparent difference in the incidence of ANC &lt;750/μL nor in the time to recovery related to the incorporation of imatinib into each treatment course.

The number of patients with platelets &lt;75000/μL at anytime varied in all cohorts by treatment lock, being highest in Consolidation 2 and Intensifications 1 and 2 and lowest in Maintenance 5 to 12. The overall median time to recovery ranged from 5.5 to 17 days, and was similar in cohort 5 (5.5 days to 20.5 days).

In general, there was no difference between treatment blocks, with the exception of a longer time to recovery  to  &gt;75000/μL  in  Reinduction  2  for  patients  treated  with  imatinib  and  a  longer  time  to recovery for patients not treated with imatinib in Intensification 2.

## Haematology Results-Study STI571AIT07

With respect to haematology, decreased white blood count, haemoglobin and platelet count was observed in over 90% of the patients in both groups without and with imatinib. There were no significant differences observed across the treatment groups

## Safety in special populations

Study STI571I2301 included 15 patients aged &lt;4 years including 3 patients aged 1 to 2 years old. To better assess the safety profile in the younger paediatric population, a safety analysis of &lt;4 vs. ≥ 4 years old was considered appropriate.

Deaths, AdEERs, and other significant AEs are summarised by age group in Table 34.

[STI57112301-Listing 14.1-1.1]

The  most  frequent  AEs  in  all  age  groups  were  related  to  investigations  (laboratory  abnormalities). Patients who had HSCT also reported frequently with surgical and medical procedures regardless of the age and with infections and infestations (age &lt;12 years) and gastrointestinal disorders (age 12 to &lt;18 years).

The number of patients ≥ 18 years of age was too low to present meaningful results. In patients &lt; 12 years  of  age  in  cohort  5,  the  most  frequent  AEs  were  haematological  (decreased  neutrophil  count, decreased  platelet  count,  decreased  haemoglobin,  WBC  decreased,  packed  red  blood  cell  (RBC) transfusion)  or  related  to  investigations  (ALT  increased,  hypokalaemia)  and  infections  (neutropenic infection, febrile neutropenia).

No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  observed  concerning  the  frequencies  of  AEs  in  different  age groups; however, the number of patients included in the respective age groups was relatively low. The AEs reported were consistent with the known safety profile of imatinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study STI571AIT07 the incidence of AEs was similar in the &lt;4 years and ≥ 4 years age groups.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Study STI571I2301

Overall  the  percentage  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  was  low  when  imatinib  was  added  to  the chemotherapy regimen. Four patients (4.3%) in the Ph+ group (two patients in cohorts 3 plus 4 and 2 patients in cohort 5) and one patient in the Ph- group were discontinued prematurely from the study due to toxicity.

- One patient in cohort 3 discontinued study treatment due to pancreatitis (causality assessed as due to PEG L-Asparaginase).
- One patients in cohort 4 discontinued study treatment due to hepatic toxicity (ALT increased, AST increased) following per protocol HSCT. At the time of the grade 3 transaminase elevation this  patient  was  receiving  the  study  medication  (imatinib)  during  the  HSCT  followup  phase. Imatinib  was  permanently  discontinued  due  to  hepatic  toxicity  approximately  2  weeks  after having  restarted  following  HSCT  therapy.  The  patient  was  taken  off  all  protocol  therapy approximately  3  months  after  imatinib  was  permanently  discontinued.  The  investigator suspected a possible relationship between the event (alanine aminotransferase increased) and the study medication (imatinib). The investigator suspected an unlikely relationship between the events (liver disorder, gamma glutamyltransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and dyspnea) and the study medication (imatinib).
- One  patient  in  cohort  5,  who  had  previously  experienced  severe  conjunctivitis  due  to cytarabine, discontinued the study treatment due to palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia, a skin disorder consisting of blisters on the right shin and left foot that occurred after HSCT.
- One  patient  in  cohort  5  experienced  life  threatening  constitutional  symptoms  (general symptom) and was noted with (cerebral) ventriculomegaly and transependymal edema on MRI suggesting hydrocephalus and was assessed as unlikely due to imatinib by the investigator.

## Study STI571AIT07

Of  the  128  patients  treated  with  imatinib,  only  one  patient  discontinued  the  study  due  to  toxicity. Toxicity was assessed by the investigator as probably related to asparaginase, and not causally related to imatinib.

## Post marketing experience

A  worldwide  literature  search  was  performed  to  capture  any  investigator  reports  on  safety  aspects which are not included in the study reports (Ovid date of search: 1948 to Nov 2011; Embase date of search: 1996 to 22 Dec 2011). The results of this literature search did not provide any evidence of unexpected or unknown events that would be attributable to treatment with imatinib, thus supporting the established safety and tolerability profile of imatinib.

The post-marketing safety of imatinib is monitored on an ongoing basis. In the post-marketing setting, with approximately 776114 patient-years of post-marketing exposure, no safety concerns have emerged that were not previously known for imatinib with the submission of these paediatric Ph+ ALL

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies. The safety profile of imatinib remains consistent with the information provided in the Core Data Sheet.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety database comprised 93 Ph+ subjects from the pivotal study STI571I2301 and 159 Ph+ patients (128 imatinib) from the supportive study STI571AIT07. Of them, 58 children from the main trial (subset excluding HSCT patients) were treated with high intensive chemotherapy + imatinib, being 30 patients the target population since this is the subjects in the cohort 5.

The exposure to imatinib in the cohort 5 has been more than 2 years, though the optimal duration with imatinib treatment is unclear.

The percentage of patients with AEs was higher in the group treated with imatinib than in the chemotherapy as only treatment. This seems logical and expectable. As relevant AEs in a higher percent observed in the cohort 5, neutrophil and platelet count, haemoglobin, neutropenic infection, pharyngitis, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, electrolytes, hypertension and hypoxia, are the more notorious, whereas myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity were the most remarkable safety concerns in the subgroup of targeted toxicities.  On the whole, the safety profile of the combination of high intensive chemotherapy + imatinib, does not seem to add any safety concern on the widely known safety profile of imatinib.

Regarding the deaths and SAEs, more patients died in the Ph- group (group treated with chemotherapy only) than in the imatinib arm (24% vs 44.5%, respectively), which is reassuring. This result has been supported by the STI571AIT07 study, in where the highest percentage of deaths was found in the no imatinib arm. Nevertheless, speaking about SAEs, the cohort 5 has 50 % of SAEs (excluding the subset of patients with BMT), which is by far, the highest percent of SAEs among cohorts. A direct comparison with Ph- subset is lacking.

In the laboratory findings the results highlight the AEs described above: neutropenia, platelet changes and liver enzymes.

Finally, the discontinuation and the post marketing experience do not lead to any safety concerns.

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, the sample size of the safety database is limited and data on the long-term use of imatinib in this new population are lacking. The safety findings from these two studies are pointing out that adding imatinib increases the toxicity of the backbone chemotherapy; there were more AEs and SAEs though less deaths.

No new safety concerns for imatinib have been identified.

In order to address the limitations related to the limited size of the safety database, the CHMP considers the following measure necessary:

To conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated in order to include information with regard to the environmental risk.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. Furthermore, minor editorial changes have been introduced.

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.8. Significance of paediatric studies

The CHMP is of the opinion that studies 1 (COG AALL0031) and 2 (EsPhALL), which are contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan, which is completed, and have been initiated before 26 January 2007 and completed after 26 January 2007, are considered as significant. Study 1 was a wellfounded dose-finding cohort study that is significant because it is considered as the pivotal efficacy study for the paediatric use assessed in this procedure. Study 2 was initially conducted as a comparative efficacy study, continuing as a prospective safety study, and the study is significant because it informs the safe use of the medicinal product in the paediatric population, in conjunction with multi-agent chemotherapy.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Four-year EFS in cohort 5 was 69.6%, more than twice that of historical controls with 31.6% (HR=0.28 CI 95% 0.16-0.49). The beneficial effects of imatinib were also reflected in the OS results (estimated OS  rate  at  48  months  was  83.6%  in  cohort  5  compared  to  44.8%  in  the  historical  control  group; HR=0.23).

Analyses comparing EFS and OS for cohort 1+2 vs cohort 5 showed better results for cohort 5 for both endpoints (p=0.0101 and p=0.0091, respectively). For the comparison of cohort 3+4 vs cohort 5, there was a trend in favour of cohort 5 with longer EFS and OS in the continuous dose cohort. An update after 5 years shows a clear benefit for imatinib.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

HSCT is still recommended in the eradication of Ph+ ALL and patients in Complete Remission are firm candidates, if possible, to receive a HSCT. There is uncertainty in Ph+ ALL paediatric patients whether the addition of imatinib to a standard regimen has any effect on the efficacy and/or safety of subsequent HSCT. In order to address this uncertainty, the MAH will conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  percentage  of  patients  with  AEs  was  higher  in  the  group  treated  with  imatinib  than  in  the chemotherapy  as  only  treatment.  This  seems  logical  and  expectable.  As  relevant  AEs  in  a  higher percent observed in the cohort 5, neutrophil and platelet count, haemoglobin, neutropenic infection, pharyngitis, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, electrolytes, hypertension and hypoxia, are the  more  relevant,  whereas  myelosuppression  and  hepatotoxicity  were  the  most  remarkable  safety concerns in the subgroup of targeted toxicities.

Regarding  the  deaths  and  SAEs,  more  patients  died  in the Phgroup  (group  treated with chemotherapy only) than in the imatinib arm (24% vs 44.5%, respectively), which is reassuring. This result has been supported by the STI571AIT07 study, in where the highest percentage of deaths was found  in  the  no  imatinib  arm.  Nevertheless,  speaking  about  SAEs,  the  cohort  5  has  50  %  of  SAEs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(excluding  the  subset  of  patients  with  BMT),  which  is  by  far,  the  highest  percent  of  SAEs  among cohorts.

In the laboratory findings the results highlight the AEs above described, neutropenia, platelet changes and liver enzymes.

Finally, the discontinuation and the post marketing experience do not lead to any safety concerns.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The  safety  profile  in  children  seems  to  be  comparable  to  adults,  though  the  limited  sample  size preclude drawing firm conclusions. In spite of this uncertainty, the profile of AEs and their frequency are reassuringly similar to adults, without any new safety concern.

The high percentage of SAEs in cohort 5, which is the main set of data supporting this application, raises concerns in relation to the addition of Glivec to chemotherapy regimen. However, the benefit for the patients in terms of EFS and OS clearly outweighs the risks.

Finally, the long term exposure to Glivec might be partially covered by data from others paediatric indications.

In order to address the limitations related to the limited size of the safety database, the MAH will conduct an observational registry collecting efficacy and safety data in newly diagnosed paediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated with chemotherapy + imatinib ± HSCT.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The outcomes in terms of EFS and OS from the COG study are pointing out a promising result in this high risk population. These  results appear  to  be  difficult to obtain with the currently  used chemotherapy regimen. Certainly, the relevance of the results is high and as a consequence, several guidelines around the world already include the use of Glivec in the treatment of Ph+ ALL paediatric patients.

The safety findings from the two studies supporting this application point out an increased toxicity of the backbone chemotherapy.

## Benefit-risk balance

The introduction of imatinib in combination with high intensive backbone chemotherapy gives clinically meaningful results in terms of EFS and OS at 48 months. These results appear to be independent of HSCT  role  in  the  study,  since  the  outcome  in  the  population  excluding  HSCT  patients  were  pretty similar to the whole population (HSCT vs Chemo+Glivec alone). The benefits showed by Glivec in the treatment of Ph+ ALL in children, outweigh the toxicity associated with chemotherapy+imatinib.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

In  summary,  relevant  results  have  been  shown  when  adding  imatinib  to  standard  chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL). From a safety point of view there are no major concerns given that imatinib is a well-known medicinal product, also used in children in other indications.
