## 1. Introduction

On December 2015, the MAH submitted a completed study for Bexsero, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The MAH stated that the generated data do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Bexsero. A type II variation addressing potential amendments to the Product Information will be submitted in 2017.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the study 'A phase IIIb, open label, multi center extension study of V72\\_28 to assess antibody persistence, and the safety and tolerability of a booster dose after the completion of the vaccination course in study V72\\_28.' is a stand-alone study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a booster dose after completion of the vaccination course in study V72\\_28.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Meningococcal meningitis and sepsis are diseases that can result in death within hours, despite the availability of effective antibiotics. The diseases are caused by Neisseria meningitidis ( N meningitidis ), a gram-negative, encapsulated bacterium classified into 5 major pathogenic serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) on the basis of the chemical composition of distinctive capsular polysaccharides. The reported annual incidence of meningococcal disease in the US varies from 0.5 to 10 per 100 000 population. The overall incidence in Canada varies from 0.5 to 2.1 per 100 000 population (PHA Canada, 2005). Each year, there are an estimated 1400-2800 cases of meningococcal disease in the US (Goldschneider et al, 1969), and in the year 2002 more than 5500 cases were reported in Europe (Muros et al, 2004). The case-fatality rate ranges from 5% to 15%, and up to 25% of survivors are left with neurological sequelae, limb loss or hearing loss. The disease is most common in children and young adults. The serogroup B in the year 2002 accounted for 36% of all reported meningococcal disease in the US, 28% in Canada, and from 41% to 90% of reported cases in Europe (Connolly and Noah, 1999; HPA 2006; Muros et al, 2004; Raghunathan et al, 2004).

In the 1960s, meningococcal vaccines consisting of purified polysaccharide antigens were developed against 4 (A, C, Y, and W-135) of the 5 pathogenic serogroups. Currently, there are no commercial vaccines available in North America or Europe for the prevention of disease caused by serogroup B of N meningitidis . Actually, the use of capsular polysaccharide as the basis of a vaccine for prevention of meningococcal B diseases has proven problematic. The meningococcal B capsular polysaccharide is identical to a widely distributed human carbohydrate (α[2 → 8] N-acetyl neuraminic acid or polysialic acid), which, being a self-antigen, is a poor immunogen in humans. An alternative approach to meningococcal B vaccine development has used surface-exposed proteins contained in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). These vaccines have been shown both to elicit serum bactericidal antibody responses and to be efficacious against developing meningococcal disease in clinical trials.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The present study, V72\\_28E1, is a phase 3b extension of study V72\\_28 which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics meningococcal B recombinant vaccine with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outer membrane vesicles produced from N meningitides serogroup B strain NZ98/254 (rMenB+OMV NZ) when administered alone without routine infant vaccines to healthy infants in their first year of life according to different 2 and 3 dose immunization schedules. The V72\\_28 study was also aimed at investigating the antibody persistence after primary series and administration of a subsequent booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 11 months of age. In the V72\\_28 study the safety and immunogenicity of 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ when administered to healthy children 2 to 10 years of age were also assessed.

The aim of this extension study was to explore the antibody persistence 24-36 months, after the last dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in children, who previously received a 2 or 3 dose primary series plus a booster dose at 11 months of age of rMenB+OMV NZ, as infants. This study was also to explore the antibody persistence 24-36 months, after 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to children (2-10 years old).

In addition, this study also evaluated the antibody response (safety and immunogenicity) to an additional dose boost in a subset of subjects who received 2 catch-up doses or ii) a 2 or 3 dose primary series plus a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in parent trial V72\\_28, and iii) the safety and immunogenicity of 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 1 month apart to healthy vaccine-naïve subjects of similar age of follow-on subjects.

## The MAH submitted reports for:

- 'A phase IIIb, open label, multi center extension study of V72\\_28 to assess antibody persistence, and the safety and tolerability of a booster dose after the completion of the vaccination course in study V72\\_28.'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## In what way?Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary Immunogenicity Objective

To evaluate the antibody persistence 24 to 36 months after the completion of the vaccination course, in subjects who participated in the V72\\_28 study in Groups I to IV.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives

- To evaluate the immune response at 1 month after a booster dose administered 24 to 36 months after completion of the vaccination course in the parent study (Groups A, C, E, G and I).
- To evaluate the immune response of 2 catch-up doses of meningococcal B recombinant vaccine with outer membrane vesicles produced from N meningitides serogroup B strain NZ98/254 (rMenB+OMV NZ) administered 1 month apart to vaccine-naïve children (Group K, L and M).

## Safety Objectives:

To assess the safety and tolerability of rMenB+OMV NZ when given as a booster dose administered 24 to 36 months after completion of the vaccination course in the parent study, and to assess the safety and tolerability of rMenB+OMV NZ when given as a 2 dose regimen (0, 1 month schedule) to vaccinenaïve subjects.

## Study design and treatments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This trial is an extension of study V72\\_28. It was conducted as a multicenter study and enrolled subjects who completed the vaccination course of study V72\\_28 (follow-on subjects enrolled in groups I to IV), and who met all other enrollment criteria for this extension study.

Following are the vaccine groups and vaccination schedule in the parent study V72\\_28 and in the present study V72\\_28E1:

- Group I: This group received 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2½, 3½ and 5 months of age and a booster at 11 months of age. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets, respectively. The vaccination subset received a fifth dose boost in this study.
- Group II: This group received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 3½ and 5 months of age and a booster dose at 11 months of age. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets, respectively. The vaccination subset received a fourth dose boost in this study.
- Group III: This group received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 6 and 8 months of age and a booster dose at 11 months of age. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets, respectively. The vaccination subset received a fourth dose boost in this study.
- Group IVa: This group constituted of subjects aged 2-5 years and received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at a 0, 2 month schedule. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:1 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets. The vaccination subset received third dose boost in this study.
- Group IVb: This group constituted of subjects aged 6-10 years and received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at a 0, 2 month schedule. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets. The vaccination subset received a third dose boost in this study. Subjects in nonvaccination subset were evaluated for antibody persistence only. Subjects assigned to vaccination subset with a fifth (Group A) or fourth (Group C and E) or third (Group G and I) dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ were evaluated for both antibody persistence and antibody response.
- In addition, 3 groups of vaccine-naïve subjects (Groups K, L and M) of similar age to the enrolled subjects in groups A to F (vaccine-naïve Group K: 35-47 months of age), Groups G to H (vaccine-naïve Group L: 4-7 years old) and in Groups I to J (vaccine-naïve Group M: 8-12 years old), not previously enrolled in the parent study V72\\_28, were recruited at the same study sites and received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 1 month apart. These subjects served as a baseline descriptive comparison for antibody persistence in the above mentioned groups and had a blood sample drawn for serological analyses at entry. In addition, their response after the first vaccination served as a descriptive comparison for the booster response in subjects from the parent study.

- Groups A, C, E, G and I (vaccination subset) and groups K, L and M (vaccine-naïve subjects):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Day 1-7 after the vaccination:
- -Unsolicited AEs
- -Solicited local AEs:
- Groups A, C, E, G, K and L: erythema, induration, injection site tenderness, swelling.
- Groups I and M: injection site pain, swelling, erythema, and induration.
- -Solicited systemic AEs:
- Groups A, C, E, G, K and L: change in eating habits, diarrhea, irritability, rash, sleepiness, persistent crying and vomiting.
- Groups I and M: arthralgia, chills, headache, malaise, myalgia and nausea, rash.
- -Other solicited data: use of medicine to prevent or to treat fever/pain, body temperature, medically attended fever.
- Entire study period:

Serious unsolicited AEs, medically attended AEs and AEs leading to withdrawal from the study, associated concomitant medications.

Groups B, D, F, H and J - Nonvaccination subset:

- Entire study period: All unsolicited AEs and related concomitant medications.

## Statistical Methods

The analyses of immunogenicity and safety were descriptive. As such, no statistical tests were to be performed. For the immunogenicity endpoints, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were to be calculated.

The immunogenicity analyses were to be based on the full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analyses, on the safety set.

The percentages of subjects w ith hSBA titers≥ 4, ≥ 5, ≥ 8 and the associated 2 -sided Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs were computed, by vaccine group for each of the N meningitidis serogroup B strains.

For analyzing GMTs, the antibody titers and antigen concentrations were logarithmically transformed (log10). GMTs and the associated 2-sided 95% CI were computed by exponentiating (base10) the corresponding least square means of the log10-transformed titers and the associated 95% CI obtained from a 2-way ANOVA with factors for vaccine group and study center.

GMRs and the associated 2-sided 95% CI were obtained from a 2-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with factors for vaccine group and study center.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 851 subjects were enrolled in this extension study, 255 subjects were evaluated for antibody persistence only and 596 subjects (follow-on + vaccine-naïve subjects) were evaluated for antibody persistence and booster/first dose response. Majority of the subjects enrolled in the vaccination subset (follow-on + vaccine-naïve subjects) were included in the per protocol set (PPS) and FAS.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were balanced across the vaccine groups as per the age groups. Most of the subjects were of white race and the gender distribution was similar.

## Antibody persistence after 24-36 months of vaccination course in follow-on subjects or at baseline in vaccine-naïve subjects:

## 35-47 months of age:

Across the vaccine follow-on groups, there was a decline in antibody titers against all strains at 24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72\\_28 (visit 1 in V72\\_28E1) from 1 month after last vaccination in V72\\_28.

Overall, at 24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72\\_28 study, hSBA antibody titers across the 3 follow-on groups (2H3H511, 3H5\\_11 and 68\\_11) were higher than NAIVE\\_123 group except against strain M10713 (Table 2-6). At 24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72\\_28 study, GMTs across the 3 follow-on groups were higher than the NAIVE\\_123 group except against strain M10713 (Table 2-8).

Sowce: Table 14.2.1.1.3; Table 14.2.1.1.9.

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; FAS, fill analysis set; hSBA, serum bactericidal activity using human complement.

Overall, hSBA antibody titers across the 3 vaccine-naïve groups (NAIVE\\_123, NAIVE\\_4A and NAIVE\\_4B) were similar against each given strain (Table 11.4.1-9). At baseline (visit 1 in V72\\_28E1) the GMTs were low across vaccine-naïve subjects against all strains. The 1 month after first dose/baseline GMRs were 5.35-fold to 8.15-fold against strain H44/76, 14-fold to 35-fold against strain H44/76, 5.72-fold to 7.28-fold against strain NZ98/254 and 1.40-fold to 1.68-fold against strain M10713.

Across all vaccine-naive groups, the 1 month of second dose/baseline GMRs were 34-fold to 46-fold against strain H44/76; 242-fold to 558-fold against strain H44/76; 27-fold to 30-fold against strain NZ98/254 and 2.20-fold to 3.86-fold against strain M10713.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Against all strains, at 1 month after first dose (visit 2 in V72\\_28E1) there was an increase in the titers with some variability depending on the strains. A more robust increase in the titers was observed at 1 month after the second dose (visit 3 in V72\\_28E1) especially against strain 5/99 (Table 11.4.1-10).

## CHMP comment:

## Booster dosing:

For both young and older children 4 to 7 years and 8 to 12 years booster dosing resulted in substantial increase in AB titers for the majority of strains with lowest outcome for M10713.

## 2-dose catch-up series response in vaccine-naïve subjects:

Catch-up dosing resulted in a substantial increase of subjects developing hSBA antibody titers especially against H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 with low outcome for M10713

## Safety results

## CHMP comment:

No SAEs were reported in the study. No unexpected safety signal was generated during the study

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72\\_28, the antibody levels declined against all strains across all follow-on vaccine groups with in general higher GMTs and AB titters in follow-on subjects compared to vaccine-naïve subjects.

The immunogenicity outcome for M10713 was in general low across the groups investigated. This is not unexpected, as the responses to this strain were seen as problematic in previous studies as well.

The administration of a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in previously primed subjects (followon groups) or two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 1 month apart to vaccine-naïve subjects induced strong hSBA titers with lowest results for M10713. The results were hereby comparable for booster vaccinations in infants who initially received either 2 or 3 doses.

No unexpected safety signal was generated. No SAEs were reported in this study.

The MAH is planning to submit a type II variation to update the SPC with data from the current study. This is endorsed.
