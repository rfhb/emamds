Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for avacopan, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data regarding the timing of detected abnormal liver function tests, the serious cases of drug-induced liver injury including cases with fatal outcome reported in the post-marketing setting, and the absence of recommendations regarding frequency or interval of monitoring of liver function tests in the most recent European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - associated vasculitis, the PRAC considers that the frequency for monitoring of liver function (i.e. hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin) should be further specified in the product information. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing avacopan should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for avacopan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing avacopan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
