## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The MAH assessed the long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B and the immune response to  a  hepatitis  B  vaccine  challenge  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years,  previously vaccinated with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine ( Infanrix hexa ) or GSK Biologicals' DTPa-IPV/Hib and HBV ( Engerix -B )  vaccines at the ages of 3, 5 and 11 months in clinical trial DTPa-HBV-IPV-031 (217744/031). The MAH concluded that these data warrant  a  change  in  the  SmPC  of  the  product  to  reflect  anti-HepB  Ab  persistence.  A  type  II variation will be submitted in due time in order to update section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## II. RECOMMENDATION 1

The data from this study can warrant a change in the SmPC and PL to reflect the data on the long-term persistence of the antibody response following Hepatitis B vaccination.

## III. INTRODUCTION

The  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Infanrix  hexa  to  comply  with  the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for  paediatric  use.  Long-term  persistence  of  anti-hepatitis  B  antibodies  and  response  to  a hepatitis B vaccine were assessed in healthy children aged 11-12 years previously vaccinated with a anti hepatitis B vaccine at the ages of 3, 5 and 11 months in clinical trial DTPa-HBV-IPV031 (217744/031).

## IV. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## IV.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

One dose (0.5 ml) of Engerix-B (Lot no.: AHBVB720A, Expiry date: 31 March 2012) contained: 10 μg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen adsorbed on 0.25 mg aluminium as aluminium hydroxide.

## IV.2 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

Long-term persistence of anti-hepatitis B antibodies and response to a hepatitis B vaccine were assessed  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years  previously  vaccinated  with  a  anti  hepatitis  B vaccine  at  the  ages  of  3,  5  and  11  months  in  clinical  trial  DTPa-HBV-IPV-031  (217744/031). According to  the  MAH  these  data  warrant  a  change  in  the  vaccine  SmPC  to  reflect  the  data regarding the long-term antibody persistence.

## 2. Clinical study

## 2.1 Methods

## 2.1.1 Objectives

## Primary:

1 The recommendation from section V can be copied in this section

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -To assess the anti-HB antibody response to a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in subjects aged 11-12 years, vaccinated in infancy with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B at 3, 5 and 11 months of age.

## Secondary:

- -To  assess  the  persistence  of  anti-HB  antibodies,  10-11  years  after  primary  infant vaccination with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B at 3, 5 and 11 months of age.
- -To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in terms of solicited symptoms, unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events (SAEs).

## 2.1.2 Study design

Phase IV, open, multi-centre, non-randomised study with the same two groups as in the primary study.  All  subjects  previously  vaccinated  with  three  doses  of  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  or  DTPaIPV/Hib+HBV  in  the  first  year  of  life  received  a  single  challenge  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals' Engerix-B vaccine in this study.

The two treatment groups were as follows:

- -DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group : Subjects who previously received DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib ( Infanrix hexa ) at 3, 5 and 11-12 months of age and received a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in this study.
- -DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group :  Subjects  who  previously  received  DTPa-IPV/Hib  +  HBV ( Engerix-B )  at  3,  5  and  11-12  months  of  age  and  received  a  challenge  dose  of  HBV vaccine in this study.

N = Number of subjects planned to be enrolled

Pre-vacc BS = Pre-vaccination blood sampling, Post-vac BS = Post-vaccination blood sampling

Two blood samples were drawn: one before, and the other, one month after the challenge dose of Engerix-B vaccine.

## 2.1.3 Study population /Sample size

Subjects aged 11-12 years, previously vaccinated with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B at 3, 5 and 11 months of age in the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031).

## 2.1.4 Treatments

Vaccination  schedule/site:  All  subjects  received  a  dose  of  Engerix-B  as  an  intramuscular injection into the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.

## 2.1.5 Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint

Anti-HBs antibody concentrations one month after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine:

- -Percentage of subjects with anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/ml.

## Secondary endpoints

## Immunogenicity

Persistence and immune response to the study vaccine:

- -Percentage of subjects with an anamnestic response to a challenge dose.
- -Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 3.3 mIU/ml, ≥ 10 mIU/ml, and ≥ 100 mIU/ml before and one month after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine.

## Safety and reactogenicity:

Solicited local and general symptoms.

- -Occurrence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  during  the  4-day  (Day  0  to  Day  3)  follow-up period after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine.
- -Occurrence of solicited general symptoms during the 4-day (Day 0 to Day 3) follow-up period after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine.

Unsolicited adverse events.

- -Occurrence  of  unsolicited  symptoms  during  the  31-day  (Day  0  to  Day  30)  follow-up period after a challenge dose of HBV vaccine.

Serious adverse events.

- -Occurrence of SAEs after the challenge dose of HBV vaccine up to the study end.

## 2.1.6 Statistical methods, sample size

The  sample  size  of  this  challenge  dose  study  was  not  estimated  using  any  power  based computations. A total of 312 children aged 11-12 years, who participated in the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031) were expected to participate in this challenge dose study. It was assumed that a range of 15% to 10% of the subjects enrolled in the challenge dose study might be non-evaluable at the time of analysis (e.g. dropouts, noncompliance with protocol etc.). Therefore, a total of 270 or 280 evaluable subjects were expected to participate in this challenge dose study.

## Total vaccinated cohort

The TVC included all subjects who received the challenge dose of the HBV vaccine. The TVC for  the  analysis  of  safety  included  all  subjects  with  study  vaccine  administration  documented. The TVC for the analysis of immunogenicity was to include all subjects who received a challenge

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose of HBV vaccine and for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available at the post-HBV vaccine challenge blood sampling time point.

## ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity

The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those who met all eligibility criteria, complied with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria met during the study), who had received a challenge dose of Engerix-B and for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available at the post-HBV challenge time point. The interval between Visit 1 and Visit 2, considered for inclusion of a subject in the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity was 21-48 days.

## ATP cohort for antibody persistence

The ATP cohort for antibody persistence included all subjects:

- -aged  11-12  years  (from  and  including  the  11th  birthday  up  to  but  excluding  the  13th birthday) at the time of enrolment,
- -who had received three doses of the combination vaccine ( Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B ) in the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031),
- -who had not received any additional dose of hepatitis B (containing) vaccine,
- -with no evidence of hepatitis B infection or disease (including anti-HBc at postchallenge dose time point or abnormal increase in anti-HBs concentrations),
- -for  whom  serological  results  were  available  at  the  pre-HBV  vaccine  challenge  blood sampling time point.

Analysis of safety: Analysis was performed on the TVC.

Analysis of demography: At Visit 1, demographic characteristics (age in years and gender) were tabulated. The mean age (with the range and standard deviation) of the vaccinated subjects was calculated. The distribution of subjects among the study centres was tabulated.

## 2.1.7 Derived and transformed data

Immunogenicity

- -A seronegative subject was a subject with anti-HB antibody concentrations below the cut-off level (&lt; 3.3 mIU/ml).
- -A seropositive subject was a subject with anti-HB antibody concentrations above the cut-off level ( ≥ 3.3 mIU/ml).
- -A seroprotected subject was a subject with anti-HB antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/ml.
- -Anamnestic response to the challenge dose was defined as:
- o At least (i.e. greater than or equal to) a 4-fold rise in post-challenge dose anti-HBs antibody concentrations in subjects seropositive at the pre-challenge dose time point.
- o Post-challenge  dose  anti-HBs  antibody  concentrations ≥ 10  mIU/ml  in  subjects seronegative at the pre-challenge dose time point.
- -The  GMC  calculations  were  performed  by  taking  the  anti-log  of  the  mean  of  the  log10 concentration transformations. Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation.
- -For  a  given  subject  and  a  given  immunogenicity  measurement,  missing  or  nonevaluable measurements were not replaced. Therefore, an analysis excluded subjects with missing or non-evaluable measurements.

## Safety/Reactogenicity

- -For the analysis of solicited  symptoms,  missing or  non-evaluable  measurements were not replaced. Therefore the analysis of the solicited symptoms based on the TVC included only subjects with documented safety data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -For  the  analysis  of  unsolicited  adverse  events/concomitant  medication,  all  vaccinated subjects were to be considered and subjects who did not report an event were considered as subjects without an event.

## 2.2 Results

## 2.2.1 Demography results:

The  mean  age  of  subjects  for  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  was  11.3  years,  with  a standard deviation of 0.46 years. Male subjects constituted 57.1% of the study population.

## 2.2.2 Number of subjects

A total of 312 subjects were enrolled in the primary study 217744/031 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-031). A total of 185 subjects (95 subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group and 90 subjects in the DTPaIPV/Hib+HBV group) were vaccinated in this study after having been checked for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main reasons for non-participation in this challenge dose study were attributed to consent withdrawal (not due to AEs/SAEs) and migration of subjects from the study area. The number of subjects enrolled into the study as well as the number excluded from ATP analyses with reasons for exclusion is presented in Table 9.

## 2.2.3 Immunogenicity results

Immunological correlate of protection: Antibodies  to  the  HB  antigen  were  measured  using ELISA  developed  in-house.  The  cutoff  of  the  test  was  set  at  3.3  mIU/ml.  An  antibody concentration ≥ 10  mIU/ml  defined  seroprotection  [Centre  for  Disease  Control,  1991;  World Health Organization, 1988].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary objective and endpoint: Assessment of the anti-HB antibody response to a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in the subjects aged 11-12 years, vaccinated in infancy with three doses of Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B at 3, 5 and 11 months of age by determination of the anti-HB antibody concentration and the percentage of subjects with anti-HB antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/ml one month after the challenge dose.

Response to the HBV vaccine challenge dose one month after the challenge dose vaccination (ATP cohort for immunogenicity):

The  anti-HBs  immunogenicity  results  for  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  at  pre  and  postchallenge dose time points is presented in Table 1.

- -The percentage of subjects with anti-HB antibody concentrations ≥ 10  mIU/ml  was 95.8% in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group and 98.9% in the DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group.
- -The percentage of subjects with anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/ml was 92.6% in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib Group and 96.6% in the DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group.
- -The  anti-HBs  GMCs  observed  in  the  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups were 2917.5 mIU/ ml and 3943.7 mIU/ ml, respectively

≥ 10 mIU/ml, ≥100mIU/ml, percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations between ≥ 10mIU/ml and 100 mIU/ml and GMCs (calculated on all subjects) at pre and post-challenge dose time point (ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

## 2.2.4 Safety results

Secondary safety objective: To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a challenge dose of HBV vaccine in terms of solicited symptoms, unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Solicited local adverse events were pain, redness or swelling at the injection site. All sollicited local (injection site) reactions were considered causally related to vaccination.

Solicited  general  adverse  events  were  fatigue,  fever,  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain) or headache.

Serious  adverse  events  were  untowarded  medical  occurrences  that  either  resulted  in  death, were  life-threatening,  required  hospitalisation  or  prolongation  of  existing  hospitalisation  or resulted in disability/incapacity.

## Solicited local adverse events

The  incidence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  reported  during  the  4-day  (Day  0  to  Day  3)  postvaccination period is presented in Table 16.

All local symptoms were considered to be causally related to vaccination.

- -Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in both groups, reported for not more than 31.6% of subjects during the 4-day (Day 0 to Day 3) postvaccination follow-up period.
- -Grade 3 pain was reported for one subject in each group.
- -Swelling  was  reported  for  15.8%  and  8.9%  of  subjects  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPaIPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively.

## Unsolicited adverse events

The  percentage  of  subjects  for  whom  the  occurrence  of  unsolicited  symptoms  classified  by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the 31-day (Day 0 to Day 30) post-vaccination period was reported is presented in Table 18 (not shown). The percentage of subjects who reported the occurrence of Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the 31-day (Day 0 to Day 30) postvaccination period is presented in Table 19 (not shown) .

- -At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  was  reported  for  5.3%  and  7.8%  of  subjects  in  the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Grade  3  unsolicited  AE  (Otitis  media)  was  reported  for  one  subject  in  the  DTPaIPV/Hib+HBV group.
- -No unsolicited symptoms that were considered to be causally related to vaccination were reported during the 31-day follow-up period.

## Serious adverse events

## Fatal events: No deaths were reported during the study.

Non-fatal events: Over the entire study period (31-days), an SAE, [Infection (not specified)], was reported  for  subject  number  287  in  the  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group,  two  days  after  vaccination which resulted in hospitalisation and lasted for six days. The infection resolved during the course of the study and was assessed as not causally related to the vaccination, by the investigator.

## Safety conclusions

- -At least one unsolicited symptom was reported for not more than 7.8% of subjects across both groups.
- -Grade 3 unsolicited symptom (Otitis media) was reported for one subject in the DTPaIPV/Hib+HBV group.
- -The SAE reported for one subject (infection) resolved during the course of the study and was not assessed as causally related to the vaccination by the investigator.
- -No fatal SAEs were reported.

## 3. Discussion on clinical (immunogenicity and safety) aspects

The  present  study  was  conducted  to  assess  anti-HBs  antibody  persistence  and  immune response to a challenge dose of HBV in children 11-12 years, previously vaccinated with GSK DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  vaccine  ( Infanrix  hexa )  or  GSK  Biologicals'  DTPa-IPV/Hib  and  HBV ( Engerix -B ) vaccines at the age of 3, 5 and 11 months. The results demonstrate that the immune response induced by the three dose primary vaccination course in infancy persisted for at least 11 years (anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 3.3 mIU/ml was reported in 72.6 % subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  group and 75.3 %  subjects in the DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group).  An anamnestic response to the HBV challenge dose, indicative of an immunological memory to the vaccine  antigen,  was  observed  in  the  majority  of  subjects  (anamnestic  response  mounted  by 95.8%  subjects in the  DTPa-HBVIPV/Hib  group  and  97.8%  of  subjects  in  the  DTPaIPV/Hib+HBV  group).  The  data  suggests  that  protection  against  hepatitis  B  may  still  be conferred through immune memory in all subjects who responded to the primary vaccination but subsequently had anti-HB antibody concentrations &lt; 10 mIU/ml.

Hepatitis  B  response  to  the  challenge  dose  is  comparable  in  children  who  received  the  HBV component as part of a combination vaccine or as a monovalent vaccine in infancy.

Engerix-B was confirmed to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic when administered as a challenge dose in subjects primed in infancy with Infanrix hexa or Engerix-B .

## 4. Conclusions:

- -One month after the challenge dose, 92.6% and 96.6% subjects had anti-HBs antibody concentration  ≥  100  mIU/ml  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  and  DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV  group, respectively.
- -Approximately  ten  years  after  the  primary  vaccination,  72.6%  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group and 75.3% subjects in DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group had anti-HB antibody concentration  ≥3.3  mIU/ml,  53.7%  in  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group  and  56.2%  subjects  in DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group had anti-HB antibody concentration ≥10 mIU/ml.
- -An  anamnestic  response  to  the  hepatitis  B  challenge  dose  was  mounted  by  95.8% (91/95) and 97.8% (87/89) subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  was  reported  for  5.3%  and  7.8%  subjects  in  DTPaHBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV group, respectively, within the 31 day (Day 0 to Day 30) follow up period after the challenge dose.
- -An SAE (infection, not specified) was reported for one subject from DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib group,  which  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  not  causally  related  to  vaccination. The SAE was resolved before the end of study.

## V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

## Overall conclusion

The MAH assessed the long-term persistence of antibodies against hepatitis B and the immune response to  a  hepatitis  B  vaccine  challenge  in  healthy  children  aged  11-12  years,  previously vaccinated with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine ( Infanrix hexa ) or GSK Biologicals' DTPa-IPV/Hib and HBV ( Engerix -B )  vaccines at the ages of 3, 5 and 11 months in clinical trial DTPa-HBV-IPV-031 (217744/031).

The presented data indicate that about 75% of subjects were seropositive for anti-HB Ab and about 55% displayed seroprotective anti-HB antibody levels 10 years after the last vaccination. An anamnestic response to the hepatitis B challenge dose was mounted by 95.8% (91/95) and 97.8% (87/89) subjects in the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPa-IPV/Hib+HBV groups, respectively. These data highlight the persistence of the anti-HB immune response 10 year after the primary vaccination series.

## Recommendation

The MAH concluded that these data warrant a change in the SmPC of the product to reflect antiHepB Ab persistence and will submit a type II variation in due time in order to update section 5.1 of the SmPC. The corresponding Type II variation will be evaluated upon receipt.
