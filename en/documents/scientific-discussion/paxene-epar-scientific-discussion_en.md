## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures, which have been finalised before 30 November 2004. For scientific information on procedures after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Paxene  concentrated  solution  for  infusion  contains  the  active  drug  substance  paclitaxel.    It  is  a naturally occurring product derived from the Yew tree.  Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-cancer drug.  The indication for Paxene is the treatment of patients with advanced AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) who  have  failed  prior  liposomal  anthracycline  therapy.  The  recommended  dose  is  100  mg/m 2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion every 14 days. Courses of therapy may be delayed or the dosage reduced depending on the observed toxicity.

A disseminated, fulminant form of KS occurs in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV).  Approximately  20%  of  patients  with  AIDS  have  AIDS-related Kaposi's  sarcoma  (AIDS-KS).    AIDS-KS  is  characterised  by  multifocal,  widespread  lesions  of  the skin, mucosal surfaces, lymph nodes and visceral organs, including the liver, spleen, gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and lungs.  Where KS is confined to the skin, AIDS patients are often healthy and free of systemic symptoms and therapy may not be required. However, the psychosocial burden associated with facial and other dermal involvement may be profound. Although most patients initially present with skin disease, KS involvement of the lymph nodes or the GI tract may occasionally precede the appearance  of  cutaneous  lesions.    Eventually,  almost  all  patients  with  epidemic  KS  develop disseminated  disease.  Life-threatening  lesions  most  commonly  involve  the  GI  tract  and  lungs. However, most patients with AIDS-KS die of opportunistic infections rather than the disease itself. Management  of  AIDS-KS  is  generally  directed  at  palliation  of  disease-related  symptoms  as  no treatment has been unequivocally proven to impact survival. Local therapy (radiation or laser therapy, intralesional administration of cytotoxic agents) may result in the disappearance or reduction in size of lesions  and  thereby  alleviate  symptoms.  However,  advanced  AIDS-KS  usually  requires  systemic therapy. 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Composition and product development Medicinal product no longer authorised

Paxene is a concentrated solution for infusion containing either 30 mg/5 ml or 150 mg/25 ml of paclitaxel, in a co-solvent system consisting of a 50:50 mixture of ethanol and polyoxyl castor oil, stabilised by 2 mg/ml of anhydrous citric acid. The use of the two co-solvents has been adequately justified. The finished product  is  made  by  Faulding  Pharmaceuticals  in  Australia  using  an  aseptic  process. Sterilisation  is  by filtration, a method that has been justified by the lower assay values and higher degradation levels seen in product that has been autoclaved compared with non-autoclaved product. The high content of ethanol also precludes autoclaving.

The clinical trial formula is identical to the formula proposed for marketing. The container is a Ph.Eur. Type I colourless glass vial closed with a silicone-coated rubber stopper.

## Active substance

Paclitaxel is extracted from the leaves, twigs and needles of Taxus X media ' Hicksii ' , an ornamental yew. Clinical studies were carried out using paclitaxel isolated from a different species, Taxus brevifolia . In the specification for paclitaxel, the assay and impurity limits have been tightened, reflecting the higher purity of the active substance produced from ' Hicksii ' material.  There are no concerns with the impurity profile or  stability  of  active  from  the  two  sources.  Only ' Hicksii ' material  will  be  used  for  the  production  of Paxene.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are eleven potentially related substances,  two  of  which  have not  been  seen  above  0.1% and are therefore  not  included  in  the  specification. The limits in the specification  for the impurities  have  been tightened and are justified by toxicology studies. The analytical methods are adequately validated.

The proposed specifications are supported by the available batch analysis results (n = 22 for brevifolia, and n = 4 for 'Hicksii').

The  stability  studies  show  that  paclitaxel  is  stable.  The  proposed  retest  period  of  12  months  is acceptable.

## Other ingredients

Polyoxyl castor oil and anhydrous citric acid comply with the relevant  monographs in Ph. Eur., while ethanol complies with the monograph in BP. The use of polyoxyl castor oil has been justified. On the basis of batch analysis data and the fact that ethanol and citric acid have anti-microbial properties testing for bioburden and endotoxins is not necessary.

## Finished product

Paclitaxel is dissolved in ethanol.  Citric acid is added to this solution followed by the required quantity of polyoxyl castor oil.  With each addition the solution is mixed.  The bulk is adjusted to weight with ethanol and the solution is bubbled through with nitrogen. Validation includes in-process and product release test results, justification of manufacturing times, bio-burden limits, filter suitability and media fill trials.

The product is manufactured in a facility that holds the necessary Manufacturing Authorisation.

A single, validated assay method is used for identity, content and related impurities. The pH is controlled around the pH of greatest stability. A limit on moisture is included to limit hydrolysis of paclitaxel. The endotoxin test will be performed according to the Ph. Eur. method. The proposed limits are well below the calculated Endotoxin Limit Concentration. Sterility will be done according to the Ph. Eur., including 14 days of incubation.

The impurity limits in the product specifications are justified by toxicology studies. The batch analysis results  (n=9)  confirm  satisfactory  uniformity  of  the  product  at  release  and  indicate  reliable  and consistent performance of the product in clinical use.

The finished product specifications are acceptable. The process has adequately been validated.

A two-year shelf life for the finished product when stored below 25°C, protected from light, is acceptable.

Solution for infusion prepared as recommended should be used immediately or be stored at 2-8°C for not more than 24 hours (see SPC).

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

The  active  ingredient  of  Paxene,  paclitaxel,  is  a  Pacific  Yew  tree  ( Taxus  brevifolia )  derivative  with cytotoxic activity.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## In vitro studies

Paclitaxel has been shown to inhibit the growth of KS in  vitro .  Four  cell  lines  were  used;  KSY-1  and KS6-3 (primary culture) isolated from AIDS patients, KS-SLK isolated from a HIV-negative patient and human  umbilical  vein  endothelial  cells  (HUVEC)  infected  with  human  herpes  virus  8  (or  KS  related herpes  virus,  HHV-8  or  KSHV).    In  a  cell  proliferation  assay,  placebo  treated  cells  were  unaffected whereas  proliferation  was  suppressed  in  a  dose  related  manner  in  KSY-1  and  HUVEC-KSHV  cells treated with over 0.5 ng/ml Paxene (IC50 ≤ 2.5 ng/ml).  The KS6-3 cells were also growth inhibited (IC50 ≥ 10 ng/ml), but the KS-SLK cells were unaffected.

## In vivo studies

In an additional in vivo study, KSY-1 cells were implanted sc in athymic mice, the next day the animals were treated with Paxene at one of the following doses: 0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg ip.  Tumour growth was reduced on day 7 at all doses and on day 14 at ≥ 10 mg/kg.  Problems arise in the interpretation of this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study; deaths between days 1 and 4 resulted in low group sizes, only one animal per treatment group could be  assessed  on  days  4  to  14.    These  data  suggest  the  potential  efficacy  of  paclitaxel  in  the  proposed indication, AIDS-KS.

## General pharmacodynamics

Paclitaxel  has  been  the  subject  of  much  study  since  it  was  first  isolated  in  1971.    It  is  proposed  that paclitaxel promotes polymerisation of tubulin dimers into micro-tubules and stabilises them by preventing de-polymerisation.    This  inhibits  the  reorganisation  of  the  micro-tubule  network  and  blocks  mitosis. Paclitaxel has also been implicated in the induction of apoptosis.  The anti-neoplastic activity of paclitaxel has been demonstrated against a wide variety of tumour types, in vitro and in vivo ,  e.g.  bladder, brain, breast, cervix, colon, ovary, lung, leukaemia.

Adverse cardiovascular effects were seen in one dog study, i.e. tachycardia, vasodilation, hypotension and collapse immediately post-dose (9 mg/kg iv), but these were not fatal.  It is noted that Cremophor EL, the vehicle,  has  been  associated  with  similar  effects  in  dogs.    Cardiovascular  effects  are  reported in  vitro (concentration  dependant  arrythmias  in  cardiac  cell  cultures)  and  clinically  (transient  asymptomatic bradycardia).  Sensory neurotoxicity in mice and rats after iv or sc administration has been reported.

Single dose toxicity studies were carried out in rats  and  dogs.  Observations in rats  included lethargy, piloerection, soft faeces, tremors and prostration post-dose. Observations in the dog included erythema, oedema,  tachycardia,  hypotension,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea.    Lesions  seen  post-mortem  were  mild  to severe  and  mainly  in  areas  of  high  tissue  turn-over  (e.g.  GI  tract,  bone  marrow,  testes).    The  only irreversible  finding  was  of  diffuse  degeneration  and  necrosis  of  testes  (seminiferous  tubules),  often accompanied by degeneration of the epididymis, in both species.

Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel was investigated in rats, dogs and man.  Paxene is to be administered iv, hence most of the studies used this route.  Following dissipation of the vehicle, which briefly increases the solubility of paclitaxel in plasma, paclitaxel is 60-70% plasma protein bound in rats.  Exposure in rats is supra-proportional to dose, implying that adequate exposures were achieved in pivotal toxicity studies. Dose-related increases in plasma levels were seen in dogs, exposure did not change significantly after six weekly iv doses. Paclitaxel is widely distributed in the rat, primarily to the GI tract, GI tract contents, liver and testes.  Coadministration  of  Cyclosporin  A  has  been  shown  to  increase  bioavailability  in  rats  suggesting  the involvement of CYP3A4 in its metabolism.  Metabolism studies were not done in the rat nor were the metabolites identified.  It is suggested that there are qualitative and quantitative inter-species differences in paclitaxel metabolism and that further studies in this area would not yield any useful information.  The need  for  this  information  is  somewhat  superseded  by  studies  in  man  which  suggest  CYP2C8  and CYP3A4 involvement, the main metabolite being 6 α -hydroxy-paclitaxel. The  half-life  of  paclitaxel  is  6-18  hours  in  rats,  8-11  hours  in  dogs  and  9-25  hours  in  man.    In  rats paclitaxel is excreted in the urine as polar metabolites (9% of administered dose) and in the faeces, mainly as the parent compound (80% of administered dose).  It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in the milk, this is reflected in the SPC. Toxicology Single dose toxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Repeated dose studies

Similar observations were made in repeated dose toxicity tests in rats and dogs.  There were additional haematological effects, with a fall in most haematological parameters, lymphoid degeneration and extramedullary haematopoiesis in the liver and spleen. Comparability was shown between T. brevifolia (bark) and T. media X 'Hicksii' (biomass) derived paclitaxel in rodents and dogs.  Many of the clinical signs are attributed to the vehicle (Cremophor EL) as they are common to vehicle-control and low-dose-paclitaxel animals.  When an intermittent administration protocol was used, to mimic the clinical use, these signs were seen to decrease in intensity and duration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Genotoxicity

Two in vitro and one in vivo genotoxicity tests were carried out. Paclitaxel in DMSO tested negative in the  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay  ( S.  typhimurium and E.  coli )  and  the  mammalian  cell  forward mutation assay (CHO cell line).  In the mouse micronucleus assay no mortality or adverse clinical signs were seen.  A dose related increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was seen compared to controls.  Paclitaxel is classified as an in vivo genotoxin under the conditions of this assay.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies are not required in this case.

## Reproductive and development toxicity studies

A developmental study was carried out in rats.  Dose-related events included: reduction in body weight gain, alopecia, increased resorptions and post-implantation losses, reduced live pup birth weight, retarded foetal ossification, increased incidence of cervical rib at 7 th cervical vertebra, two incidences of dilation of the lateral ventricles of the brain.  The maternal and developmental NOEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day (day 7-17 of the gestation).

A full reproductive and developmental toxicity programme is not required as cytotoxic/cytostatic drugs are  assumed  to  cause  reproductive  disturbances  (see  the  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  preclinical evaluation  of  anticancer  medicinal  products  [CPMP/SWP/997/96]).  Paxene  is  contra-indicated  in pregnancy. Local tolerance To  assess  intra-vascular  and/or  extra-venous  irritation  potential,  Paxene  (1.2  mg/ml,  4 × the  clinical concentration) was infused into the left ear vein (3 mg/2.5 ml/kg) or left ear peri-venous tissue (0.6 mg/0.5 ml) of NZW rabbits.  For control purposes, the same volume of 0.9% (w/w) NaCl was infused in the right ear.    The  sites  were  observed  for  48  hours  followed  by  necropsy  and  histopathology.    Mild  irritation (erythema,  vascular  dilatation)  was  seen  at  all  sites,  including  controls,  within  15  min  of  infusion  and lasting up to 48 hours.  The irritation potential of Paxene is within acceptable limits. Special toxicity studies The  human  blood  compatibility  of  Paxene  was  determined in  vitro using  haemolysis  and  erythrocyte aggregation tests.    Undiluted  vehicle  and  concentrations ≥ 0.3  mg/ml  paclitaxel  caused  haemolysis  and crenation of erythrocytes.  Erythrocyte aggregation and blood clotting were seen at 0.9 mg/ml paclitaxel. Maximally  diluted  vehicle  and  concentrations  of  paclitaxel  &lt;0.3  mg/ml  were  compatible  with  human whole blood. Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment The predicted environmental concentrations of paclitaxel are below 1 ppb and it was concluded that there is no environmental risk from the use, storage and disposal of paclitaxel from Paxene.

## 4. Clinical aspects

One  phase  II  trial  has  been  conducted  in  AIDS-KS  recruiting  a  total  of  107  patients  (all  received paclitaxel). In addition safety data are available for a further 436 patients from applicant sponsored Phase I, II, III studies of Paxene in ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The clinical trials were performed according to GCP standards and agreed ethical principles.

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Paclitaxel  is  a  tubulin  active  anticancer  medicinal  product  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  antitumoural activity. Apart from this, additional dynamic properties make the substance interesting in the treatment of  KS.  KS  has  been  described  as  a  model  for  a  growth  factor  driven  tumour,  characterised  by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prominent  neo-angiogenesis.  A  human  herpes  virus  (HHV-8)  has  also  been  implicated  in  the pathogenesis  of  KS.  Paclitaxel  has  been  reported  to  exert  direct,  i.e.,  effects  not  mediated  by cytotoxicity, anti-angiogenic properties and may also give rise to phosphorylation of HHV-8 induced bcl-2 with consequent tumour cell apoptosis.

## Dose finding studies

No dose-finding studies with Paxene have been conducted.

## Pharmacokinetics

The studies that have been performed are summarised in Table 1.

The  pharmacokinetic  fate  of paclitaxel is  concentration-dependent.  In  AIDS-KS  patients,  the pharmacokinetics of Paxene are non-linear at doses ≥ 100 mg/m 2 .

Based on in vitro studies the degree of plasma protein binding of paclitaxel has been reported to range from  88%  to  98%  and  paclitaxel  is  stated  to  be  predominantly  bound  to  albumin  and α 1-acid glycoprotein. In spite of this high protein binding, paclitaxel is widely distributed to tissues.

Following an intravenous dose of 100 mg/m² given as a 3-hour infusion to 19 patients with AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma, the maximum concentrations ranged from 761 to 2860 ng/ml (mean 1,530) and average area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was 5619 ng hr/ml (range 2,609- 9,428).  Clearance was 20.6 l/h/m 2 (range 11-38) and the volume of distribution was 291 l/m 2 (range 121-638). The terminal elimination half-life averaged 23.7 hours (range 12 - 33).

Renal excretion plays a minor part in the total elimination of paclitaxel, less than 10% of the dose has been  reported  to  be  excreted  as  unchanged  drug.  The  major  elimination  pathway  is  metabolism

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

followed by biliary excretion: in six patients 39% to 87% of an intravenous dose (175 mg/m²) was excreted  in  faeces  and,  on  average,  only  10%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  as  unchanged  paclitaxel. Several  metabolites  have  been  detected  but  only  three  of  these  metabolites  have  been  identified: 6 α -hydroxy-paclitaxel, 3'p-hydroxy-paclitaxel and 6 α , 3'p-dihydroxy-paclitaxel. 6 α -hydroxypaclitaxel is the major component excreted in faeces.

In vitro studies have shown that CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are involved in the formation of 6 α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'-p-dihydroxy-paclitaxel, respectively.

The antitumour activity of paclitaxel metabolites has not been exhaustively investigated. Although the levels  of  these  metabolites  are  lower  than  for  paclitaxel,  the  extent  of  protein  binding  is  unknown. Theoretically the metabolites could contribute to the antitumour activity. However, the effect is likely to be less than for the parent compound.

## Special populations

No controlled studies have been presented which investigate the effects of impaired organ function, age, gender or race. This information is included in section 4.2 of the SPC.

Safety  and  efficacy  in  children  have  not  been  established  and  Paxene  is  not  recommended  for paediatric use.

## Interaction studies

No formal interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  It  is  not  considered  feasible  to  conduct  formal drug  interaction  studies  in  AIDS-KS  patients  given  the  numerous  concomitant  medications  and  the inability to change or discontinue anti-HIV therapy in such patients.

Since paclitaxel is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C8, caution should be exercised with other  medicinal  products  known  to  inhibit  or  induce  these  enzymes,  as  they  may  affect  the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. In addition, as microsomal levels of CYP C8 have been reported to vary appreciably in human livers, there may be consequences for the disposition of paclitaxel.

Studies conducted in AIDS-KS patients, who were taking multiple concomitant medications, suggest that  the  systemic  clearance  of  paclitaxel  was  significantly  lower  in  the  presence  of  nelfinavir  and ritonavir.  Consequently,  Paxene  should  be  administered  with  caution  in  patients  receiving  these protease inhibitors (PI's).

The  use  of  the  PI  indinavir  did  not  alter  tumour  response  rates  in  AIDS-KS  patients  nor  did  it significantly alter paclitaxel pharmacokinetics.

Neutropenia seems to be related to the duration of time that plasma concentrations remain at or above a  threshold  concentration  (0.05  and  0.1 µ mol/l)  rather  than  directly  to  AUC  or  C max .    Neuropathy, musculoskeletal toxicity, mucositis and leucopenia have also been related to paclitaxel pharmacokinetics.  The relationships are not so clear as for neutropenia but these toxic effects seem to be related to total systemic exposure.

## Clinical experience

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Efficacy

## Dose-response studies

No dose-response study has been performed. With respect to the issue of whether a lower dose may be appropriate,  the  pivotal  trial  permitted  a  dose  reduction  to  75  mg/m²  for  patients  with  severe neutropenia and severe neuropathy and it is encouraging that only 12% of patients required this. Four of  these  patients  had  a  response  recorded  prior  to  dose  reduction  and  four  after  the  dose  reduction. Also in view of the response rate in the core population (57%) it is likely that the schedule proposed for  licensing  is  expedient  in  this  population.  It  is  not  considered  feasible  to  conduct  a  randomised, controlled clinical trial in patients who have failed liposomal anthracycline treatment comparing the 100 mg/m² and 75 mg/m² dose. Since 1996, the incidence of AIDS-KS is rapidly decreasing in Europe and North America. A study to demonstrate equivalent efficacy would require over 300 patients in each treatment arm and would currently be impossible to complete in a reasonable timeframe. A study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

designed to show lower efficacy at the 75 mg/m² dose might not be ethical considering the outstanding anticancer activity and tolerability shown with the 100 mg/m² dose.

## Main study

The efficacy and safety of Paxene were investigated in a single, non-comparative study (IX-110-081) in 107 patients with advanced KS, previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. Patients were given a 3-hour infusion of Paxene 100 mg/m² administered every 14 days for at least 2 cycles. The mean age of patients in this study was 38 years and all of the patients were male. Of the 107 patients, 63 patients were  considered  resistant  to  liposomal  anthracyclines,  defined  as  having  progressive  disease  on  a liposomal anthracycline. As liposomal anthracyclines are the only products currently approved for the treatment of advanced AIDS-KS this subgroup of patients is considered to constitute the core efficacy population.  The  primary  endpoint  was  best  tumour  response  according  to  modified  ACTG  criteria (Krown SE, Metroka C, Wernz JC. Kaposi's Sarcoma in the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome: a  Proposal  for  Uniform  Evaluation,  Response  and  Staging  Criteria.  J  Clin  Oncol  1989;1201-7). Tumour response is considered to be a relevant efficacy measure in the assessment of clinical benefit in patients with KS.

The evaluability of efficacy depends to a large extent on whether the use of effective antiretroviral therapy  is  regarded  as  a  confounding  factor.  Because  the  possibility  exists  for  a  pharmacodynamic interaction between contemporaneously introduced, effective antiretroviral therapy and 'specific' antiKS  treatment,  it  should  be  considered  that  Paxene  efficacy  is  evaluable  only  in  patients  on  stable 'long-term' antiretroviral therapy prior to and during Paxene treatment.

There were no differences in demographic characteristics between the total population and the subset resistant to liposomal anthracycline-therapy. All of the patients were adult males with a mean age of 38.0 + 6.6 years. About half of all patients where white and one-third were white-Hispanic.

All  patients  had  advanced  AIDS-KS:  81.3%  had ≥ 25  mucocutaneous  lesions,  35.5%  had  visceral involvement  and  52.3%  had  symptomatic  lymphoedema.  The  Karnofsky  performance  status  was ≥ 60 for  all  patients  as  this  was  an  entry  criterion.  Most  patients  were  poor  risk  based  on  tumour burden,  immune  status  and  systemic  involvement  based  on  the  ACTG  recommended  staging classification.

## Results study IX-110-081

59% of core patients and 53% of all patients completed more than 10 cycles. The overall success rate (complete  or  partial  response)  after  15  cycles  of  treatment  was  57%  (CI  44-70%)  in  liposomal anthracycline-resistant patients and 56% in the total population (see Table 3).

a: Independent reviewer assessment.

b: Success is defined as complete response or partial response.

More  than  half  of  the  responses  were  apparent  after  the  first  three  cycles  of  treatment  with  no important differences between the total population and the core subset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While spontaneous regressions have occurred in patients with classic KS, this is unlikely to occur in AIDS-KS,  which  is  a  more  aggressive  form  of  the  disease.  In  addition  it  is  unlikely  that  patients having failed one or more previous chemotherapeutic regimens would respond spontaneously in the percentage seen in this study (57% of the core patients).

Further  subset  analyses  showed  consistency  of  response  in  core  patients  regardless  of  initial  TIS staging, number of previous chemotherapies and previous or concommittant PI use.

In liposomal anthracycline-resistant patients, the response rates were comparable for patients who had never  received  a  PI  (55.6%)  and  those  who  received  one  at  least  2  months  prior  to  treatment  with Paxene (60.9%). Patients who started PI's within 2 months of treatment with Paxene or within the first 10 cycles had a lower response rate (48.1%), but 3 of the 13 patients who responded did so prior to the initiation of PI's. Of the four patients who commenced PI's after cycle 10, all 4 had responded prior to this cycle. In summary, 12 of 36 responses occurred prior to the introduction of PI's or in patients who did not receive PI's.

When all 107 patients are considered, the response rate is lower (32%) in those who did not receive PI's compared to those who started at least two months before the study (58.1%) or those who started PI's during the study (58.5%). In this group, 24 of 60 responses occurred prior to the introduction of PI's or without PI treatment.

The applicant reports that there was an obvious temporal relationship between the onset of response and  initiation  of  Paxene  therapy  in  the  core  patient  group  (p=0.0002)  and  all  patients  (p&lt;0.0001). Responses generally occurred within four cycles of initiation of Paxene (median 48.5 days). In  addition,  an  analysis  of  time-to-event  and  survival  by  PI  use  has  been  provided.  Among  core patients, there was no association between time to response and time to disease progression, treatment failure and survival time and the use of a PI. Among all patients, there was a trend for survival to be longer in patients who received PI's and this is consistent with the published literature on PI's. Thus in both the core group and all patients, it is likely that the response can be attributed to Paxene as responses occurred prior to the introduction of PI's and in patients who did not receive PIs. CD4  counts  at  baseline  were  collected  as  part  of  the  study  protocol.  Data  were  available  for  102 patients in the all patients population and 60 patients in the core efficacy population. In this subset of the  core  efficacy  population,  32  patients  (53.3%)  had  a  CD 4 count  of  0-50  cells/mm³,  20  patients (33.3%) had a CD4  count of 50-200 cells/mm³ and 8 patients (13.3%) had a CD4  count &gt;200 cells/mm³. Table 4 reports the response rate for patients with baseline CD4 count of 0-50 versus ≥ 100 cells/mm³, for patients with data available falling into either category. These data indicate that even patients with a CD4 count less than 50 had a significant response rate. Table 4: Best response by CD4 baseline count Population CD4 Total no. of Success (CR or Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of PI use on CD4 counts was compared in 13 patients who received PI's inhibitors and 13 who did not. While individual CD4 counts increased in some patients treated with PI's, this was not consistently the case.

The median time to progression in the core population is 468 days (95% CI 257-NE). Median survival for Paxene could not be computed, but the lower 95% bound was 617 days in core patients. This is consistent with the view that Paxene does not have negative effects on survival. It is not considered

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

feasible to conduct a study to investigate the effects of Paxene on survival as there is no comparative agent for multi-resistant patients who have failed liposomal anthracyclines. Historical controls cannot be used, because of the changing nature of both AIDS and AIDS-KS.

The total Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) score in the core efficacy population decreased significantly during treatment (p ≤ 0.001) and mirrored the improvements seen in tumour response. Compared with baseline, there was a significant improvement in the Karnofsky Performance Score.

## Safety

## Patient exposure

In the main study 107 patients have been enrolled and administered a total of 1,474 courses of Paxene, thereof 57 patients were administered &gt;10 courses. Dosage reductions to 75 mg/m² were recorded in 13 patients. Delays in treatment due to toxicity occurred with 43 (5.4%) of the first 10 cycles and 38 (5.8%) of subsequent cycles. G-CSF was used by close to 50% of the patients during the first cycle, and use ranged between 60 and 70% during cycles 2 to 10, increasing to &gt;80% after cycle 10. There was concern that the  use  of  filgrastim  in  HIV-positive  patients  would  result  in  an  increase  in  viral replication,  as  this  has  been  reported  for  GM-CSF.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  studies  in  the published  literature which  indicate  that filgrastim is safe and  effective in  preventing  severe neutropenia in patients with advanced HIV infection, and is not associated with an increase in viral replication.

Adverse events, including serious adverse events Altogether 34 patients died, thereof 15 during the study or within 30 days of dosing. The investigator as being due to Paxene reported only one of the deaths during therapy. There are indications that in at least 7 patients Paxene therapy might have contributed to a shortened survival. A total of 387 adverse events were judged severe (CTC grade 3 or greater in severity) in all patients. Generally  speaking,  the  frequency  and  distribution  of  severe  adverse  effects  reported  in  the  core population was similar to that of the group as a whole. Of the 226 severe adverse events reported in the  subset  of  patients,  54  were  life-threatening.  The  most  common  related  adverse  event  was neutropenia, which was severe in 65 cases. Severe alopecia was seen in 11 cases. Other severe adverse events  considered  related  to  Paxene  were  thrombocytopenia  (9  cases),  sepsis  (3  cases),  diarrhoea (4 cases) and neuropathy (2 cases). An overview of observed adverse events is presented in Table 5.

Although the data are limited, an analysis of adverse events by PI use did not show any significant differences  in  the  incidence  of  all  grades  of  events  or  severe  events.  Certain  PIs  (ritonavir  and nelfinavir) interfere with the clearance of paclitaxel and so may enhance the toxicity. A reduction in the dosage of Paxene may be required, as indicated in the SPC.

## Haematological toxicity

Haemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, leukocyte and neutrophil counts all declined during the study and in the majority of cases these changes were related to Paxene administration. However, there was no downward trend in the values with additional dosing during the study.

Filgrastim was required by 85% of patients by cycle 15 to minimise neutropenia.

The efficacy of Paxene in AIDS-KS patients who have failed to respond to liposomal anthracyclines has  been  demonstrated  in  terms  of  tumour  response,  time-to-event  data  and  clinical  benefits. Notwithstanding differences in the clinical trials, the tumour response rate associated with Paxene is superior  to  that  reported  for  Caelyx  (Stewart  S,  Jablonowski  H,  Goebel  FD,  et  al.  Randomized comparative  trial  of  pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin  versus  bleomycin  in  the  treatment  of  AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma.

5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment Quality The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence of the potential efficacy of this product in the proposed indication. The data with regard to the pharmacokinetics are satisfactory. Overall the toxicology programme revealed that paclitaxel is mutagenic in vivo , but it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied. Paclitaxel at low doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day produced low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats. Animal studies showed apparently non-reversible, adverse effects of paclitaxel on  the  male  reproductive  organs  at  clinically  relevant  exposure  levels.  This  information  has  been included in the SPC. Efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Safety

The  safety  profile  of  Paxene  for  the  treatment  of  AIDS-KS  was  considered  difficult  to  assess particularly  in  the  absence  of  comparative  data.  Myelosuppression  is  the  major  dose-limiting undesirable effect of paclitaxel and this is usually manifest as neutropenia. Paxene was associated with 65% incidence of severe neutropenia and a 14% incidence of neutropenic fever. There is an increased risk  of  infections  in  patients  treated  with  Paxene,  and  infections  related  to  Paxene  may  have contributed to three of 15 deaths that occurred on study. Filgrastim (G-CSF) was used by more than 50% of patients in any cycle. Notwithstanding the difficulties in comparing studies, the incidence of severe  neutropenia  appears  to  be  higher  in  Paxene-treated  patients  than  that  reported  for  Caelyx, DaunoXome and ABV (doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  support  of  Paxene,  few  patients  (6/107)  discontinued  the  study  due  to  Paxene-related  adverse events,  only  4%  of  cycles  were  delayed  because  of  neutropenia,  only  12%  of  patients  required  a reduction in the dose due to toxicity, and &gt;55% of patients continued on maintenance therapy.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Based on the available data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus the benefit/risk  profile  of  Paxene  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  AIDS-related  Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) who have failed prior liposomal anthracycline therapy to be favourable.

## 6. Aditional indication:

## 1 Introduction

Paxene  (6mg/ml  concentration  for  solution  for  infusion)  contains  the  cytotoxic  active  substance paclitaxel, a naturally occurring product derived from the yew tree.

- -metastatic ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing combination therapy without taxanes.

Paxene  was  centrally  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  AIDS-related  Kaposi's  sarcoma  in patients who have failed prior liposomal anthracycline therapy in July 1999. Paxene is also marketed in  the  USA  under  the  name  Onxol  for  the  indications:  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  combination chemotherapy  for  metastatic  disease  or  relapse  within  6  months  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  and advanced ovarian cancer. Another paclitaxel, Taxol, is approved in several EU countries since 1993. The most effective single agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer are the taxanes and the anthracyclines. However, currently there is no established standard therapy. Paclitaxel is the first of the  taxanes.  It  is  integrated  in  combination  treatment  regimens  for  treatment  of  metastatic  breast cancer and combination therapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel is superior to single-agent therapy in terms  of  response.  However,  no  survival  advantage  has  been  observed.  As  it  has  not  been demonstrated  to  have  benefit  over  conventional  chemotherapy  for  advanced  breast  cancer  it  is therefore, indicated as 2 nd line for patients who have failed anthracycline therapy. Most  of  the  patients  diagnosed  with  ovarian  cancer  of  epithelial  origin  have  advanced  disease  at presentation. The  most  commonly  adopted  regimen  in  first-line chemotherapy  consists of a combination of a platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and an alkylating agent (usually cyclophosphamide).  Whatever  type  of  chemotherapy  is  chosen,  standard  treatment  usually  yields clinical objective response rates (complete and partial) of 60 to 70% and 5-year survival rates of 10 to 20%, with median survival of about 24 months in most studies. The MAH applied for 2 Type II variations for Paxene for the additional indications of: -2 nd line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed or are not candidates for  standard  anthracycline  -containing  therapy  i.e.  same  indication  as  the  one  approved  for Taxol. Medicinal product no longer authorised

These applications are intended to extend the pharmacotherapeutic repertoire in refractory metastatic breast and ovarian cancer to provide an alternative to marketed taxane preparations.

The application for the indication of metastatic breast cancer was initially based on a single clinical trial  conducted by the applicant: Phase III study in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer (Protocol  IX-107-081  Mettinger  et  al.  2000a).  In  this  trial  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Paxene  was determined  after  administration  of  175mg/m 2 via  3-hour  infusion  and  of  140mg/m 2 via  96-hour infusion, both repeated at 3-week intervals.

The application for the indication of metastatic ovarian cancer was initially based on a single clinical trial  conducted by the applicant: Phase III trial of 3-hour infusion of Paxene (Paclitaxel) in patients with refractory ovarian cancer with rescue to 96-hour infusions on failure of 3-hour infusion (Protocol IX-108-081 Mettinger et al. 2000b)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  response  to  the  CPMP  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  MAH  submitted  the  original clinical data of paclitaxel, with consent of BMS (Taxol), in support of the new indications. In order to demonstrate  the  scientific  relevance  of  these  data,  quality  issues  related  to  the  formulation  of paclitaxel had to be addressed.

## 2 Quality aspects

The  Taxol  formulation  was  developed  in  the  early  1980's  (50%  Cremophor  EL  (CrEL)  and  50% ethanol)  as  the  most  suitable  vehicle  for  I.V.  administration  of  the  product  to  humans.  A  purified version  of  CrEL  (CrEL-P)  was  introduced  into  the  formulation  in  the  early  1990's  to  increase  the chemical  stability  of  the  product  (a  loss  of  potency  of  &gt;  60%  after  12  weeks  storage  at  50 ° C  was discovered when the commercial CrEL was used). The Paxene formulation was developed based on the  published  information  on  Taxol  (i.e.  a  50:50  mixture  of  CrEL  and  ethanol).  During  further optimization, it was found that the addition of 0.2 % citric acid (2 mg/ml) improved chemical stability properties. Without citric acid, a 10% decrease in paclitaxel was observed after storage at 40 ° C for 7 days. However, the formulation containing 0.02% citric acid showed only 0.07% degradation after the same storage condition (40 ° C for 7 days).

The information supplied by Norton Healthcare confirms that the two products have essentially the same quantitative and qualitative formulations in terms of active substance, and pharmaceutical forms (both  products  are  solutions  for  injection).  The  MAH  was  not  required  to  submit  a  bioequivalence study  as  the  product  is  to  be  administered  as  an  aqueous  IV  solution  containing  the  same  active substance in the same  concentration as the currently authorised product (Taxol).   However, Cremophors  (Polyoxyethylated  castor  oil)  are  prone  to  micelle  formation.  Therefore  the  possibility was raised that differences between the two formulations (purified Cremophor in Taxol as opposed to addition of citric acid in Paxene) might affect micellar formation in vivo thereby altering the kinetics which might have implications for safety assessment of the different products. Micelle formation is a property of surfactants and takes place when a surfactant, in aqueous solution, reaches its critical micelle concentration (CMC). The CMC is a unique character of surfactants, which can  be  determined  by  measuring  changes  in  various  physical  properties  such  as  surface  tension, conductivity,  light  scattering,  osmotic  pressure  and  the  solubility  of  a  water-insoluble  dye.  Surface tension and light scattering are commonly used to measure the CMC. These in vitro techniques were used in four studies to evaluate micelle formation of Paxene (containing Cremophor EL, ethanol and citric  acid)  and  Taxol  (containing  purified  Cremophor  EL  and  ethanol)  formulations  in  media simulating the physiological environment, including solutions recommended for the clinical administration of Paxene and Taxol. The studies also investigated the effect of citric acid on micelle formation. Comparative analysis of the CMC, molecular mass of micelles and particle size of micelles was carried out for Paxene and Taxol in saline solution and/or phosphate buffered solution (PBS: pH 7.4) and/or 5% glucose solution. The results for CMC are summarised in Table1. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 6.1: CMC of Paxene and Taxol in Different Media

| Media           | CMC(mg/ml)      | CMC(mg/ml)      |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|                 | Paxene          | Taxol           |
| Water           | 0.0307 ± 0.0014 | 0.0387 ± 0.0008 |
| Saline Solution | 0.0610 ± 0.0047 | 0.0654 ± 0.0032 |
| PBS (pH7.4)     | 0.0542 ± 0.0042 | 0.0528 ± 0.0013 |
| 5% Glucose      | 0.0550 ± 0.0006 | 0.0573 ± 0.0016 |

Molecular Mass of micelles formed in Paxene was determined as 322,000, in Taxol was 319,000 and placebos of Cr-EtOH with or without citric acid was 293,000 and 274,000 respectively.

Measurements of the particle size of micelles for Paxene and Taxol by DLS using a He-Ne Laser and QELS using a submicron particle sizer further supported the similarity of the two preparations.

Paxene is manufactured with a nitrogen headspace, so the CrEL in the product is exposed only to the nitrogen environment within the closed vial thereby minimising any possible oxidation. Oxidation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CrEL under the micro-nitrogen environment of the closed vial and at the storage condition specified for Paxene is probably an extremely slow process, very unlikely in these circumstances and therefore micelle formation of CrEL will be unaffected during the specified shelf life of Paxene .

## 3. Clinical aspects

The variation was initially submitted based on the clinical trials described in sections 3.2 and 3.3. As a response to the CPMP objections the MAH provided original data on Taxol to support its claim for the new  indication.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  demonstrate  how  Paxene  is  related  to  Taxol.  This  was regarded  as  crucial  because  the  efficacy  data  from  Paxene  clinical  trials  alone,  were  inadequate  to support authorisation of Paxene in the new indications.

## 3.1. Pharmacokinetics

## In Vitro Binding Study in Human Plasma by Equilibrium Dialysis

The non-linear plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients has been well documented. However, the  exact  mechanism  remains  to  be  elucidated.  Previous  theories  suggested  that  non-linearity  was based  on  saturable  distribution  and  elimination  kinetics.  A  more  recenthypothesis  proposed  that entrapment of paclitaxel in plasma by CrEL, probably in micelles, may contribute to the apparent nonlinear plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Technology for direct measurement of micelle formation in vivo is currently not available. An in vitro plasma equilibrium dialysis model (a two-compartment equilibrium dialysis system) was established to assess the influence of CrEL/CrEL-P on the plasma binding  of  paclitaxel  from  an  infusion  solution.  According  to  this  model,  the  fraction  of  unbound paclitaxel  can  be  estimated  by  determination  of  the  ratio  of  the  paclitaxel  concentration  in  a compartment containing buffer and the concentration in another compartment containing plasma. This model was used to investigate the effect of CrEL, CrEL-P, and citric acid on the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in human plasma. The data show that the presence of citric acid has no significant additional effect on the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in the CrEL-P-containing vehicle tested. The fraction of unbound paclitaxel from Taxol  (CrEL-P/ethanol)  and  Paxene  (CrEL/citric  acid/ethanol)  formulations  were  not  significantly different (7.12% and 7.54% respectively).

The  MAH  provided  pharmacokinetic  studies  together  with  an  addendum  to  the  Expert  Report summarising all relevant PK data to provide assurance that the kinetic characteristics are similar .

A total of six pharmacokinetic studies (TAX-1/92, TAX-2/92, IX-100-081, IX-107&amp;108-081, IX-110081  and  IX-103-137)  were  carried  out  with  Paxene.  The  full  study  reports  were  provided  in  the original marketing authorisation application in 1997 and responses to the CPMP List of Questions in 1998. The six studies involved 97 patients (48 males and 49 females) with non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, metastatic cancer and AIDS-KS.

The results of the key pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in plasma from these studies are summarised in Table 3. Comparative analysis of these (Cmax,, Cmax,, AUClast, AUCN, CL and Vss) was performed

with  published  Taxol  data  over  a  wide  dose  range.  Cmax  and  AUC  data  were  normalised  to  a  100 mg/m 2 dose  (Cmax,N and AUCN).

The  primary  endpoint  in  both  segments  was  time  to  progression  (TTP)  defined  as  the  time  from randomisation  to  documented  disease  progression  or  to  time  of  a  non-cancer  death.  The  secondary endpoints  were  the  best  responses  to  therapy:  Complete  response  rate  (CR),  Overall  survival  and improvement in Quality of Life (QoL) as reported on the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) analyzed on a scoring system. (Overall survival was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause. The  best  response  was  categorized  as  success  if  the  patient  had  either  a  PR/CR  to  treatment.) Radiological responses were reviewed and verified by an external panel of independent radiologists.

A: no SD available in the publication and therefore not included in the analysis. Data from a second independent comparative analysis based on five published PK studies for Taxol and three for Paxene at comparable dose levels (100-, 135-, 175- or 200 mg/m 2 by 3-hour infusion) suggest that the non-linearity of paclitaxel PK previously noted for Taxol is also observed for Paxene following a 3-hour infusion. 3.2. Clinical trials submitted in support of the indication of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) One  pivotal  study  conducted  with  Paxene  in  patients  with  advanced breast  cancer was  initially submitted:a  Phase  III  trial  of  3-hour  vs.  96-hour  infusions  of  Paxene  (Paclitaxel)  in  patients  with refractory metastatic breast cancer and an assessment of 96-hour infusions in 3-hour failures (Protocol IX-107-081). The trial was designed to compare 3-hour and 96-hour infusions of Paxene in women with metastatic breast cancer, who had failed to respond to at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, one of which had been given for metastatic disease. The dose for the 96-hour infusion regimen, 140 mg/m 2 ,  was  based  on  a  paper  published  by  Wilson  et  al 1 while  in  the  control  arm  Paxene  was administered at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 , i.e. the licensed dose of Taxol. The cycle length was 3 weeks for both regimens. Segment II (Rescue Therapy) was a phase II study with a built in stopping rule. If at least 1 CR/PR was seen in the first 14 patients receiving rescue therapy then patients showing rapid progression on 3hour infusion would be crossed over to 96-hour. If none of the first 14 patients responded then rescue would be discontinued. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Results

## Primary endpoint -Time to Disease Progression (TTP)

The median times to disease progression were comparable in the two treatment groups 11.14 weeks (3-hour) vs. 12.71 weeks  (96-hour)  (P=0.3109).

Secondary endpoints - best responses to therapy (PR/CR/stable disease):

The tumour response rates were not statistically different 18.5% (3-hour infusion) and 25.2% (96 hour infusion) by Fisher's Exact Test (P=0.1670). The CR rate was 4.7% (8) in the 3-hour and 5%  (7) in the  96-hour  arm.  In  patients  with  measurable  disease  the  response  rates  were  20.9%  and  28% respectively. Another 36.4% and 30.2% of patients had stable disease on Paxene.

## Best Tumour Response by Treatment Group (Number (%))

| Treatment Group                           | Complete/Partial                     | Stable                           | Disease Progression              |   P value ITT |

The best response to Paxene was examined by the most recent prior chemotherapy and the highest category of chemotherapy. The lowest response to Paxene was seen in patients previously treated with anthracyclines.  The  response  to  Paxene  was  higher  in  the  96-hour  treatment  group  than  the  3-hour group when previous therapy was another chemotherapeutic agent.

## Overall Survival

Median survival times were comparable in the two treatment groups at 39.7 weeks (3-hour) and 34.7 weeks  (96-hour) infusions (P=0.7128).

## Other Time to event parameters

Time to Response-the median times to response was comparable in the two treatment groups at 6.8 weeks (3-hour) and 9.0 weeks  (96-hour) infusion groups respectively.

Duration of Response -the median durations of response was comparable in the two treatment groups at 19.6 4 weeks (3-hour) and 22.0 weeks (96-hour) infusions.

Quality  of  Life as  measured  by  SDS  scores  improved  significantly  in  both  arms  (P&lt;0.05)  and  the improvement tended to be greater in patients randomised to 96-hour infusions in the total population as well as in patients with bone lesions. Improvement of the combined score for pain, nausea, appetite and fatigue was more consistently observed with 96-hr infusion.

Segment II (Rescue Study) 32/41 (78%) progressed into segment II.

Best Tumour Response-a partial response to Paxene was seen in 17.1% (7/41) of patients (95% CI: 7.2-32.1%). Stable disease was present in 3/41 7.3%. The median time to progression was 49 days (42-88ds). The median survival was 162 days. The median time to response was 64 days. The median duration of response was 103 days. The study was considered too small for further analysis.

Currently, the following dosage is recommended for metastatic breast cancer: 175mg/m2 via 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Clinical trials have investigated the administration of paclitaxel every 3 weeks

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at varying doses (135-250mg/m2) and schedules (1-3-24- and 96 hour infusions). The 3-hour schedule produced a lower incidence of myelosuppression but more frequent and severe peripheral neuropathy. Prolonged infusion of paclitaxel increase cytotoxicity, and therefore response rates and decreases hypersensitivity reactions.

## 3.3. Clinical trials submitted in support of the indication Metastatic Ovarian Cancer (MOC)

A single, non-randomised pivotal study conducted by the Applicant with Paxene in patients with MOC was  initially  submitted:  a  Phase  III  trial  of  3-hour  infusion  of  Paxene  (Paclitaxel)  in  patients  with refractory ovarian cancer with rescue to 96-hour infusions on failure of 3-hour infusion (Protocol IX108-081).

Patients with ovarian carcinoma who had failed at least one, but not more than two platinum based chemotherapy regimens were eligible for this study.  In segment 1 of the study, all patients received Paxene at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks (licensed posology for Taxol for this indication).  Patients with progressive disease within 4 cycles on this regimen were eligible for segment 2 and treatment with Paxene 140 mg/m 2 infused over 96 hours every 3 weeks. Altogether 120 patients were enrolled, the median age was 62 years and 76% of the patients were previously treated with carboplatin (cisplatin 42%).

One pivotal study conducted with Paxene was submitted for each of the claimed indications.  These studies did not meet the requirements of the CPMP PtC on Applications with One Pivotal study for phase  III  documentation  of  efficacy  in  the  claimed  indication  nor  were  they  comparator  studies  as recommended (CPMP/EWP/205/95 Note for Guidance evaluation of anti cancer medicinal products). No  randomised,  comparative  study  has  been  submitted  to  support  the  licensing  of  Paxene  for  the treatment  of  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  ovary  after  failure  of  platinum-containing  combination therapy without taxanes. This was not considered acceptable, as there are licensed products available (e.g., topotecan).

Discussion Medicinal product no longer authorised

Another paclitaxel, Taxol is currently licensed for the treatment  of  metastatic  breast cancer and for first-line  therapy  and  second-line  treatment  of  patients  with  ovarian  cancer  failing  cisplatin-based therapy. In response to the objections of the CPMP the MAH submitted additional original clinical data on paclitaxel from the MAH of Taxol, BMS. The Applicant demonstrated that the two products have essentially the same quantitative and qualitative formulations in terms of active substance, and pharmaceutical  forms.  However,  differences  in  formulation  between  Taxol  and  Paxene  were  noted which put in question whether clinical trial results using the Taxol formulation could be extrapolated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and applied to Paxene. The Applciant subsequently   convincingly demonstrated that the difference in formulation (addition of citric acid) between the two products does not affect micelle formation in vivo therefore the submitted clinical data on Taxol can be considered scientifically relevant to support the claimed  new  indications  for  Paxene,  and  to  provide  the  necessary  assurances  regarding  safety  and efficacy.

The submitted data on micelle formation clearly demonstrate that:

- -The critical micelle concentration is similar for the Paxene and Taxol formulations.
- -The  micelles  formed  from  Paxene  and  Taxol  in  the  stated  physiological  media  are  of comparable size and molar mass.
- -The use of CrEL and citric acid in the Paxene formulation has no significant effect on micellar structure relative to the Taxol formulation.

The studies using in vitro techniques demonstrated equivalence of micelles formed from Paxene and Taxol formulations in physiological solutions or solutions recommended for clinical administration of paclitaxel injections.

The MAH provided data from six pharmacokinetic studies conducted with Taxol and Paxene in the clinically  relevant  dose  range  involving  97  patients  (48  male,  49  female)  with  cancer.  Comparative analysis of key pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Cmax, AUClast, AUCN, CL and Vss) was performed with  published Taxol  data  over  a  wide  dose  range  (75-210mg/m 2) and  provides  good  evidence  that there is no difference in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics, which are non-linear at doses of 175 mg/ m 2 and above, following administration of Paxene and Taxol. This non-linearity, at clinically relevant dose range,  has  been shown to be due to the excipient CrEL. As CrEL forms micelles in  vivo ,  in  which paclitaxel is trapped, these micelles act as high affinity drug-transporting sites resulting in a decreased portion of free paclitaxel. Consequently the pharmacokinetic of CrEL is critical to the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Both the in vitro and PK data show that there is no evidence that citric acid and CrEL in the Paxene formulation have a significant effect on the in vitro or in vivo properties or kinetics of paclitaxel. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that the kinetics of both Paxene and Taxol follow a similar non-linear fashion.  The  important  characteristics  (Cmax  and  AUC) for  both are comparative  at the same  dose level.  The  corresponding  data  on  total  clearance  at  each  dose  level  also  show  similarity  between Paxene and Taxol. In  conclusion,  the  comparative  PK  analysis  indicates  the  plasma  PK  profile  of  paclitaxel  following administration of Paxene is identical to that observed following administration of Taxol. This suggests that  the  excipients  present  in  these  formulations  modulate  the  systemic  clearance  of  paclitaxel  in patients with cancer to a similar extent. This is in agreement with the evidence of similarity of micelle formation demonstrated for Paxene and Taxol in the in vitro studies, therefore it is now demonstrated that micellar formation is unaffected by the presence of citric acid in Paxene. Oxidation is unlikely to occur  under  the  conditions  present  in  Paxene  vials.  Therefore  the  equivalence  of  both  Paxene  and Taxol formulations is demonstrated. It is scientifically valid to use Taxol clinical data to support the new indications for Paxene. Medicinal product no longer authorised

On the basis of the original Taxol data submitted, paclitaxel at 175 mg/m² in both studies produced higher response rates (29% vs, 22% of mitomycin, p = 0.11 in study 048; 17% vs. 6%, p = 0.14) in study 047. Paclitaxel, given at 175 mg/m², was able to significantly delay tumour progression in both trials (medians of 4.2 vs. 3.0 months, p = 0.027 in study 048; 3.5 vs. 1.6 months, p = 0.026 in study 047). Resistance to prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and also resistance to mitomycin did not adversely influence time to progression.

Results of a pivotal, prospectively randomized trial (CA139-022 or GOG-111) which compared Taxol and  cisplatin  in  combination  versus  the  standard  regimen  of  cyclophosphamide  and  cisplatin  in combination  in  410  patients  with  previously  untreated,  suboptimally  debulked  FIGO  stage  III  and FIGO stage IV patients with carcinoma of the ovary, supported the claimed indication in MOC. In addition, the published results of 20 other non-randomized trials, involving a total of 498 patients were

presented in a separate report. In these trials paclitaxel was administered as a single agent or, in most cases, in combination, with other drugs (always including a platinum compound).

In addition, Onxol (identical to Paxene) has been in clinical use in the USA since October 2000 in the claimed indications.

Therapy with paclitaxel was well tolerated by the majority of patients. The most common and most important haematological side effects of Paclitaxel were leucopenia and neutropenia. A single case of significant hypersensitivity reaction to Paclitaxel, resulting in treatment discontinuation, occurred in the pivotal studies. The most common and most important non-haematological side effect of Paclitaxel was  peripheral  neuropathy.  Arthralgia  and  myalgia  were  also  frequently  seen  in  patients  receiving paclitaxel.  Gastrointestinal  side  effects  (emesis,  diarrhoea  and  mucositis)  were  very  rarely  severe. Abnormalities  of  liver  and  renal  function  were  unusual  and  rarely  severe.  Alopecia  was  almost universal.

The recommended posology of Paxene in metastatic breast and ovarian cancer is 175mg/m2 via 3hour infusion every 3 weeks.

Furthermore,  it  was  discussed  at  the  CPMP  that  another  treatment  approach  in  MOC  would  be  to combine Taxol with a platinum drug in first line therapy. Whilst within the European Union the most common first line regimen is a platinum-based combination with paclitaxel there is still a role for nonpaclitraxel  containing  regimens.  The  lack  of  preclinical  and  clinical  cross-resistence  between  Taxol and  platinum  drugs  makes  the  use  of  the  compound  feasible  and  appealing  in  previously  untreated patients. 3. 5. Overall conclusion and benefit / risk assessment All the evidence of the in vitro studies on Paxene and Taxol including the in vitro binding study in human plasma demonstrate that the difference in formulation between the two products does not affect micelle formation/behaviour in vitro/in vivo .  Clinical data provided on paclitaxel (both from Paxene and Taxol) support the new indications. Therefore, the benefit/ risk of paclitaxel in the indications: -in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed or are not candidates for standard anthracycline therapy. -in the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing combination therapy without taxanes. is favourable.
