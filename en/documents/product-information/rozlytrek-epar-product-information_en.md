## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase ( NTRK ) gene fusion

Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients older than 1 month with solid tumours that have a NTRK gene fusion,

- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and
- who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor
- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## ROS1 gene fusion

Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1 -positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Rozlytrek should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.

## Patient selection

## NTRK gene fusion

A validated assay is required for the selection of patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours. NTRK gene fusion-positive status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy (see section 5.1).

## ROS1 gene fusion

A validated assay is required for the selection of adult patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC. ROS1 -positive status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy (see section 5.1).

## Posology

Rozlytrek is available as hard capsules or film-coated granules.

The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form according to the dose required and patient needs.

- Whole capsules are recommended for patients who can swallow whole capsules and where the required dose is 100 mg or a multiple of 100 mg. Patients who have difficulty or are unable to swallow capsules or who require enteral administration (e.g., gastric or nasogastric) may receive treatment with Rozlytrek capsules administered as an oral suspension. Refer to the Method of administration section below and section 6.6.
- Rozlytrek film-coated granules are recommended for paediatric patients who have difficulty, or are unable, to swallow capsules but can swallow soft food and where the required dose is 50 mg or a multiple of 50 mg. Film-coated granules should be sprinkled on soft food. Refer to the Rozlytrek film-coated granules SmPC for prescribing information.

## Adults

The recommended dose for adults is 600 mg entrectinib once daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population &gt; 6 months of age

The recommended dose for paediatric patients &gt; 6 months of age is based on body surface area (BSA) (see Table 1). Patients who have difficulty or are unable to swallow capsules but can swallow soft food, may receive treatment with Rozlytrek film-coated granules. Refer to the Rozlytrek film-coated granules SmPC for prescribing information.

Table 1: Recommended dosing for paediatric patients &gt; 6 months

| Body surface area (BSA) *   | Once daily dose   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| ≤ 0.42m 2                   | 250 mg/m 2**      |
| 0.43 m 2 to 0.50m 2         | 100 mg            |
| 0.51 m 2 to 0.80 m 2        | 200 mg            |
| 0.81 m 2 to 1.10 m 2        | 300 mg            |
| 1.11 m 2 to 1.50m 2         | 400 mg            |
| ≥ 1.51m 2                   | 600 mg            |

*BSA categories and recommended dosing in Table 1 are based on closely matching exposures to a target dose of 300 mg/m 2

**To enable dosing increments of 10 mg, capsules prepared as an oral suspension may be used. Refer to the Method of Administration section below and section 6.6.

## Paediatric patients &gt; 1 month to ≤ 6 months of age

The recommended dose for paediatric patients &gt; 1 month to ≤ 6 months of age is 250 mg/m 2 BSA entrectinib once daily, using capsules prepared as an oral suspension.

Capsules administered as an oral suspension (oral or enteral use) enable dosing increments of 10 mg. The daily dose to be administered should be rounded to the nearest 10 mg increment as described in the Method of administration section below and section 6.6.

## Duration of treatment

It is recommended that patients are treated with Rozlytrek until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Delayed or missed doses

If a planned dose of Rozlytrek is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due within 12 hours.

For whole capsules, if vomiting occurs immediately after taking a dose of Rozlytrek, patients may repeat that dose.

For capsules administered as an oral suspension by individuals other than the healthcare professional (e.g., caregivers or parents) and partial or total vomiting/spitting occurs immediately after taking an administered dose, caregivers should consult the healthcare professional for the next steps.

## Dose modifications

Management of adverse reactions may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of treatment with Rozlytrek, in case of specified adverse reactions (see Table 3) or based on the prescriber's assessment of the patient's safety or tolerability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adults

For adults, the dose of Rozlytrek may be reduced up to 2 times, based on tolerability (see Table 2). Rozlytrek treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate a dose of 200 mg once daily.

## Paediatric population

For paediatric patients older than 1 month, the dose of Rozlytrek may be reduced up to 2 times, based on tolerability (see Table 2).

## Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors

The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors in adult and paediatric patients older than 1 month should be avoided (see section 4.4).

For adults, if co-administration is unavoidable, the use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with Rozlytrek should be limited to 14 days and the Rozlytrek dose should be reduced as follows:

- 100 mg once daily for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5)
- 200 mg once daily for use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

After discontinuation of the concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the Rozlytrek dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor can be resumed. A wash-out period may be required for CYP3A4 inhibitors with a long half-life (see section 4.5).

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored for hepatic function and adverse reactions (see Table 3).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Entrectinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of entrectinib in paediatric patients 1 month of age and younger have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

Rozlytrek is for oral use or enteral use (e.g., gastric or nasogastric).

Rozlytrek can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2) but should not be taken with grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or Seville oranges (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The hard capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not crush or chew the capsules.

## Capsules administered as an oral suspension

For details on preparation of capsules as an oral suspension, see section 6.6.

Rozlytrek should be taken immediately after preparation as an oral suspension. Discard the suspension if not used within 2 hours (see section 6.4).

The patient should drink water after taking the oral suspension to ensure the medicinal product has been completely swallowed. If enteral (e.g., gastric or nasogastric) administration is required, administer the oral suspension via the tube. The tube should be flushed with water or milk after delivering Rozlytrek. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the enteral tube to administer the medicine, see section 6.6.

Detailed instructions on the administration of the capsules prepared as an oral suspension are given in the Instructions for Use (IFU) at the end of the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Efficacy across tumour types

The benefit of Rozlytrek has been established in single-arm trials encompassing a relatively small sample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of Rozlytrek have been shown based on overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour types. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant genomic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, Rozlytrek should only be used if there are no satisfactory treatment options (i.e., for which clinical benefit has not been established, or where such treatment options have been exhausted).

## Cognitive disorders

Cognitive disorders, including confusion, mental status changes, memory impairment, and hallucinations, were reported in clinical trials with Rozlytrek (see section 4.8). Patients over the age of 65 years experienced a higher incidence of these events than younger patients. Patients should be monitored for signs of cognitive changes.

Based on the severity of cognitive disorders, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

Patients should be counselled on the potential for cognitive changes with Rozlytrek treatment. Patients should be instructed not to drive or use machines until symptoms resolve if they experience cognitive disorders (see section 4.7).

## Fractures

Fractures have been reported in 29.7% (27/91) of paediatric patients treated with Rozlytrek in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Bone fractures mostly occurred in paediatric patients less than 12 years of age and were localised in the lower extremity (with a predilection for femur, tibia, foot, and fibula). In both adult and paediatric patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area. Fourteen paediatric patients had more than one occurrence of a fracture. Fractures resolved in the majority of paediatric patients (see section 4.8). Five paediatric patients had Rozlytrek treatment interrupted due to a fracture. Six paediatric patients discontinued treatment due to fractures.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with signs or symptoms of fractures (e.g., pain, abnormal gait, changes in mobility, deformity) should be evaluated promptly.

## Hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia has been observed in patients treated with entrectinib. Serum uric acid levels should be assessed prior to initiating Rozlytrek and periodically during treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Treatment with urate-lowering medicinal products should be initiated as clinically indicated and Rozlytrek withheld for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Rozlytrek dose should be modified based on severity as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

## Congestive heart failure

Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 5.4% of patients across clinical trials with Rozlytrek (see section 4.8). These reactions were observed in patients with or without a history of cardiac disease and resolved in 63.0% of those patients upon institution of appropriate clinical management and/or Rozlytrek dose reduction/interruption.

For patients with symptoms or known risk factors of CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be assessed prior to initiation of Rozlytrek treatment. Patients receiving Rozlytrek should be carefully monitored and those with clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath or oedema, should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate.

Based on the severity of CHF, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

## QTc interval prolongation

QTc interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with Rozlytrek in clinical trials (see section 4.8).

Use of Rozlytrek should be avoided in patients with a baseline QTc interval longer than 450 ms, in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, and in patients taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval.

Rozlytrek should be avoided in patients with electrolyte imbalances or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and bradyarrhythmias. If, in the opinion of the treating physician, the potential benefits of Rozlytrek in a patient with any of these conditions outweigh the potential risks, additional monitoring should be performed and a specialist consultation should be considered.

Assessment of ECG and electrolytes at baseline and after 1 month of treatment with Rozlytrek are recommended. Periodic monitoring of ECGs and electrolytes as clinically indicated throughout Rozlytrek treatment, are also recommended.

Based on the severity of QTc prolongation, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

## Women of childbearing potential

Rozlytrek may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception methods during treatment and up to 5 weeks after the last dose of Rozlytrek.

Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment with Rozlytrek and for 3 months after the last dose (see sections 4.6 and 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Drug interactions

Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases entrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions. Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor should be avoided. For adult patients if co-administration is unavoidable, the Rozlytrek dose should be reduced (see section 4.2).

During treatment with Rozlytrek, the consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, and Seville oranges should be avoided.

Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A or P-gp inducer decreases entrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which may reduce efficacy of Rozlytrek, and should be avoided.

## Lactose intolerance

Rozlytrek contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sunset yellow FCF (E110)

Rozlytrek 200 mg hard capsules contain sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effects of entrectinib on other medicinal products

## Effect of entrectinib on CYP substrates

Entrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of entrectinib 600 mg once daily with oral midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) in patients increased the midazolam AUC by 50% but reduced midazolam Cmax by 21%. Caution is advised when entrectinib is administered together with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cisapride, cyclosporin, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus), due to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions.

## Effect of entrectinib on P-gp substrates

In vitro data suggest that entrectinib has inhibitory potential towards P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

Co-administration of a single 600 mg dose of entrectinib with digoxin (a sensitive P-gp substrate) increased digoxin Cmax by 28% and AUC by 18%. The renal clearance of digoxin was similar between treatments of digoxin alone and digoxin co-administered with entrectinib, indicating minimal effect of entrectinib on renal clearance of digoxin.

The effect of entrectinib on digoxin absorption is not considered clinically relevant, but it is unknown whether the effect of entrectinib may be larger on more sensitive oral P-gp substrates such as dabigatran etexilate.

## Effect of entrectinib on BCRP substrates

## Inhibition of BCRP was observed in in vitro studies.

The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised when sensitive oral BCRP substrates (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan, lapatinib) are co-administered with entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of entrectinib on other transporter substrates

In vitro data indicate that entrectinib has weak inhibitory potential towards organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised when sensitive oral OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin repaglinide, bosentan) are co-administered with entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption.

## Effect of entrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes

In vitro studies indicate that entrectinib may induce pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C family and UGT). Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates (e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure.

## Oral contraceptives

It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives are advised to add a barrier method (see section 4.6).

## Effects of other medicinal products on entrectinib

Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme mediating the metabolism of entrectinib and formation of its major active metabolite M5.

## Effect of CYP3A or P-gp inducers on entrectinib

Co-administration of multiple oral doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single oral dose of entrectinib reduced entrectinib AUCinf by 77% and Cmax by 56%.

Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP3A/P-gp inducers (including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, St. John's Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ], apalutamide, ritonavir, dexamethasone) should be avoided.

If co-administration of Rozlytrek with dexamethasone cannot be avoided, dexamethasone dose recommendations should be determined by the healthcare professional.

## Effect of CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors on entrectinib

Co-administration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single oral dose of entrectinib increased AUCinf by 600% and Cmax by 173%. Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, a similar magnitude of the effect is expected in children as young as 2 years old.

Co-administration of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, grapefruit, or Seville oranges) should be avoided. If concurrent use of strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 is unavoidable, dose adjustment of entrectinib is required (see section 4.2).

Although, a marked effect of inhibitory P-gp medicinal products on entrectinib pharmacokinetics is not expected, caution is advised when treatment with strong or moderate P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) are co-administered with entrectinib due to risk of increased entrectinib exposure (see section 5.2).

## Effect of medicinal products that increase gastric pH on entrectinib

Co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), lansoprazole with a single 600 mg entrectinib dose reduced entrectinib AUC by 25% and Cmax by 23%.

No dose adjustments are required when entrectinib is co-administered with PPIs or other medicines that raise gastric pH (e.g., H2 receptor antagonists or antacids).

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females

Female patients of childbearing potential should have medically supervised pregnancy testing prior to initiating Rozlytrek therapy.

Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 5 weeks following the last dose of Rozlytrek.

It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method.

Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Rozlytrek (see section 5.3).

## Pregnancy

There are no available data from the use of entrectinib in pregnant women. Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, entrectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).

Rozlytrek is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

Female patients receiving Rozlytrek should be advised of the potential harm to the foetus. Female patients should be advised to contact the doctor, should pregnancy occur.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether entrectinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Rozlytrek.

## Fertility

No fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rozlytrek has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be instructed not to drive or use machines until the symptoms resolve, if they experience cognitive adverse reactions, syncope, blurred vision, or dizziness, during treatment with Rozlytrek (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea, dizziness, dysgeusia, oedema, increased weight, anaemia, increased blood creatinine, nausea, dysaesthesia, pain, vomiting, pyrexia, arthralgia, increased aspartate aminotransferase and dyspnoea, cognitive disorders, cough, and increased alanine aminotransferase. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were lung infection (5.3%), fractures (4.1%), dyspnoea (3.6%), cognitive impairment (2.9%), pleural

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effusion (2.5%) and pyrexia (2.5%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 6.0% of patients.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 4 summarises the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring in 762 adult and 91 paediatric patients treated with Rozlytrek in three clinical trials in adults (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2) and one clinical trial in paediatric patients (STARTRK-NG) and one clinical trial in adult and paediatric patients (TAPISTRY). The median duration of exposure was 8.6 months.

Table 5 includes paediatric patients from three clinical studies; STARTRK-NG, STARTRK-2 and TAPISTRY. The median duration of exposure was 11.1 months. Paediatric data in the description of selected adverse reactions reflect exposure to Rozlytrek in this expanded paediatric safety population (n=91). The safety profile observed in the expanded paediatric population was consistent with the known paediatric safety profile from the integrated safety population in Table 4 below.

Adverse drug reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. The following categories of frequency have been used: very common ≥1/10, common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000), very rare (&lt;1/10 000). Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

3 Adolescents ( ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age): Grade ≥ 3 reactions reported were neutropenia, weight increased, fracture, lung infection, and headache

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Cognitive disorders

A variety of cognitive symptoms was reported across clinical trials (see section 4.4). These included events reported as cognitive disorders (6.4%), confusional state (6.2%), memory impairment (4.9%), disturbance in attention (4.1%), amnesia (2.3%), mental status changes (0.9%), hallucination (0.8%), delirium (0.8%), disorientation (0.5%), brain fog (0.4%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (0.2%), visual hallucination (0.2%), auditory hallucination (0.1%), mental impairment (0.1%) and mental disorder (0.1%). Grade 3 cognitive disorders were reported in 3.6% of patients. Adult patients who had central nervous system (CNS) disease at baseline had a higher frequency of these adverse reactions (30%) compared to those without CNS disease (22.6%). The median time to onset for cognitive disorders was 0.95 months. In the paediatric population, 2.2% (2/91) of patients experienced disturbance in attention of Grade 1 severity and 2.2% (2/91) of patients experienced disturbance in attention of Grade 2 severity.

## Fractures

Fractures were experienced by 9.1% (69/762) of adult patients and 29.7% (27/91) of paediatric patients. In general, there was inadequate assessment for tumour involvement at the site of fracture; however, radiologic abnormalities possibly indicative of tumour involvement were reported in some adult patients. In both adult and paediatric patients, most fractures were hip or other lower extremity fractures (e.g., femoral or tibial shaft) and some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma.

The median time to fracture was 8.11 months (range: 0.26 months to 45.34 months) in adults. Rozlytrek was interrupted in 26.1% of adults that experienced fractures. Eighteen adult patients had Rozlytrek treatment interrupted and 2 adult patients discontinued Rozlytrek due to fractures. Rozlytrek dose was reduced for 2 adult patients due to fractures.

A total of 52 fracture events were reported in 27 paediatric patients, with 14 patients who experienced more than one occurrence of fracture. In paediatric patients, fractures mostly occurred in patients less than 12 years of age. Fractures resolved in 85.2% (23/27) of paediatric patients. The median time to fracture was 4.3 months (range: 2.0 months to 28.65 months) in paediatric patients. Twelve patients experienced Grade 2 fractures and 10 patients experienced Grade 3 fractures. Seven of the Grade 3 fractures were serious. Rozlytrek was interrupted in 18.5% (5/27) of paediatric patients who experienced fractures. Six paediatric patients discontinued Rozlytrek due to fractures. Rozlytrek dose was reduced for one paediatric patient.

## Ataxia

Ataxia (including events of ataxia, balance disorder, and gait disturbances) was reported in 15.1% of patients. The median time to onset for ataxia was 0.5 months (range: 0.03 months to 65.48 months) and the median duration was 0.7 months (range: 0.03 months to 11.99 months). The majority of patients (55.8%) recovered from ataxia. Ataxia related adverse reactions were observed more frequently in elderly patients (24.2%) compared to patients below 65 years of age (11.8%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Syncope

Syncope was reported in 5.0% of patients. In some patients, syncope was reported with concurrent hypotension, dehydration, or QTc prolongation and in other patients no other concurrent related conditions were reported.

## QTc interval prolongation

Among the 853 patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 47 (7.2%) patients with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval prolongation of &gt; 60 ms after starting entrectinib, and 27 (4.1%) patients had a QTcF interval of &gt; 500 ms (see section 4.4).

## Peripheral sensory neuropathy

Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 16.2% of patients. The median time to onset was 0.71 months (range 0.03 months to 81.97 months) and the median duration was 0.9 months (range: 0.07 months to 41 months). 48.6% of patients recovered from peripheral neuropathy.

## Eye disorders

Eye disorders reported across clinical trials included vision blurred (9%), visual impairment (1.9%), and diplopia (1.8%). The median time to onset for eye disorders was 1.9 months (range: 0.03 months to 49.61 months). The median duration of eye disorders was 1.2 months (range 0.03 months to 14.98 months). 54% of patients recovered from the eye disorder adverse reactions.

## Paediatric population

The overall safety profile of Rozlytrek in the paediatric population is generally similar to the safety profile in adults.

The safety of Rozlytrek in paediatric patients was established based on data from 91 paediatric patients across 3 clinical trials (STARTRK-NG, STARTRK-2, and TAPISTRY). Of these, 21 patients were 28 days to &lt; 2 years old, 55 patients were ≥ 2 to &lt; 12 years old, 15 patients were ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years old.

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or 4 severity occurring more frequently (at least a 5% increased incidence) in paediatric patients compared to adult patients were neutropenia (19.8% vs 4.5%), weight increased (18.7% vs 9.6%), bone fractures (11% vs 2.5%), and lung infection (11% vs 5.5%). No Grade 5 events were observed in the 91 patients in the expanded paediatric safety population. Grade 3 to 4 events that occurred at a frequency ≥ 5% were neutropenia (19.8%), weight increased (18.7%), fractures (11%), lung infection (11%), and anaemia (8.8%).

The safety profile in each age group (infants and toddlers, children, and adolescents) is similar to the overall safety profile of Rozlytrek in paediatric patients.

## Elderly

Among the 853 patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 227 (26.6%) patients were 65 years or older and 53 (6.2%) were 75 years or older. The overall safety profile of entrectinib in elderly patients is similar to the safety profile observed in patients younger than 65 years of age. Adverse reactions occurring more frequently (at least a 5% increased incidence) in the elderly compared to patients less than 65 years old were dizziness (44.9% vs 33.4%), blood creatinine increased (35.7% vs 30%), hypotension (19.8% vs 14.5%), and ataxia (24.2% vs 11.8%).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Patients who experience overdose should be closely supervised and supportive care instituted. There are no known antidotes for entrectinib.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX14

## Mechanism of action

Entrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases TRKA, TRKB and TRKC (encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [ NTRK ] genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 , respectively), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS ( ROS1 ), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with IC50 values of 0.1 to 2 nM. The major active metabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed similar in vitro potency and activity against TRK, ROS1, and ALK.

Fusion proteins that include TRK, ROS1 or ALK kinase domains drive tumourigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signalling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cancer cell lines derived from multiple tumour types, including subcutaneous and intracranial tumours, harbouring NTRK, ROS1, and ALK fusion genes.

Prior treatments with other drugs that inhibit the same kinases may confer resistance to entrectinib. Resistance mutations in the TRK kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include NTRK1 (G595R, G667C) and NTRK3 (G623R, G623E and G623K). Resistance mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include G2032R, F2004C and F2004I.

The molecular causes for primary resistance to entrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if the presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy of TRK inhibition.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours

## Efficacy in adult patients

The efficacy of Rozlytrek was evaluated in a pooled sub-group of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumours with a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in one of three multicentre single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2) or the multicentre multi-cohort, open-label clinical trial, TAPISTRY. To be included in the pooled subgroup, patients were required to have confirmed NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours; measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1; at least 12 months of follow-up from the first post-treatment initiation tumour assessment, and no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor (patients with concomitant driver mutations, where known, were excluded). Patients with primary CNS tumours were assessed separately using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO). Patients received Rozlytrek 600 mg orally once daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.

Efficacy was assessed in 242 adult patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion enrolled in these trials. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 47.5% males, median age of 58 years (range 19 years to 92 years), 37.2% and 9.9% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively, 49.4% white Caucasian, 36.5% Asian, 3.3% Hispanic or Latino and 61.9% never smokers. The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 (42.1%), 1 (50%), or 2 (7.9%). Most patients (95.5%) had metastatic disease [most common sites being lung (62.8%), lymph nodes (49.2%), liver (33.1%), bone (31%), and brain (16.5%)], 4.5% patients had locally advanced disease. 76.9% and 52.5% of patients had received surgery and radiotherapy for their cancer, respectively. 71.5% patients had received prior systemic therapy for their cancer including chemotherapy (61.6%) and 37.2% patients had no prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. The most common cancers were lung cancer (24.8%), sarcoma (19%), salivary gland tumours (15.7%), thyroid cancer (13.6%), colorectal cancer (7%), and breast cancer (7%).  The overall median duration of follow-up was 35.1 months.

Efficacy results from patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours are summarised in Table 6.

Due to the rarity of NTRK gene fusion-positive cancers, patients were studied across multiple tumour types with a limited number of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR estimate per tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific tumour type.

The ORR in 122 patients that had broad molecular characterisation before Rozlytrek treatment was 59.8% (95% CI: 50.6, 68.6); of those, the ORR in 97 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 55.7% (95% CI: 45.2, 65.8) and the ORR in 25 patients without other genomic alterations was 76% (95% CI: 54.9, 90.6).

## Intracranial response

A BICR assessment resulted in a subgroup of 36 adult patients with CNS metastases at baseline, including 20 patients with measurable CNS lesions. Intracranial (IC) response assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 was reported in 14 out of these 20 patients (7 CR and 7 PR), for an ORR of 70% (95% CI: 45.7, 88.1) and median DOR of 19.7 months (95% CI: 7.4, 26.6). Five of these 20 patients had received intracranial radiotherapy to the brain within 2 months prior to starting Rozlytrek treatment.

## Primary CNS tumour

Across the three trials, 16 adult patients with primary CNS tumours were treated with Rozlytrek with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Two out of the 16 adult patients had an objective response assessed by BICR according to RANO.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy in paediatric patients

Efficacy of Rozlytrek was assessed in 44 paediatric patients with solid tumours that have a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in STARTRK-NG or TAPISTRY.

To be included in the analysis, patients were required to have confirmed NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours; at least 6 months of follow-up, no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor, received at least one dose of entrectinib and presenting with measurable or evaluable disease at baseline. Patients received Rozlytrek doses from 20 mg to 600 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed ORR as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 for extracranial tumours and according to RANO for primary CNS tumours. The secondary efficacy outcome measures included duration of confirmed response as evaluated by BICR and time to first confirmed objective response (CR or PR).

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 45.5% males, median age of 4 years (range: 2 months to 15 years), 52.3% white Caucasian, 34.1% Asian, and 9.1% Hispanic or Latino, with a median BSA of 0.73 m 2 (range: 0.2-1.9 m 2 ). At baseline, 23.8% of patients had metastatic disease, 76.2% of patients had locally advanced disease, and 43.2% of patients had no prior systemic therapies for their cancer. The majority of patients had received treatment for their cancer including surgery (n=24), radiotherapy (n=8) and/or systemic therapy (n=25). The sites for metastatic disease included other (4 patients), brain (3 patients), and lung (3 patients). 45.5% of patients had primary CNS tumours. The overall median duration of follow-up was 24.2 months.

Efficacy results from patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours are summarised in Table 8.

Due to the rarity of NTRK gene fusion-positive cancers, patients were studied across multiple tumour types with a limited number of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR estimate per tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific tumour type.

## ROS1-positive NSCLC

The efficacy of Rozlytrek was evaluated in a pooled sub-group of patients with ROS1positive metastatic NSCLC who received Rozlytrek 600 mg orally once daily and were enrolled in one of three multicentre single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2). To be included in the pooled sub-group, patients were required to have histologically confirmed, recurrent or metastatic, ROS1 -positive NSCLC, ECOG performance status ≤ 2, measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1, ≥ 6 months of follow-up, and no prior therapy with a ROS1 inhibitor. All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline.

The primary efficacy endpoints were ORR and DOR, as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. The secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS, OS, and in patients presenting with CNS metastases at baseline - IC-ORR and IC-DOR (also evaluated by BICR using RECIST v1.1).

Efficacy was assessed in 161 patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 35.4% males, median age of 54 years (range 20 years to 86 years), 24.2% and 4.3% were older than 65 years and 75 years of age, respectively, 44.1% white Caucasian, 45.3% Asian, 4.3%, Black, 2.6% Hispanic or Latino and 62.7% never smokers. The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 (41%), 1 (49.1%), or 2 (9.9%). Most patients (98.1%) had metastatic disease [most common sites being lymph nodes (69.6%), lung (50.3%) and brain (32.9%)], 1.9% patients had locally advanced disease and 37.3% patients had no prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. ROS1 positivity was determined by NGS in 83% of patients, by FISH in 9% of patients, and by RT-PCR in 8% of patients. The overall median duration of follow-up from receipt of the first dose was 15.8 months.

Efficacy results from patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC are summarised in Table 10.

In the ROS1 positive NSCLC efficacy evaluable patients with ≥ 12 months of follow-up (n=94), the ORR was 73.4% (95% CI: 63.3, 82), the median DOR was 16.5 months (95% CI: 14.6, 28.6) and median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI: 12, 21.4).

## Intracranial response

A BICR assessment resulted in a subgroup of 46 ROS1-positive NSCLC patients with CNS metastases at baseline including 24 patients with measurable CNS lesions. Intracranial response assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 was reported in 19 of these 24 patients (3 CR and 16 PR) for an ORR of 79.2% (95% CI: 57.8, 92.9). The percentage of patients (95% CI) with DOR ≥ 6 months, ≥ 9 months and ≥ 12 months was 76% (56, 97), 62% (38, 86), and 55% (29, 80), respectively (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Nine of these 24 patients had received intracranial radiotherapy to the brain within 2 months prior to starting Rozlytrek treatment.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic parameters for entrectinib and its major active metabolite (M5), have been characterised in patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours and ROS1 -positive NSCLC and healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib and M5 are linear and are not dosedependent or time-dependent. Steady state is achieved within one week for entrectinib and two weeks for M5 following daily administration of Rozlytrek.

Entrectinib is a weak P-gp substrate based on in vitro data. The exact in vivo contribution of P-gp is unknown. M5 is a P-gp substrate. Entrectinib is not a substrate of BCRP but M5 is a substrate of BCRP. Entrectinib and M5 are not substrates of OATP 1B1 or OATP1B3.

## Absorption

Following a single 600 mg oral administration of Rozlytrek to patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive and ROS1 -positive NSCLC under fed conditions, entrectinib was rapidly absorbed reaching time-to-maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after approximately 4 to 6 hours. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, steady-state was achieved within 5 days for entrectinib with 600 mg once daily dosing.

No clinically significant effect of food on entrectinib bioavailability was observed.

In healthy adult subjects, the AUC and Cmax of Rozlytrek in the film-coated granule formulation was similar to that of the capsules. Rozlytrek capsules administered as a suspension with water or milk, given orally, or through a gastric or nasogastric tube, results in similar AUC and Cmax as capsules swallowed whole.

## Distribution

Entrectinib and its major active metabolite M5 are highly bound to human plasma proteins independent of drug concentrations. In human plasma, entrectinib and M5 had similar protein binding with &gt; 99% bound at a clinically relevant concentration.

After a single oral dose of entrectinib, the geometric mean volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 600 L, suggesting extensive distribution of the drug. Entrectinib demonstrated steady-state brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of 0.4 to 2.2 in multiple animal species (mice, rats, and dogs) at clinically relevant systemic exposures.

## Biotransformation

Entrectinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 (~76%). Minor contributions from several other CYPs and UGT1A4 were estimated at &lt; 25% in total. The active metabolite M5 (formed by CYP3A4) and the direct N-glucuronide conjugate, M11, (formed by UGT1A4) are the two major circulating metabolites identified.

## Elimination

The population PK model estimated mean accumulation at steady-state following 600 mg once daily administration of entrectinib was 1.89 (±0.381) and 2.01 (±0.437) for M5. Following administration of a single dose of [ 14 C]-labelled entrectinib, 83% radioactivity was excreted in faeces (36% of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22% as M5) with minimal excretion in urine (3%).

Entrectinib and M5 account for approximately 73% of radioactivity in systemic circulation at Cmax, and approximately half of total radioactivity AUCinf.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Population PK analysis estimated apparent clearance CL/F was 19.6 L/h and 52.4 L/h for entrectinib and M5, respectively. The elimination half-lives of entrectinib and M5 were estimated to be 20 hours and 40 hours, respectively.

## Linearity/Non-linearity

Entrectinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 100 mg to 600 mg.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib have been evaluated in 78 paediatric patients above one month of age. In patients from &gt; 1 month to ≤ 6 months the administered dose was 250 mg/m 2 ; in patients &gt; 6 months, the administered dose was 300 mg/m 2 based on five BSA categories, with a maximum dose of 600 mg for children with ≥ 1.51 m 2 body surface area (BSA).

Data obtained from population pharmacokinetic analyses show that in paediatric patients 6 years and older, 300 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose for BSA range 0.81 m 2 to 1.10 m 2 , 400 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose for BSA range 1.11 m 2 to 1.50 m 2 , and 600 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose for BSA range ≥ 1.51 m 2 results in a similar systemic exposure attained in adults treated with 600 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose.

Data from non-compartmental analysis in patients from 1 month to &lt; 6 years demonstrated that systemic exposure of the sum of entrectinib and M5 in paediatric patients receiving 250 mg/m 2 or 300 mg/m 2 of Rozlytrek once daily were generally lower than the mean systemic exposure of adult patients treated with 600 mg of Rozlytrek once daily. The recommended dose in this age category is based on available efficacy and safety data.

## Elderly

No differences in entrectinib exposure were noted in patients older than 65 years and younger adults based on pharmacokinetic analysis.

## Renal impairment

Negligible amounts of entrectinib and the active metabolite M5 are excreted unchanged in urine (~3% of the dose) indicating that renal clearance plays a minor role in the elimination of entrectinib. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib are not significantly affected in renal impairment. The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is unknown.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were studied in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. Following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg entrectinib, the combined AUClast of entrectinib and M5 showed no relevant change in the hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal function group. The AUClast geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 1.30 (0.889, 1.89) for the mild, 1.24 (0.886, 1.73) for the moderate, and 1.39 (0.988, 1.95) for the severe hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. For the unbound entrectinib and M5, the AUClast (fu) geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 1.91 (1.21, 3.02) for the mild, 1.57 (1.06, 2.31) for the moderate, and 2.34 (1.57, 3.48) for the severe hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. Although the effect of hepatic impairment on unbound PK parameters generally followed a similar direction as total PK parameters, due to the high non-specific binding in buffer and high variability, results should be interpreted with caution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, it was also observed that the variability in systemic exposure was high and observed exposures overlapped across all the study groups (see section 4.2).

## Effects of body weight, race and gender

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on sex, race (Asian, Black and White) and body weight (4 kg to 130 kg).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of entrectinib.

## Genotoxicity

Entrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but demonstrated a potential for abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity) in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Entrectinib was not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats and did not induce DNA damage in a comet assay in rats.

## Impairment of fertility

Dedicated fertility studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib. No adverse effects of entrectinib on male and female reproductive organs were observed in the repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs at approximately 2.4-fold and 0.6-fold, respectively, the human exposure by AUC at the recommended human dose.

## Reproductive toxicity

In an embryo-foetal developmental study in rats, maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and food consumption) and foetal malformations (including body closure defects and malformations of the vertebrae and ribs), were observed at 200 mg/kg/day of entrectinib which represents approximately 2-fold the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Dose-response dependent reduced foetal body weight (low, middle and high dose) and reduced skeletal ossification (middle and high dose) were observed at exposures equivalent to &lt; 2 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose.

## Repeat-dose toxicity studies

Entrectinib-related toxicities in repeat-dose studies in adult rats and dogs, and juvenile rats were observed in the central nervous system (convulsions, abnormal gait, tremors) at ≥ 0.2 times the human exposures by Cmax at the recommended dose, skin (scabs/sores) and decreased red blood cell parameters at ≥ 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In adult rats and dogs, effects on liver (increased ALT and hepatocellular necrosis) were observed at ≥ 0.6 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In dogs, diarrho ea at ≥ 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose and prolongations of QT/QTc interval at ≥ 0.1 times the human exposure by Cmax at the recommended dose were also observed.

## Juvenile rat toxicology study

In a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study, animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to day 97 (approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood in humans). In addition to CNS effects, ptosis and skin effects, decreased RBC parameters and effects on growth and development were observed in the dosing and recovery phases including decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation (at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose). Deficits in neurobehavioural assessments including functional observational battery (decreased

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion

Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients older than 1 month with solid tumours that have a NTRK gene fusion,

- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and
- who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor
- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## ROS1 gene fusion

Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1 -positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Rozlytrek should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.

## Patient selection

## NTRK gene fusion

A validated assay is required for the selection of patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours. NTRK gene fusion-positive status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ROS1 gene fusion

A validated assay is required for the selection of adult patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC. ROS1 -positive status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy (see section 5.1).

## Posology

Rozlytrek is available as hard capsules or film-coated granules.

The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form according to the dose required and patient needs.

- Rozlytrek film-coated granules are recommended for paediatric patients who have difficulty, or are unable, to swallow capsules but can swallow soft food and where the required dose is 50 mg or a multiple of 50 mg. Film-coated granules should be sprinkled on soft food.
- Patients who have difficulty or are unable to swallow capsules or who require enteral administration (e.g., gastric or nasogastric) may receive treatment with Rozlytrek capsules administered as an oral suspension. Refer to the Rozlytrek hard capsules SmPC for prescribing information.

## Adults

The recommended dose for adults is 600 mg entrectinib once daily.

Paediatric population

Paediatric population &gt; 6 months of age

The recommended dose for paediatric patients &gt; 6 months of age is based on body surface area (BSA) (see Table 1).

Table 1: Recommended dosing for paediatric patients &gt; 6 months

| Body surface area (BSA)*   | Once daily dose / Number of sachets (granules)   |

*BSA categories and recommended dosing in Table 1 are based on closely matching exposures to a target dose of 300 mg/m 2

**To enable dosing increments of 10 mg, capsules prepared as an oral suspension may be used. Refer to the Rozlytrek capsule SmPC for prescribing information.

## Paediatric patients &gt; 1 month to ≤ 6 months of age

The recommended dose for paediatric patients &gt; 1 month to ≤ 6 months of age is 250 mg/m 2 BSA entrectinib once daily, using capsules prepared as an oral suspension.

Capsules administered as an oral suspension (oral or enteral use) enable dosing increments of 10 mg. The daily dose to be administered should be rounded to the nearest 10 mg increment. Refer to the Rozlytrek hard capsules SmPC for prescribing information.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Duration of treatment

It is recommended that patients are treated with Rozlytrek until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Delayed or missed doses

If a planned dose of Rozlytrek is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due within 12 hours.

When Rozlytrek is administered by individuals other than the healthcare professional (e.g., caregivers or parents) and partial or total vomiting/spitting occurs immediately after taking an administered dose, caregivers should consult the healthcare professional for the next steps.

## Dose modifications

Management of adverse reactions may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of treatment with Rozlytrek, in case of specified adverse reactions (see Table 3) or based on the prescriber's assessment of the patient's safety or tolerability.

## Adults

For adults, the dose of Rozlytrek may be reduced up to 2 times, based on tolerability (see Table 2). Rozlytrek treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate a dose of 200 mg once daily.

## Paediatric population

For paediatric patients older than 1 month, the dose of Rozlytrek may be reduced up to 2 times, based on tolerability (see Table 2).

## Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors

The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors in adult and paediatric patients older than 1 month should be avoided (see section 4.4).

For adults, if co-administration is unavoidable, the use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with Rozlytrek should be limited to 14 days and the Rozlytrek dose should be reduced as follows:

- 100 mg once daily for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5)
- 200 mg once daily for use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After discontinuation of the concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the Rozlytrek dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor can be resumed. A wash-out period may be required for CYP3A4 inhibitors with a long half-life (see section 4.5).

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored for hepatic function and adverse reactions (see Table 3).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Entrectinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of entrectinib in paediatric patients 1 month of age and younger have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

Rozlytrek is for oral use.

Rozlytrek can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2) but should not be taken with grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or Seville oranges (see section 4.5).

The film-coated granules should be sprinkled on one or more spoonfuls of a soft food (e.g., applesauce, yogurt, pudding) and taken within 20 minutes of mixing.

The patient should drink water after taking the film-coated granules to ensure the medicinal product has been completely swallowed.

Patients should be instructed to not crush or chew the film-coated granules to avoid a bitter taste.

The contents of a sachet of film-coated granules should not be divided to prepare a smaller dose.

Detailed instructions on the administration of the film-coated granules are given in the Instructions for Use (IFU) at the end of the package leaflet.

The film-coated granules are not suitable for enteral administration due to potential for clogging in the tubing. Refer to the Rozlytrek hard capsules SmPC for enteral (e.g., gastric or nasogastric tube) administration.

## 4.3 Contraindications

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Efficacy across tumour types

The benefit of Rozlytrek has been established in single-arm trials encompassing a relatively small sample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of Rozlytrek have been shown based on overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour types. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant genomic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, Rozlytrek should only be used if there are no satisfactory treatment options (i.e., for which clinical benefit has not been established, or where such treatment options have been exhausted).

## Cognitive disorders

Cognitive disorders, including confusion, mental status changes, memory impairment, and hallucinations, were reported in clinical trials with Rozlytrek (see section 4.8). Patients over the age of 65 years experienced a higher incidence of these events than younger patients. Patients should be monitored for signs of cognitive changes.

Based on the severity of cognitive disorders, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

Patients should be counselled on the potential for cognitive changes with Rozlytrek treatment. Patients should be instructed not to drive or use machines until symptoms resolve if they experience cognitive disorders (see section 4.7).

## Fractures

Fractures have been reported in 29.7% (27/91) of paediatric patients treated with Rozlytrek in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Bone fractures mostly occurred in paediatric patients less than 12 years of age and were localised in the lower extremity (with a predilection for femur, tibia, foot, and fibula). In both adult and paediatric patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area.

Fourteen paediatric patients had more than one occurrence of a fracture. Fractures resolved in the majority of paediatric patients (see section 4.8). Five paediatric patients had Rozlytrek treatment interrupted due to a fracture. Six paediatric patients discontinued treatment due to fractures.

Patients with signs or symptoms of fractures (e.g., pain, abnormal gait, changes in mobility, deformity) should be evaluated promptly.

## Hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia has been observed in patients treated with entrectinib. Serum uric acid levels should be assessed prior to initiating Rozlytrek and periodically during treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Treatment with urate-lowering medicinal products should be initiated as clinically indicated and Rozlytrek withheld for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Rozlytrek dose should be modified based on severity as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

## Congestive heart failure

Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported 5.4% of patients across clinical trials with Rozlytrek (see section 4.8). These reactions were observed in patients with or without a history of cardiac disease and resolved in 63.0% of those patients upon institution of appropriate clinical management and/or Rozlytrek dose reduction/interruption.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients with symptoms or known risk factors of CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be assessed prior to initiation of Rozlytrek treatment. Patients receiving Rozlytrek should be carefully monitored and those with clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath or oedema, should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate.

Based on the severity of CHF, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

## QTc interval prolongation

QTc interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with Rozlytrek in clinical trials (see section 4.8).

Use of Rozlytrek should be avoided in patients with a baseline QTc interval longer than 450 ms, in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, and in patients taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval.

Rozlytrek should be avoided in patients with electrolyte imbalances or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and bradyarrhythmias. If, in the opinion of the treating physician, the potential benefits of Rozlytrek in a patient with any of these conditions outweigh the potential risks, additional monitoring should be performed and a specialist consultation should be considered.

Assessment of ECG and electrolytes at baseline and after 1 month of treatment with Rozlytrek are recommended. Periodic monitoring of ECGs and electrolytes as clinically indicated throughout Rozlytrek treatment, are also recommended.

Based on the severity of QTc prolongation, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 3 in section 4.2.

## Women of childbearing potential

Rozlytrek may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception methods during treatment and up to 5 weeks after the last dose of Rozlytrek.

Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment with Rozlytrek and for 3 months after the last dose (see sections 4.6 and 5.3).

## Drug interactions

Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases entrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions. Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor should be avoided. For adult patients if co-administration is unavoidable, the Rozlytrek dose should be reduced (see section 4.2).

During treatment with Rozlytrek, the consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, and Seville oranges should be avoided.

Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A or P-gp inducer decreases entrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which may reduce efficacy of Rozlytrek, and should be avoided.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per 600 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effects of entrectinib on other medicinal products

## Effect of entrectinib on CYP substrates

Entrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of entrectinib 600 mg once daily with oral midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) in patients increased the midazolam AUC by 50% but reduced midazolam Cmax by 21%. Caution is advised when entrectinib is administered together with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cisapride, cyclosporin, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus), due to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions.

## Effect of entrectinib on P-gp substrates

In vitro data suggest that entrectinib has inhibitory potential towards P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

Co-administration of a single 600 mg dose of entrectinib with digoxin (a sensitive P-gp substrate) increased digoxin Cmax by 28% and AUC by 18%. The renal clearance of digoxin was similar between treatments of digoxin alone and digoxin co-administered with entrectinib, indicating minimal effect of entrectinib on renal clearance of digoxin.

The effect of entrectinib on digoxin absorption is not considered clinically relevant, but it is unknown whether the effect of entrectinib may be larger on more sensitive oral P-gp substrates such as dabigatran etexilate.

## Effect of entrectinib on BCRP substrates

Inhibition of BCRP was observed in in vitro studies.

The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised when sensitive oral BCRP substrates (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan, lapatinib) are co-administered with entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption.

## Effect of entrectinib on other transporter substrates

In vitro data indicate that entrectinib has weak inhibitory potential towards organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised when sensitive oral OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin repaglinide, bosentan) are co-administered with entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption.

## Effect of entrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes

In vitro studies indicate that entrectinib may induce pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C family and UGT). Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates (e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure.

## Oral contraceptives

It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives are advised to add a barrier method (see section 4.6).

## Effects of other medicinal products on entrectinib

Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme mediating the metabolism of entrectinib and formation of its major active metabolite M5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of CYP3A or P-gp inducers on entrectinib

Co-administration of multiple oral doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single oral dose of entrectinib reduced entrectinib AUCinf by 77% and Cmax by 56%.

Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP3A/P-gp inducers (including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, St. John's Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ], apalutamide, ritonavir, dexamethasone) should be avoided.

If co-administration of Rozlytrek with dexamethasone cannot be avoided, dexamethasone dose recommendations should be determined by the healthcare professional.

## Effect of CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors on entrectinib

Co-administration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single oral dose of entrectinib increased AUCinf by 600% and Cmax by 173%. Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, a similar magnitude of the effect is expected in children as young as 2 years old.

Co-administration of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, grapefruit, or Seville oranges) should be avoided. If concurrent use of strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 is unavoidable, dose adjustment of entrectinib is required (see section 4.2).

Although, a marked effect of inhibitory P-gp medicinal products on entrectinib pharmacokinetics is not expected, caution is advised when treatment with strong or moderate P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) are co-administered with entrectinib due to risk of increased entrectinib exposure (see section 5.2).

## Effect of medicinal products that increase gastric pH on entrectinib

Co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), lansoprazole with a single 600 mg entrectinib dose reduced entrectinib AUC by 25% and Cmax by 23%.

No dose adjustments are required when entrectinib is co-administered with PPIs or other medicines that raise gastric pH (e.g., H2 receptor antagonists or antacids).

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females

Female patients of childbearing potential should have medically supervised pregnancy testing prior to initiating Rozlytrek therapy.

Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 5 weeks following the last dose of Rozlytrek.

It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method.

Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Rozlytrek (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

There are no available data from the use of entrectinib in pregnant women. Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, entrectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).

Rozlytrek is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

Female patients receiving Rozlytrek should be advised of the potential harm to the foetus. Female patients should be advised to contact the doctor, should pregnancy occur.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether entrectinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Rozlytrek.

## Fertility

No fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rozlytrek has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be instructed not to drive or use machines until the symptoms resolve, if they experience cognitive adverse reactions, syncope, blurred vision, or dizziness, during treatment with Rozlytrek (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea, dizziness, dysgeusia, oedema, increased weight, anaemia, increased blood creatinine, nausea, dysaesthesia, pain, vomiting, pyrexia, arthralgia, increased aspartate aminotransferase and dyspnoea, cognitive disorders, cough, and increased alanine aminotransferase . The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were lung infection (5.3%), fractures (4.1%), dyspnoea (3.6%), cognitive impairment (2.9%), pleural effusion (2.5%) and pyrexia (2.5%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 6.0% of patients.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 4 summarises the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring in 762 adult and 91 paediatric patients treated with Rozlytrek in three clinical trials in adults (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2) and one clinical trial in paediatric patients (STARTRK-NG) and one clinical trial in adult and paediatric patients (TAPISTRY). The median duration of exposure was 8.6 months.

Table 5 includes paediatric patients from three clinical studies; STARTRK-NG, STARTRK-2 and TAPISTRY. The median duration of exposure was 11.1 months. Paediatric data in the description of selected adverse reactions reflect exposure to Rozlytrek in this expanded paediatric safety population (n=91). The safety profile observed in the expanded paediatric population was consistent with the known paediatric safety profile from the integrated safety population in Table 4 below.

Adverse drug reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. The following categories of frequency have been used: very common ≥1/10, common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

&lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000), very rare (&lt;1/10 000). Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

% refers to all grades

1 Infant/toddlers ( ≥ 28 days to &lt; 24 months ): Grade ≥ 3 reactions reported were neutropenia, weight increased, lung infection, anaemia, AST increased, abdominal pain, and urinary tract infection

2 Children ( ≥ 24 months to &lt; 12 years ): Grade ≥ 3 reactions reported were neutropenia, weight increased, fractures, lung infection, anaemia, ALT increased, syncope, AST increased, ataxia, dyspnoea, abdominal pain, congestive heart failure, fatigue, headache, pain, pyrexia, urinary tract infection, arthralgia, cognitive disorders, constipation, cough, decreased appetite, dehydration, hypotension, muscular weakness, oedema, and vomiting

3 Adolescents (≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age): Grade ≥ 3 reactions reported were neutropenia, weight increased, fracture, lung infection, and headache

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Cognitive disorders

A variety of cognitive symptoms was reported across clinical trials (see section 4.4). These included events reported as cognitive disorders (6.4%), confusional state (6.2%), memory impairment (4.9%), disturbance in attention (4.1%), amnesia (2.3%), mental status changes (0.9%), hallucination (0.8%), delirium (0.8%), disorientation (0.5%), brain fog (0.4%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(0.2%), visual hallucination (0.2%), auditory hallucination (0.1%), mental impairment (0.1%) and mental disorder (0.1%). Grade 3 cognitive disorders were reported in 3.6% of patients. Adult patients who had central nervous system (CNS) disease at baseline had a higher frequency of these adverse reactions (30%) compared to those without CNS disease (22.6%). The median time to onset for cognitive disorders was 0.95 months. In the paediatric population, 2.2% (2/91) of patients experienced disturbance in attention of Grade 1 severity and 2.2% (2/91) of patients experienced disturbance in attention of Grade 2 severity.

## Fractures

Fractures were experienced by 9.1% (69/762) of adult patients and 29.7% (27/91) of paediatric patients. In general, there was inadequate assessment for tumour involvement at the site of fracture; however, radiologic abnormalities possibly indicative of tumour involvement were reported in some adult patients. In both adult and paediatric patients, most fractures were hip or other lower extremity fractures (e.g., femoral or tibial shaft) and some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma.

The median time to fracture was 8.11 months (range: 0.26 months to 45.34 months) in adults. Rozlytrek was interrupted in 26.1% of adults that experienced fractures. Eighteen adult patients had Rozlytrek treatment interrupted and 2 adult patients discontinued Rozlytrek due to fractures. Rozlytrek dose was reduced for 2 adult patients due to fractures.

A total of 52 fracture events were reported in 27 paediatric patients, with 14 patients who experienced more than one occurrence of fracture. In paediatric patients, fractures mostly occurred in patients less than 12 years of age. Fractures resolved in 85.2% (23/27) of paediatric patients. The median time to fracture was 4.3 months (range: 2.0 months to 28.65 months) in paediatric patients. Twelve patients experienced Grade 2 fractures and 10 patients experienced Grade 3 fractures. Seven of the Grade 3 fractures were serious.  Rozlytrek was interrupted in 18.5% (5/27) of paediatric patients who experienced fractures. Six paediatric patients discontinued Rozlytrek due to fractures. Rozlytrek dose was reduced for one paediatric patient.

## Ataxia

Ataxia (including events of ataxia, balance disorder, and gait disturbances) was reported in 15.1% of patients. The median time to onset for ataxia was 0.5 months (range: 0.03 months to 65.48 months) and the median duration was 0.7 months (range: 0.03 months to 11.99 months). The majority of patients (55.8%) recovered from ataxia. Ataxia related adverse reactions were observed more frequently in elderly patients (24.2%) compared to patients below 65 years of age (11.8%).

## Syncope

Syncope was reported in 5.0% of patients. In some patients, syncope was reported with concurrent hypotension, dehydration, or QTc prolongation and in other patients no other concurrent related conditions were reported.

## QTc interval prolongation

Among the 853 patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 47 (7.2%) patients with at least one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval prolongation of &gt; 60 ms after starting entrectinib, and 27 (4.1%) patients had a QTcF interval of &gt; 500 ms (see section 4.4).

## Peripheral sensory neuropathy

Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 16.2% of patients. The median time to onset was 0.71 months (range 0.03 months to 81.97 months) and the median duration was 0.9 months (range: 0.07 months to 41 months). 48.6% of patients recovered from peripheral neuropathy.

## Eye disorders

Eye disorders reported across clinical trials included vision blurred (9%), visual impairment (1.9%), and diplopia (1.8%). The median time to onset for eye disorders was 1.9 months (range: 0.03 months

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to 49.61 months). The median duration of eye disorders was 1.2 months (range 0.03 months to 14.98 months). 54% of patients recovered from the eye disorder adverse reactions.

## Paediatric population

The overall safety profile of Rozlytrek in the paediatric population is generally similar to the safety profile in adults.

The safety of Rozlytrek in paediatric patients was established based on data from 91 paediatric patients across 3 clinical trials (STARTRK-NG, STARTRK-2, and TAPISTRY). Of these, 21 patients were 28 days to &lt; 2 years old, 55 patients were ≥ 2 to &lt; 12 years old, 15 patients were ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years old.

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or 4 severity occurring more frequently (at least a 5% increased incidence) in paediatric patients compared to adult patients were neutropenia (19.8% vs 4.5%), weight increased (18.7% vs 9.6%), bone fractures (11% vs 2.5%), and lung infection (11% vs 5.5%). No Grade 5 events were observed in the 91 patients in the expanded paediatric safety population. Grade 3 to 4 events that occurred at a frequency ≥ 5% were neutropenia (19.8%), weight increased (18.7%), fractures (11%), lung infection (11%), and anaemia (8.8%).

The safety profile in each age group (infants and toddlers, children, and adolescents) is similar to the overall safety profile of Rozlytrek in paediatric patients.

## Elderly

Among the 853 patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 227 (26.6%) patients were 65 years or older and 53 (6.2%) were 75 years or older. The overall safety profile of entrectinib in elderly patients is similar to the safety profile observed in patients younger than 65 years of age. Adverse reactions occurring more frequently (at least a 5% increased incidence) in the elderly compared to patients less than 65 years old were dizziness (44.9% vs 33.4%), blood creatinine increased (35.7% vs 30%), hypotension (19.8% vs 14.5%), and ataxia (24.2% vs 11.8%).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Patients who experience overdose should be closely supervised and supportive care instituted. There are no known antidotes for entrectinib.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX14

## Mechanism of action

Entrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases TRKA, TRKB and TRKC (encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [ NTRK ] genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 , respectively), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS ( ROS1 ), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(ALK), with IC50 values of 0.1 to 2 nM. The major active metabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed similar in vitro potency and activity against TRK, ROS1, and ALK.

Fusion proteins that include TRK, ROS1 or ALK kinase domains drive tumourigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signalling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cancer cell lines derived from multiple tumour types, including subcutaneous and intracranial tumours, harbouring NTRK, ROS1, and ALK fusion genes.

Prior treatments with other drugs that inhibit the same kinases may confer resistance to entrectinib. Resistance mutations in the TRK kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include NTRK1 (G595R, G667C) and NTRK3 (G623R, G623E and G623K). Resistance mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include G2032R, F2004C and F2004I.

The molecular causes for primary resistance to entrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if the presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy of TRK inhibition.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours

## Efficacy in adult patients

The efficacy of Rozlytrek was evaluated in a pooled sub-group of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumours with a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in one of three multicentre single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2) or the multicentre multi-cohort, open-label clinical trial, TAPISTRY. To be included in the pooled subgroup, patients were required to have confirmed NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours; measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1; at least 12 months of follow-up from the first post-treatment initiation tumour assessment, and no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor (patients with concomitant driver mutations, where known, were excluded). Patients with primary CNS tumours were assessed separately using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO). Patients received Rozlytrek 600 mg orally once daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.

Efficacy was assessed in 242 adult patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion enrolled in these trials. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 47.5% males, median age of 58 years (range 19 years to 92 years), 37.2% and 9.9% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older respectively, 49.4% white Caucasian, 36.5% Asian, 3.3% Hispanic or Latino and 61.9% never smokers. The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 (42.1%), 1 (50%), or 2 (7.9%). Most patients (95.5%) had metastatic disease [most common sites being lung (62.8%), lymph nodes (49.2%), liver (33.1%), bone (31%), and brain (16.5%)], 4.5% patients had locally advanced disease. 76.9% and 52.5% of patients had received surgery and radiotherapy for their cancer, respectively. 71.5% patients had received prior systemic therapy for their cancer including chemotherapy (61.6%) and 37.2% patients had no prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. The most common cancers were lung cancer (24.8%), sarcoma (19%), salivary gland tumours (15.7%), thyroid cancer (13.6%), colorectal cancer (7%), and breast cancer (7%). The overall median duration of follow-up was 35.1 months.

Efficacy results from patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours are summarised in Table 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the rarity of NTRK gene fusion-positive cancers, patients were studied across multiple tumour types with a limited number of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR estimate per tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific tumour type.

The ORR in 122 patients that had broad molecular characterisation before Rozlytrek treatment was 59.8% (95% CI: 50.6, 68.6); of those, the ORR in 97 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 55.7% (95% CI: 45.2, 65.8) and the ORR in 25 patients without other genomic alterations was 76% (95% CI: 54.9, 90.6).

## Intracranial response

A BICR assessment resulted in a subgroup of 36 adult patients with CNS metastases at baseline, including 20 patients with measurable CNS lesions. Intracranial (IC) response assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 was reported in 14 out of these 20 patients (7 CR and 7 PR), for an ORR of 70% (95% CI: 45.7, 88.1) and median DOR of 19.7 months (95% CI: 7.4, 26.6). Five of these 20 patients had received intracranial radiotherapy to the brain within 2 months prior to starting Rozlytrek treatment.

## Primary CNS tumour

Across the three trials, 16 adult patients with primary CNS tumours were treated with Rozlytrek with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Two out of the 16 adult patients had an objective response assessed by BICR according to RANO.

## Efficacy in paediatric patients

Efficacy of Rozlytrek was assessed in 44 paediatric patients with solid tumours that have a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in STARTRK-NG or TAPISTRY.

To be included in the analysis, patients were required to have confirmed NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours; at least 6 months of follow-up, no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor, received at least one dose of entrectinib and presenting with measurable or evaluable disease at baseline. Patients received Rozlytrek doses from 20 mg to 600 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed ORR as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 for extracranial tumours and according to RANO for primary CNS tumours. The secondary efficacy outcome measures included duration of confirmed response as evaluated by BICR and time to first confirmed objective response (CR or PR).

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 45.5% males, median age of 4 years (range: 2 months to 15 years), 52.3% white Caucasian, 34.1% Asian, and 9.1% Hispanic or Latino, with a median BSA of 0.73 m 2 (range: 0.2-1.9 m 2 ). At baseline, 23.8% of patients had metastatic disease, 76.2% of patients had locally advanced disease, and 43.2% of patients had no prior systemic therapies for their cancer. The majority of patients had received treatment for their cancer including surgery (n=24), radiotherapy (n=8) and/or systemic therapy (n=25). The sites for metastatic disease included other (4 patients), brain (3 patients), and lung (3 patients). 45.5% of patients had primary CNS tumours. The overall median duration of follow-up was 24.2 months.

Efficacy results from patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours are summarised in Table 8.

The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific tumour type.

## ROS1-positive NSCLC

The efficacy of Rozlytrek was evaluated in a pooled sub-group of patients with ROS1 -positive metastatic NSCLC who received Rozlytrek 600 mg orally once daily and were enrolled in one of three multicentre single-arm, open-label clinical trials (ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2). To be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

included in the pooled sub-group, patients were required to have histologically confirmed, recurrent or metastatic, ROS1 -positive NSCLC, ECOG performance status ≤ 2, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, ≥ 6 months of follow-up, and no prior therapy with a ROS1 inhibitor. All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline.

The primary efficacy endpoints were ORR and DOR, as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. The secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS, OS, and in patients presenting with CNS metastases at baseline - IC-ORR and IC-DOR (also evaluated by BICR using RECIST v1.1).

Efficacy was assessed in 161 patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 35.4% males, median age of 54 years (range 20 years to 86 years), 24.2% and 4.3% were older than 65 years and 75 years of age, respectively, 44.1% white Caucasian, 45.3% Asian, 4.3%, Black, 2.6% Hispanic or Latino and 62.7% never smokers. The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 (41%), 1 (49.1%), or 2 (9.9%). Most patients (98.1%) had metastatic disease [most common sites being lymph nodes (69.6%), lung (50.3%) and brain (32.9%)], 1.9% patients had locally advanced disease and 37.3% patients had no prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. ROS1 positivity was determined by NGS in 83% of patients, by FISH in 9% of patients, and by RT-PCR in 8% of patients. The overall median duration of follow-up from receipt of the first dose was 15.8 months.

Efficacy results from patients with ROS1 -positive NSCLC are summarised in Table 10.

In the ROS1 positive NSCLC efficacy evaluable patients with ≥ 12 months of follow-up (n=94), the ORR was 73.4% (95% CI: 63.3, 82), the median DOR was 16.5 months (95% CI: 14.6, 28.6) and median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI: 12, 21.4).

## Intracranial response

A BICR assessment resulted in a subgroup of 46 ROS1 -positive NSCLC patients with CNS metastases at baseline including 24 patients with measurable CNS lesions. Intracranial response assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 was reported in 19 of these 24 patients (3 CR and 16 PR) for an ORR of 79.2% (95% CI: 57.8, 92.9). The percentage of patients (95% CI) with DOR ≥ 6 months, ≥ 9 months and ≥ 12 months was 76% (56, 97), 62% (38, 86), and 55% (29, 80), respectively (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Nine of these 24 patients had received intracranial radiotherapy to the brain within 2 months prior to starting Rozlytrek treatment.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic parameters for entrectinib and its major active metabolite (M5), have been characterised in patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours and ROS1 -positive NSCLC and healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib and M5 are linear and are not dose-dependent or time-dependent. Steady state is achieved within one week for entrectinib and two weeks for M5 following daily administration of Rozlytrek.

Entrectinib is a weak P-gp substrate based on in vitro data. The exact in vivo contribution of P-gp is unknown. M5 is a P-gp substrate. Entrectinib is not a substrate of BCRP but M5 is a substrate of BCRP. Entrectinib and M5 are not substrates of OATP 1B1 or OATP1B3.

## Absorption

Following a single 600 mg oral administration of Rozlytrek to patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive and ROS1 -positive NSCLC under fed conditions, entrectinib was rapidly absorbed reaching time-to-maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after approximately 4 to 6 hours. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, steady-state was achieved within 5 days for entrectinib with 600 mg once daily dosing.

No clinically significant effect of food on entrectinib bioavailability was observed.

In healthy adult subjects, the AUC and Cmax of Rozlytrek in the film-coated granule formulation was similar to that of the capsules. Rozlytrek capsules administered as a suspension with water or milk, given orally, or through a gastric or nasogastric tube, results in similar AUC and Cmax as capsules swallowed whole.

## Distribution

Entrectinib and its major active metabolite M5 are highly bound to human plasma proteins independent of drug concentrations. In human plasma, entrectinib and M5 had similar protein binding with &gt; 99% bound at a clinically relevant concentration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After a single oral dose of entrectinib, the geometric mean volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 600 L, suggesting extensive distribution of the drug. Entrectinib demonstrated steady-state brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of 0.4 to 2.2 in multiple animal species (mice, rats, and dogs) at clinically relevant systemic exposures.

## Biotransformation

Entrectinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 (~76%). Minor contributions from several other CYPs and UGT1A4 were estimated at &lt; 25% in total. The active metabolite M5 (formed by CYP3A4) and the direct N-glucuronide conjugate, M11, (formed by UGT1A4) are the two major circulating metabolites identified.

## Elimination

The population PK model estimated mean accumulation at steady-state following 600 mg once daily administration of entrectinib was 1.89 (±0.381) and 2.01 (±0.437) for M5. Following administration of a single dose of [ 14 C]-labelled entrectinib, 83% radioactivity was excreted in faeces (36% of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22% as M5) with minimal excretion in urine (3%).

Entrectinib and M5 account for approximately 73% of radioactivity in systemic circulation at Cmax, and approximately half of total radioactivity AUCinf.

Population PK analysis estimated apparent clearance CL/F was 19.6 L/h and 52.4 L/h for entrectinib and M5, respectively. The elimination half-lives of entrectinib and M5 were estimated to be 20 hours and 40 hours, respectively.

## Linearity/Non-linearity

Entrectinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 100 mg to 600 mg.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib have been evaluated in 78 paediatric patients above one month of age. In patients from &gt; 1 month to ≤ 6 months the administered dose was 250 mg/m 2 ; in patients &gt; 6 months, the administered dose was 300 mg/m 2 based on five BSA categories, with a maximum dose of 600 mg for children with ≥ 1.51 m 2 body surface area (BSA).

Data obtained from population pharmacokinetic analyses show that in paediatric patients 6 years and older, 300 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose for BSA range 0.81 m 2 to 1.10 m 2 , 400 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose for BSA range 1.11 m 2 to 1.50 m 2 , and 600 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose for BSA range ≥ 1.51 m 2 results in a similar systemic exposure attained in adults treated with 600 mg Rozlytrek once daily dose.

Data from non-compartmental analysis in patients from 1 month to &lt; 6 years demonstrated that systemic exposure of the sum of entrectinib and M5 in paediatric patients receiving 250 mg/m 2 or 300 mg/m 2 of Rozlytrek once daily were generally lower than the mean systemic exposure of adult patients treated with 600 mg of Rozlytrek once daily. The recommended dose in this age category is based on available efficacy and safety data.

## Elderly

No differences in entrectinib exposure were noted in patients older than 65 years and younger adults based on pharmacokinetic analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Negligible amounts of entrectinib and the active metabolite M5 are excreted unchanged in urine (~3% of the dose) indicating that renal clearance plays a minor role in the elimination of entrectinib. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib are not significantly affected in renal impairment. The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is unknown.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were studied in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. Following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg entrectinib, the combined AUClast of entrectinib and M5 showed no relevant change in the hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal function group. The AUClast geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 1.30 (0.889, 1.89) for the mild, 1.24 (0.886, 1.73) for the moderate, and 1.39 (0.988, 1.95) for the severe hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. For the unbound entrectinib and M5, the AUClast (fu) geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 1.91 (1.21, 3.02) for the mild, 1.57 (1.06, 2.31) for the moderate, and 2.34 (1.57, 3.48) for the severe hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. Although the effect of hepatic impairment on unbound PK parameters generally followed a similar direction as total PK parameters, due to the high non-specific binding in buffer and high variability, results should be interpreted with caution.

In addition, it was also observed that the variability in systemic exposure was high and observed exposures overlapped across all the study groups (see section 4.2).

## Effects of body weight, race and gender

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on sex, race (Asian, Black and White) and body weight (4 kg to 130 kg).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of entrectinib.

## Genotoxicity

Entrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but demonstrated a potential for abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity) in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Entrectinib was not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats and did not induce DNA damage in a comet assay in rats.

## Impairment of fertility

Dedicated fertility studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib. No adverse effects of entrectinib on male and female reproductive organs were observed in the repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs at approximately 2.4-fold and 0.6-fold, respectively, the human exposure by AUC at the recommended human dose.

## Reproductive toxicity

In an embryo-foetal developmental study in rats, maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and food consumption) and foetal malformations (including body closure defects and malformations of the vertebrae and ribs), were observed at 200 mg/kg/day of entrectinib which represents approximately

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2-fold the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Dose-response dependent reduced foetal body weight (low, middle and high dose) and reduced skeletal ossification (middle and high dose) were observed at exposures equivalent to &lt; 2 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose.

## Repeat-dose toxicity studies

Entrectinib-related toxicities in repeat-dose studies in adult rats and dogs, and juvenile rats were observed in the central nervous system (convulsions, abnormal gait, tremors) at ≥ 0.2 times the human exposures by Cmax at the recommended dose, skin (scabs/sores) and decreased red blood cell parameters at ≥ 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In adult rats and dogs, effects on liver (increased ALT and hepatocellular necrosis) were observed at ≥ 0.6 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In dogs, diarrhoea at ≥ 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose and prolongations of QT/QTc int erval at ≥ 0.1 times the human exposure by Cmax at the recommended dose were also observed.

## Juvenile rat toxicology study

In a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study, animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to day 97 (approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood in humans). In addition to CNS effects, ptosis and skin effects, decreased RBC parameters and effects on growth and development were observed in the dosing and recovery phases including decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation (at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose). Deficits in neurobehavioural assessments including functional observational battery (decreased landing foot splay, decreased fore and hind limb grip strength that seemed to manifest later in age) and learning and memory (at ≥ 8 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.2 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose), and decreased femur length (at ≥ 16 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose) were observed.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

7. Instructions for use

## 1. What Rozlytrek is and what it is used for

## What Rozlytrek is

Rozlytrek is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance 'entrectinib'.

## What Rozlytrek is used for

Rozlytrek is used to treat either:

- adults, adolescents, and children older than 1 month with solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body that are caused by a change in a gene called 'neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase' ( NTRK ), or
- adults with a type of lung cancer called 'non-small cell lung cancer' (NSCLC) that is caused by a change in a gene called ' ROS1'.

This medicine is used for solid tumour cancers when:

- a test has shown that your cancer cells have a change in genes called ' NTRK ' (see 'How Rozlytrek works' below), and
- your cancer has spread within the affected organ or to other organs in your body or if surgery to remove the cancer is likely to cause severe complications, and
- you have not previously been given medicines called ' NTRK inhibitors'
- other treatments have not worked or are not suitable for you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicine is used if your lung cancer (NSCLC):

- is ' ROS1 -positive' - this means that your cancer cells have a change in a gene called ' ROS1 ' (see 'How Rozlytrek works' below), and
- is advanced - for example, has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic), and
- you have not previously been given medicines called ' ROS1 inhibitors'.

## How Rozlytrek works

Rozlytrek works by blocking the action of faulty enzymes. These faulty enzymes are caused by a change in the NTRK or ROS1 genes that make them. The faulty enzymes make the cancer cells grow.

Rozlytrek may slow down or stop the growth of the cancer. It may also help to shrink your cancer.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Rozlytrek

## Do not take Rozlytrek

- if you are allergic to entrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek if:

- you have recently had memory loss, confusion, hallucinations, or mental status changes
- you have had fractured bones, or conditions which may increase your risk of breaking bones, called 'osteoporosis' or 'osteopaenia'
- you take medicine to lower the uric acid in your blood
- you have heart failure (when your heart struggles to pump blood to supply oxygen to the body) - signs can include cough, feeling short of breath, or swelling in your legs or arms
- you have ever had heart problems or a heart conduction problem called 'prolonged QTc interval' - this is shown on an 'electro-cardiogram' (ECG), or by low levels of electrolytes in your blood
- you have an inherited problem called 'galactose intolerance', 'congenital lactase deficiency' or 'glucose-galactose malabsorption'.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek.

## Other medicines and Rozlytrek

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is because Rozlytrek can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way Rozlytrek works.

In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines for:

- fungal infections (anti-fungals) - such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole
- AIDS/HIV infection - such as ritonavir or saquinavir
- depression - such as paroxetine, fluvoxamine, or a herbal medicine for depression - St. John's Wort
- stopping seizures or fits - such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital
- tuberculosis - such as rifampicin or rifabutin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- solid cancers and blood cancer - topotecan, lapatinib, mitoxantrone, apalutamide, or methotrexate
- inflamed joints or joint autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis) - methotrexate
- migraines - ergotamine
- severe pain - fentanyl
- mental illness (psychoses) or Tourette Syndrome - pimozide
- irregular heart rate - quinidine
- stopping the formation of blood clots - warfarin or dabigatran etexilate
- gastric reflux (heartburn) - cisapride or omeprazole
- lowering blood cholesterol - atorvastatin, pravastatin, or rosuvastatin
- suppressing your body's immune system, or stopping your body from rejecting an organ transplant - sirolimus, tacrolimus, or cyclosporin
- lowering blood sugar levels - repaglinide or tolbutamide
- high blood pressure - bosentan, felodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil
- inflammation or nausea - dexamethasone

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rozlytrek.

## Rozlytrek with food and drink

Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit or Seville oranges during your treatment with this medicine. It may increase the amount of the medicine in your blood to a harmful level.

## Women and contraception

You must avoid becoming pregnant while taking this medicine because it could harm the baby. If you are able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective contraception:

- while on treatment, and
- for at least 5 weeks after stopping treatment.

It is not known if Rozlytrek can reduce the effect of birth control medicines (contraceptive pills or implanted hormonal contraceptives). You should use another reliable method of birth control such as a barrier method (such as a condom).

Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.

## Men and contraception

Your female partner must avoid becoming pregnant while you are taking this medicine because it could harm the baby. If your female partner is able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective contraception:

- while on treatment, and
- for at least 3 months after stopping treatment.

Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.

- A clean empty cup (not included in the package)
- A cup of room temperature (below 30°C) drinking water or milk
- An oral syringe (provided by your pharmacist) with 0.5 mL graduation marks
- A paper towel

## Preparing a suspension of Rozlytrek

Step 1. Wash your hands.

Step 2. Count the number of capsules indicated by your healthcare professional to prepare the suspension.

Step 3. Place a clean empty cup on a paper towel.

Step 4. Tap the capsule to loosen the contents inside.

Step 5. Hold the capsule above the clean empty cup to avoid spilling.

Step 6. Open the capsule by gently pressing in on the capsule and gently twisting both sides apart.

Pour the contents into the clean cup ( Figure A ).

Figure A

<!-- image -->

- Step 7. Tap both sides of the capsule shell and check to ensure all contents have gone into the cup.
- If the contents of the capsule are spilled outside of the cup, empty the cup contents, and use another capsule. Go to Step C1 for clean-up instructions and then start over at Step 1.
- Step 8. Push the syringe plunger all the way down to remove any air in the oral syringe ( Figure B ).

Figure B

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

| • Step 9. Take the cup of room temperature (below 30°C) drinking water or milk. Using the syringe, withdraw the exact volume* of room temperature drinking water or milk from the cup ( Figure C ). *Your healthcare professional will tell you how much liquid to use. Do not use any other type of liquid.   | FigureC   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Step 10. Add the drinking water or milk from the syringe to the cup with the content of the capsule(s) ( FigureD ).                                                                                                                                                                                            | FigureD   |
| Step 11. Let the suspension sit for 15 minutes ( Figure E ). Note: It is important to do this to get an even suspension, otherwise you may not get the correct dose.                                                                                                                                           |           |
| Step 12. Swirl the suspension several times to evenly mix the medicine in the liquid ( Figure F ). Note : The suspension will be cloudy if you have used water.                                                                                                                                                | Figure E  |
| Step 13. Push the plunger of the syringe all the way down to remove any air in the syringe ( Figure G ).                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FigureG   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 14. Swirl the medicine cup again before placing the syringe in the cup ( Figure H ).

Step 15. Immediately place the syringe into the cup and slowly pull back the plunger and withdraw the exact volume of suspension to reach your prescribed dose of Rozlytrek ( Figure I ).

- Your healthcare professional will tell you how much suspension to withdraw for the prescribed dose.
- Do not wait to withdraw the suspension. If it sits for too long, the medicine may settle to the bottom, and you may not get the correct dose.

## Step 16. Check the amount in the syringe ( Figure J ).

With the tip of the syringe pointing up, check:

- you have withdrawn the correct volume of suspension
- there are no large bubbles

Note: If you have not withdrawn the correct volume, or if there are large bubbles inside:

- put the syringe into the cup again
- push the medicine back into the cup
- then withdraw the medicine again (start at Step15)

Shake the syringe quickly. Give Rozlytrek immediately after it is drawn up into the syringe.

If not taken within 2 hours , throw away the medicine from the syringe.  Go to Step C1 for clean-up instructions and then start at Step 2 to remix a new dose.

## Administration by mouth

Step A1. Sit the patient upright when giving a dose of Rozlytrek by mouth ( Figure K ).

Place the oral syringe into the mouth with the tip along either cheek.

Slowly push the plunger all the way down.

Note : Giving Rozlytrek too fast may cause choking.

Step A2. Check that there is no medicine left in the oral syringe ( Figure L ).

If some suspension remains in the oral syringe, repeat step A1.

Step A3. Give some water right after giving the prescribed dose of Rozlytrek.

In case of a strong aftertaste, the child can be breast-fed or given milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Administration through a gastric or nasogastric tube

You can take or give the suspension through a nasogastric or gastric tube placed by the healthcare professional.  Check the manufacturer's instructions for the size and dimensions of the enteral tube. Make sure that the tube size is at least 8 French or higher to prevent clogging of the tube if your aliquots (amount of suspension) is 3 mL or higher.

To take or give Rozlytrek doses of 3 mL or higher, split the dose and give it in at least 2 parts. Flush the tube with same amount of water or milk after giving each part.

Neonates and children with fluid restrictions may require minimal flushing volumes of 1 mL to 3 mL to deliver Rozlytrek. The aliquots should be adjusted accordingly.

To take or give Rozlytrek doses of 30 mL, split the dose into at least three 10 mL parts. Flush the tube with the same amount of water or milk after giving each part. The tube should be flushed with water or milk after delivering Rozlytrek.

In case of any questions consult your healthcare professional.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step C1

- Wash your hands and all the items used to give Rozlytrek.
- Remove the syringe plunger from the syringe barrel.
- Use only clean water to rinse the syringe parts and the cup used to prepare the suspension. Let all items dry before the next use.
- Put the syringe plunger back into the syringe barrel when dry.
- Any unused medicinal product or waste material, including the remaining suspension (not administered) should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. The remaining suspension (not administered) should not be discarded in wastewater.
- Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

## 1. What Rozlytrek is and what it is used for

## What Rozlytrek is

Rozlytrek is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance 'entrectinib'.

## What Rozlytrek is used for

Rozlytrek is used to treat either:

- adults, adolescents, and children older than 1 month with solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body that are caused by a change in a gene called 'neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase' ( NTRK ), or
- adults with a type of lung cancer called 'non-small cell lung cancer' (NSCLC) that is caused by a change in a gene called ' ROS1'.

This medicine is used for solid tumour cancers when:

- a test has shown that your cancer cells have a change in genes called ' NTRK ' (see 'How Rozlytrek works' below), and
- your cancer has spread within the affected organ or to other organs in your body or if surgery to remove the cancer is likely to cause severe complications, and
- you have not previously been given medicines called ' NTRK inhibitors'
- other treatments have not worked or are not suitable for you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicine is used if your lung cancer (NSCLC):

- is ' ROS1 -positive' - this means that your cancer cells have a change in a gene called ' ROS1 ' (see 'How Rozlytrek works' below), and
- is advanced - for example, has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic), and
- you have not previously been given medicines called ' ROS1 inhibitors'.

## How Rozlytrek works

Rozlytrek works by blocking the action of faulty enzymes. These faulty enzymes are caused by a change in the NTRK or ROS1 genes that make them. The faulty enzymes make the cancer cells grow.

Rozlytrek may slow down or stop the growth of the cancer. It may also help to shrink your cancer.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Rozlytrek

## Do not take Rozlytrek

- if you are allergic to entrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek if:

- you have recently had memory loss, confusion, hallucinations, or mental status changes
- you have had fractured bones, or conditions which may increase your risk of breaking bones, called 'osteoporosis' or 'osteopaenia'
- you take medicine to lower the uric acid in your blood
- you have heart failure (when your heart struggles to pump blood to supply oxygen to the body) - signs can include cough, feeling short of breath, or swelling in your legs or arms
- you have ever had heart problems or a heart conduction problem called 'prolonged QTc interval' - this is shown on an 'electro-cardiogram' (ECG), or by low levels of electrolytes in your blood
- you have an inherited problem called 'galactose intolerance', 'congenital lactase deficiency' or 'glucose-galactose malabsorption'.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek.

## ANNEX IV

## SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for entrectinib, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on myocarditis from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in nine cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between entrectinib and myocarditis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing entrectinib should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for entrectinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing entrectinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
