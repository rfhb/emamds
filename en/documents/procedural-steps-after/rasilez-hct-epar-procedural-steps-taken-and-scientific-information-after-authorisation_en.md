In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to implement minor amendments in sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 and 4.7, 5.2 of Rasilez SmPC and package leaflet in alignment with Rasilez/HCTZ product information, as well as an editorial change in Annex II.  Moreover, section 4.2 of the Rasilez/HCTZ SmPC has been updated to cross refer to sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 in alignment with Rasilez SmPC.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data extension study.

The long-term safety is evaluated in terms of growth and development, through height and weight measurement, with added neurocognitive and renal function evaluations as follow-up measures performed only in patients with secondary hypertension (19 patients).

In the primary analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean changes in weight, height, or BMI between the treatment groups (aliskiren compared to the enalapril) from baseline to long term visit (Week 104).

In patients after 104 weeks (Week 156), there were LS mean decreases from Baseline in weight and BMI in both treatment groups, with a slightly larger decrease in the aliskiren compared to the enalapril treatment group. There was a greater LS mean increase from Baseline in height after 104 weeks (Week 156) in secondary hypertension patients compared to the increase observed after 52 weeks (Week 104) in primary hypertension patients, which is expected in these growing paediatric patients. Results of the neurocognitive assessments, performed only in patients with secondary hypertension, showed some improvements in most of the test scores, with no meaningful difference between the treatment groups.

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the results of study SPP100F2301 (ATMOSPHERE) a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, parallel group, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of both aliskiren monotherapy and aliskiren/enalapril combination therapy compared to enalapril monotherapy, on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II IV).

The RMP (v 13.2) has also been updated to reflect the study results.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data monotherapy and of the combination of aliskiren with enalapril compared to enalapril for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity benefit in a double-blind active controlled randomised study in 7,064 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV)  and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤35%), of which 62% had a history of hypertension. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death and first hospitalisation for heart failure. The final results of the study did not demonstrate statistically that aliskiren was non-inferior to enalapril on the primary endpoint; however, there was essentially no difference in the observed incidence rates between aliskiren and enalapril. There was no significant benefit of adding aliskiren to enalapril. Treatment effects were similar in patients with diabetes and with renal insufficiency. The incidence of adjudicated stroke was not significantly different between the aliskiren and enalapril groups or between the combination and enalapril groups. The incidence of adverse events tended to be higher in patients with diabetes, or with GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m², or with age ≥ 65 years; however, there was no difference between patients treated with aliskiren and those treated with enalapril. The incidence of certain adverse events was similar between aliskiren and enalapril groups while there was an increased incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal impairment/renal failure and hypotension related events with the combination of aliskiren and enalapril. There was a statistically significant increased incidence of syncope with the combination of aliskiren and enalapril compared to enalapril in the overall population and in the subgroups NYHA I/II overall.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 11.1%, 13.3%, and 11.0% in the combination, aliskiren, and enalapril groups, respectively. Statistically significantly higher incidences in the occurrence of cardiac failure and ischaemic stroke were also found for aliskiren compared to enalapril in patients with NYHA I/II with hypertension, and in the occurrence of chronic cardiac failure and ventricular extrasystole in patients with NYHA III/IV with hypertension. For the combination of aliskiren and enalapril there were statistically significant differences in the rate of angina unstable compared to enalapril. No clinically relevant differences in efficacy or safety results were observed in the subpopulation of elderly patients with a history of hypertension and chronic heart failure Class III compared to the overall study population.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for Rasilez and section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of Rasilez HCT on the basis of the completed long term extended paediatric study CSPP100A2365E1.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data

Aliskiren has been evaluated for safety in a randomised, double-blind, 8-week study in 267 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, followed by an extension study including 208 patients treated for 52 weeks. This study was extended with a 52-week doubleblind, randomised study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril in 208 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years (at baseline in the previous study). At the end of this extension study, changes in msSBP from baseline were similar with aliskiren compared to enalapril ( 7.63 mmHg vs.  7.94 mmHg) in the full analysis set. However, the significance of the non-inferiority testing was not maintained when the analysis was performed on the per-protocol set. In addition, due to the possibility of up-titration if medically necessary to control the msSBP, no conclusion can be drawn on the appropriate posology of aliskiren in patients aged 6 to 17 years. In the 8-week randomised, double-blind study with aliskiren monotherapy in 267 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, fasting trough aliskiren concentrations at day 28 were comparable to those observed in other studies in both adults and children using similar aliskiren doses. In juvenile repeated toxicity studies in rats aliskiren at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day was associated with high mortality and severe morbidity. Increased systemic exposure to aliskiren (&gt;400-fold higher in 8 day old rats compared with adult rats) was observed. The MDR1 gene expression in juvenile rats was also significantly lower when compared to adult rats. The increased aliskiren exposure in juvenile rats appears to be attributed mainly to lack of maturation of PMedicinal Product no longer authorised

Earlier studies have indicated that proteinuria has been associated with increased renal as well as cardiovascular risk. A significant reduction in albuminuria has been achieved with the use of renin inhibition through aliskiren. Therefore it was hypothesized that aliskiren would offer additional renal and cardiovascular protection when administered on top of other RAS blockers, leading to the design of ALTITUDE. ALTITUDE was a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized trial that enrolled patients with Type 2 diabetes |

and nephropathy as determined by macro/microalbuminuria and/or eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Nearly half of the patients also had significant cardiovascular disease. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. Aliskiren was tested against placebo when added to standard therapy including an ACEI or ARB.

The primary objective of the ALTITUDE study, was to determine whether aliskiren, compared to placebo, delays the occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complications when added to conventional treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and renal events. As part of this procedure the MAH submitted the final CSR of the study fulfilling in this way the obligation mentioned in Annex II of all aliskiren containing products. In addition the MAH updated the section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the final results of the ALTITUDE study including the 1 year safety extension phase.

The efficacy results did not indicate any advantage of adding aliskiren on top of standard therapy including an ACEI or ARB. The CHMP considers that, the presented data consistently suggest that the combination of inhibitors/blockers of the renin-angiotensin system lowers proteinuria and in addition increases the risk of cardiovascular or renal events in high cardiovascular risk patients.

The CHMP concludes that the complete data of the ALTITUDE study do not add any new information to the benefit/risk profile of aliskiren in the approved hypertension indication and the benefit/risk balance of the aliskiren containing products remains positive. Moreover, it confirms the appropriateness of the wording regarding the

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority Medicinal | 23/01/2014 Product | The MAH submitted the final CSR for APOLLO study. APOLLO study was designed to determine whether treatment with an aliskiren-based regimen in part combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide compared to a non-aliskiren based regimen, both on top of non-study BP lowering agents, where applicable, reduces the risks of major CV events (composite of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and significant heart failure), and to determine whether treatment with an aliskiren-based regimen compared to a non-aliskiren based regimen prevents decline in the ability to perform everyday activities independently, or/and prevents decline in renal function and reduces total mortality. In view of the preliminary findings in the ALTITUDE trial (aliskiren treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with renal dysfunction on top of standard RAS blocking therapy) which was terminated early in December 2011 based on futility and potential increases in adverse events in the aliskiren group, it was agreed with regulatory authorities to contraindicate the use of aliskiren in diabetic hypertensive patients on concomitant RAS blocker therapy. Many patients enrolled in APOLLO were diabetic and were receiving another agent acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) such as an ACEI or and ARB as standard of care, and it was decided to exclude them from APOLLO. longer |

Following the exclusion of diabetics from the study, Novartis concluded that the study in its current design would not provide the needed information about the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in elderly hypertensive patients within the required timeframe and decided in agreement with Health Authorities to terminate the study early.

At the time of the early termination of the APOLLO study, a total of 1759 patients had been randomized as against the originally planned 11,000 patients. A total of 25 primary CV composite endpoints had accrued in the study as against the planned 2000. These low numbers significantly limit interpretation of the results.

The CHMP considers that the presented data set does not add new significant information either for safety or efficacy of aliskiren because of the study limitations (premature termination of the study). The safety findings are consistent with the known safety profile of aliskiren in the general hypertensive population. Despite the fact that the study enrolled a vulnerable elderly population with elevated cardiovascular risk and that the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was low the limited data set does not allow drawing any meaningful conclusion on the safety profile of aliskiren when used in elderly patients at the highest approved strength (300 mg).

The CHMP considers that this new data does not warrant any SmPC changes. The premature termination of the APOLLO study leaves unsolved the problem of the doseresponse of aliskiren in elderly hypertensive patients.  This area of missing information is reflected in the RMP of the aliskiren containing products and appropriate pharmacovigilance activities are employed in order to

This paper was reviewed by the MAH and since the results with orange or apple juice were pertinent to the use of aliskiren, an update to the Summary of Product Characteristics was proposed in order to add a statement for not recommending the concomitant use of aliskiren with orange or apple juice. When combined with all available data (clinical trial, literature and post-marketing), the results of the study described in the above mentioned paper showed that the |

bioavailability of aliskiren is most sensitive to coadministration with food in general.

The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of different types of foods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due to this additive effect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded.

Literature data indicate that vegetable components or extracts may decrease aliskiren bioavailability. Therefore, the CHMP considered that based on the available data the concomitant consumption of vegetable components or extracts (including herbal teas and fruit juices) should be avoided in conjunction with aliskiren intake.

Since the approval of aliskiren/HCTZ, a number of clinical studies have been conducted and their results, as assessed by the CHMP in the due procedures, consistently confirmed the additive antihypertensive effect observed when aliskiren is combined with HCTZ and support the use of the registered doses. Yet some efficacy issues, mainly related to the aliskiren component, remain poorly characterised: there is still limited information on the use in elderly and very elderly hypertensive patients and, in particular, on the dose-response of aliskiren in this patient population; no evidence of favourable effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for aliskiren and aliskiren-containing combinations is available till now. Of potential minor concern is the recently emerged interaction with flavonoids contained in fruit juices, that could implicate that concomitant assumption of vegetable components or extracts should be not recommended, which would be a limitation to the use of aliskiren, with a possible impact on

compliance. This issue is currently under evaluation. Recently identified interactions between aliskiren, furosemide and torasemide, possibly mediated by competition with the renal OATP-mediated transport have emerged. Appropriate risk minimisation measures have been employed in this respect as reflected by the recently updated wording in the SmPC.

The safety profile of aliskiren/HCTZ has evolved from the time of the MA and several safety updates of the product information have been implemented. In particular, the Article 20 referral review, based on the results of the Altitude study led to significant amendment of the SmPC with the introduction of a contraindication of use of aliskiren in diabetic patients or patients with renal impaired concomitantly treated with an ACEI or ARB, and of a warning stating that dual blockade of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system by combining aliskiren with an ACE inhibitors or an ARB is not recommended in all patients. A number of safety issues related particularly to the aliskiren component are currently under monitoring. Overall the up-dated safety profile of Aliskiren/HCTZ in the approved indication is still considered acceptable and is adequately reflected in the currently approved PI pending further updates which are subject to on-going assessment procedures.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Rasilez HCT in the treatment of essential hypertension remains favourable and therefore recommends the renewal of the marketing authorisation.

o.d. (compared to placebo), on top of conventional treatment (either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), reduces cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. On 14 December 2011, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) of the ALTITUDE trial recommended the study to be halted due to futility and potential for excess harm in patients receiving ALI (non-fatal stroke, renal complications, hyperkalaemia and hypotension in this high-risk study population was observed).

The submitted clinical study report confirms previously submitted and assessed ASTRONAUT preliminary results and did not show a significant benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy including an ACEI or ARB in patients hospitalized with a recent episode of AHF, neither with respect to the primary endpoint (CV death or HF rehospitalization within 6 months), nor with respect to key secondary endpoint (first confirmed occurrence of either CV death or HF rehospitalisation within 12 months). The subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant interaction of treatment by diabetes status at baseline for the composite of CV death and HF re-hospitalization within 12 months and all-cause mortality within 12 months, showing excess of CV events and the increase in all-cause death in the aliskiren group in diabetic patients. In the subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence Interval: 1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in favour of aliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50 -0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003.

The CHMP concludes that the presented data doesn't raise any additional safety concerns besides those already reflected in the product information and that the overall the benefit/risk of aliskiren containing products remains unchanged. The agreed text included in section 5.1 of the SmPC is considered by the CHMP as appropriately reflecting the relevant findings from authorised   |

No formal aliskiren/torasemid drug-drug interaction study has been performed. The available clinical data doesn't show that higher doses of torasemid were needed when taken together with aliskiren. The post-marketing data doesn't indicate a higher incidence of AEs attributable to a reduced torasemide effect when aliskiren is taken together with torasemide.

The reported frequency for this ADR in relation to aliskiren alone is 'uncommon'. In addition, 'orthostatic hypotension' is listed in the SmPC as a common ADR for hydrochlorothiazide. As the indication of Rasilez HCT is for add-on and replacement therapy, the risk for hypotension as compared to initial therapy is likely reduced. Based on these considerations and controlled clinical trial data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC of all aliskiren containing products in order to: - include the adverse reactions 'liver disorder', 'jaundice', 'hepatitis' and 'liver failure' based on several reported cases of 'liver disorder' accompanied by clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of marked hepatic dysfunction, 7 cases of 'jaundice' (5 of them with dechallenge+), 2 cases of 'yellow skin' (both with dechallenge +) and 4 fatal cases of 'hepatic failure' (including one case of 'liver failure fulminant' with consequent liver transplant). - change the system organ class (SOC) for the ADR 'dizziness' from Nervous system disorders to Cardiac disorders and the SOC for 'edema peripheral' from 'General disorders and administration site conditions' to 'Cardiac disorders' in order to conform to the primary path for the mapping of terms in the most current MedDRA version. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications Medicinal Product | 30/05/2013 | 01/07/2013 no | PL Based on the data resulted from a systematic review of available information on liver events from the published literature, the MAH's safety database and clinical trial database, the MAH proposed the inclusion of ADR 'liver disorder' in the SmPC section 4.8 of all aliskiren containing products. This proposal was found acceptable by the CHMP since it was supported by several reported cases of 'liver disorder' accompanied by clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of marked hepatic dysfunction. In addition, at the CHMP request, the MAH accepted to include 'jaundice', 'hepatitis' and 'liver failure' as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC of all liskiren containing products under the system organ class (SOC) 'Hepatobiliary disorders' with the frequency 'unknown'. The CHMP based its request on 7 cases of 'jaundice' (5 of them with dechallenge+), 2 cases of 'yellow skin' (both with dechallenge +) and 4 fatal cases of 'hepatic failure' (including one case of 'liver failure fulminant' with consequent liver transplant). In addition, change of the SOC for the ADR 'dizziness' from 'Nervous system disorders' to 'Cardiac disorders' and the SOC for ADR 'edema peripheral' from 'General disorders and administration site conditions' to 'Cardiac disorders' was implemented in order to reflect the latest primary path for the mapping of terms presented in the most current longer |

| WS/0280   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. The MAH proposed the update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) in order to update the information regarding aliskiren interaction with furosemide following completion of the drug-to-drug interaction study CSPP100A2255. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the   | 13/12/2012   | 28/01/2013 no   | SmPC longer   | The MAH performed the present study [CSPP100A2255] with the aim of assessing whether a pharmacodynamic (diuretic efficacy) interaction exists between aliskiren and furosemide in heart failure patients. The study assessed the effect of a single (150 mg) and multiple doses (150 and 300 mg/day) of aliskiren on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of once daily 60 mg furosemide at steady state in patients with chronic heart failure. Overall, the study data suggest that aliskiren may decrease the efficacy of furosemide. Results of study CSPP100A2255 are the basis of a proposal for a modification of SmPC text to update the sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. authorised                                      |

The safety update of the SmPC and Package Leaflet was based on the MAH's systematic review of all available information on anaphylactic reactions associated with the use of aliskiren from clinical studies and the MAH's post- marketing safety database. A number of cases of 'anaphylactic reaction' could be retrieved from the post- marketing database, of which six had no alternative explanation other than treatment with aliskiren.

Update of sections 4.9 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to add the information on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in patients with end stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis following completion of the study SPP100A2262. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 19/04/2012 25/05/2012 Medicinal Product no | Aliskiren is mainly eliminated through the hepatobiliary route. Renal excretion only accounts for 0.6% of the administered dose. No adjustment of the initial dosage is required in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment. The MAH has conducted a study (Study SPP100A2262) to characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of aliskiren in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients receiving haemodialysis (HD). It is concluded that no dose adjustment is needed in patients with ESRD. A novel and important finding of the study is that aliskiren cannot be efficiently removed by HD. Based on the data of Study SPP100A2262, the MAH proposes to change the section 4.9 and 5.2 of the SmPC.                                                        |

The most frequent are osteoarthritis, gout, bursitis, infectious diseases, injury, osteomyelitis, and autoimmune diseases. However, it is also considered that hypersensitivity/allergic reactions sometimes manifest with systemic involvement including arthralgia. Joint swelling is also very commonly associated with the above mentioned joint disorders, or could be linked to peripheral oedema or to systemic manifestation of hypersensitivity reactions. This review focused on arthralgia and joint swelling cases where underlying hypersensitivity reactions likely played a role in the development of arthralgia and where both conditions could have been due to the direct effect of aliskiren. In response to the request from CHMP, MAH conducted a comprehensive review of all cases of 'Arthrlagia'. Based on this new analysis, CHMP requested the addition of the ADR 'Arthralgia' in section 4.8 of aliskiren containing product SmPCs. authorised |

Conducted review of all cases of SCARs and of arthralgia did not demonstrate an evidence of a clear causal relationship between these events and aliskiren treatment. However, the analysis revealed a possible relationship between these events and hypersensitivity. Subsequently MAH has performed a detailed analysis of available data. The evidence presented is considered to support the inclusion of post-marketing events of \"hypersensitivity\" into the SmPC section 4.8 (undesirable effects) for aliskiren. |

| WS/0073 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SPC in view of the results of study CSPP100A2112 investigating the potential interaction between aliskiren and grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal Product                                                  | 17/02/2011 18/03/2011 SmPC no | This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.5 of the SPC in view of the results of study CSPP100A2112 investigating the potential interaction between aliskiren and grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with aliskiren.
