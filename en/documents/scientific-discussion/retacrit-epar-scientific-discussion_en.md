## 1. Introduction

Patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) develop uraemic anaemia as one of the most obvious signs of the  disease.  This  symptom  is  caused  by  impeded  renal  production  of  erythropoietin  (EPO).  EPO  is produced  primarily  in  the  kidneys  and  stimulates  red  blood  cell  counts  (RBC)  production  by promoting  survival,  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  erythroid  progenitors  in  the  bone  marrow. Epoetin-containing medicinal products are currently indicated for several conditions besides anaemia in patients with chronic renal failure, namely, chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients, for increasing the yield of autologous blood from patients in a pre-donation programme, and for reducing exposure  to  allogenic  blood  transfusions  in  adult  non-iron-deficient  patients  prior  to  major  elective orthopaedic surgery.

The  application  for  SB309  has  been  submitted  as  a  'similar  biological  medicinal  product'  under Article 10(4) of directive 2001/83/EC (as amended), hereafter referred to as biosimilar.

SB309 has been developed as a biosimilar product referring to epoetin alfa, authorised in the EU, e.g. in the UK under the brand name Eprex (Janssen-Cilag Ltd.) and in Germany under the name Erypo (Ortho Biotech, a division of Janssen-Cilag GmbH).

The claimed indications were:

- -Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in adult and paediatric patients on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis.
- -Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis.
- -Treatment  of  anaemia  and  reduction  of  transfusion  requirements  in  adult  patients  receiving chemotherapy  for  solid  tumours,  malignant  lymphoma  or  multiple  myeloma,  and  at  risk  of transfusion  as  assessed  by  the  patient's  general  status  (e.g.  cardiovascular  status,  pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
- -SB309 can be used to increase  the  yield  of  autologous  blood  from  patients  in  a  predonation programme.  Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic  events.  Treatment  should  only  be  given  to  patients  with  moderate  anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10-13 g/dl [6.2-8.1 mmol/l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are  not  available  or  insufficient  when  the  scheduled  major  elective  surgery  requires  a  large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).

The  claimed  indications  initially  included  also  reduction  of  allogeneic  blood  transfusions  in  adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery. However, during the CHMP scientific  assessment  it  became  evident  that  efficacy  and  safety  of  Epoetin  zeta  have  not  been demonstrated  for  the  SC  route  of  administration  in  immunocompetent  patients.  Therefore,  the applicant withdrew all indications using exclusively the SC route of administration in immunocompetent patients. The remainder of this report focuses on the IV route of administration and the SC route in chemotherapy-related anaemia.

## About the product

Human erythropoietin  is  a  single  chain,  monomeric,  glycosylated  polypeptide  of  165  amino  acids. Erythropoietin for clinical use is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cells as expression system. All epoetins in clinical use have an amino acid sequence similar to endogenous erythropoietin but differ in the glycosylation pattern. Glycosylation influences pharmacokinetics and may affect efficacy and safety, particularly immunogenicity.

The  active  substance  in  SB309  (Epoetin  zeta)  is  a  recombinant  human  erythropoietin  (rhEPO)  of identical primary structure produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The molecular weight of the  glycosylated  protein  is  30.6  kDa  according  to  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph,  40%  of  which  are

carbohydrate structures. The oligosaccharide chains are subject to posttranslational modifications and display heterogeneity to a certain extent.

To support the claim that SB309 is biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Erypo with regard to quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  applicant  has  submitted  a  comparability  exercise  for  a  similar biological  medicinal  product  versus  the  reference  medicinal  product.  The  main  clinical  data  for  the application submitted by the applicant consists of two pharmacokinetic (PK) trials comparing the PK profiles of SB309 and Erypo after single dose administration, and  two phase III trials (one correction phase study and one maintenance phase study) comparing efficacy and safety of intravenously (IV) administered  SB309  and  Erypo  in  patients  with  renal  anaemia.  Two  safety  trials  are  still  ongoing (interim  data  have  been  provided).  The  applicant  received  Scientific  Advice  from  the  CHMP (Procedures No. EMEA/H/SA/469/1/2004/III, 2004 and EMEA/H/SA/469/1/FU/1/2005/II, 2005).

## 2. Quality aspects

## Product description

SB309 [epoetin zeta (INN)] solution for injection in pre-filled syringes contains recombinant human erythropoietin (rhu-EPO, epoetin) as drug substance and water for injection, sodium monohydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, polysorbate 20, glycine, leucine,  isoleucine,  threonine,  glutamic  acid  and  phenylalanine  as  excipients.  The  syringes  (Type I glass) are provided with a fixed steel needle and a plunger stopper with PTFE coating for intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) injection. Eleven different quantitative sizes of pre-filled syringes of SB309 will be available containing defined amounts of epoetin of 1,000 IU up to 40,000 IU, respectively.

The  drug  product  is  presented  as  a  solution  for  injection  in  pre-filled  syringes  in  the  following strengths: 3,333 IU/ml (presentation of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 ml), 10,000 IU/ml (presentations of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 ml) and 40,000 IU/ml (presentations of 0.5, 0.75 and 1 ml), with all strengths exhibiting the same qualitative composition.

## Drug Substance

## Manufacture

The drug substance [epoetin zeta (INN)] is manufactured and released by Norbitec GmbH, D-25436 Uetersen,  Germany.  After  a  series  of  sub  cultivations,  the  cells  are  seeded  into  the  production fermenter. The production is based on a fed-batch process.

The drug substance is recovered from the fermentation broth by a conventional protein purification process  comprising  orthogonal  chromatography  steps  and  a  viral  filtration  step.  The  manufacturing steps are  monitored by process controls that include operational parameters, acceptance criteria and specifications.

The Master Cell Bank (MCB) was established using foetal calf serum (FCS) from a certified source. The Working Cell Bank (WCB) was established without the use of materials from human or animal origin. The cultivation and all subsequent manufacturing steps are also performed without the use of materials from human or animal origin. The cell culture medium is protein-free and does not contain insulin or antibiotics. The selected cell line was analysed with regard to sequence of epoetin cDNA, growth potential, viability, productivity, genetic stability and viral safety.

Process validation data demonstrate that the process steps from thawing the WCB vial, to harvesting the production bioreactor and purification are consistent. All parameters for upstream process (USP) and downstream process (DSP) were maintained within the defined ranges.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adventitious Agents

The  viral  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  Epoetin  zeta  is  assured.  This  is  confirmed  by  the experimental  finding  that  the  CHO  cell  substrates  (MCB,  WCB  and  Post  Production  Cells  (PPC)) show no biological evidence of any productive viral infection. The inherent risk of viral contamination associated with animal-sourced materials (FCS, porcine trypsin) can be excluded, since the cell culture process occurs in serum- and protein-free medium. The data obtained from the comprehensive virus validation studies demonstrate that the purification procedure possesses a reproducibly high and robust capability for virus clearance.

## Characterisation

An extensive characterisation programme has been conducted for the drug substance with respect to the protein backbone as well as the carbohydrate moieties.

An orthogonal set of state-of-the-art analytical methods was established to elucidate structural features of  the  epoetin  zeta  protein  backbone.  The  primary  structure  of  epoetin  zeta  was  confirmed  using peptide  mapping  using  different  enzymes  and  mass  spectroscopy.  Epoetin  zeta  has  been  shown  to contain  an  intact  protein  structure  with  correctly  linked  disulfide  bonds,  integrity  of  the  C-and  Ntermini, and minimal  degradation  caused  by  oxidation and deamidation. Secondary  structure determination using spectroscopic measurements revealed that the alfa helix represents the predominant structure element conforming to the four-helical bundle topology model as predicted for erythropoietin in the literature.

The  carbohydrate  moieties  in  epoetin  zeta  were  characterised  using  a  complementary  panel  of analytical  methods  in  order  to  reveal  or  to  exclude  unusual  glycan  structures  with  a  potentially negative impact on the performance of epoetin zeta. The total glycan pool released from the protein backbone  was  subjected  to  fractionation  by  column  chromatography  and  if  necessary  further  subfractionation  was  performed  using  a  different  stationary  phase  in  order  to  yield  sub-fractions  of sufficient purity. HPAEC-PAD was used as a major analytical tool to classify the glycans with respect to sialylation and antennarity on each level of sub-fractionation. Further analysis of the sub-fractions by mass spectroscopy enabled the ability to identify and/or exclude unique or unusual structures.

Using  NMR-techniques,  glycan  structures  were  elucidated  with  respect  to  their  isomeric  nature. Positions  of  N-acetyllactosamine  repeats  on  antennae,  lack  of  sialylation  of  antennae,  position  of fucosylation (in order to identify/exclude certain Lewis-motifs) and presence of O-acetylated groups were confirmed. O-glycans were mainly characterised by mass spectrometrical methods of the de-Nglycosylated protein.

Applying  this  analytical  strategy,  the  carbohydrate  content  of  epoetin  zeta  was  confirmed  to  be essentially free of unusual, potentially immunogenic structures.

## Specification

Appropriate specifications have been set for analysis of the active substance at release and at the end of shelf life.

## Stability

The claimed shelf-life of the active substance is supported by batch data.

## Comparability Exercise for Active Substance

Epoetin  zeta  was  compared  to  epoetin  alfa,  the  drug  substance  of  the  selected  reference  product Eprex/Erypo  (Janssen-Cilag  GmbH).  For  the  comparability  exercise  the  same  set  of  tests  and analytical procedures were applied to the drug substance and the drug product.

In accordance with the Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products containing Biotechnologyderived Proteins as Active Substance: Quality Issues (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/49348/2005), the applicant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

isolated  active  substance  from  the  reference  medicinal  product  in  order  to  perform  the  comparative analysis at the level of the active substances. Isolation was performed by RP-HPLC.

It  was  demonstrated  that  the  isolated  active  substance  used  in  the  comparability  exercise  is representative of the active substance present in the reference medicinal product.

In  the  comparability  study  focused  on  the  protein  backbone,  the  data  obtained  demonstrated equivalence between the two epoetin products.

With respect to the glycan moieties, the overall range of structures was found to be comparable. Even upon sub-fractionation of glycans of both products a very similar profile with respect to antennarity and  sialylation  was  revealed.  However,  the  amount  of  glycoforms  without  an  O-glycan  chain  was slightly  higher  for  epoetin  zeta  as  compared  to  epoetin  alfa.  On  the  other  hand,  the  amounts  of undesired variants of sialic acid, N-glycolyl neuraminic acid and O-acetyl neuraminic acid were higher in the reference product as compared to epoetin zeta.

Comparison of the purity and in-vivo bioactivity did not reveal any remarkable difference.

In terms of quality, the drug substance comparability between SB309 and Eprex/Erypo is considered demonstrated.

## Drug Product

The  drug  product  SB309  is  provided  as  a  liquid  ready-to-use  solution  in  a  single-dose  prefilled syringe. It is formulated based on epoetin zeta as active ingredient at concentrations of 3,333 IU/mL, 10,000  IU/mL  and  40,000  IU/mL.  Eleven  dosage  strengths  are  provided  from  1,000  IU  to  40,000 IU/syringe dependent of different filling volumes (0.3 to 1.0 mL).

## Product Development and Manufacture

The drug product contains recombinant human erythropoietin (rhu-EPO, epoetin) as drug substance and  water  for  injection,  sodium  monohydrogen  phosphate,  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate,  sodium chloride, calcium chloride, polysorbate 20, glycine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, glutamic acid and phenylalanine as excipients. The dosage strengths only differ with respect to drug substance amount. The concentrations of the excipients are identical for all strengths.

The manufacturing process is a conventional process beginning with the dissolution of the excipients followed by addition of the drug substance bulk solution. After mixing, the bulk drug product solution is 0.22 µm filtered, sterile filtered and aseptically filled into syringes. The drug product manufacturing process is validated.

## Product Specification

The batches selected for the batch analysis were considered to be acceptable.

## Stability of the Product

A shelf life of 24 months for the dosage strengths 1,000 IU, 2,000 IU and 3,000 IU and 18 months for the dosage strengths 4,000 IU, 5,000 IU, 6,000 IU, 8,000 IU, 10,000 IU, 20,000 IU, 30,000 IU and 40,000 IU is demonstrated when stored at 2-8 °C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Comparability Exercise for Drug Product

SB309 drug product batches were compared to Eprex/Erypo drug product batches.

All batches were found to be similar with regard to protein backbone as well as carbohydrate moieties and hence the overall comparability of SB309 and Eprex/Erypo is considered demonstrated.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In  general,  the  dossier  for  SB309  is  of  good  quality.  The  two  major  concerns  as  well  as  the  minor deficiencies that had been identified and summarised in the Day 120 LoQ, have been appropriately addressed by the applicant.

Very  extensive,  high  quality  studies  were  performed  to  compare  SB309  to  the  reference  product Eprex/Erypo at both the drug substance and the drug product level. Likewise the characterisation of the  drug  substance  and  the  comparability  studies  to  compare  drug  substance  from  different  scale manufacturing process is considered high quality with an extreme level of detail applying state-of-theart analytical methods.

Comparability studies confirmed that the protein backbone of epoetin zeta is comparable to epoetin alfa.  Regarding the overall range of glycan structures a high level of similarity between SB309 and Eprex/Erypo  was  demonstrated.  Minor  differences  were  noted  at  the  level  of  particular  structural elements. These reflect the foreseen variability of glycoproteins derived from different manufacturing processes.

The identified minor differences in glycostructures are not of concern and particularly the lower levels of undesired glycostructures such as N-glycolyl neuraminic acids and O-acetylated neuraminic acids in SB309 as compared to the reference product are not considered to pose any safety issues.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Toxicity  studies  were  in  compliance  with  Good  Laboratory  Practice  with  the  exception  that bioanalytical  and  toxicokinetic  elements  of  these  two  studies  did  not  include  independent  Quality Assurance inspection or audit of reports. In mid 2006, CHMP issued guidance 1 on the development of similar  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietin  and  the  non-clinical  testing  of epoetin  zeta  is  therefore  judged  against  this  guidance,  which  requires  that  the  applicant  shall demonstrate the 'comparability of the product applied for to a reference product authorised in the EU'. The applicant sought scientific advice from the CHMP in early 2004, including on the necessity of any preclinical  studies.    The  dossier  that  was  submitted  includes  the  recommended  studies.    Testing comprised comparative in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics and comparative repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs.  Local tolerance by a number of routes was also tested.  In accordance with CHMP  guidance,  no  studies  on  safety  pharmacology,  reproductive  toxicology,  mutagenicity  or carcinogenicity were conducted.

## Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic  biosimilarity  of  two  batches  of  SB309  and  Erypo  was  tested  in  three  in-vitro studies  measuring  receptor  binding,  proliferation  and  second  messenger  activation  in  cultured  cells, and in one in-vivo study (normocythaemic mouse assay according to Ph. Eur.). There was a different slope of the displacement curve and a different EC50 value for SB309 as compared to Erypo in the receptor binding, study # 176.  A possible reason could be that SB309 and the reference product Erypo were  not  compared  directly  in  the  same  experiments  but  investigated  in  consecutive  experimental setups..  There were initial problems (e.g. high variability of the results) with the functional in-vitro assays in study #177 intended to measure burst- and colony forming activity in erythrocyte precursors. The  Applicant  repeated  these  experiments  with  fresh  cell  material  and  thereby  obtained  reliable results.  The  effects  of  Retacrit  and  Erypo  were  highly  similar.    In  the  third  in-vitro  study,  direct comparison of SB309 and Erypo was performed as desirable at the level of receptor binding as well as in functional assays although the relevance of the results was somewhat limited by the low number of replicates.

An in vivo comparison of the potency of SB309 and of Erypo over the dosage range 3.3 to 90 IU/ml in normocythaemic mice was undertaken using methodology described in the European Pharmacopoeia (01/2005:    1316  corrected,  method  B).    EPO-BRP#2  provided  by  the  European  Directorate  for  the Quality of Medicines, European Pharmacopoeia Commission was also tested.  The assay quantifies reticulocytes by fluorescence activated cell sorting of blood drawn four days after one subcutaneous administration  to  female  B6D2F1  mice.    This  method  allows  establishment  of  a  dose-response relationship  for  each  test  material  and  includes  a  check  of  parallelism  of  regressions  for  a  valid quantitative comparison.  The relative potency should be between 0.80 and 1.25.

Results are presented in the table below, where REF refers to results with Erypo, test 1 refers to one batch of SB309 (0050410/10000), Test 2 refers to a different batch of SB309 (500-M2) and BRP-#2 refers to the standard provided by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, European Pharmacopoeia Commission.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

No studies were submitted.

## Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Two studies of 3 months duration are reported:  one is in the rat and used subcutaneous administration and  one  is  in  the  dog  and  used  intravenous  administration.    Both  routes  are  used  clinically.    Two batches of each product were used in each study.

## Rat 13 week study by the subcutaneous route:

In this study, rats were allocated to treatment groups as shown in the table below.  Additional rats were allocated  for  use  in  additional  haematology  screens  and  for  erythropoietin  and  anti-erythropoietin antibody  determinations.    Blood  was  drawn  prior  to  dosing,  on  day  5  at  13  time  points  from  2.5 minutes to 24 hours after dosing, and again at the end of weeks 5, 9, 13 and 17.  All rats were dosed by subcutaneous injection three times a week with SB309 at one of two dose levels, or with Erypo at one dose level, or control (saline), for 13 weeks.

There  was  significant  mortality  in  this  study,  such  that  dosing  at  2500  IU/kg  was  stopped  18  days earlier than planned in female rats.  3 of 15 male rats and 7 of 15 female rats treated with higher dose SB309 died prematurely in this study.  With the same dose of Erypo, 5 out of 15 male and 7 out of 15 female rats died prematurely.  There was additionally one death in a male rat treated with 500 IU/kg SB309.    All  these  deaths  were  attributed  to  exaggerated  pharmacology  with  cause  of  death  being moderate  to  marked  congestion  with  dilatation  of  vessels,  haemorrhage,  stasis  of  blood  and development  of  thrombi.    The  frequency  and  causes  of  deaths  are  not  indicative  of  a  difference between the products.  One control female rat was also found dead during the study.

There were no differences between higher dose SB309 and Erypo with regard to body weight, body weight  gain,  food  and  drinking  water  consumption,  biochemical  parameters,  ophthalmological  or auditory examinations.

Comparing  the  two  products,  SB309  caused  a  slight  reduction  in  urinary  specific  gravity  and  a significant increase in urine volume in males at week 6, in comparison with Erypo.

Haematological parameters of haemoglobin, red blood cell count, reticulocyte count and haematocrit consistently  changed  in  the  expected  manner  and  in  comparison  to  controls,  each  product  caused  a statistically  significant  rise.    Comparing  values  between  the  two  products,  there  was,  in  general,  no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

difference. At 6 weeks, there was a statistically significant difference in values for reticulocytes and red  blood  cells  of  male  rats  treated  with  either  high  dose  SB309  or  with  Erypo.  Histopathological examination of organs showed an increase in the number of haematopoietic cells compared to controls in spleen and bone marrow, as would be expected.  Associated lesions in the thymus, kidney, stomach, heart and adrenal glands are considered to be related effects and were of mild to marked congestion and haemorrhage with the vessels dilated and filled with erythrocytes.   The number of rats per group that exhibit increased haemopoietic cells in spleen and in bone marrow, and other effects was usually greater with SB309 than with Erypo.

## Toxicokinetics

Erythropoietin was analysed in serum taken from rats and dogs in the 13 week toxicology studies.  A validated  double  sandwich  ELISA  method  was  used  to  quantify  erythropoietin.  Antibodies  to erythropoietin were assessed by a radio-immune-precipitation assay.  The assay uses radiolabelled 125 Irecombinant human erythropoietin to bind circulating antibodies against human erythropoietin in the serum of treated subjects.  The bound complex is precipitated by protein G and the radioactivity in the precipitate  is  measured  by  a  gamma  counter  to  allow  quantification  of  antibodies  to  erythropoietin. Suitability of the assay was shown for human serum for specificity, stability of samples stored at -20ºC for  over  9  months  and  for  three  freeze-thaw  cycles.    The  applicability  of  the  assay  for  rat  and  dog serum  was  shown  by  a  comparative  test  with  human  and  rat  serum  samples  spiked  with  rabbit antiserum  against recombinant  human  erythropoietin.    Neutralising potential of antibodies to erythropoietin was assessed using stimulation of an erythroleukaemic cell line by erythropoietin.  The presence  of  antibodies  that  neutralise  erythropoietin  in  tested  samples  is  indicated  by  inhibition  of erythropoietin-mediated cellular growth by test serum.

The exposure achieved in this study during Day 5 is presented in the two tables below, with values from 3 rats per sex per time point.  In these tables, Test 1 and Test 2 refer to SB309 and Reference indicates Erypo.  Mean Cmax and AUC and serum half-life were minimally lower in the 2500 IU/kg SB309 than in the Erypo group, but there was no statistically significant difference between SB309 and Erypo at the same nominal dose of 2500 IU/kg.  The difference in exposure between the lower and higher dose of SB309 was not proportionate with the dose increase.

## Antigenicity

4 rats treated with SB309 developed antibodies to erythropoietin, with the first positive test in week 4, and 4 treated with Erypo were antibody positive or had borderline titres (i.e. close to the limit of detection), with the first positive test in week 3.

In conclusion, this study revealed no meaningful difference in the safety profile with respect to pharmacodynamic effects, antigenicity or toxicity between SB309 and Erypo.

## Dog 13 week study by the intravenous route

In this study, two male and two female dogs were allocated to groups as shown in the table below and were injected intravenously once every day for 13 weeks with SB309 at one of two dose levels, or Erypo at one dose level, or control.  Half the dogs were killed for post-mortem examinations and half entered  a  recovery  (i.e.  dose  free)  period  of  5  weeks,  and  were  then  killed  for  post-mortem examinations.  The study thus ran for 18 weeks.  After day 10, the dose administered was reduced as shown in the table:  this was a planned change, and the first 10 days of dosing is described as a loading dose.  Electrocardiography was performed on Day 1, and in weeks 6 and 13 before administration of drug and at 5 minutes after administration, for 1 minute.  Urine was collected over a 3 hour period following a dose of 50 ml tap water, for urinalysis, before and at weeks 6, 13 and 18 of the study: ophthalmological examinations were done at the same timepoints.  All dogs in Groups 1, 3 and 4 were examined histologically, with the spleens and bone marrow of dogs in Group 2 also examined.  Blood samples  were  drawn  at  weekly  intervals  for  haematology,  coagulation  and  clinical  biochemistry. Blood samples were also drawn at appropriate timepoints for toxicokinetics of erythropoietin (a full kinetic profile was planned from blood samples taken on study day 5, with individual samples taken for trough levels at intervals) and for antibody determinations, which were drawn at weekly intervals throughout the entire period of the study.

For  the  purposes  of  this  assessment,  the  primary  comparison  of  interest  is  that  of  Group  3  versus Group 4, i.e. SB309 versus the same dose of Erypo.

There was no difference between Groups 3 and 4 with respect to local tolerance, behaviour, external appearance on clinical observation, faeces, mortality, body weight and body weight changes, food and drinking water consumption, electrocardiographic measures, blood pressure, haematological parameters,  clinical  biochemistry,  urinalysis,  ophthalmology,  organ  weights  or  macroscopic  or microscopic examinations.  The examinations of spleen and bone marrow tissues did not suggest any difference between the same dose of SB309 and Erypo.

In  comparison  with  the  control  group,  each  of  SB309  and  Erypo  produced  effects  characteristic  of erythropoietins.    Marked  haematopoietic  activation  of  bone  marrow  was  observed  with  substantial, sustained increases in reticulocyte counts, red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit throughout the dosing period with tendency to revert to normal during the recovery period.  There were sporadic instances where one product was associated with a significant change compared to control where the other was not (e.g. reticulocyte counts at 10, 11 and 12 weeks in males and on days 10, 12 and weeks 7, 9 and 10 in females); however, such instances are not toxicologically meaningful.

Histopathologically, increase in haematopoietic cells in spleen and in bone marrow was observed.

## Toxicokinetics

Data derived from blood samples drawn on Day 5 of the study are tabulated below.  Group 3 and Group 4 are in the columns headed Test 2 and Reference, respectively.  There was a slight tendency for  increased AUC-inf and Cmax with Erypo compared to the same dose of SB309, although there was no difference in the half life and suggests these differences may be due to a higher specific protein content of the final drug product batches.

The trough serum concentrations measured throughout the study are presented in tabular form below. As for the kinetics with the rat, analysis was done twice, once by reference to a SB309 standard and once by reference to an Erypo standard.  The tabulated values for serum erythropoietin concentration indicate  no  change  on  repeated  dosing,  but  do  indicate  lower  concentrations  in  males  compared  to females (subset of data not shown).  These data are presented to show that the very large standard deviations confound any assessment of difference.  In addition, in weeks 5 and 9, values for SB309 are skewed by data from one female dog having very substantially higher exposure (i.e. approximately 10fold the mean of the other dogs) to erythropoietin.  This dog developed antibodies to erythropoietin from week 11, consistent with a decline in the measured serum concentration of erythropoietin at week 13.

## Antigenicity

Data on the frequency of anti-erythropoietin antibody positivity are shown below.  These data are the number of samples that tested positive and, as one dog will test positive on a number of occasions, this way of presenting the data may exaggerate the numbers concerned.

One dog out of eight treated with Erypo developed antibodies to erythropoietin, which were detected from  the  third  week.    In  contrast,  a  total  of  eight  dogs  out  of  16  treated  with  SB309  developed antibodies to erythropoietin which were detected from the fourth week:  these eight comprised three given the lower dose and five given the higher dose regime.  No neutralising potential was identified in  the  serum  samples  that  tested  positive  for  antibodies.    In  addition  to  these  findings,  borderline positive tests were found in 18 dogs, in all groups including the control and on day -2, before any dogs were dosed. The different rate of antibody formation is not considered relevant for clinical use since human epoetin is a foreign protein for dogs. The low potential of both, SB309 and Erypo, to induce neutralising antibodies is considered reassuring (see discussion below).

## Genotoxicity

No studies were submitted.

## Carcinogenicity

No studies were submitted.

## Reproduction Toxicity

No studies were submitted.

## Local tolerance

Local  tolerance  was  tested  within  the  frame  of  the  repeated-dose  studies  insofar  the  injection  sites were  examined.  Local  tolerance  was  also  assessed  in  the  rabbit  using  intravenous,  subcutaneous, intramuscular, paravenous and intra-arterial injection of the 40,000 IU/syringe strength product.  No concerns were identified.

## Other toxicity studies

Antigenicity was assessed in the general toxicity studies and is discussed above.  Other toxicity studies (dependence, metabolites, impurities) were not submitted.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant claimed that because the product does not contain any novel components, and contains a protein that is similar to the endogenous human protein and to that contained in an existing medicinal product, availability of the product will not pose any identifiable extra risk to the environment. The applicant also claimed that CHMP guidance specifically exempts proteins from such assessment, as they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Biosimilarity in terms of non-clinical pharmacodynamics could be convincingly shown in the in-vivo assays. There were some problems with the in-vitro assays, but in the light of the unequivocal outcome of the in-vivo assays this is a minor concern. Although in-vivo assays are characterised by a rather low accuracy of the results due to inter-individual differences of the animals, it could be demonstrated by using a large number (1024) of animals that mean, standard deviation and slope of the dose-response are nearly superimposable for SB309 and Erypo. This indicates that the observed statistical variation was due to inter-individual differences of the animals and not to different actions of SB309 and Erypo.

With the exception of antigenicity in the dog which is discussed further below, there were no signs of toxicity other than that which can be attributed to major erythropoietic stimulus (i.e. suprapharmacological effects) and to compensatory changes. In comparison with the control group, each of SB309 and Erypo produced effects characteristic of erythropoietins. Whereas there were no differences  in  type  of  toxicity  between  SB309  and  Erypo  in  the  dog,  there  were  differences  in  the magnitude  of  erythropoietic  effect  in  the  rat.  This  could  be  consistent  with  a  slightly  more  potent erythropoietic  effect  of  SB309  compared  to  Erypo  (the  applicant  suggested  this  could  be  due  to  a greater amount of protein per International Unit of erythropoietin in its product compared to Erypo). However, these findings could also indicate a modest difference in biological response due to natural variation.  In  conclusion,  in  terms  of  toxicology,  the  data  did  not  indicate  a  meaningful  difference between the two products.

Antigenicity of SB309 in direct comparison with Erypo was extensively tested. The absolute rate of antibody  formation  was  rather  high,  but  this  does  not  necessarily  indicate  a  high  antigenicity  in humans  since  human  epoetin  is  a  foreign  protein  for  animals.  There  was,  however,  a  marked difference  in  antigenicity  between  the  two  products,  although  antibodies  were  non-neutralising  and were  not  associated  with  any  deterioration  in  condition  of  the  dogs.  Antibodies  to  erythropoietin occurred more frequently in dogs treated with SB309 than dogs treated with Erypo.

To  date  there  is  no  hint  that  SB309  will  be  more  antigenic  than  Erypo,  at  least  in  respect  to  the clinically  relevant  neutralising  antibodies.  In  dogs  no  neutralising  antibodies  were  found  in  the antibody  assay,  and  pharmacodynamics  data  (e.g.  red  blood  cell  count)  also  gave  no  hint  for neutralising antibodies. Neutralising antibodies were only detected in rats, and there was a very good agreement between the rate of antibody formation in the satellite groups (antibodies determined by RIP) and the main groups (neutralising antibodies identified by a sharp decrease in RBCs), confirming the reliability of the antibody assay, at least for the (clinically more relevant) neutralising antibodies.

Local tolerance was tested within the frame of the repeated-dose studies and in a separate rabbit study. The comparator Erypo was not included in this study but this is considered acceptable because this study aimed to detect unexpected local toxicity of SB309. The results did not raise concerns.

No  secondary  pharmacodynamics,  safety  pharmacology,  and  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions studies have been submitted, in line with CHMP guidance. In accordance with CHMP guidance, no studies on reproductive toxicology, mutagenicity or carcinogenicity were conducted. The environmental risk assessment is satisfactory.

As a conclusion for the preclinical review, the applicant's data indicate that SB309 and the reference product Erypo could be distinguished from each other in certain in vitro pharmacology tests, and in some aspects,  but  not  all,  in in  vivo tests.    The  differences  which  were  identified  are  probably  not toxicologically meaningful.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The pharmacokinetic properties of SB309 and the reference product Erypo were compared in two PK studies  in  healthy  volunteers  after  single  dose  SC  and  IV  administration.  Two  clinical  studies  were conducted to compare the therapeutic equivalence of IV administered SB309 and the reference product Erypo in patients with anaemia due to chronic renal failure. The studies included one correction phase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study  to  determine  response  dynamics  and  dosing  during  the  anaemia  correction  phase,  and  one maintenance  phase  study.  An  additional  maintenance  treatment  follow-up  study  was  performed  to obtain long-term safety data for SB309. One uncontrolled safety trial was conducted in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia.

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The applicant has submitted two PK studies in healthy volunteers to demonstrate similar PK profiles for  SB309  and  Erypo.  Study  411-54-05-05-0000  was  a  two-period  crossover  study  in  24  healthy volunteers comparing the PK profiles of the test product SB309 and the reference product Erypo after a single IV dose. Study 411-54-03-09-0001 was a three-period crossover trial in 48 healthy volunteers comparing the PK profiles of SB309 and Erypo after a single SC dose as well as the PK profiles after a single dose of SC and IV administered SB309. The design and endpoints of both studies were in line with  the  recommendations  in  the Guidance  on  similar  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant erythropoietins .

Epoetin plasma concentrations were analysed using a validated modified double sandwich ELISA.

No equivalence margins were pre-defined. However, post-hoc an acceptance range of 80-125% for AUC and 70-143% for Cmax was used by the applicant who also referred to the Scientific Advice given  by CHMP  in  April  2004  that  stated  that the concept of 'comparability' cannot  use bioequivalence but that similar PK profiles of SB309 and the reference product would strengthen the choice  of  reference  in  the  clinical  trials.  The  advice  concluded  that  for  this  purpose  descriptive statistics will suffice.

The primary endpoint was AUC0-tlast and the secondary endpoints were Cmax, t1/2, Vd, CLtot and MRT.

The study  results  (primary  analysis)  suggested  subavailability  of  SB309  compared  to  Erypo  (1  not included in the 90% CI). The 90% CIs for both AUC0-tlast and Cmax for the SC comparison were contained  in  the  post  hoc  defined  acceptance  ranges  but  only  the  90%  CI  for  Cmax  for  the  IV comparison (see Tables X and Y below). According to the certificates of analysis of the test and the reference drug, a significant difference was present between the batches of both products regarding the total protein content: 71.77 µg/ml protein for the test drug and 83.62 µg/ml protein for the reference drug  in  study  411-54-05-05-0000;  78.45  µg/ml  protein  in  the  test  drug  and  83.62  µg/ml  in  the reference drug in study 411-54-03-09-0001. The concentration of epoetin in the final product is not based  on  protein  content  but  is  adjusted  by  means  of  a  bioassay  which  measures  the  biological activity. Due to this reason, a correction of epoetin serum concentrations based on the protein content of the used batches was performed in both studies. This adjustment for protein content was justified on the basis that the assay used for the determination of erythropoietin concentrations in human plasma is based  on  binding  of  a  specific  antibody  to  the  erythropoietin  protein  backbone,  and  therefore corresponds to total protein content. The 90%  CIs  for the corrected intra-individual ratios (testIV/referenceIV)  of  AUC0-tlast  and  Cmax  were  well  within  the  post-hoc  defined  equivalence margins (see Tables X and Y). T1/2 values were similar being 5.8 ± 0.6 h for test and 6.1 ± 1.2 h for reference in study 411-54-05-05-0000 and 24.7 ± 8.0 h for test and 23.0 ± 6.6 h for reference in study 411-54-03-09-0001.

Discussion on Clinical Pharmacokinetics

The  submitted  PK  studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with  the Guidance  on  similar  medicinal products containing recombinant erythropoietins , although this guideline had not been in place at the time of clinical development .

Based on corrected epoetin serum concentrations similar PK profiles of SB309 and Erypo could be demonstrated for the IV route as well as the SC route of administration. For the uncorrected values, similar  PK  profiles  could  be  demonstrated  only  for  SC  administration.  In  principle,  correction  for protein content is considered acceptable but, in a strict sense, only if pre-specified. However, similar PK profiles alone do not allow the conclusion of similar efficacy and safety of two biotechnologyderived  medicinal  products.  Comparative  phase  III  studies  are  required  for  epoetin-containing products claiming to be similar to another one already on the market.

The bioavailability of erythropoietin is known to be much lower if administered SC compared to IV and  is  approximately  20%.  As  expected,  the  bioavailability  of  SC  administered  epoetin  was considerably  lower  than  that  of  the  IV  administered  drug  in  Study  411-54-03-09-0001  but  the comparison IV vs. SC is not relevant for a 'biosimilar' application.

## Pharmacodynamics

No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with SB309. The pharmacodynamics (PD) of erythropoietin is known and described in the literature.

## Mechanism of action

Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) promotes red blood cell production by stimulating the division and differentiation of committed progenitors in the bone marrow the same way endogenous erythropoietin does.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary pharmacology

After  IV  administration  of  epoetin,  the  typical  pharmacodynamic  profile  shows  an  increase  in reticulocyte  count  within  the  first  2  weeks  followed  by  an  increase  in  the  red  blood  cell  level  as manifested by hematocrit or Hb determinations within 2 to 6 weeks. After single SC administration an increase in reticulocyte count within 3-4 days with a peak around day 8-11(13) and a return to baseline by day 22 has been described (R. Ramakrishan et al. J Clin Pharmacol, 2004; W.K. Cheung et al. Clin Pharmacol Therapeutics, 1998). A linear relationship between reticulocyte AUC and epoetin exposure has  been  described  for  single  doses  up  to  1800  IU/kg  (W.K.  Cheung  et  al.,  Clin  Pharmacol Therapeutics, 1998). There is high interindividual variability in the reticulocyte response to epoetin.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacodynamics

The Guideline on similar medicinal products containing recombinant erythropoietins suggests that a PD study be performed investigating reticulocyte count as the most relevant pharmacodynamic marker for assessment of the activity of epoetin. As stated above, this guidance document was not available at the time the studies were performed and there was still discussion on the requirements for biosimilar applications.  Although  PD  studies  should  be  part  of  the  development  programme  for  a  biosimilar epoetin,  the  lack  of  such  studies  is  not  critical  since  demonstration  of  similar  efficacy  and  safety between the new and the reference product is required anyway.

## Clinical efficacy

Two  clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  compare  the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  IV  administered SB309 and  the  reference  product  Erypo  in  patients  with  anaemia  due  to  chronic  renal  failure.  The studies  were  one  correction  phase  study  (411-54-04-05-0000  [study  04-05])  to  determine  response dynamics and dosing during the anaemia correction phase, and one maintenance phase study (411-5404-04-0000 [study 04-04]). An additional maintenance treatment follow-up study (411-54-04-14-0000 [study 04-14]) was performed to obtain long-term safety data for SB309. This study is presented in the Clinical Safety section below.

## Dose response studies

No studies were submitted.

## Main studies

## Correction Phase Study

Study  411-54-04-05-0000  [study  04-05]  was  performed  as  a  randomised,  double-blind,  verumcontrolled, multiple-dose, parallel-group, multicentre design phase III trial in haemodialysis patients with renal anaemia in patients with or without epoetin treatment to prove therapeutic equivalence of IV administered SB309 to the reference product (Erypro).

## Methods

## Study Participants

Male or female haemodialysis patients, aged 18-75 years with a baseline haemoglobin concentration below 9 g/dl in spite of optimal iron supplementation with or without pre-treatment with epoetin were eligible. Patients presenting (among others) any of the following criteria could not be included in the trial:  contraindication  for  the  test  drug;  relative  or  absolute  iron  deficiency  at  the  end  of  the supplementation period; refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation; documented bleeding disorders; platelet count below 100x109/l; known, clinically manifested deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin  B12  (irrespective  whether  currently  treated  or  not);    known  bone  marrow  fibrosis  (osteitis fibrosa  cystica);  clinically  relevant  changes  of  dialysis  regimen  and/or  dialyzer  during  the  trial; clinically relevant increase of CRP (higher than 10 mg/dl) for at least 2 weeks;  acute bleeding and/or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recently  documented  hemorrhage;  known  lack  of  response  to  epoetin;    known  hypersensitivity  to epoetin (for patients who have received epoetin before); epoetin dosages &gt; 3x200 IU/kg/week;  known hypersensitivity to albumin; detectable anti-epoetin antibodies; uncontrolled hypertension;  myocardial infarction,  stroke,  severe/unstable  angina,  coronary/peripheral  artery  bypass  graft,    decompensated congestive heart failure (NYHA class III - IV), cerebrovascular incident or transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism,  deep vein thrombosis, or other thromboembolic event within the 6 months prior to  double-blind  study  drug  administration;  known  epilepsy;  liver  cirrhosis  with  clinical  evidence  of complications (portal hypertension, splenomegaly,  ascites); patients  with  confirmed  aluminum intoxication; confirmed, clinically relevant hemolysis and/or occult blood loss;  presence of malignant tumors; clinically relevant malnutrition;  pregnancy or lactation period in female patients.

## Treatments

SB309 or Erypo, 1000 IU or 2000 IU epoetin, were administered IV, three times per week (if a dose &lt; 3 x 1000 IU was needed the epoetin dosage could be less than three times a week).

The period of work-up of anaemia lasted up to 6 weeks. The subsequent double-blind treatment period lasted 24 weeks. Thereafter, all patients could continue treatment with the test product as a part of an open, follow-up safety trial.

## Objectives

To  prove  the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  SB309  to  the  reference  product  (Erypo)  in  achieving correction of haemoglobin concentration in anaemic patients with end-stage renal failure on chronic haemodialysis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoints were:

- -Mean weekly dosage of epoetin per kg body weight during the last four weeks of treatment
- -Mean haemoglobin levels during the last four weeks of treatment

Secondary efficacy endpoints included:

- -Proportion of patients with treatment success (haemoglobin level ≥ 11.0 g/dl for 2 consecutive weeks without any blood transfusion within the preceding 3 months)
- -Increase of haemoglobin over time
- -Proportion of patients with maintenance success (maintenance of haemoglobin levels of 11 ± 1 g/dl for at least 4 consecutive weeks)
- -Mean weekly dosage of epoetin per kg body weight during each interval of 4 weeks of treatment
- -Mean haemoglobin levels during each interval of 4 weeks of treatment
- -Mean haemocrit levels during each interval of 4 weeks of treatment
- -Proportion of patients with an increase of haemoglobin of more than 1 g/dl for 4 weeks
- -Percentage of haemoglobin measurements above 10 g/dl
- -Percentage of haemocrit measurements above 30%
- -Proportion of patients with blood transfusions

## Sample size

A sample size of 204 patients per group was calculated to achieve a power of more than 80% for proof of  equivalence  for  both  primary  endpoints.  The  total  number  of  patients  to  be  randomized  was estimated to be 600 since a drop-out rate of approximately 30-35% was expected.

## Randomisation

At the beginning of the double-blind phase of the trial, each patient was randomly assigned to one of the study drugs (1:1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

Blinding was achieved using the double-dummy technique. Neither the investigators nor the monitors were  informed about the identity of the trial medication and also had no copy of the randomization code. The investigators and patients monitors had no access to the code before the end of the trial. The investigator  was  allowed  to  unblind  the  individual  treatment  if  appropriate  in  an  emergency  or  on request by an authority or IEC/IRB.

## Statistical methods

The 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the treatment differences between both treatment groups in the primary endpoints

The confidence interval was compared with pre-defined acceptance ranges:

- -± 14 IU/kg/week for mean weekly dosage
- -± 1 g/dl for haemoglobin

Statistical analysis was performed on three patient populations:

- -full data set for efficacy, including all patients who started therapy and had any follow-up information regarding the primary endpoint, and did not violate major entry criteria;
- -full data set for safety, including all patients who started therapy irrespective of the information regarding the primary endpoint;
- -per protocol (PP) population; excluding cases of major protocol violations.
- -The per protocol population was the primary analysis population.

## Rationale for acceptance range for dosage and haemoglobin

For  Hb,  a  range  of  ±  1g/dl  has  been  previously  used  and  was  considered  well  established  as  an equivalence range in parallel-group trials (data from EPAR on Epoetin delta).

With respect to dosage, the lowest usual dose-adjustment used as a pre-filled syringe was 1000 IU, which  roughly  corresponds  to  14  IU/kg/week  as  the  lowest  possible  change  of  dosage  in  normal clinical practice for a person of approximately 70 kg body weight. The rationale for the choice of the acceptance range regarding the dosage was the fact that a 15 IU/kg dose had been described as being close to the  no effect dosage in the EPAR on Dynepo. Accordingly, it was assumed that a difference in dose smaller than this would not matter in practice.

## Numbers analysed

A total of 609 subjects (305 test product and 304 reference product) were randomised for treatment. A total of 609 patients were considered evaluable for safety (305 test product and 304 reference product who received study medication),  598  patients  evaluable  for  full  analysis  (300  test  product  and  298 reference product who were treated for at least four weeks) and 541 patients evaluated as per protocol set (273 test product and 268 reference product without major protocol deviations).

## Outcomes and estimation

The mean treatment duration of treatment of patients treated with SB309 was 157.79±30.05 days. For the patients treated with the reference drug the mean duration was 157.79±29.58 days. The maximally reached duration of treatment was 181 days for SB309and 178 days for Erypo.

The mean haemoglobin value over the last four weeks was 11.61 ± 1.27 g/dl for the patients treated with SB309 and 11.63 ± 1.37 g/dl for patients treated with Erypo. The 95% confidence interval of the difference  (test-reference)  was  between  -  0.245  g/dl  and  0.201  g/dl  and  within  the  pre-defined equivalence range (±1.0 g/dl).

Table 11 Mean haemoglobin (g/dL) over the last four weeks (correction phase study) - PP population

| Treatment   | Description   | Description   | Description   |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Treatment   | Mean          | SD            | Max           |
| SB309       | 11.61         | 1.27          | 14.50         |
| Erypo       | 11.63         | 1.37          | 14.93         |

SD = standard deviation

The mean weekly epoetin dosage per kg body weight over the last four weeks was 182.20 ± 118.11 IU/kg/week (SB309) and 166.14 ± 109.85 IU/kg/week (Erypo). The 95% confidence interval of the difference (test-reference) was between -3.21 IU/kg/week and 35.34 IU/kg/ week hence equivalence of  the  test  and  reference  product  could  not  be  confirmed  regarding  dosage  using  the  predefined equivalence limits (see discussion below). The dosage of the test drug within the last four weeks was approximately 10% higher than the dosage of the reference product.

The mean Hb concentrations and epoetin dosages over time in both treatment groups are presented in the Figure below.

## Proportion of patients with treatment success

A total of 230 patients treated in each of both groups (84.2% of patients treated with test drug and 85.8% of patients treated with reference drug) registered treatment success.

## Increase of haemoglobin over time

Haemoglobin increased from a mean value of 8.07 ± 0.79 g/dl at week 0 to 11.60 ± 1.37 g/dl at week 24 in the patients treated with the test drug. In the reference group, the haemoglobin level increased from a mean value of 8.04 ± 0.79 g/dl at week 0 to 11.61 ± 1.44 g/dl at week 24. In both treatment groups  a  plateau  was  observed  during  the  last  five  weeks  of  treatment.  The  rate  of  increase  of haemoglobin over time was highly similar in both treatment groups.

## Proportion of patients with maintenance success

A maintenance success was achieved in 236 (86.4%) patients treated with the test product and in 227 (84.7%)  patients  treated  with  the  reference  drug.  The  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  treatment difference (test-reference) was between -4.2% and 7.7%.

## Mean weekly dosage of epoetin per kg body weight during each interval of 4 weeks of treatment

A permanent and very similar increase over each interval of four weeks could be observed within the first  16  weeks  in  both  treatment  groups.  Within  the  last  eight  weeks  the  dosage  of  the  reference product decreased slightly but constantly and that of the test drug remained approximately constant. The treatment differences were not statistically significant for any of the 4-week periods.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mean haemoglobin levels during each interval of 4 weeks of treatment

The course of the mean haemoglobin levels over time was practically identical for both products. No statistically  significant  differences  were  registered  for  any  of  the  four  week  intervals  between  both products. The treatment difference was not statistically significant.

## Mean haemocrit levels during each interval of 4 weeks of treatment

Baseline values from patients treated with SB309 increased from 24.7% at baseline to 35.6% in week 21-24. Baseline values from patients treated with Erypo increased from 24.7% (baseline) up to 35.8% in  week  21-24.  No  statistically  significant  differences  were  registered  for  any  of  the  four  week intervals between both products.

## Proportion of patients with an increase of haemoglobin of more than 1 g/dl for 4 weeks

All except three patients in each treatment group experienced an increase of more than 1 g/dl within a period  of  four  weeks  (SB309  n=270,  Erypo  n=265).  The  treatment  difference  was  not  statistically significant.

## Percentage of haemoglobin measurements above 10 g/dl

An average of 64.3% of the haemoglobin values in patients treated with SB309 were above 10 g/dl over the total treatment time. In the Erypo group the corresponding proportion was 65.7%. There was no  statistically  significant  treatment  difference  regarding  this  parameter.  The  descriptive  statistics regarding the four week intervals showed a mean of 14.0% (SB309) and 15.9% (Erypo) for the period week 1-4. During week 21-24 the corresponding proportions were 86.8% and 85.5%. The treatment difference was not statistically significant.

## Percentage of haemocrit measurements above 30%

On average, 68.6% of the haematocrit values from patients treated with SB309 were above 30% over the total treatment period. In the reference group the corresponding value was 69.7%. The treatment difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  The  descriptive  statistics  regarding  the  4-week  intervals showed an increase from a mean of 20.3% (SB309) and 19.2% (reference product) for the period week 1-4 to 89.7% in both treatment groups during week 21-24.

## Proportion of patients with blood transfusions

Within  the  work-up  period  (PP  population),  three  patients  received  blood  transfusions.  During  the double-blind treatment phase, 10 patients of the SB309 group and 13 patients of the reference group required one or more blood transfusions. The treatment difference was not statistically significant.

## Maintenance Phase Study

Study 411-54-04-04-0000 [study 04-04] was a randomised, double-blind, cross-over,  verumcontrolled, multiple-dose, multinational design phase III trial in patients with renal anaemia to prove the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  IV  administered  SB309  to  the  reference  product  (Erypro)  for maintaining the haemoglobin concentration in these patients.

## Methods

## Study Participants

Patients were only eligible for enrollment if ALL of the following applied: male or female patients, aged 18-75 years; haemodialysis patients with end-stage renal failure and renal anaemia currently on epoetin treatment for at least 3 months; patients on stable, adequate dialysis for at least three months (defined as no clinically relevant changes of dialysis regimen and/or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dialyzer); informed consent given in a written form after being provided with detailed information about the nature, risks, and scope of the clinical trial as well as the expected desirable and adverse effects of the drug.

## Treatments

During the run-in period, the reference product Erypo was administered IV, 1-3 times per week. During the double-blind treatment phase, SB309 or Erypo, 1000 IU or 2000 IU epoetin, were administered IV, 1-3 times per week.

## Duration of Study

Double-blind  treatment  of  24  weeks,  preceded  by  an  open  run-in  period  of  12-16  weeks.  In substantiated cases a prolongation of the run-in period was allowed up to max. 18 weeks. After the end of the 24 weeks double-blind treatment, all patients could continue treatment with the test product as a part of an open, follow-up safety trial.

## Objectives

To prove  the  therapeutic  equivalence  of  SB309  to  a  reference  product  (Erypo)  for  maintaining  the haemoglobin concentration in anaemic patients with end-stage renal failure on chronic haemodialysis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary Efficacy Endpoints:

- -Intra-individual change (test-reference) in mean weekly dosage per kg body weight of each product during the double-blind treatment period
- -Intra-individual change (test-reference) in mean haemoglobin level during double-blind treatment with each study drug.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

- -Mean haemocrit levels during double-blind treatment with each study drug

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Proportion of patients with any permanent changes of haemoglobin levels of more than 1 g/dl during the double-blind period
- -Proportion of patients with any transient changes of haemoglobin levels of more than 1 g/dl during the double-blind period
- -Proportion of patients with any permanent dose change during the double-blind period
- -Proportion of patients with any transient dose change during the double-blind period
- -Proportion of patients with any haemoglobin measurement outside the target range during the double-blind treatment period
- -Incidence of blood transfusions

## Safety Endpoints:

- -Occurrence of anti-epoetin antibodies
- -Ratings of tolerability
- -Evaluation of adverse events

## Sample size

Sample  Size  Level  1:  The  calculated    sample  size  of  50  patients  who  completed  the  double-blind treatment period would achieve a power of more than 80% for the two-sided proof of equivalence for the Hb targeted endpoint.

Sample  size  Level  2:  The  calculated  sample  size  of  220  patients  who  complete  the  double-blind treatment  period  would  achieve  a  power  of  more  than  80%  for  the  two-sided  proof  of  equivalence regarding epoetin dosage. If approximately 35% of the randomized patients drop-out before the end of the double-blind period, a total number of 340 patients had to be randomized in the present trial. To reach  this  number  of  randomized  patients,  more  than  340  patients  had  to  be  included  in  the  run-in period of the study.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was performed at the beginning of the double-blind period  with  patients   randomly (1:1) assigned to the two different treatment groups

Patients were only randomised when the target Hb level was within the range of 10.5-12.5 g/dl with stable epoetin dosage and without intra-individual change in Hb of more than 0.6 g/dl over 4 weeks.

## Blinding (masking)

This has been previously described in the correction phase study above.

## Statistical methods

The 95% confidence intervals of the intra-individual change (test-reference)  were calculated for:

- -mean weekly dosage per kg body weight of each product during the double-blind treatment period
- -mean haemoglobin level during double-blind treatment period

The confidence intervals were compared with pre-defined clinically relevant acceptance ranges:

- -± 14 IU/kg/week for dosage
- -± 0.6 g/dl for haemoglobin

The intervals were calculated by means of ANOVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The evaluation of the secondary and safety endpoints was performed according to the type of distribution of the respective parameter. A Chi-square test was applied for parameters with discrete distribution, a t-test or a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was applied for continuous parameters.

The statistical analysis was performed on three different patient populations:

- -Full data set of efficacy, including all patients who started therapy and had any follow-up information regarding the primary endpoint after switch-over, and did not violate major entry criteria.
- -Full data set for safety, including all patients who started therapy irrespective of the information regarding the primary endpoint.
- -Per protocol population, excluding cases of major protocol violation and drop-outs.

## Results

## Participant flow

The administration of study medication was correctly performed in 96.7% of all cases for SB309 and in 97.5% of all cases for the reference medication (PP set).

## Numbers analysed

A  total  of  313  patients  were  randomised  for  treatment  and  considered  evaluable  for  safety,  282 patients were evaluable for full analysis and 239 patients evaluated as per protocol set.

## Outcomes and estimation

The mean treatment duration in the PP population was 82.31±4.75 days for SB309 and 82.79±7.69 days for the reference product.

## Primary Endpoints

The mean haemoglobin values measured during run-in phase and double-blind treatment with SB309 and the reference product are shown in the table below. The 95% CI interval of the intra-individual difference (test - reference) of the mean haemoglobin level during double-blind treatment with each study drug was between 0.09 g/dL and 0.28 g/dL and thus entirely within the pre-defined equivalence range (±0.6 g/dL).

Table 15 Mean haemoglobin (g/dL) over treatment period (maintenance phase study) - PP population

| Treatment   | Description   | Description   | Description   |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Treatment   | Mean          | SD            | Max           |
| Run-in      | 11.56         | 0.69          | 13.42         |
| SB309       | 11.35         | 0.76          | 14.22         |
| Erypo       | 11.54         | 0.65          | 13.84         |

SD = standard deviation

The mean epoetin dosage administered during double-blind treatment with SB309 and the reference product  was  92.68±62.60  IU/kg/week  and  92.58±64.31IU/kg/week,  respectively.  The  maximum weekly  dosage  was  437.25 IU/kg/week  in  the  run-in  phase  and  398.41 IU/kg/week  with  SB309 compared to 393.07 kg/IU/week with Erypo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 95% CI interval of the intra-individual difference (test - reference) of the mean weekly dosage per kg  bodyweight  of  each  product  during  double-blind  treatment  was  between  -4.67 IU/kg/week  and 4.29 IU/kg/week and within the pre-defined equivalence range.

Results  of  the  primary  efficacy  parameters  are  summarised  below. Following  a  switch  from  the reference  to  the  test  drug  the  dose  increased  by  approximately  10-15%  and  the  haemoglobin  level decreased  transiently  by  approximately  5%.  After  a  switch  from  test  to  reference  product  the  dose decreased by approximately 10% and simultaneously an increase of approximately 10% was observed in  haemoglobin  levels.  This  difference  could  possibly  be  explained  by  the  difference  in  mean bioactivity  between  the  SB309  and  Erypo  batches  used  in  the  study  as  measured  by  the  Ph.Eur. normocythaemic  mouse  assay,  although  all  batches  remained  within  the  Ph. Eur.  limits,  namely 80%-125% (with error limits of 64 to 156%). The inter-batch difference in bioactivity spanned a range of  23%.  After  correction  for  bioactivity,  the  results  of  the  95%  CI:  intervals  for  the  difference  in dosage  between  the  two  products  were  3.806-13.917 IU/kg/week  (for  details  on  correction  for bioactivity see below).

## Secondary Endpoints

## Mean haematocrit levels during double-blind treatment period

Mean  haematocrit  levels  during  the  double-blind  treatment  period  with  each  study  drug  appeared similar:  34.30  ±  2.52%  for  test  treatment  and  34.87  ±  2.15%  for  reference  treatment,  although  the difference  was  statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.0001);  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  mean difference (test-reference) was between 0.28% and 0.85%.

Proportion of patients with any permanent changes of haemoglobin levels of more than 1 g/dl during the double-blind period

A permanent change in Hb was observed in 10.5% of the patients under test treatment and in 11.3% of the patients under reference treatment. The treatment difference was not statistically significant

## Proportion of patients with any permanent or transient dose change during the double-blind period

During treatment with test product 94 patients (39.3%) had a permanent dose change and 141 patients (59.0%) had a transient dose change. A permanent dosage change during treatment with the reference product was necessary in 98 patients (41.0%), whilst transient dosage changes occurred in 155 patients (64.9%). The treatment difference was not statistically significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Proportion of patients with any haemoglobin measurement outside the target range

In the course of the treatment with SB309 and with the reference product, 32.6% of patients on test and and 36.4% of patients on reference drug experienced Hb values outside the target Hb range (10.5-12.5 g/dL). The treatment difference was not statistically significant

## Incidence of blood transfusions

During the run-in phase only one patient needed a blood transfusion. In the course of the double-blind treatment  phase  three  patients  on  test  drug  and  two  patients  on  reference  drug  received  blood transfusions.

## Ancillary analyses

Due to concerns of carry-over effects from the first to the second treatment phase and that the study duration  may  have  been  too  short  to  fully  assess  treatment  differences,  the  applicant  provided additional analyses, including a comparison of Hb values and epoetin doses over the last 4 weeks of of each treatment period (and therefore excluding the first 8 weeks), as an attempt to minimise carry over effects from previous epoetin treatment. The equivalence margins were also met with this new posthoc analysis.

In  addition,  the  applicant  presented  the  mean  Hb  levels  and  epoetin  dosages  over  the  complete  52week treatment period (see Figure below). A stable Hb had already been achieved at the 12-week time point of the second treatment phase and the epoetin dose did not further increase in the test/test group (in  fact  it  declined  thereafter  and  got  closer  to  the  reference  dose).  Of  note,  a similar  percentage  of patients in both treatment groups, i.e. 87% and 85% enrolled in the test-reference group and referencetest group, respectively, completed the 24-week comparative phase. In addition, a similar percentage of  these  completers,  i.e.  86%  and  87%  of  the  test-reference  and  reference-test  group,  respectively, entered the follow-up phase during which all patients were treated with the test product.

To avoid possible bias due to drop-outs, the epoetin doses only for those patients that completed the parent study and enrolled in the follow-up study are depicted in Figure below. The mean treatment difference in epoetin dosage at the end of the parent study was higher in this group compared to the overall completer group indicating that the decline in dosage observed after the 24-week time point of the comparative phase was not due to drop-out of patients on high doses of the test drug.

## Adjustment for bioactivity

Although there were differences in bioactivity in the batches, Erypo batches were found on average to have  8%  higher  bioactivity  than  SB309  batches,  although  all  batches  remained  within  the  Ph. Eur. limits, namely 80%-125% (with error limits of 64 to 156%). The difference in bioactivity was shown to be associated with a correspondingly higher protein content in the Erypo batches which contained on average 9% over the labelled amount of protein, compared with on average 1% over the labelled amount  with  SB309.  On  the  other  hand,  the  average  specific  activities  for  both  products  were remarkably similar (130.80 for test vs. 130.75 units/µg for reference).

The  applicant  therefore  provided  an  additional  analysis  adjusting  epoetin  dosage  for  inter-batch variability in bioactivity. For this purpose, the applicant utilised a correction factor in the reanalysis of the  data  with  respect  to  dosage.  However,  even  with  the  application  of  a  correction  factor,  the correction  phase  study  failed  to  meet  its  pre-specified  criteria  for  equivalence  since  the  95% confidence interval fell between (-23.5, 17.48) IU/kg/week. In addition, introduction of a correction factor into the maintenance phase study led to a widening of the revised 95% CI for dosage of 3.08613.917 IU/kg/week. However, both 95% CIs were included in the modified acceptance range of ± 45 IU/kg/week (for details of the widening of the equivalence margins see below).

A comparison of results for uncorrected and corrected data is given in the Table below.

The  applicant  clarified  that  dose  correction  for  bioactivity  was  performed  based  on  the  exact bioactivity of every single syringe administered throughout the trial to every patient.

## Widening of acceptance range

The correction phase study did not meet the co-primary end-point of mean weekly dosage of epoetin per  kg  bodyweight during the last 4 weeks of treatment since this showed a mean difference of 16 IU/kg/week (corresponding to 9.6% of reference dose) with a 95% CI of -3.21 to 35.34 IU/kg/week (corresponding to 1.9-21% of reference dose), which was outside the pre-specified equivalence range (+/-14 IU/kg/week [corresponding to 8.4% of the reference dose]).

The applicant initially argued that the difference in epoetin dose observed between test and comparator products was considered to be attributable to the batches of reference product having up to 15% higher activity and that this deviation from the labelled content was within the Ph. Eur. approved limits for bioactivity of 80-125%.  The applicant therefore suggested a widening of the equivalence margins to at  least  the  release  specification  of  80  to  125%  and  showed  in  a  post-hoc  analysis  that  a  change  in bioactivity of up to 25%, on average, did not relevantly influence Hb levels in the study population. During the scientific assessment, the applicant clarified that the pre-defined equivalence margin of 14 IU/kg/week was wrong and should be corrected to 45 IU/kg /week because of a misreading of the EPAR of Dynepo were it is stated that the no-effect dosage for Dynepo is 15 IU/kg given three times weekly (TIW) and not only once weekly. This newly proposed acceptance range was also supported by literature.  The applicant provided evidence that a difference of 35.3 IU/kg/week in epoetin dose (worst case scenario in the correction phase trial) was clinically not relevant in the investigated study population, whether this difference was calculated as absolute value or as percentage of the reference

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose (21%). The applicant also provided further reassurance that such a difference does not result in a different safety profile.

## Study 441-54-04-46-0000

This uncontrolled safety trial was conducted in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia. A  12  week  interim  report  was  provided.  A  comprehensive  historical  comparison  was  presented  as supportive information (data not shown).

## Study objective

The primary objective of this trial was to provide information on the incidence of clinically significant thrombotic events (deep vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulant therapy, embolic events including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemia, left ventricular failure and thrombotic microangiopathy) within the first 12 weeks of treatment with SB309.

## Disposition of patients

A total number of 261 male and female anaemic (Hb &lt;10 g/dL) patients with cancer (solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma) gave their informed consent, of which 216 patients were enrolled after fulfilling of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The information for efficacy and safety was based on data from 208 patients. The evaluation of serious adverse events (SAEs) was based on data from 216 patients due to the fact that SAEs were reported on a regular basis for all patients enrolled. A total of 97 patients dropped out, 90 patients during the first 12-week treatment period.

## Haemoglobin

The  baseline  mean  Hb  value  was  8.7  ±  0.92  g/dl  (n=207).  Treatment  with  SC  SB309  led  to  a continuous increase in Hb by on average 2.7 g/dl to a mean of 11.4 ± 1.98 g/dl within 12 weeks. This Hb  increase  was  statistically  significant  compared  to  baseline  values  (p&lt;0.0001)  demonstrating  a strong evidence for the efficacy of SB309 in the target population.

Published data on epoetin alfa show similar mean haemoglobin values after treatment periods of 12-28 weeks of 11.3-12.0 g/dl and a mean Hb increases in the range of 1.8-3.3 g/dl (Littlewood et al. 2001: 2.2-3.3 g/dL within 12-24 weeks, Cortesi et al. 2005: 1.8 g/dL within 10 weeks, Gabrilove et al. 2001: 1.8 g/dL within 16 weeks, Sasha et al. 2003: 1.9 g/dL within 16 weeks, Quirt et al. 2001: 2.8 g/dL within 16 weeks). The results obtained from the current trial are thus in line with literature data.

## Epoetin dose

The range of the mean weekly epoetin doses applied was 502.7 ± 151.08 IU/kg to 598.7 ± 265.04 IU/kg  (n=207).  Between  weeks  4  and  8  an  apparent  increase  of  the  mean  dosage  was  observed followed by a decrease from week 8 onwards until the end of first treatment period. This corresponds to the dosage recommendations given in the protocol.

The graphical presentation (Figure 4) demonstrates that SB309 is effective regarding the recommended  initial dose and its ability to reach the target haemoglobin concentration of approximately  12  g/dl.  This  aligns  with  published  results  from  similar  trials  with  Epoetin  alfa  in cancer patients.

## Study 441-54-04-14-0000

Patients with renal anaemia completing either of the above efficacy studies were eligible to receive SB309  in  this  open-label,  uncontrolled  safety  trial  with  particular  focus  on  the  formation  of  antiepoetin antibodies. A total of 745 patients were included. An interim report covering data from 23May  2005  until  27-April-2006  was  presented  for  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  with  the  initial submission. The applicant provided further interim data on the follow-up study covering the first 28 weeks. These data suggested that adequate Hb levels could be well  maintained with the use of SB309 (data not shown). No case of lack/loss of efficacy was reported.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Dose response studies are not considered necessary for a medicinal product claimed to be similar to one already licensed since posology will be the same as for the reference product.

The  titration  trial  was  conducted  broadly  in  accordance  with  CHMP  guidance.  It  was  noted  that  a comparative trial in renal anaemia patients using the SC route of administration was not possible at the time of clinical development due to the temporary contraindication of Erypo.

The study results indicate that both products can control Hb levels to the same extent, but higher doses of  SB309  were  required  for  control  to  be  achieved.    The  applicant  claimed  that  this  difference  in epoetin  dosage  was  due  to  differences  in  syringe  content  (with  regard  to  bioactivity  and  protein content)  of  SB309  and  Erypo  despite  the  same  nominal  dose  and  all  syringes  remaining  within  the release  specifications  of  80-125%.  This  is  supported  by  the  almost  identical  specific  bioactivity  of both products. Although these arguments were considered plausible, correction of epoetin dosage for bioactivity was not endorsed because it is doubtful that a true correction can be achieved due to the high  intrinsic  variability  of  the  bioassay  used  to  determine  bioactivity  (an  indicator  may  be  that correction led to contrasting effects in the correction phase and maintenance phase study). In addition, adjusting  every  single  administered  syringe  for  bioactivity  is  not  practical  and  difficult  if  not impossible to verify. Moreover, the applicant could show that changes in bioactivity of up to 25% did,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on average, not relevantly affect Hb levels. Also in the light of these data, a bioactivity correction for a mean difference of 8% in bioactivity does not appear to be justified.

The  applicant  also  argued  for  wider  equivalence  margins  than  those  pre-specified.    The  CHMP considered the acceptability of the post-hoc correction of the equivalence margin to ±45 IU/kg/week. The worst case scenario for the treatment difference in epoetin dose was a difference of 35.1 IU/kg per week  (upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI)  in  the  correction  phase  study.  This  value  is  clearly  below  the assumed  no-effect  level  of  45  IU/kg/week.  The  applicant  provided  an  analysis  from  the  correction study  showing  that,  on  average,  a  dose  increase  of  approximately  40  IU/kg/week  was  required  to achieve  a  borderline  relevant  increase  in  Hb  of  1  g/dL  in  patients  on  haemodialysis.  Since  the background  variability  in  Hb  is  high  in  this  patient  population,  even  in  'stable'  patients  on  stable epoetin doses, the chosen limit of 1 g/dL for definition of clinical relevance appeared acceptable. In an additional  analysis  the  applicant  could  provide  evidence  that  the  clinical  effect  of  batch  changes (measured as frequency of subsequent dose adjustments) of SB309 or due to product changes (from Erypo to SB309 or vice versa),  was not increased compared to batch changes of the reference product Erypo and therefore unlikely to elicit a safety concern. In addition, the applicant could show that Hb levels  and  epoetin  doses  were  very  similar  in  a  subgroup  of  patients  receiving  test  and  reference product of similar bioactivity further supporting the assumption that SB309 and Erypo have similar efficacy. Moreover, data from the follow-up study in patients with renal anaemia demonstrate that Hb levels can be well maintained with the use of different batches of SB309. In conclusion, the applicant could reasonably justify the modified equivalence margin of ± 45 IU/kg/week and, more importantly, could  demonstrate  that  a  difference  of  35.1  IU/kg/week  in  epoetin  dose  (worst  case  scenario)  was clinically  not  relevant  in  the  studied  population.  The  CHMP  requested  further  reassurance  that differences in dose up to 45 IU/kg/week (modified equivalence margin) will not result in a different safety profile (see safety section below).

Taken together,  the  study  results  and  additional  analyses  requested  by  CHMP  provided  convincing evidence that SB309 and Erypo have similar efficacy when used IV. The following considerations led to  the  conclusion  that  similar  efficacy  can  also  be  assumed  for  the  SC  route of  administration:  The demonstration  of  similar  efficacy  for  the  IV  route,  together  with  the  similarity  of  PK  profiles, especially bioavailability, for both the IV and SC route of administration suggests similar efficacy also for SC use. The comparison of the efficacy data from the oncology trial with published data are in line with this conclusion.

In conclusion, based on the argumentation and additional data provided by the applicant, comparable clinical  efficacy  between SB309 and Erypo has been demonstrated not only with regard to the Hbtargeted endpoint but also with regard to epoetin dose for both routes of administration. The observed difference  in  epoetin  dose  appears  to  be  due  to  a  difference  in  the  syringe  content  (in  terms  of bioactivity  and  protein  content)  of  the  test  and  reference  product  batches  despite  the  same  nominal dose but is not considered clinically relevant. The difference in syringe content may be explained by the  use  of  different  bioassays  for  determination  of  bioactivity  for  the  test  product  (normocythaemic mouse bioassay used in the EU) and the reference product (exhypoxic polycythaemic mouse bioassay used in the USA).

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Safety  data  were  derived  from  922  adult  haemodialysis  patients  (correction  phase  study:  n=609 patients,  thereof  206  without  epoetin  pre-treatment;  maintenance  phase  study:  n=313  patients)  have been provided. Of these, 618 patients were treated with SB309 and 617 patients with Erypo for 12-24 weeks in the double-blind phases of the respective studies. A total of 745 patients who completed the correction  phase  study  (n=513)  and  the  maintenance  phase  study  (n=232)  are  further  treated  for  at least 52 weeks with SB309 in the ongoing follow-up study 411-54-04-14-0000.

The clinical safety data were also derived from 208 patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia and treated with SB309 in Study 441-54-04-46-0000.

## Adverse events

The most frequently observed AEs were hypertension, AV-fistula thrombosis/complications, infections and cardiovascular events. The observed spectrum of AEs was that expected for patients on haemodialysis. Cardiovascular events are the most common cause of death in this population.

Although, overall there did not appear to be significant differences in the safety profiles of the test and reference drugs, there were nevertheless, differences seen in the correction phase trial which showed more  common  AEs  considered  at  least  possibly  drug-related  for  SB309.  Particularly,  an  increased incidence of drug-related cases of hypertension and SAEs involving hypertensive crisis, haemorrhagic stroke,  cerebrovascular  events  and  TIA  were  seen  with  SB309  in  the  correction  phase  trial.  In  this trial,  the  rate  of  hypertensive  events  was  9.2%  (8.2%  related)  (which  occurred  in  6.6%  of  patients) with SB309 compared to 5.9% (5.5% related) (which occurred in 4.3% of patients) with reference. On the  other  hand,  AV  fistula  thromboses  occurred  more  often  in  Erypo  treated  compared  to  SB309 treated patients (incidence 4.6% vs. 2.3%, respectively). A total of 16 patients (11 SB309  versus 5 Erypo) had SAEs belonging to the SOC 'nervous system disorders'. Following an assessment of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, it was assumed that these patients were at a higher risk  due  to  their  significantly  higher  blood  pressure  values  (147.77 mmHg±18.33)  compared  to  all other  patients  (139.93  mmHg±19.55).  Although,  in  the  correction  phase  study  overall  SAEs  were reported at a similar rate, i.e. in 94 and in 96 cases of test and reference treatment, respectively, SAEs relating to cerebrovascular events were more frequent in the SB309 group (10 vs. 3), whereas SAEs relating to AV fistula thromboses were more frequent in the Erypo group (9 vs.4). Hypertension/hypertensive  crisis  occurred  in  2.1%  of  patients  during  test  treatment  and  in  2.0%  of patients during reference treatment.

In the maintenance phase trial, hypertension occurred in 1.9% of SB309 treated and in 2.2% of Erypo treated patients. There were 3 cases of hypertensive crisis with SB309 compared with only one in the reference group. On the other hand, peripheral occlusive disease and coronary artery disease was more frequent in the reference than in the test group (1.6% vs. 0.3% and 1.3% vs. 0%, respectively). Again, the  absolute  numbers  were  small.  Overall,  43  SB309  treated  patients  experienced  71  SAEs  and  52 Erypo treated patients experienced 75 SAEs. With respect to SAEs the numbers for hypertension and hypertensive  crisis  were  2.8  %  in  the  test  vs.  0%  in  the  reference  group.  However,  none  were apparently drug related.

In patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia, eighty-four patients experienced a total of 163 AEs during the 12-week treatment period. Ninty-one of these events were assessed as serious and 65 AEs as  severe  by  the  investigators.  Twenty-one  patients  dropped-out  due  to  58  AEs  within  the  first  12 weeks.  The  AEs  experienced  during  the  trial  were  typical  for  patients  with  cancer  receiving chemotherapy.  The  incidences  of  adverse  events  observed  in  the  present  trial  are  comparable  with literature data  in this population (Cortesi et al., 2005, Littlewood et al., 2001, Prescribing Information Procrit 2007). The causal relationship of these AEs and the study medication was judged as not related in  87.1%  (n=142),  unlikely  in  8.0%  (n=13),  probable  in  2.5%  (n=4,  deep  vein  thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, GI disorder, rash), possible in 1.2% (n=2, deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation) and not assessable in 0.6% (n=1, infection) of cases. The two patients for which the event was judged as possibly related to study medication dropped-out. The mean systolic blood pressure remained more or less constant from visit 0 (123.07 ± 15.31 mmHg) to visit 5 (122.97 ± 14.23 mmHg). The same applies for the mean diastolic blood pressure: visit 0 (76.18 ± 10.41 mmHg) and visit 5 (76.98 ± 9.06 mmHg). Local tolerability as assessed by the investigators after each administration of study drug was either excellent (83.2%-92.1%) or good (7.9%-16.8%).

Incidence of clinically significant thrombotic events in patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia At the date of the interim report 9 cases (AE or SAEs) were identified to belong to the events defined as primary endpoint: 1 superior vena cava occlusion (AE), 2 cardiac failures, 1 acute cardiac failure, 2 cardiopulmonary failures, 2  deep  vein  thromboses,  and  1  thrombophlebitis.  The  cardiac  failure,  the acute cardiac failure and the cardiopulmonary failure were associated with a fatal outcome. One of the 9  events  occurred  within  the  second  treatment  period.  The  incidence  rate  of  clinically  significant thrombotic events in the safety population of patients (n=208) within the 12 weeks of treatment was thus  3.9% (8 of 208). This incidence rate is similar or lower than the published incidence rates for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

thrombotic events in epoetin treated cancer patients being between 5-6% (Vansteenkiste et al., 2002; Prescribing  Information  Epogen,  2004)  and  approx.  30%  (Rosenzweig  2004).  For  patients  with metastasic  breast  cancer  and  receiving  a  five  drug  chemotherapeutic  regimen  but  not  treated  with epoetin an incidence of 17.5% of such events was published by Goodnough (1984). The definition of thrombotic events in the present trial was as broad as possible in order to avoid any positive bias in favour of the test drug. Three cases (one of which was uncertain) of death in the oncology trial were associated with the development of a thrombotic event.

## Immunogenicity

In both comparative trials in patients with renal anaemia ,  serum samples for determination of antiepoetin antibodies were drawn at start and during the study.  The samples were frozen at -20º C and kept until analysis in a central laboratory. In all patients, the last available blood sample was analysed first.  Only  if  anti-epoetin  antibodies  were  detected  all  previous  blood  samples  for  the  respective patient  analysed  in  order  to  detect  the  time  point  of  first  occurrence.  In  suspicious  cases  with respective  clinical  symptoms,  blood  samples  could  be  analysed  at  an  earlier  time  point.  Usually, antibody testing should be performed from the beginning and on an ongoing basis to detect possible problems with immunogenicity early on. For determination of anti-erythropoietin antibodies in human serum samples a validated radio-immuno-precipitation assay (RIP-assay) was employed. This assay has  been  previously  described  and  published  by  Casadevall  et  al.    In  the correction  phase  study , eleven patients were positive for anti-epoetin antibodies (7 patients in the SB309 group and 4 in the reference  group,  see  Table  below).  However,  in  all  these  11  patients  anti-erythropoietin  antibodies were already present at the screening visit. Although positive at the final visit, one patient was finally regarded as  negative  in  all  available  samples.  In  the maintenance  study ,  three  (approx  1%)  of  the randomised patients had positive results for anti-epoetin antibodies which were already present at the screening  visit  (see  Table  17).  No  indication  of  PRCA  was  present  in  any  of  the  patients  with  a positive result in the screening test for anti-erythropoietin antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  oncology  study  samples  from  189  patients  with chemotherapy-related  anaemia were evaluated  in  view  of  occurrence  of  anti-epoetin  antibodies.  All  samples  tested  showed  a  negative result.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There was no significant treatment difference in mortality between treatment groups in haemodialysis patients.  During  the  correction  phase  trial,  26  vs  17  patients  of  the  test  and  reference  group, respectively,  were  withdrawn  due  to  an  AE,  those  withdrawn  due  to  SAEs  were  22  vs  14,  with withdrawal  figures  involving  the  nervous  system  SOC  showing  10  vs  2  for  SB309  and  reference, respectively. During the maintenance phase trial, 20 patients of each treatment group were withdrawn due to an AE. In the uncontrolled follow up study, 41 patients had study medication withdrawn. For SAEs see above.

In patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia, a total number of 19 patients died in the course of the trial until 26-Jul-2007 (14 within the first 12-week treatment period). One patient died before start of treatment. Fourteen cases of death were judged as not related and five cases as unlikely related to the study medication. A total of 93 SAEs were observed in 41 patients. In 19 patients (8.8 % of the study population) the SAE had a fatal outcome. The majority of SAEs reported so far belong to the SOCs blood and lymphatic system disorders (22.6%, n=21) and infections and infestations (17.2%, n=16), and renal and urinary disorders (10.8%, n=10). Among the first two groups pancytopenia was reported for 8.6% (n=8) of SAEs, followed by anaemia, febrile neutropenia and leukopenia (each 3.2%, n=3). Within the group of infections and infestations 5.4% (n=5) belong to sepsis, and 4.3% (n=4) belong to bronchopneumonia. Only eight SAEs could currently be identified to belong to the events defined as primary endpoint (2x cardiac failure, acute cardiac failure, 2x cardiopulmonary failure, 2x deep vein thrombosis,  and  thrombophlebitis).  The  majority  of  SAEs  were  assessed  as  severe  (79.6%,  n=74). Only 19.4% (n=18) of all reported events were assessed as moderate and 1.1% (n= 1) as mild. Most of the  reported  SAEs  were  judged  as  not  related  to  study  medication  (82.8%,  n=77).  An  unlikely relationship  to  study  drug  was  reported  for  14.0%  of  SAEs  (n=13).  Three  events  were  judged  as possibly related and concerned atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis. The study medication was withdrawn in 20 of 208 patients (9.6%) due to an adverse event.

## Laboratory findings and vital signs

Laboratory parameters were generally unremarkable and not significantly different between treatment groups. Vital signs: In the correction phase study, 4 out of a total of 53 SB309-treated patients with normotensive  blood  pressure  at  baseline  developed  hypertension.  The  majority  of  patients  showed hypertension at the beginning (n=226) and at the end (n=225) of the trial. Within the reference group, one  out  of  a  total  of  60  patients  with  normal  blood  pressure  at  entry  experienced  hypotension  and 4 patients developed hypertension at final visit. Blood pressure indicating  hypertension was measured in 217 patients at entry visit.

## Discussion on clinical safety

## Patients with renal anaemia

The observed spectrum of AEs is that expected for patients on haemodialysis. Concerning the adverse event  profile  of  SB309  observed  in  the  correction  phase  trial,  increase  in  blood  pressure  and propensity to thrombosis during epoetin therapy could at least be partly explained by an increase in blood  volume  and  the  change  in  viscosity  and  rheologic  properties  of  the  blood  with  increasing Hb/haematocrit.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  from  the  study  data  that  SB309  would  lead  to overshooting  Hb  response.  In  fact,  mean  Hb  values  were  very  similar  during  the  correction  phase study  and,  if  anything,  somewhat  lower  in  the  maintenance  phase  study.  Thus  the  most  likely explanation for the observed small differences appears to be variability in this high-risk population.

The applicant conducted a number of analyses to address the concern of increased hypertensive events with SB309 observed in the anaemia correction study. High systolic BP has been identified as the only relevant risk factor for SAEs in the SOC Nervous System Disorder and this finding re-emphasizes the already known critical need for effective BP control in this high-risk population. Overall the data do not conclusively suggest that patients are at increased risk for hypertension and related events when using  SB309  compared  to  Erypo.  In  the  same  line,  no  such  increased  risk  has  been  identified  for SB309  in  the  maintenance  phase  study  (or  in  the  oncology  trial).  The  MAA  has  committed  to  an undertaking to monitor blood pressure in both naïve and pre-treated patients and  provide a proposal within  a  timeframe    to  be  agreed  by  CHMP.  Concerning  the  SOCs  of  specific  interest  (blood  and lymphatic  system,  cardiac  disorder,  vascular  disorders)  and  SAEs  in  the  SOC  Nervous  System Disorder,  the  applicant  committed  to  keep  these  events  under  review.  The  Applicant  will  further monitor hypertensive encephalopathy and will also include other CNS SOC events as part of the RMP.

## Patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia

The Applicant provided an interim  report  on  the  oncology  trial  441-54-04-46-0000  and  a  final  12week safety report. The observed AE profile in this study was in line with that expected in this very ill population but due to the non-comparative nature of the study, direct comparison with the reference product was not possible. The incidence of thrombotic events was low, despite a very broad definition of  this  term.  Based  on  the  current  safety  information  and  published  series,  there  is  no  concern regarding the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia with SB309.

## Immunogenicity

Concerning  immunogenicity,  the  applicant  presented  an  interim  report  including  12-month  data  on 227  patients  with  renal  anaemia  and  a  later  update  on  585  patients.  The  size  of  this  database  is considered  sufficient.  No  new  anti-epoetin  antibodies  developed  during  IV  treatment  with  SB309  , which is reassuring. All samples tested from the oncology trial (N=189 patients) were negative for anti-epoetin antibodies.

Immunogenicity of epoetin is  considered  greater  for  SC  use  than  IV  use  and  in  immunocompetent (particular renal anaemia) patients than immunocompromised patients. Immunogenicity of SC use of SB309 has not been evaluated in patients with renal anaemia and, therefore, a respective warning and restriction to IV use in this population has been included into the SPC.

## The screening assay is considered sufficiently validated and sensitive.

The applicant did not perform a neutralisation assay to examine whether the detected antibodies have neutralising  properties  because  no  new  antibodies  developed  during  the  study  and  in  all  antibodypositive cases, titres decreased or remained stable during the study period indicating a lack of a boost effect  of  SB309.  The  applicant  could  show  that  a  qualified  and  sufficiently  validated  neutralisation assay is available for the post-marketing phase. However, to support all aspects of the validation some additional tests should be performed as a follow up measure.

Contraindications and warnings for epoetin zeta are in line with Reference Product, Eprex/Erypo.

## Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

The description of the applicant's pharmacovigilance system contains comprehensive information on all relevant aspects and is considered acceptable.

The applicant identified potential risks which were not detected in the studies but which are known class  effects  for  epoetins.  Therefore  the  applicant  plans  special  pharmacovigilance  activities  to evaluate the potential risk of thromboembolic reactions in oncological patients as well as immunogenicity in patients with renal anaemia in association with the use of SB309.

The RMP relating to the immunogenicity aspect (close monitoring using specific questionnaires) is generally acceptable. The applicant was asked to design their post-marketing investigations to take this into  account  in  addition  to  the  investigation  of  the  risk  of  neutralising  antibody  formation,  and thromboembolism in cancer patients.

The overall safety profile of SB309 and the reference product Erypo appear to be similar. However, since pre-marketing data are limited, the applicant was asked to present an appropriate pharmacovigilance plan in order to further study the safety profile of SB309, particularly rare SAEs such as immune mediated PRCA.

In conclusion, the Risk Management Plan is considered acceptable for the current application provided the  Applicant  will  also  include  other  CNS  events  in  addition  to  hypertensive  encephalopathy  for further monitoring and provides a proposal on how to monitor blood pressure in both naïve and pretreated patients in the post-marketing phase.

The  applicant  has  committed  to  perform  a  SC  study  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  similar medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins  (CHMP/94526/05)  using  the  reference product Erypo as comparator. In addition, the applicant has committed to submitting a protocol for market survey to monitor potential off-label use.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the above mentioned risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product.

## Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Extensive,  high  quality  studies  were  performed  to  compare  SB309  to  the  reference  product Erypo/Eprex at both the drug substance and the drug product level. The characterisation of the drug substance and the comparability studies to compare drug substance from different scale manufacturing process is also considered high quality applying state-of-the-art analytical methods with a high level of detail.

Manufacturing Processes  and  analytical  methods  have  been  appropriately  validated  and  safety  with regard to adventitious agents demonstrated.  Satisfactory controls have been applied.

Two major objections  at  the  time  of  D121  List  of  Questions  have  been  resolved  and  a  number  of remaining  minor  points  remaining  were  proposed  as  commitments  to  be  concluded  in  the  postauthorisation period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The comparability of SB309 and Erypo was extensively tested preclinically at several levels (receptor binding,  growth  stimulation  of  cultured  bone  marrow  cells,  haematopoesis  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs, immunogenicity  in  rats  and  dogs)  so  that  the  claim  of  biosimilarity  relies  on  a  robust  and  broad preclinical  data  base.  Therefore,  since  all  aspects  of  epoetin  action  were  covered  by  the  preclinical development programme (as far as technically feasible), and no unexpected effects were detected the use of SB309 in patients appears safe from a pharmaco-toxicological point of view.

## Efficacy

From  a  clinical  point  of  view  the  applicant  has  provided  sufficient  evidence  that  SB309  and  the reference product Erypo are similarly effective in correcting and maintaining haemoglobin concentrations and in this respect qualify as biosimilar products.

Both  pivotal  efficacy  trials  met  their  primary  endpoint  with  respect  to  mean  haemoglobin  levels. Although, in the correction phase trial, the 95% CI of the treatment difference in epoetin dosage was outside the pre-specified equivalence margins, the applicant clarified that these pre-set margins were due to a misreading of the EPAR on Dynepo and therefore should be corrected to 45 IU/kg /week. This newly proposed acceptance range was further supported by literature.

In  addition,  the  applicant  provided  evidence  that  a  difference  of  35.3  IU/kg/week  in  epoetin  dose (worst  case  scenario)  was  clinically  not  relevant  in  the  investigated  study  population,  whether  this difference was calculated as absolute value or as percentage of the reference dose (21%).

Moreover, the applicant could provide evidence that the clinical effect of batch changes (measured as frequency of subsequent dose adjustments) of SB309 or due to product changes (from Erypo to SB309 or  vice  versa)  was  not  increased  compared  to  batch  changes  of  the  reference  product  Erypo  and therefore unlikely to elicit a safety concern if test is used instead of reference. A sub-group analysis of patients  who  received  batches  of  test  and  reference  of  similar  bioactivity  showed  very  similar  and stable Hb values and therefore provided additional reassurance of biosimilarity.

Although the oncology study, by design, could not prove similar efficacy of SB309 and Erypo, the observed increases in Hb over time are in good agreement with published data on epoetin alfa and therefore further support the conclusion of biosimilarity..

## Safety

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

SB309 is a biological medicinal product. Data from clinical studies with SB309 are in line with the safety profile of other authorized epoetin-containing medicinal products and did not reveal unanticipated or unusual safety findings.

The overall safety profile of SB309 and the reference product Erypo appear to be similar. However, since pre-marketing data are limited, the applicant was asked to present an appropriate pharmacovigilance plan in order to further study the safety profile of SB309, particularly rare SAEs such as immune mediated PRCA. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 5 adequately addressed these.

## User consultation

A satisfactory user consultation for readability of the patient leaflet has been undertaken

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk-benefit assessment

Based on the data on quality, efficacy and safety, the risk-benefit ratio is considered positive for the IV indications. Biosimilarity between SB309 and Erypo has been sufficiently established. The applicant has applied for both the intravenous and the subcutaneous route of administration for their epoetincontaining medicinal product SB309.  However,  no  comparative  efficacy and safety data on subcutaneous  use  have  been  provided.  Despite  this  short-coming,  the  benefit-risk  ratio  is  also considered positive for the SC use of SB309 in the chemotherapy-associated anaemia indication based on the following considerations. In terms of efficacy, IV administered SB309 and Erypo have been shown to have similar PK profiles as well as similar efficacy in correcting anaemia and maintaining Hb levels in patients with renal anaemia.  Based on this similarity for the IV route, the demonstration of similar PK profiles, particularly bioavailability, for the SC route of administration suggests similar efficacy  also  for  SC  use.  The  comparison  of  the  efficacy  data  from  the  chemotherapy-associated anaemia  trial  with  published  data  are  in  line  with  this  conclusion.  The  safety  profiles  of  IV administered SB309 and Erypo have been shown to be generally similar. In addition, no new safety concern  (including  immunogenicity)  emerged  from  the  chemotherapy-associated  anaemia  study.  In fact,  the  AE  incidences  in  the  chemotherapy-associated  anaemia  trial,  particularly  the  incidence  of clinically significant thrombotic events, were similar or lower than those published for epoetin alfa. Based  on  these  considerations  the  chemotherapy-associated  anaemia  indication  applied  for  is considered approvable.

The benefit-risk ratio is not considered positive for the major orthopaedic surgery indication because immunogenicity of SC administered SB309 has not been assessed in immunocompetent individuals. Antibody  data  cannot  be  extrapolated  from  IV  to  SC  use  or  from  immunocompromised  to immunocompetent individuals. The applicant has withdrawn this indication.

Although  there  are  no  remaining  major  issues  there  are  still  some  safety  concerns  with  respect  to increased SAEs in the Central Nervous System SOC with SB309 both in the correction study as well as the follow up study.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns

the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see details in Annex II of the Product Information

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of SB309 in the treatment of:

anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in adult and paediatric patients on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (IV use)

severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (IV use)

anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status

Increasing the yield of autologous blood from patients in a pre-donation programme was  favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
