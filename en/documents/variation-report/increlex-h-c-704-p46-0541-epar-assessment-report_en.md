## 1. Introduction

On  6th  October  2014  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  (MS305)  for  Increlex,  in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the specific obligation SO 002.1 (Long term safety study).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Increlex and that  no  consequential  regulatory  action  is  required.  No  amendments  are  introduced  to  the  Product Information.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH states that Study MS305 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for: Increlex (Mecasermin (Rdna Origin) Injection) Growth  Forum Database-IGFG Registry: A Patient Registry For Monitoring Long-Term Safety And Efficacy Of Increlex. Study number: W-TG-52800-010/MS305.

The United States Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Deficiency (US-IGFD) Registry was a retrospective and prospective  patient  registry  sponsored  by  Ipsen  Biopharmaceuticals,  Inc.  In  collaboration  with participating  health  care  practitioners,  this  observational  study  monitored  the  long  term  safety  of patients  treated  with  Increlex  (mecasermin  (rDNA)  origin).  The  US-IGFD  Registry  was  intended primarily to monitor the safety and efficacy of Increlex therapy in children with growth failure.

## 2.2.2. Clinical study

## Study  MS305:  Increlex  (Mecasermin  (Rdna  Origin)  Injection)  Growth Forum  Database-IGDF  Registry:  A  Patient  Registry  For  Monitoring  LongTerm Safety And Efficacy Of Increlex.

## Description

This study was initiated voluntarily in 2006 by Tercica, Inc. after regulatory approval of Increlex in the US, as a noninterventional real world experience subject registry. The study was not initiated to fulfil any FDA post approval requirements, but to provide more data than was available in the NDA.

Due to the low number of patients meeting the key inclusion criteria relevant to provide meaningful efficacy results, the data from this study could not be analysed for efficacy. In addition, a very small number of subjects were treated with Increlex  for  the  US  labelled  indication,  although  it  should  be noted that the US labelled indication is very similar to the EU one.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  a  result,  only  baseline  characteristics  and  safety  data  were  analysed  and  presented  herein. Consequently, this abbreviated Clinical Study Report (CSR) does not contain all the sections required by ICH E3 but does contain full safety data as requested by ICH. This is the final CSR of the US-IGFD Registry following its closure.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The study objectives were:

- To obtain long term safety data for Increlex replacement therapy in children with growth failure
- To obtain long term efficacy data for Increlex replacement therapy in children with growth failure

## Study design

This minimal risk, phase IV, multicentre, open label, observational study of the long term safety and efficacy of Increlex treatment was open ended with the duration of Increlex treatment determined at the investigator's discretion.

The  US-IGFD  Registry  was  initiated  in  May  2006  and  closed  on  23  May  2014.  The  protocol  was  a retrospective and prospective patient registry originally sponsored by Tercica, Inc. (a subsidiary of the Ipsen Group). In collaboration with participating healthcare providers, the US-IGFD Registry monitored the long term safety and efficacy of children with growth failure treated with Increlex in the US.

All  data collected were from the patients' medical records, which were recorded as part of standard medical care. No additional patient procedures or activities were mandated or performed during this study. The data were captured using electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) via a secure website. Some data were mandatory for data transmission (e.g. Increlex dose, height, weight, and adverse events (AEs)) but other data were optional. Optional data were those considered useful to the data analysis but which, depending on the standard of care at each site, may or may not have been collected at each visit  (e.g.  serum  IGF-1  levels),  or  may  not  be  available  to  the  investigator  (e.g.  gestational  age  at birth). The eCRF provided the opportunity to report the occurrence of targeted AEs, other important events considered to be related to Increlex administration and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Due to the low number of patients meeting the key inclusion criteria relevant to provide meaningful efficacy results, these data were not analysed and only baseline and safety data are presented.

## Study population /Sample size

Patients entered into the US-IGFD Registry conformed to the following inclusion criteria:

· Parents or legally authorised representatives were required to give signed informed consent and must have given signed Authorisation to Use and Disclose Health Information before any Registry related activities were conducted. Assent from the patient was also to be obtained where appropriate.

• Patients receiving Increlex prescribed by a qualified practitioner were enrolled.

No exclusion criteria were specified.

This was a phase IV observational registry study. No formal sample size and power calculations were performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Increlex was prescribed by a qualified physician according to the individual need of a patient.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Safety assessments, performed at the follow up, end of therapy and post-treatment visits consisted of:

- Serious AEs

·  All  targeted  AEs  (asymptomatic papilloedema, acromegalic facial changes, oedema, gynecomastia, hearing loss, headache, hypoglycaemia, intracranial hypertension (other than asymptomatic papilloedema),  lipohypertrophy  at  injection  site, myalgia,  otitis  media,  sleep  apnoea,  tonsillar hypertrophy, urticaria and injection site reaction)

- Other significant non serious AEs
- Non serious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities
- Increlex exposure

Targeted AEs were AEs of special interest based on clinical trials and research related to PIGFD and data  were  therefore  sought  proactively.  The  occurrence  of  each  targeted  AE,  other  significant nonserious AEs and nonserious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported at each visit as 'yes/no.' No start or stop dates were collected for these AEs. Relationship to treatment, severity of the  AE,  outcome  and  action  taken  regarding  Increlex  treatment  were  only  reported  for  SAEs.  All targeted AEs were considered related to treatment.

## Statistical Methods

Detailed  methodology  for  summary  and  statistical  analyses  of  the  data  collected  in  the  US-IGFD Registry is documented in the Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) dated 20 May 2014.

All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  by  the  biostatistics  unit  of  a  CRO  contracted by  the  Sponsor using  Statistical  Analysis  System  (SAS®)  software  Version  9.2  or  higher  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary, North Carolina, US). The statistical analyses were performed in accordance with ICH E9 guidelines and were to be based on the pooled data from the individual US study sites, unless otherwise stated.

Demographics,  the  results  of  the  IGF-1  generation  test,  GH  concentrations,  diagnoses,  previous therapy  and  the  results  of  genetic  tests  were  summarised  overall  and  by  gender  for  the  enrolled population.

For  the  primary  endpoint,  each  type  of  AE  (targeted  AEs,  other  related  significant  nonserious  AEs, nonserious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and SAEs) were summarised with the number and proportion of subjects with at least one event classified by primary System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). The number of occurrences was also presented. For each type of SAE, severity and causality were described.

Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs with onset dates within 31 days following the last Increlex injection. Pretreatment AEs were those occurring before the first Increlex injection and post-treatment AEs were those occurring after 31 days of the last Increlex injection.

Data were summarised for the safety follow up population and the safety post-treatment population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

1377 subjects were enrolled from 114 active sites.

Among the enrolled population, 1342 (97.5%) subjects were included in the safety population (fewer in number than the enrolled population, as this population comprised enrolled subjects with at least one follow up visit or any safety data collected during treatment follow up), 1339 (97.2%) subjects had at least one follow up treatment visit (safety follow up population) and 164 (11.9%) subjects had posttreatment follow up data (safety post-treatment population).

The  number  of  subjects  who  discontinued  and  the  reasons  for  treatment  withdrawal  are  and summarised in Table 3. In total, 804 subjects discontinued from the US-IGFD Registry, with 40 (5.0%) of these due to AEs.

## Protocol Deviations

The major protocol violation that occurred during the conduct of the study was lack of documented informed  consent  in  many  subjects.  Of  the  1377  subjects  enrolled,  678  (49.2%)  lacked  adequate documentation that signed informed consent had been obtained. Due to site closure ICFs could not be verified, and subjects from closed sites were counted as subjects lacking documented ICFs.

## Baseline data

Demographic characteristics of subjects in the enrolled population are and summarised in Table 4.

There  were  more  boys  than girls  (1047  (76.0%)  and  330  (24.0%)  subjects,  respectively).  The mean±SD age at first Increlex treatment was 11.0±3.6 years for boys and 9.8±3.5 years for girls.

Thus, boys tended to be older than girls at first Increlex intake.

At baseline (enrolment visit, Day 0), in boys, mean±SD height was 128.3±19.6 cm, mean±SD height SDS was -2.4±0.9 and mean±SD height velocity was 5.0±2.3 cm/year.

At baseline, in girls, mean±SD height was 120.6±19.3 cm, mean±SD height SDS was -2.6±1.1 and mean±SD height velocity was 5.2±2.2 cm/year.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At baseline, in boys, mean±SD weight was 29.0±11.8 kg and mean±SD weight SDS was -2.1±1.5.

At baseline, in girls, mean±SD weight was 25.5±11.7 kg and mean±SD weight SDS was -2.1±1.5.

With respect to Tanner stage, at baseline the majority of boys had pubic hair assessments indicating stages I (472 (74.8%) subjects) and II (95 (15.1%) subjects). The majority of girls had pubic hair assessments indicating Tanner stages I (146 (76.8%) subjects) and II (28 (14.7%) subjects).

With   respect   to   IGF-1,   in   boys,   the   mean±SD   serum   concentration   was 147.6±147.5 ng/mL (ranging from 0.0-1565.0 ng/mL, with 137  missing values); in girls,  the  mean±SD  serum concentration was 177.9±195.5 ng/mL (ranging from 1.9-1293.0 ng/mL, with 49 missing values).

With  respect  to  GH,  in  boys  the  mean±SD  basal  GH  concentration  was 4.4±13.9 ng/mL (ranging from 0.0-200.0 ng/mL with 643 missing values) and the mean±SD highest stimulated GH concentration was 20.0±12.8 ng/mL (ranging from 0.1-131.0 ng/mL,  with  410  missing  values).

In girls, the mean±SD  basal  GH concentration was 4.5±5.4 ng/mL (ranging from 0.0-29.1 ng/mL, with  218  missing  values)  and  the  mean±SD  highest  stimulated  GH  concentration  was  20.8±14.5 ng/mL (ranging from 0.8-107.6 ng/mL, with 143 missing values).

The range of values was wide and there were a large number of missing values. It should  be  noted that  GH  and  IGF-1  concentrations  are  dependent  on  age  and pubertal status which could account for the wide range of concentrations obtained.

## Diagnosis

The most common primary diagnosis was primary IGFD (769 (73.4%) boys and 218 (66.1%) girls). These data also indicated that Increlex was being prescribed for other primary diagnoses, the most common being idiopathic short stature (207 (19.8%) boys and 79 (23.9%) girls).

## Measurements of Treatment Exposure

Treatment  exposure  was  estimated  by  the  physician/study  coordinator  based  on  parent/subject reports. The data are and summarised in Table 12.

At baseline, the median dose of Increlex administered was 41.6 µg/kg twice daily (BID) in boys and 55.9  µg/kg  BID  in  girls.  The  investigators  took  3-6  months  to  bring  subjects  up  to  the  maximum approved dose of Increlex (120 µg/kg given BID) instead of the recommended 2 weeks. A total of 804 (58.4%) subjects permanently discontinued the treatment.

## Efficacy results

Due to the low number of patients meeting the key inclusion criteria relevant to provide meaningful efficacy results these data were not analysed and are not provided in this abbreviated report.

## Safety results

## Extent of Exposure

The extent of exposure to Increlex is summarised in Table 13. The mean±SD duration of treatment with  Increlex  was  25.4±16.9  months  for  boys  and 23.6±17.4  months  for  girls,  and  was  therefore comparable between the genders. The maximum duration of Increlex treatment was 80.1 months for boys and 76.2 months for girls. The sum of duration of treatment with Increlex expressed in terms of subject  years  was  2151.5  years  for  boys  and  637.7  years  for  girls,  which  reflected the  gender imbalance in this study.

## Adverse Events

The safety analysis is based on a safety follow up population of 1017 boys and 322 girls and a safety post-treatment population, which comprised 112 boys and 52 girls.

Treatment emergent AEs recorded in the safety follow up population are summarised in Table 14.

In the US-IGFD Registry, 371 (27.7%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced a total of 1256 TEAEs, of which 83 (experienced by 46 (3.4%) subjects) were serious TEAEs. With respect to targeted TEAEs, 667 events were experienced by 251 (18.7%) subjects, of which 13 (experienced by 11 (0.8%) subjects) were serious targeted TEAEs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  total,  667  targeted  TEAEs  were  reported  for  251  (18.7%)  subjects.  The  most  frequent  targeted TEAEs  (affecting  more  than  1%  of  the  subjects)  were:  hypoglycaemia  (125  (9.3%)  subjects), headache (90 (6.7%) subjects), injection site reaction (26 (1.9%) subjects), otitis media (22 (1.6%) subjects), myalgia (20 (1.5%) subjects), tonsillar hypertrophy (17 (1.3%) subjects) and injection site hypertrophy (16 (1.2%) subjects). There were 13 serious targeted TEAEs in 11 (0.8%) subjects.

Serious targeted TEAEs comprised tonsillar hypertrophy (four (0.3%) subjects), hypoglycaemia (two (0.1%)  subjects),  otitis  media  (two  (0.1%)  subjects),  intracranial  pressure  increased  (two  (0.1%) subjects), headache (one (&lt;0.1%) subject) and papilloedema (one (&lt;0.1%) subject).

Five  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  tonsillar  hypertrophy  (two  mild  and  three  moderate)  were reported in four subjects, with times to onset ranging from 111 to 1368 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they involved hospitalisation (two cases), were medically significant (two cases) or were both medically significant and involved hospitalisation (one case).  In  four  cases,  the  drug  was  temporarily  suspended.  The  events  were  all  reported  to  have resolved in periods ranging from 1 to 129 days.

Two serious Increlex related cases of hypoglycaemia (one moderate and one mild) were reported in two subjects, with times to onset of 896 and 661 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events  were  assessed  as  serious  as  they  were  both  medically  significant.  In  one  case,  the  dose  of Increlex was reduced as a result of the event, with no action taken in the other case. Both events were reported to have resolved.

Two serious Increlex unrelated cases of otitis media (both moderate in intensity) were reported in two subjects, with times to onset of 689 and 104 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they both involved hospitalisation. In one case, no action was taken with respect to the study drug; in the other case, the drug was temporarily suspended. Both events were reported to have resolved.

Two serious Increlex related events of intracranial pressure increased (one moderate and one severe) were reported in two subjects, with times to onset of 88 and 67 days. These events were assessed as serious  as  they  involved  hospitalisation  (one  case)  or  were  both  life  threatening  and  involved hospitalisation (one case). Both of these events led to drug withdrawal and were reported resolved in 3 and 136 days.

One serious Increlex related case of headache (severe in intensity) was reported in one subject, with a time to onset of 207 days after the start of Increlex treatment. This event was assessed as serious as it was medically significant. The drug was temporarily suspended and the event resolved after 4 days.

One serious Increlex related event of papilloedema (severe in intensity) was reported in one subject, with a time to onset of 118 days. This event was assessed as serious as it involved hospitalisation. This event led to drug withdrawal and was reported resolved in 1 day.

## Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Other Significant Adverse Events

## Deaths

Two deaths were recorded during the study, both during follow up .

Subject  1162  (aged  20  years  at the  time  of  the  event)  experienced  sudden  unexpected  death, recorded  as  possibly  related  to  study  drug.  This  male  subject  was  aged  15.0  years  at  the  start  of Increlex intake and had been treated with Increlex for PIGFD for 2102 days before the onset of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

event. The subject's medical history included a familial risk factor of Laron syndrome, Type I diabetes and hypoglycaemic episodes. The subject was not taking any concomitant medications.

For Subject 2273 (aged 13 years at the time of the event), death was due to progression of sickle cell disease and recorded as being unrelated to study drug. This male subject was aged 11.7 years at the start of Increlex intake and had been treated with Increlex for idiopathic short stature for 1116 days before  the  onset  of  the  event.  The  subject's  concurrent  conditions  included  sulphonamide  allergy, asthma  and  sickle  cell  disease,  while  his  past  medical  history  included  serious  events  of  fever  of unknown origin, hypoxia, Epstein Barr virus infection and infarcts.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

In the US-IGFD Registry study, 46 (3.4%) subjects experienced a total of 83 serious TEAEs during the study period. These are summarised by SOC and PT for the safety follow up population in Table 17.

## Other Serious TEAEs (Related and Not Related)

The most common serious TEAEs were benign intracranial hypertension (six events experienced by five (0.4%) subjects), tonsillar hypertrophy (five events experienced by four (0.3%) subjects), adenoidal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertrophy  (four  events  experienced  by  three  (0.2%)  subjects  and  constipation  (six  events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects).

A total of 83 serious TEAEs were experienced by 46 patients during treatment with Increlex. For five additional  subjects,  five  SAEs  of  graft  versus  host  disease,  osteonecrosis,  increased  intracranial pressure, pancreatitis and hyperplasia were reported more than 31 days after the last Increlex intake (post-treatment).  Of  the  83  serious  TEAEs,  49  (59.0%)  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity,  33 (39.8%) were of severe intensity and one (1.2%) was of unknown intensity. For 10 subjects, these serious TEAEs led to treatment withdrawal. Serious TEAEs that led to treatment withdrawal included major  depression,  beta  haemolytic  streptococcal  infection,  IgA  nephropathy,  benign  intracranial hypertension  (three  serious  TEAEs  in  three  subjects),  increased  intracranial  pressure  (two  serious TEAEs in two subjects), papilloedema, sickle cell anaemia, condition aggravated, hypersensitivity and convulsion.

Treatment interruption occurred in 21 subjects due to 34 serious TEAEs. Among all serious TEAEs, 39 (47.0%) reported in 24 subjects were considered related to treatment.

The most common treatment related serious TEAEs were benign intracranial hypertension (six events experienced by five (0.4%) subjects), tonsillar hypertrophy (five events experienced by four (0.3%) subjects), adenoidal hypertrophy (four events experienced by three (0.2%) subjects), hypoglycaemia (two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects) and spinal column stenosis (two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects). Most of the 83 serious TEAEs had an outcome of 'resolved.'

## Related Serious TEAEs

Six serious Increlex related cases of benign intracranial hypertension (one severe and five moderate in intensity) were reported by five subjects. The times to onset ranged from 42 to 602 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they were medically significant (five cases) or involved hospitalisation (one case). In three cases, the drug was temporarily suspended and in three cases, the drug was withdrawn. The events were all reported to have resolved in time periods ranging from 2 to 1217 days.

Four  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  adenoidal  hypertrophy  (one  mild  and  three  moderate  in intensity) were reported by three subjects. The times to onset ranged from 286 to 1368 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they were medically significant (two  cases)  or  involved  hospitalisation  (two  cases).  In  three  cases,  the  drug  was  temporarily suspended. The events were all reported to have resolved in time periods ranging from 1 to 129 days.

Four  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  constipation  (all  severe  in  intensity)  were  reported  by  one subject. The times to onset ranged from 1484 to 1641 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events  were  assessed  as  serious  as  they  involved  hospitalisation.  In  one  case,  the  drug  was temporarily suspended, with no action taken in the other cases. The events were all reported to have resolved in time periods ranging from 2 to 3 days.

Two serious Increlex related cases of spinal column stenosis (one severe and one mild in intensity) were reported by two subjects. The times to onset were 1872 and 2077 days after the start of Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they were both medically significant. In one case, the drug was temporarily suspended. Both events were reported as ongoing.

Two  serious  Increlex  related  cases  of  convulsion  (one  moderate  and  one  severe  in  intensity)  were reported  by  two  subjects.  The  times  to  onset  were  21  and  645  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex treatment. These events were assessed as serious as they both involved hospitalisation. In one case,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the drug was temporarily suspended; in the other case, the drug was withdrawn. Both events were reported to have resolved in 1 day.

Serious Increlex related cases (one each) of skin reactions, abdominal pain, encopresis, eye swelling, nasal  oedema,  epiphysiolysis,  hypersensitivity,  haematuria  and  drug  hypersensitivity  (ranging  in intensity from mild to severe) were reported.

The times to onset ranged from 38 to 1641 days after the start of Increlex treatment.

These  events  were  assessed  as  serious  as  they  were  medically  significant  (five  cases),  involved hospitalisation (three cases) or resulted in persistent significant disability (one case). In one case, the drug was withdrawn, in five cases, the drug was temporarily suspended and in three cases no action was taken. The events were all reported to have resolved in time periods ranging from 2 to 260 days.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

## Adverse Events Leading to Drug Withdrawal

In the US-IGFD Registry, 40 (3.0%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced a total of 49 TEAEs that led to drug withdrawal.

Treatment emergent AEs leading to drug withdrawal experienced by more than one subject included hypoglycaemia (four events experienced by four (0.3%) subjects, with times to onset of between 31 and  1062  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex  treatment),  intracranial  pressure  increased  (four  events experienced by three (0.2%) subjects, with times to onset of between 111 and 631 days after the start of  Increlex  treatment),  hypersensitivity  (three  events  experienced  by  three  (0.2%)  subjects,  with times to onset of between 9 and 641 days after the start of Increlex treatment), benign intracranial hypertension (three events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset of between 43 and 196 days after the start of Increlex treatment), acromegalic facial features or facial dysmorphism: two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset of 1786 and 1994 days after the start of Increlex treatment), headache (two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset  of  388  and  690  days  after  the  start  of  Increlex  treatment),  injection  site  rash  (two  events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset of 59 and 69 days after the start of Increlex treatment) and pain in extremity (two events experienced by two (0.1%) subjects, with times to onset of 195 and 1608 days after the start of Increlex treatment).

## Other Significant Nonserious Adverse Events

In  the  US-IGFD  Registry,  179  (13.4%)  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  396  significant  nonserious TEAEs.

The  most  common  significant  nonserious  TEAEs  (reported  in  more  than  five  subjects)  included arthralgia  (15  events  experienced  by  12  (0.9%)  subjects),  snoring  (11  events  experienced  by  10 (0.7%) subjects), pharyngitis streptococcal (10 events  experienced by 10 (0.7%) subjects), pain in extremity  (nine  events  experienced  by  eight  (0.6%)  subjects),  dizziness  and  abnormal  hair  texture (each nine events experienced by seven (0.5%) subjects) and scoliosis (six events experienced by six (0.4%) subjects).

## Analysis and Discussion of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Other

## Significant Adverse Events

Mortality

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were two deaths during the study. One was recorded as sudden, unexpected death, possibly related  to  the  study  drug  and  the  other  was  due  to  progression  of  sickle  cell  disease  and  was  not related to the study drug.

## Serious Adverse Events

A total of 46 (3.4%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced 83 serious TEAEs during the  study  period.  The  most  common  serious  TEAEs  were  benign  intracranial  hypertension,  tonsillar hypertrophy,  adenoidal  hypertrophy  and  constipation.  For  10  subjects,  these  serious  TEAEs  led  to treatment  withdrawal.  In  total,  39  (47.0%)  serious  TEAEs  reported  in  24  subjects  were  considered related to treatment.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

A total of 40 (3.0%) subjects experienced 49 TEAEs that led to drug withdrawal. The most common TEAEs leading to treatment withdrawal were hypoglycaemia, increased intracranial pressure, hypersensitivity and benign intracranial hypertension. Additionally, 179 (13.4%) subjects experienced a total of 396 significant nonserious TEAEs.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## MAH conclusion

The  US-IGFD  Registry  was  a  retrospective  and  prospective  patient  registry  program  sponsored  by Ipsen  Biopharmaceuticals,  Inc.  This  observational  registry  was  initiated  in  the  US  in  May  2006  to monitor the long term safety and efficacy of Increlex in the treatment of children with growth failure. The US-IGFD Registry was closed on 23 May 2014.

Efficacy  analyses  were  not  performed  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion criteria  relevant  to  provide  meaningful  efficacy  results  Only  safety  and  baseline  data  have  been presented.

This US-IGFD Registry study included 1377 patients enrolled in 114 sites (enrolled population), with the mean age at initiation of Increlex intake being 11.0±3.6 years for boys and 9.8±3.5 years for girls. Over 90% of patients had a diagnosis of either PIGFD or idiopathic short stature. Overall, 27.2% of patients had previously received growth promoting therapy.

Overall,  667  targeted  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  251  (18.7%)  patients,  of  which  13  were  serious targeted  TEAEs.  The  most  frequently  reported  targeted  TEAEs  were  hypoglycaemia,  headache, injection site reaction, otitis media, myalgia, tonsillar hypertrophy and injection site hypertrophy. The serious  targeted  TEAEs  comprised  tonsillar  hypertrophy,  hypoglycaemia,  otitis  media,  increased intracranial pressure, headache and papilloedema. Increlex was generally well tolerated, with only 40 (3.0%) patients having to stop treatment due to AEs.

A total of 83 serious TEAEs were experienced by 46 patients during treatment with Increlex. These led to treatment interruption in 21 patients and treatment withdrawal in 10 patients. Of the serious TEAEs, 39 were recorded as being related to Increlex treatment. More than half (59.0%) of the serious TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and most resolved. In addition, five SAEs were reported during the post-treatment period.

Overall,  179  (13.4%)  patients  experienced  a  total  of  396  significant  nonserious  TEAEs.  The  most common significant nonserious TEAEs included arthralgia, snoring, pharyngitis streptococcal, pain in extremity, dizziness, abnormal hair texture and scoliosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two  deaths  occurred  during  the  study;  one  (sudden,  unexplained  death)  was  recorded  as  being possibly related to study treatment.

The overall AE profile observed in this population is consistent with the known safety profile of Increlex and  the  known  pharmacology  of  the  drug.  No  new  safety  signals  or  changes  in  Risk  Benefit  were identified after review of the safety data

## Rapporteur's discussion on clinical aspects

Increlex was granted the marketing authorisation under Exceptional Circumstances on 3 August 2007 for the long-term treatment of growth failure in children and adolescents with severe primary insulinlike  growth  factor-1  deficiency  (Primary  IGFD).  At  the  time  of  the  granting  of  the  initial  marketing authorisation,  it  was  not  possible  for  the  MAH  to  provide  complete  information  on  this  medicinal product. Several post-authorisation commitments were agreed with the CHMP for data to be provided as Specific Obligations (SOs) and Post-Authorisation measures.

In order to get more safety and efficacy data SO 002 was established:

The MAH should perform one long-term safety study where mecasermin treatment is initiated in early phase of childhood and continued to adulthood in order to investigate:

- long-term toxicity in patients undergoing developmental changes
- to evaluate possible occurrence of malignancies as well as other risks

At that stage, the US-IGFD Registry was already initiated (May 2006) to monitor the long term safety and efficacy of children with growth failure treated with Increlex in the US.

To  fulfil  this  SO  and  in  order  fulfil  the  regulatory  requirements  in  EU  the  MAH  established  an  EU registry (EU-IGFD) in 2007.

During the 6 th  annual re-assessment (2013) the MAH stated that there were no patients, neither in the EU nor in the US registry, who meet all of the previous inclusion criteria.

At the same time MAH proposed several amendments to the original SO 002 which were agreed with CHMP:

- Obligation  redefined  to  end  when  100  patients  with  at  least  3  years'  instead  of  5  years' exposure  to Increlex have  been  followed-up  for 5 years since completing  treatment, irrespective of final height
- Long-term follow up of patients completing Increlex treatment in EU-IGFD only.

In addition, during the 6 th  annual re-assessment the MAH informed EMA the decision to close the US Registry  (20  MAY  2014).  Partly  due  to  this  the  finalisation  of  this  SO  is  estimated  by  2023  at  the earliest.

The MAH has now submitted the results from the closed US-IGFD Registry.

Due to the low number of patients meeting the key inclusion criteria relevant to provide meaningful efficacy  results  these  data  were  not  analysed  and  only  baseline  and  safety  data  are  presented. However, in 71.7% of the patie nts  the  primary diagnosis  was primary IGF-1 deficiency. The MAH is asked to clarify the number of these 987 subjects who fulfilled the EU indication for Increlex and the possibility to get efficacy data derived from this population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding safety, no new safety concerns were found.

371 (27.7%) subjects in the safety follow up population experienced a total of 1256 TEAEs, of which 83  (experienced  by  46  (3.4%)  subjects)  were  serious  TEAEs.  The  TEAEs  in  the  safety  follow  up population are in line with the known safety profile of Increlex: hypoglycaemia was the most frequently reported  TEAE  (9.3%)  and  the  other  most  frequent  TEAEs  included  headache  (6.7%)  injection  site reaction  (1.9%),  otitis  media  (1.6%),  myalgia  (1.5%)  subjects),  tonsillar  hypertrophy  (1.3%)  and injection  site  hypertrophy  (1.2%).  These  AEs  are  all  also  targeted  AEs  associated  with  the  use  of Increlex and mentioned in the Increlex-SPC.

The  related  serious  TEAEs  included  six  cases  of  benign  intracranial  hypertension,  four  cases  of adenoidal hypertrophy, four cases of constipation, two cases of spinal column stenosis, two cases of convulsion.  These  serious  TEAEs  are  also  associated  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  Increlex  and mentioned in the Increlex-SPC (all expect constipation, however this AE is considered to be covered with AE 'abdominal pain') .

Two  deaths  were  recorded  during  the  study,  both  during  follow  up.  The  first  subject  experienced sudden unexpected death, recorded as possibly related to study drug. It seems that autopsy has been performed but the outcome of it has not been reported by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  is  asked  to  provide further clarification of the reason behind this death since at the moment it is not possible to exclude whether this death is related to use of the study drug or not. The other death was due to progression of sickle cell disease and thus unrelated to study drug.

In general, there were no new, unexpected TEAEs.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  MAH  has  submitted  the  current  MS305  study  to  EMA  in  accordance  with  the  Article  46  of  the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. The study was carried out as a stand-alone study and provided  long-term  safety  information  from  the  US-IGFD-registry.  Unfortunately,  long-term  efficacy data were not analysed and therefore not presented for evaluation. Since this US-IGFD-registry has been closed the data presented is the final data from this registry.

Children were treated with Increlex prescribed by a qualified physician according to the individual need of a patient.

The safety profile of Increlex in this study is in line with previous experience with Increlex and in line with Increlex SPC.

This study does not have any impact on the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in its current approved EUindication. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of Increlex remains positive.

## Recommendation

- [ ] Fulfilled:

- [x] Not fulfilled:

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications related both efficacy and safety  aspects  of  the  study  305  as  part  of  this  procedure.  (see  section  IV  'Additional  clarifications requested')

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional clarifications requested

1. Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide meaningful efficacy results  these  closure,  efficacy  data  were  not  analysed  and  only  baseline and safety data are presented. However, in 71.7% of the patients the primary diagnosis was primary IGF-1 deficiency. The MAH is asked to clarify the number of these 987 subjects who fulfilled the EU indication for Increlex and the possibility to get efficacy data derived from this population.
2. Two  deaths  were  recorded  during  the  study,  both  during  follow  up.  The  first  subject experienced sudden unexpected death, recorded as possibly related to study drug. It seems that autopsy has been performed but the outcome of it has not been reported by the MAH. The MAH  is  asked  to  provide  further  clarification  of  the  reason  behind  this  death  since  at  the moment it is not possible to exclude whether this death is related to use of the study drug or not.

## MAH`s reply to the additional clarifications:

## Question 1 - Summary of the MAH's response

Efficacy  analysis  in  patients  enrolled  in  study  W-TG-52800-010/MS305  was  not  provided  primarily because  of  the  low  number  of  patients  meeting  the  key  inclusion  criteria  relevant  to  provide meaningful efficacy data. The low number of patients was related to 2 main factors: the first one is related to problems with the informed consent procedure and the second one is related to the very small number of subjects treated in accordance with the US labelled indication*. It should be noted that the US labelled indication is more restricted but very similar to the EU label**. In the EU label, the threshold of IGF-1 is -2SDS (equivalent to 2.5 percentile) instead of -3SDS for US label.

In  study  W-TG-52800-010/MS305,  987  patients  have  been  enrolled  with  the  primary  diagnostic  of primary IGF-1 deficiency.

As  requested  in  the  Rapporteur's  Preliminary  Assessment  Report  (PAR),  the  MAH  has  clarified  the status  of  these  987  patients  by  selecting  patients  potentially  eligible  for  efficacy  analysis  with  the following criteria: patients who fulfilled the EU indication for Increlex and had signed off the informed consent.  To  be  in  line  with  the  efficacy  results  of  EU-IGF  registry  (study  2-79-52800-002),  the subgroup of naïve pre-pubertal patients was also selected among the 987 patients. This subgroup is of particular interest for efficacy to have unbiased efficacy data (assessment of height could be biased on patients who started puberty and who were previously treated for short stature).

The results of the research were as follows:

-  Over  987  patients,  only  70  patients  responded  to  selection  criteria  at  baseline  (patients fulfilling  the  EU  indication for Increlex and  with a signed off informed consent), including 39 patients naïve pre pubertal. At one and two year, the number of evaluable patients were 56 and 38 patients respectively (33 and 22 for naïve pre-pubertal) as shown in table below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>



| Follow-up   |   Overall (N=70) |   Naive pre-pubertal (N=39) |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Baseline    |               70 |                          39 |
| 6 months    |               54 |                          30 |
| 12 months   |               56 |                          33 |
| 18 months   |               50 |                          28 |
| 24 months   |               38 |                          22 |
| 30 months   |               31 |                          18 |
| 36 months   |               24 |                          13 |
| 42 months   |               18 |                          10 |
| 48 months   |               14 |                           7 |

-  Among the 917 patients non eligible for efficacy analysis,
- o 451 (49%) had not signed the informed consent,
- o 895 (98%) did not fullfill EU Increlex Label:
-  Some of them presented only primary IGF1 deficiency and not severe primary IGFD (with height ≤ -3SDS and IGF1 &lt; 2,5 percentile): 576 patients were not compliant with height SDS (&lt;-3 SDS, n=521) and/or with IGF-1 SDS (&lt;-2 SDS,n=275). Only few patients (41) had GH deficiency.
- For some other patients the data to classify the patients were missing: 319 patients have at least one missing data (mainly missing data on GH stimulation test to identify GH sufficiency). The efficacy analysis in the EU IGF-1 registry (last report submitted in November 2013) was performed  in  a  patient  sample  of  172  subjects  (registry  population)  including  96  naïve  pre pubertal  patients.  Efficacy  data  at  year  1  and  2  were  presented  for  138  and  88  patients respectively (62 and 36 naive prepubertal).

Taking  into  account  the  number  of  patients  in  the  analysis  previously  performed  in  the  EU  IGF-1 registry overall (172, 138, 88) and in naïve pre-pubertal patients (96, 62, 36), the MAH estimates that the sample size of patients eligible for efficacy analysis in study W-TG-52800-010/MS305 overall (70, 56,  38)  and  in  naïve  pre  pubertal  (39,  33,  22)  is  too  small  to  provide  relevant  effectiveness conclusions.

*: US Increlex indication: long-term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary IGF-I deficiency, defined as height and IGF-I SDS ≤ - 3, with normal/elevated GH or with GH gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH

**: EU Increlex indication: severe primary IGF-I deficiency, defined as a height SDS ≤ -3 and basal IGF-I concentrations &lt; 2.5th percentile, with GH sufficiency and exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-I deficiency

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The  MAH  has  provided  the  efficacy  analysis  in  patients  enrolled  in  study  MS305.  Only  70  patients responded to selection criteria at baseline (patients fulfilling the EU indication for Increlex and with a signed off informed consent), including 39 patients naïve pre pubertal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main reason for such a low number of patients (70/987) that fulfilled the selection criteria is the fact  that  patients  who  did  not  have  signed  informed  consent  were  excluded.  This  is  still  considered unfortunate.  Therefore  the  'real'  number  of  patients  who  fulfilled  the  selection  criteria  remains unclear. The MAH has previously stated that it is not possible to get missing informed consents any longer afterwards. If this  is the case, it is  not possible to draw any meaningful efficacy conclusions from this US-registry-study.

The  MAH  concludes  that  the  sample  size  of  patients  eligible  for  efficacy  analysis  in  study  /MS305 overall  (70,  56,  38)  and  in  naïve  pre  pubertal  (39,  33,  22)  is  too  small  to  provide  relevant effectiveness  conclusions.  Because  of  the  above  mentioned  reasons  this  reasoning  is  acceptable, although with some hesitance and caution.

## Conclusion

Point is solved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 2 - Summary of the MAH's response

A complete case narrative for subject 1219-1162 is provided in Section 14 of the Clinical Study Report (pages 384 - 386). The narrative is provided below, with additional information obtained from review of the subject line listings and final amended autopsy report. In addition, the dosing regime has been tabulated for clarity.

The final amended autopsy report states the immediate cause of death as 'Sudden unexpected death', with other significant conditions 'IGF-1 deficiency and  complications'. No  specific anatomical, microscopic or toxicological abnormalities sufficient to explain death were found at autopsy.

## SUBJECT US 1219-1162: Spinal column stenosis, Sudden death

This 20 year old male subject with PIGFD was enrolled in the US-IGFD Registry on 10 Oct 2006, at age 15 years old. The patient's birth weight was 4.08 kg, and birth length was 44.5 cm. Baseline height was 106.1 cm, with SDS -6.34; baseline BMI was 17.14, with SDS -1.23. Genetic testing confirmed Laron dwarfism.

The  subject's  medical  history  included  a  familial  risk  factor  of  Laron  syndrome,  insulin  dependent diabetes  and  hypoglycaemic  episodes.  The  subject  was  not  taking  any  concomitant  medications  at enrolment, but was taking 'agents to block puberty' at the follow-up visits (12 Jan 2007 through 30 Mar 2011).

On  01  Nov  2006,  the  subject  started  treatment  with  Increlex  at  a  dose  of  120  mcg/kg  BID administered via a subcutaneous route, for the indication of severe IGF-1 deficiency associated with Laron syndrome.

The following dosing regimen was received by the subject:

| Dosing Dates               | Increlex Dose received                                                                   |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 20 Mar 2007 to 04 Jun 2007 | 121 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 05 Jun 2007 to 30 Aug 2007 | 123 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 31 Aug 2007                | Dose reduced to 120 mcg/kg BID due to weight changes                                     |
| 29 Nov 2007 to 25 Feb 2008 | 150 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 26 Feb 2008 to 26 May 2008 | 180 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 27 May 2008                | Dose was reduced to 165 mcg/kg, BID due to lab results and 'comfort' with the dose level |
| 05 Sep 2008 to 09 Mar 2009 | 168 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 10 Mar 2009 to 25 May 2009 | 183 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 26 May 2009                | Dose was reduced to 173 mcg/kg, BID due to 'comfort' with the dose level.                |
| 25 Aug 2009 to 26 Apr 2010 | 185 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 27 Apr 2010                | Dose was reduced to 170 mcg/kg BID due to weight changes                                 |
| 12 Oct 2010                | Dose was reduced to 167 mcg/kg BID due to weight changes                                 |
| 04 Jan 2011 to 19 Sep 2011 | 181 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |
| 20 Sep 2011 to 16 Jan 2012 | 206 mcg/kg, BID                                                                          |

On 12 Jan 2007 and 20 Mar 2007, the patient experienced non-serious adverse events hypoglycaemia and headache (both events on each date).

On 05 Jun 2007, the patient experienced non-serious adverse event hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On 12 Oct 2010, the patient experienced non-serious adverse event injection site reaction.

On  20  Sep  2011,  the  patient  experienced  non-serious  adverse  events  headache  and  injection  site reaction.

On 28 Nov 2011, the  subject  underwent  a  tonsillectomy  due  to  airway  obstruction  associated  with snoring. Following surgery the subject was required to use a positive pressure mask. It was reported that the subject skipped two doses of Increlex as he was not eating. The reporter assessed this as possibly related to Increlex as lymphoid hyperplasia has been reported with Increlex use.

On 17 Jan 2012, the Increlex dose was increased to 218 mcg/kg BID. From 08 Mar 2012 to 13 Jun 2012, the subject received 11 mg Increlex BID.

On 08 Mar 2012, the patient experienced non-serious adverse event headache.

On 14 Jun 2012, the subject developed hypoglycaemia after injecting himself at 7 am without eating a full breakfast. The subject became confused and had a headache. The subject received treatment with intravenous glucose in response to the event. Following treatment, the subject went home and rested and the symptoms resolved.

On 14 Jun 2012, the dose of Increlex was increased to 12 mg, BID.

On 09 Jul 2012, the subject underwent a lumbar MRI and was diagnosed with asymptomatic spinal stenosis.  The  physician  did  not  provide  any  cause  of  spinal  stenosis.  However,  stated  that  spinal stenosis has been reported in subjects with Laron syndrome. No corrective treatment was reported.

On 02 Aug 2012, the subject took his latest dose of Increlex at 9 pm and it was reported that he ate a normal meal, but later than the usual time. On 03 Aug 2012, at 5:30 am, the subject's room mate found the subject unresponsive and purple. The paramedics and police were called and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, however, the subject could not be revived.

The  autopsy  examination  was  inconclusive  in  regards  to  the  immediate  cause  of  death.  The  post mortem vitreous glucose level was noted to be 10 mg/dL. The subject's underlying history of IGF-1 deficiency  and  any  associated  complications  may  have  contributed  as  well  to  the  fatal  outcome.  No evidence of injury, intoxication, infection or other pathological process was found. The final amended autopsy  report  states  the  immediate  cause  of  death  as  'Sudden  unexpected  death',  with  other significant  conditions  'IGF-1  deficiency  and  complications'.  No  specific  anatomical,  microscopic  or toxicological abnormalities sufficient to explain death were found at autopsy.

The reporting physician considered the event 'sudden unexpected death' as severe.

The reporting physician considered the events spinal stenosis, hypoglycaemia and airways obstruction associated with snoring to be related and the event sudden unexpected death to be possibly related to Increlex.

The events of sudden unexpected death, airway obstruction associated with snoring and hypoglycaemia were assessed by Ipsen as related to therapy with Increlex. The company commented that the autopsy examination was inconclusive with regards to the immediate cause of death. The post mortem vitreous glucose level was noted to be 10 mg/dL. The subject's underlying history of IGF-1 deficiency and associated complications  may have contributed to the fatal outcome. Since hypoglycaemia is listed, a causal relationship could not be absolutely excluded. Snoring with associated airway  obstruction  is  listed.  The  event  of  spinal  stenosis  was  assessed  by  Ipsen  as  not  related  to therapy with Increlex. The company commented that this condition is seen in people suffering from Laron syndrome.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has provided final amended autopsy report as requested by the CHMP. In addition, the MAH has also provided updated case narrative for subject 1219-1162.

The  MAH  concludes  that  the  autopsy  examination  was  inconclusive  with  regards  to  the  immediate cause  of  death  and  since  hypoglycaemia  is  listed,  a  causal  relationship  could  not  be  absolutely excluded.

MAH`s  reasoning  is  acceptable.  Although  sudden  unexpected  death  is  always  considered  severe serious  event,  the  inconclusive  result  of  the  autopsy  does  not  confirm  nor  exclude  the  possible relationship of this death to use of the study drug.

## Conclusion

Point is solved.

## Rapporteur's updated overall conclusion

This study has no impact on the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in its current approved EU-indication. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of Increlex remains positive.
