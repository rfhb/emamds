In  the  European  Union  there are two  centrally authorised  products containing  strontium  ranelate: Protelos and Osseor, both authorised  on  21/09/2004. Data  submitted  as  part  of  the  routine  benefit-risk  assessment  within  a periodic  safety  update report (PSUR), covering the  period from  22 September 2011 to 21 September 2012, raised concern regarding  cardiovascular safety  beyond  the already  recognised  risk for venous thromboembolism. As a  result of  this assessment, an  increased  risk for serious  cardiac disorders, including  myocardial infarction has  now been identified  and risk minimisation measures  specifically targeting the identified  risk  were  recommended  by  the CHMP. The  risk  minimisation  measures include  reducing the  target  population by  excluding  patients  with high risk  for  ischemic  cardiac  disorders,  and restricting  the indication  to  patients with  severe osteoporosis,  who are  most  likely  to  benefit from the treatment. In  view of  this newly  identified  risk of  serious cardiac disorders  including  myocardial  infarction  and the  already  recognised  safety  concerns  such  as  serious  skin  disorders  and  venous  thrombotic events (VTE),  concerns have been raised over the overall  balance of  benefits and  risks of  medicinal products  containing  strontium ranelate,  and  their  place  in  therapy.  The  CHMP  recommended further  wide-ranging  evaluation  of  the  benefits  and  risks  of  Protelos  and  Osseor.  It  is  considered important to allow  available data  on safety and  efficacy,  including  upcoming  analysis and  possibly expert advice, to  be taken  into account due to overarching  concerns of  a  potential impact on  public health. Therefore, the  European Commission  (EC)  initiates a  procedure under Article  20 of  Regulation  (EC) No  726/2004  and  requests  the  Agency  to  assess  the  above  concerns  and  their  impact  on  the benefit  risk  balance  for  the  centrally  authorised  medicinal  products  Protelos  and  Osseor.  The  EC requests the Agency to give  its opinion  on  whether the  marketing authorisation for these  products should  be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn  including  whether provisional  measures are necessary.  As  the  request  results from  the  evaluation  of  data  resulting  from  pharmacovigilance activities, the opinion  should  be adopted  by  the Committee  for  Medicinal  Products for  Human  Use on the basis of  a  recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, following the procedure laid  down in Article 31 of  Directive 2001/83/EC.
