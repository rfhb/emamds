1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0037             | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include information on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) reduction to undetectable levels, based on results from the TITAN (56021927PCR3002) and SPARTAN (ARN-509-003) studies. TITAN is a Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of Apalutamide Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) versus ADT in subjects with Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC). SPARTAN is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ARN-509 in Men With Non-Metastatic (M0) Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement a minor QRD change to the Labelling.

In TITAN, 68% of patients receiving apalutamide in combination with ADT reduced PSA to undetectable levels at any time, compared to 32% taking ADT alone. In SPARTAN, 38% of patients receiving apalutamide in combination with ADT reduced PSA to undetectable levels at any time, compared to 0% taking ADT alone.

Neoplastic findings were noted including an increased incidence of testicular Leydig cell adenoma and carcinoma at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/kg/day, mammary adenocarcinoma and fibroadenoma at 15 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day, and thyroid follicular cell adenoma at 50 mg/kg/day. These findings were considered rat specific and therefore of limited relevance to humans. |

Results from this updated analysis were consistent with those from the pre specified interim analysis. The improvement in OS was demonstrated even though 39% of patients in the placebo arm crossed over to receive Erleada, with a median treatment of 15 months on Erleada crossover. Consistent improvement in OS was observed across patient subgroups including high- or low-volume disease, metastasis stage at diagnosis (M0 or M1), and Gleason score at diagnosis (≤7 vs. >7). |

| II/0013               | Update of sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order to update information on pregnancy and update non- clinical information following results of a developmental toxicity study in rats. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 10/06/2021   | 09/12/2021 | SmPC | Erleada is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant (see section 4.3). Based on an animal reproductive study and its mechanism of action, Erleada may cause foetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered during pregnancy to a pregnant woman. There are no data available from the use of Erleada in pregnant women. Apalutamide caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-20) in a preliminary embryofetal developmental toxicity study in rats. These doses resulted in systemic exposures approximately 2, 4 and 6 times, respectively the exposure in humans at the dose of 240 mg/day. Findings included non-pregnant females at 100 mg/kg/day and embryofetal lethality (resorptions) at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day, decreased fetal anogenital distance and a misshapen pituitary gland (more rounded shape) at ≥25 mg/kg/day. Skeletal variations (unossified phalanges, supernumerary short thoracolumbar rib(s) and/or abnormalities of the hyoid) were also noted at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day, without resulting in an effect on mean fetal weight. |

The median OS was 73.9 months for the Erleada arm and 59.9 months for the placebo arm. The pre- specified alpha boundary (p ≤ 0.046) was crossed and statistical significance was achieved. This improvement was demonstrated even though 19% of patients in the placebo arm received Erleada as subsequent therapy. Ischaemic cerebrovascular disorders and alopecia have been added to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency common. The existing warning on ischaemic heart disease has been amended to include information about ischaemic cerebrovascular disorders. Patients should |
