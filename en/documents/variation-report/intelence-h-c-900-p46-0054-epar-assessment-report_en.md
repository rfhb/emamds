## 1. Introduction

The  Clinical  Overview  of  this  Article  46  submission  summarizes  the  long-term  safety  results  for etravirine  (ETR)  in  Study  TMC125-TiDP35-C239,  a  roll-over  study  from  previous  studies  (TMC125C206,  TMC125-C216,  TMC125-C217,  TMC125-C213  and  TMC125-C234).  The  main  objective  of  this study TMC125-TiDP35-C239 was to continue the provision of ETR for adult and paediatric subjects who previously received ETR in a clinical study in countries where ETR was not available.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Study TMC125-TiDP35-C239 is not part of a Paediatric Investigation Plan.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Three tablet formulations are registered in EU, which can be either swallowed whole or dispersed:

- A scored 25-mg tablet (F066).
- A 100-mg tablet (F060).
- A 200-mg tablet (F068).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

In  the  European  Union  (EU),  INTELENCE,  in  combination  with  a boosted  protease  inhibitor  (PI)  and other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adult patients and in  antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)-experienced  paediatric  patients  beginning  at  2  years  of  age.  The recommended d ose of ETR for paediatric patients aged ≥2 years to &lt;18 years and weighing ≥10 kg is based on body weight:

| Body Weight   | Dose               | Tablets                                                                                            |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ≥10 to <20 kg | 100 mg twice daily | Four 25 mg tablets twice daily or one 100 mg tablet twice daily                                    |
| ≥20 to <25 kg | 125 mg twice daily | Five 25 mg tablets twice daily or one 100 mg tablet and one 25 mg tablet twice daily               |
| ≥25 to <30 kg | 150 mg twice daily | Six 25 mg tablets twice daily or one 100 mg tablet and two 25 mg tablets twice daily               |
| ≥30 kg        | 200 mg twice daily | Eight 25 mg tablets twice daily or two 100 mg tablets twice daily or one 200 mg tablet twice daily |

The recommended oral dosage of ETR for adult patients is 200 mg (one 200 mg tablet or two 100 mg tablets) taken twice daily following a meal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study TMC125-TiDP35-C239

## Methods

## Objectives

The main objective of this study was to continue the provision of ETR for adult and paediatric subjects who previously received ETR in a clinical study sponsored by JRD, and who continued to benefit from the use of ETR, in countries where ETR was not commercially available for the subject's indication, was not  reimbursed,  and  could  not  be  accessed  through  another  source  (e.g.  access  program  or government program), or where the subject was not eligible for ongoing studies/programs with ETR.

## Study design

This  is  a  roll-over  study  from  previous  studies  (TMC125-C206,  TMC125-C216  [in  adults],  TMC125C217, TMC125C213 [in subjects aged 6 to &lt;18 years], and subsequently TMC125 -C234 [in subjects aged ≥2 to ≤6 ye ars]) which started in December 2009 and collected long-term safety information on ETR. No efficacy data were collected.

At the Baseline visit, subjects were either continued on the ETR dose they had received in the previous ETR study, or on an adjusted dose if deemed necessary by the investigator. For paediatric subjects, ETR dose adjustment was based on weight, in accordance to the recommended paediatric doses (see table above). Assessment visits were recommended according to local generally accepted standard of care, but not less frequent than every 3 and 6 months for paediatric and adult subjects, respectively.

Treatment will be continued until one of the following criteria are met: the investigator determines that the  subject  no  longer  benefits  from  ETR  treatment  (e.g.  based  on  viral  load);  treatment  limiting toxicity; lost to follow-up; subject withdrawal of consent; pregnancy; termination of the program by the Sponsor; ETR becomes commercially available for the subject's indication, is reimbursed, or can be accessed through another source (e.g. access program, government program) in the region the subject is living in, whichever occurs first.

This  final  CSR  contains  data  collected  up  to  the  implementation  of  amendment  CTPA-GEN-III  (eg, subjects leaving CTPA-GEN-II and entering CTPA-GEN-III). The purpose of this amendment CTPA-GENIII  was  to  simplify  the  follow  up  of  participants  and  to  incorporate  the  following  changes:  Subjects aged  2  years  and  older  were  allowed  to  roll-over  from  previous  Study  TMC125-C234;  and  dosing instructions were added to provide weight-based dosing for paediatric subjects. Therefore, the study is still ongoing under protocol amendment CTPA-GEN-III, but no data are being collected at present.

## Study population/Sample size

Subjects (adults and children ≥2 years old) who completed treatment in a clinical study with ETR, and continued to benefit from the use of ETR, were eligible to continue ETR through this study. There was no targeted study sample size.

## Treatments

Study treatment is defined as ETR 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. ETR will be dosed orally according to the dosing table:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Weight       | Dose       | Tablets                                                     |
|--------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10 to <20 kg | 100 mg bid | 4 tablets 25mg bid.or 1 tablet 100 mg bid.                  |
| 20 to <25kg  | 125 mg bid | 5 tablets 25 mg bid. or 1 tablet 100 mg +1 tablet 25 mg bid |
| 25 to <30 kg | 150 mg bid | 6 tablets 25 mg bid or 1 tablet100 mg + 2 tablets 25 mg bid |
| ≥30 kg       | 200 mg bid | 8 tablets 25 mg bid or 2 tablets 100 mgbid                  |

Adult subjects received a dose of ETR 200 mg BID.

## Outcomes/endpoints

There were no primary and secondary endpoints.

Safety and toxicity monitoring were performed throughout the study as per local standard of care. Safety was evaluated based on:

- Adverse events/HIV-related events summarized in terms of:

- Mortality
- All SAEs
- AEs leading to discontinuation
- AEs possible related to ETR
- Urine pregnancy test

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 180 subjects were enrolled in this study (71 paediatric subjects and 109 adult subjects). All subjects  were  discontinued  from  study  (excepted  one  paediatric  subject  who  did  not  complete  the study due to unknown reasons) mainly for switch to commercially available medication, withdrawal of consent  and  lost  to  follow-up.  One  third  of  patients  have  switch  to  CTPA-GEN-III  amendment  and therefore  have  continued  ETR  treatment  within  this  study.  Of  note,  data  from  CTPA-GEN-III amendment are not available.

Antiretrovirals in the initial OBR included PIs, NRTIs, NNRTIs, and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir. The most frequently used PIs were ritonavir (1 69 subjects [93.9%]), lopinavir (103 subjects [57.2%]), and darunavir (40 subjects [22.2%]). The most frequently used NRTIs were tenofovir (81 subjects [45%]), lamivudine (45 subjects [25%]), and zidovudine (38 subjects [21.1%]). Integrase inhibitor raltegravir  and  NNRTI  efavirenz  were  only  used  by  6  subjects  (3.3%)  and  4  subjects  (2.2%), respectively.  Most  subjects  were  treated  with  a  PI  combination  (lopinavir  +  ritonavir,  31  subjects [17.2%]),  or  with  PI  and  NRTI  combinations  (lopinavir  +  ritonavir  +  tenofovir,  27  subjects  [15%]; lopinavir + ritonavir + stavudine, 10 subjects [5.6%]). Other combinations were used in &lt;4% of the subject population.

## Common Adverse Events

The most common AEs were reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations (19 [10.6%]), of which, the majority were reported in paediatric subjects (13 [18.3%]) and 6 (5.5%) were reported in adults. Upper respiratory tract infections (5 subjects [2.8%]) and tonsillitis (4 subjects [2.2%]) were the most commonly reported infections.

Adverse events in the SOC of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were the second most commonly reported (9 subjects [5%]); reports were evenly distributed among paediatric (4 subjects [5.6%]) and adult (5 [4.6%]) subjects. Preferred term Rash was the most commonly reported AE (4 subjects [2.2%]), with all reports occurring in adult subjects.

## Drug-related Adverse Events

Out of 180 subjects, 5 subjects (2.8%) reported AEs that were at least possibly related to ETR:

A 17-year-old male subject experienced lipase increased of grade 2 severity on Day 249, considered as possibly  related  to  ETR.  No  adjustment  in  dose  or  ETR  discontinuation  have  been  done.  The  AE resolved after 113 days.

A 34-year-old female patient experienced hepatic enzyme increased of grade 3 severity on Day 506, considered as possibly related to ETR. ETR was permanently discontinued. The AE recovered after 21 days.

A 34-year-old female patient experienced rash of grade 1 severity on Day 86 assessed as possibly related to ETR. The dose of ETR was not changed and the AE resolved.

A 41-year-old female experienced neuropathy peripheral on Day 1048 of grade 1 severity considered as possibly related to ETR. The AE resolved. The dose was not changed.

A 66-year-old male patient was reported with lipoatrophy of grade 2 severity on Day 534 considered as probably related to ETR. The dose of ETR was not changed and the outcome was not resolved.

## Adverse Events Leading to Drug Discontinuation

Overall, 12 (6.7%) out of 180 subjects reported at least 1 AE that lead to drug discontinuation, the majority  of  events  were  reported  in  adult  subjects  (n=11).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to discontinuation  of  study  medication  were  reported  in  the  SOC  Pregnancy,  puerperium  and  perinatal conditions, PT Pregnancy, with 1 case (1.4%) reported in a paediatric subject, and 3 (2.8%) reported in  adults.  The  other  PTs  reported  were  :  death  (2  subjects),  myocardial  infarction,  disseminated tuberculosis, sepsis, brain herniation, hepatic enzyme increased, acute kidney injury, rash, hyponatremia,  hypovolemia,  CNS  metastases,  lymph  nodes  metastases  and  depression  (1  subject each).

## Deaths and Serious Adverse Events

There  were  6  deaths  reported  in  this  study.  There  have  been  one  accidental  death,  one  sudden unexplained death (a 63-year-old female with history of HTA, cardiac failure, asthma, diabetes found in her bed in the morning), one death secondary to epithelial carcinoma with cerebral metastases, one patient with depression committed suicide (patient with history of chronic depression, panic attack and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

insomnia), one death was attributed to myocardial infarction and the last one was attributed to acute kidney  injury,  sepsis,  hyponatremia  and  disseminated  tuberculosis.  None  of  these  fatal  cases  were considered as related to ETR.

A total of 18 subjects (10%) reported at least one SAE with the majority reported in adults 13 (11.9%) and 5 (7%) reported in the paediatric population:

## Other Safety Observations

A progressive and gradual increase in mean weight from 40.86 kg at baseline to 67.90 kg at Month 105 was observed in paediatric subjects. Such an increase, however, is confounded by the normal gain in body weight in paediatric participants due to normal growth. The mean change in weight for adult participants was from 70.70 kg at baseline to 77.63 kg at Month 84.

Overall, the MAH considers that the safety data collected in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of etravirine.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  main  objective  of  this  observational  study  was  to  continue  the  provision  of  ETR  for  adult  and paediatric subjects who previously received ETR in a clinical study. No efficacy data were recorded, no formal  safety  monitoring  was  imposed,  but  safety  data  have  been  collected  among  180  patients receiving ETR among other antiretroviral drugs throughout the reporting of AEs by the investigators. The final report shows that the study TMC125-TiDP35-C239 included 71 paediatric subjects with age ranking from 4 to 17 years and 109 adult subjects. Most subjects included in this study have been treated as recommended with ETR coadministered with a boosted PI (94%) and another ARV (≈80%, mainly a NRTI).

The most common reason for ETR discontinuation in this study has been the switch to another protocol for  the  study  (around  one  third),  the  switch  to  commercially  available  medication  (13.9%)  and  the withdrawal of consent (24%). Only 12 subjects discontinued due to AE/HIV-related events (11 adults and  1  child).  The  most  frequent  AE  leading  to  ETR  discontinuation  has  been  the  occurrence  of pregnancy (4 cases). The 5 AEs considered as related to ETR are already listed in the ETR SmPC as common (lipase increase, peripheral neuropathy, hepatic enzyme increase) or very common (rash). All but one resolved and the recovery was reported despite ETR continuation in 3 out 4 cases and after ETR discontinuation in one case. The AESI reported are mostly skin AEs (rash). The other AESI have been reported only once and in adult subjects.

Of note, there was no SAE considered related to ETR. The 6 fatal cases have been considered as not related to ETR and this is endorsed following the review of the cases.

Regarding data provided on weight, an increase in mean weight has been observed in paediatric subjects and adults. However, as highlighted by the MAH, the analysis is confounded by the normal growth of paediatric subjects and the increasing limited number of subjects with weight data available visits after visit. At month 105, weight is available only for 1 subject. Therefore, it is considered that no conclusion can be drawn from these data on the weight increase.

In conclusion, the MAH's conclusion stating that the safety data collected during this study are consistent with the known safety profile of ETR and that no new safety signal has been highlighted notably in paediatric patients can be endorsed.
