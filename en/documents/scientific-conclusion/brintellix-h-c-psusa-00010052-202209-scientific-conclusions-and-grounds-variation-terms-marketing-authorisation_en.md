## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vortioxetine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on dyspepsia from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close temporal relationship, 43 cases reporting a positive de-challenge and 1 case reporting a positive re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and dyspepsia is at least a reasonable possibility.

In view of available data on movement disorders (akathisia , bruxism , dystonia, including Meige syndrome, trismus , restless leg syndrome , tremor) from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge (akathisia: n=18, bruxism: n=18, trismus: n=7, restless leg syndrome: n= 26, tremor: n=93) and re-challenge (1 case for bruxism,  trismus  and  tremor),  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  vortioxetine  and movement disorders is at least a reasonable possibility.

In view of available data on sexual dysfunction from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close temporal relationship, 79 cases reporting a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and sexual dysfunction is at least a reasonable possibility.

In view of available data on withdrawal reactions from the literature and spontaneous reports, including several  cases  reported  in  the  current  PSUR  period  with  a  plausible  time  to  onset,  some  cases  where symptoms resolved after resuming treatment with vortioxetine (positive 'de-challenge') and 2 cases where consecutive treatment interruptions caused withdrawal reactions (positive 're-challenge'), and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and withdrawal reactions is at least a reasonable possibility.

In view of available data on vision blurred from spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close temporal  relationship,  46  cases  reporting  a  positive  de-challenge  and  1  case  reporting  a  positive  rechallenge,  and  in  view  of  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur  considers  a  causal relationship between vortioxetine and vision blurred is at least a reasonable possibility.

In view of available data on galactorrhoea from spontaneous reports, including in several cases a close temporal relationship, and 3 cases reporting a positive de-challenge from the current PSUR period, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and galactorrhoea is at least a reasonable possibility.

The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be amended accordingly.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vortioxetine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vortioxetine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
