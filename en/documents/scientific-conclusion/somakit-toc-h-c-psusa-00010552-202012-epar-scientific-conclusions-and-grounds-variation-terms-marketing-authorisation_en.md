## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for edotreotide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on the impact of splenosis and accessory intrapancreatic spleen on PET findings interpretation errors from the literature, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing edotreotide should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for edotreotide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing edotreotide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
