## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dexamethasone (centrally authorised product indicated in symptomatic multiple myeloma), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Following a Members State's request for PRAC advice for another systemic dexamethasone product, the PRAC advised that a warning regarding the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis should be included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the corresponding section of the PL, given that several other nationally authorised corticosteroids,  including  dexamethasone  products,  already  contain  warnings  on  pheochromocytoma crisis.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dexamethasone (centrally authorised product indicated in symptomatic multiple myeloma) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dexamethasone (centrally authorised product indicated in symptomatic multiple myeloma) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
