| II/0017             | Update of section 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to reflect the final results from the drug-drug interaction (DDI) study J2G-MC-JZJV; this is a phase 1, single-center, open-label, DDI study to investigate the effect of selpercatinib on the pharmacokinetic profiles of dabigatran, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, in healthy volunteers. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. | 10/11/2022 | 24/03/2023 | SmPC and PL | The results of study J2G-MC-JZJV have shown a significant increase in Cmax (43%) and AUC0- ∞ (38%) of dabigatran (single dose at D1 and D8) after a single dose of selpercatinib (single dose at D8) in healthy volunteers. Selpercatinib is therefore a mild inhibitor of P-gp and caution should be used when taking a sensitive P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, dabigatran etexilate, colchicine, saxagliptin), and particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin). |
