## Overview

On 27 March 2003 the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for the whole European Union to Pharmacia - Pfizer EEIG for Bextra (valdecoxib).

Bextra (valdecoxib) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with Cox-2 selectivity. In the context of the review of Cox-2 inhibitors, the European Commission issued a decision for suspension of the marketing authorisation of Bextra in October 2005. Bextra has not been marketed in Europe since 2005. The Marketing Authorisation Holder did not apply to renew the marketing authorisation. Consequently, the five-year marketing authorisation for Bextra expired on 27 March 2008.
