## 2.1. Introduction

The applicant did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP. 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP and the evaluation teams were: Rapporteur: Hanne Lomholt Larsen Co-Rapporteur: Bjorg Bolstad 2. Scientific discussion Medicinal product no longer authorised

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia in the western world, with an incidence rate of approximately 4.5 cases per 100.000 in the US in 2012. The median age at presentation is 71 years, and 11% of patients are diagnosed under the age of 55 years. The etiology is uncertain with progressively accumulation of clonal B-cells co-expressing T-cell (CD5+) and B-cell (CD19+, CD23+) cell surface markers, with a low expression of the otherwise typical B-cell marker CD20. The clinical course of CLL is variable and influenced in great part to genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical properties of the tumour cells and clinical features at time of diagnosis. CLL is a chronic disease; some patients have indolent disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and could have a normal life expectancy, whereas others have advanced disease, rapid disease progression and poor outcome. The overall survival (OS) ranges from months to decades.  Although patients with early-stage disease have a life expectancy of more than 10 years, those who progress or have advanced disease (Binet stage B or C, or RAI stage II - IV) have shorter median survival. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss and fatigue are common in advances disease and can significantly  impact  quality  of  life.  CLL  is  non-curative,  with  the  exception  of  allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation, which is only an option for very few patients. Even with newer treatments, CLL is marked by relentless relapses and remissions of decreasing duration and quality.

Advanced  age  and  disease  stage,  more  than  2  prior  therapies,  and  the  presence  of  chromosomal abnormalities such as 17p and 11q deletions mutations in the IGVH gene and over-expression of CD38 and/orZAP70 are associated with decreased duration and quality of response to therapy. Immunosuppression, which increases the risk of infections, is typical in CLL patients; further, the treatment often is complicated by increased susceptibility to infections, which may lead to death in many patients. The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and the CD20-targeted mAb rituximab (FCR) is the most potent commonly used regimen in previously untreated and relapsed patients with CLL. The combination was approved on the basis of a randomized phase III trial which demonstrated a median PFS of 30.6 months for FCR, compared with 20.6 months for FC. More fragile patients with comorbidities might not tolerate the FC regimen, less toxic regimen as bendamustine and rituximab (BR) are therefore commonly used in this clinical setting. A phase II study of BR demonstrated a median event-free survival of 14.7 months, and results from retrospective, observational studies indicate, that BR has a therapeutic value in older, less fit patients with CLL. Which treatment to use for relapsed CLL, is dependent on multiple factors based on a risk based  approach  and  prognostic  factors  such  as  presence  of  17p13  deletion  and/or  tumour  protein  53 mutation, co-morbidity and physical fitness of the patient, duration and type of previous remission and complications to prior treatments. Arzerra (ofatumumab; GSK1841157, OMB157) is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes an epitope of the CD20 molecule expressed on human B cells and B cell tumours that is distinct from the rituximab binding site. It induces cell lysis primarily through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDS) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), especially in low CD20 expressing cells, such as CLL. Based on this, it is suggested that ofatumumab's stronger B-cell depletion potential compared to rituximab may translate into longer duration of treatment response. Ofatumumab has shown activity in patients with previously untreated CLL, as well as refractory disease, both as single agent and as chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Wierda et al 2011). Ofatumumab has a well-established safety profile and was well tolerated in clinical trials, based upon 2.603 haematology patients, including 1.555 patients with CLL (as of December 2014) (GSK Document Number GM2008/00147/10, 2015). Ofatumumab is currently approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for  use  as  monotherapy in patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, and in EU in combination with chlorambucil or bendamustine for patients with CLL who have not received prior therapy and are inappropriate for fludarabine-based therapy (3 July 2014).

The concentrations of ofatumumab in human plasma in both studies were determined by an antibody capture sandwich ELISA that has been previously submitted (original method: GlaxoSmithKline Document Numbers CD2008/00745/00, CD2008/01624/00, and 2012N145316\\_00; and transferred to Alliance Pharma: GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N118243\\_01). Briefly, the method was precise, accurate and reproducible, with a lower limit of quantification of 100 ng/mL and an upper limit of quantification of 1606500 ng/mL. At all validation sample concentrations examined, the run accuracy (expressed by the percent bias) was less than 20% (maximum bias observed was 16.2%), and was therefore acceptable. At all validation sample concentrations examined, the intra- and inter-run precision values (represented by the coefficient of variation) were less than or equal to 20%, and were therefore acceptable. The maximum intraand inter-run precision observed were 3.1% and 14.4% respectively. The method transferred to Alliance met the acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision. The maximum inter-and intra-run accuracy were 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively, which were less than 20% and hence acceptable. The maximum inter- and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intra- run precision were 6.6% and 2.8%, respectively, which were less than 20% and hence acceptable. Ofatumumab was shown to be stable in human plasma for up to 10 freeze-thaw cycles. Longterm stability was established for up to 1743 days at -20ºC (2012N145316\\_00).

The anti-drug antibody assay validated for clinical sample analysis has been previously submitted (original method: GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N118034\\_00 and subsequently transferred to Alliance Pharma: GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N230890\\_00). Briefly, this was a bridging electroluminescence assay with a relative sensitivity of 2.5 ng/mL of affinity-purified anti-ofatumumab rabbit polyclonal positive control. The assay tolerates a drug concentration of at least 200 μg/mL of human serum. All patients with available PK and ADA data in studies OMB913 and OMB991 had at least one ADA sample with a corresponding ofatumumab concentration below 200 μg/mL, allowing conclusive determination of the ADA status. The confirmatory assay involved addition of both ofatumumab and rituximab, hence reducing the false positive signals caused by CD20 bearing cell membrane fragments and confirming the specificity of antibodies that bind to ofatumumab.

Ofatumumab is eliminated through a non-linear target-mediated route as well as a target independent route mediated by non-specific endocytosis followed by intracellular catabolism. Higher numbers of B cells result in greater component of target-mediated elimination clearance and shorter ofatumumab half-life at the start of therapy.

PKPD methods The population PK analysis was performed using the NONMEM software system, NONMEM VII version 3 (ICON, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). All modelling was performed using the first order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) method. The exposure response analysis were performed by numerical or graphical exploration of the data mainly in quartiles of the exposure endpoints as well as Kaplan-Meier. The datasets were prepared using SAS and validated for the analysis. Validated R codes were used to generate the figures for graphical exploration and the tables for exposure quartiles. All figures were generated in R version 3.0.2. Statistical methods ANCOVA was used for exploring the potential interaction between ofatumumab and F-ara-A and C. Absorption Ofatumumab is administered as an iv solution, and the usual considerations of bioavailability and bioequivalence do not apply. The currently marketed acetate-buffered formulation of ofatumumab was used in studies included in the current submission. Therefore, bioavailability and bioequivalence studies to characterize the biopharmaceutics of ofatumumab were not performed during the clinical development program. Distribution In clinical studies with ofatumumab, the half-life was 17.1 days and the volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 1.7 to 8.1 L across studies, dose levels, and infusion number. Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with relapsed CLL receiving ofatumumab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, geometric mean CL and t½ values for ofatumumab were  11.2 ml/h (3.7-105 ml/h) and 19.9 days (1.4 47.1 days) after the fourth infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Subsequent ofatumumab dosing leads to potent depletion of B cells resulting in reduced overall clearance at later cycles. Following multiple doses, ofatumumab pharmacokinetics exhibits a long half-life and low volume of distribution similar to that of other mAbs.

## Target population

Ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in study OMB913 was investigated using a population pharmacokinetic approach, and were consistent with those reported previously in subjects with CLL.

By estimating just a single parameter (BOND\\_adj) and updating another parameter (BIN) based on the data in Study OMB110913, the published ofatumumab population PK model resulted in the successful fitting of the ofatumumab PK data from Study OMB110913. Following the update of the BIN parameter based on the ratio of the baseline CD20 levels in Study OMB110913 compared to that in Study OMB111773/Hx CD20-406, a BOND\\_adj parameter of 0.8 was estimated. Given the baseline CD19+ levels in Study OMB110913 were aligned to the relapsed/refractory population published by Struemper (0.0901 (95% CI: 0.0603-0.12)), the estimate of the BOND\\_adj parameter was in line with expectations. The data were described well, and there was good agreement between individual post-hoc parameter estimates for the ofatumumab model from Study OMB110913 and previous ofatumumab studies. Additionally, the derived ofatumumab PK parameters were also comparable to previously reported values, with the average estimated half-life after repeat dosing of 19.9 days, which closely matches estimates from other studies, as well as the expected half-life of monoclonal antibodies. Ofatumumab population pharmacokinetics has been studied in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens in CLL subjects. Whilst Study OMB110913 was not designed, powered, nor sampled to formally assess a potential DDI between ofatumumab and either FC component, the potential for a DDI was assessed using several methodologies. For both F-ara-A and C, concentration-time profiles and a formal comparison (ANOVA) of derived AUC(0-τ) by treatment group indicated comparable PK in the absence and presence of ofatumumab. For F-ara-A, the point estimates for AUC(0-τ) comparison between treatments at both cycles suggested similar exposure in both treatment arms. The CI were wide and included the null value of 1.0, for no change in parameter suggesting lack of DDI of ofatumumab on F-ara-A exposure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Figure 1: F-ara-A concentration-time after dose profiles by cycle For C, the point estimates for AUC(0-τ) comparison at Cycle 1 was 0.959 suggesting lack of DDI of ofatumumab on C exposure. At Cycle 6, the point estimates for AUC(0-τ) comparison was 0.68 suggesting lower C exposure with concurrent ofatumumab treatment. The CI around the point estimate at Cycle 6 was wide and included the null value. The population PK model estimates of clearance were slightly higher with ofatumumab co-administration.

In this small DDI substudy, parameter estimates may have been influenced by the consistent differences in sample collection between the two treatment arms and a very sparse sampling scheme, which could make it difficult to definitively draw conclusions based on derived parameters from this limited dataset.

Based on the results of Study OMB913 included in this submission, ofatumumab exposure was similar when administered alone or in combination with C in relapsed CLL subjects. In a sub-study assessment, no effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of ofatumumab was seen on either fludarabine or cyclophosphamide exposure. Cumulative drug-drug interaction data available therefore suggests a lack of interaction between ofatumumab and chemotherapy agents.

No new dedicated drug interactions studies have been submitted with this application. The potential interaction between ofatumumab and F-ara-A and C were investigated based on population analysis of the exposures. Population pharmacokinetics Model description: The analysis was performed using the NONMEM software system, NONMEM VII version 3 (ICON, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). All modelling was performed using the first order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) method. Prior modeling: The population pharmacokinetic model the current analysis was built on was previously submitted. The prior population pharmacokinetic model was based on data from 252 patients with CLL, 38 patients with FL, and 187 patients with RA who received multiple infusions of ofatumumab as a single agent at doses ranging from 100 to 2000 mg in Study Hx-CD20-001, Study Hx- CD20-402, Study Hx-CD20-403, and Study OMB773/Hx-CD20-406. Figure 2: Diagram of Pharmacokinetic Model Database: The population PK dataset for ofatumumab included 2478 observations from 176 subjects. Of these subjects, 103 were male and 73 female and 151 were White, 2 Black/African American, 19 Asian, 3 American Indian/Alaskan and 1 multi-race.

For all three analytes, prior to fitting, the suitability of existing/published models to the Study OMB110913 data was assessed using a visual predictive check (VPC). A previously developed nonlinear mixed-effects model describing the PK of ofatumumab was used to characterize ofatumumab exposure. The population parameter estimates (fixed effects) and variability (random effects) from the previous model were used to generate the empirical Bayesian estimates of individual parameters. The B cell synthesis rate (BIN) was set to the relative ratio of the geometric mean B-cell count in Study OMB110913 compared to that in Study OMB111773/Hx-CD20-406. An adjustment factor for B-cell target on drug interaction rate constant was estimated. Model applicability was assessed by visual inspection of goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks. For F-ara-A and C, previously developed non-linear mixed-effects models were used to provide supporting prior information on parameter estimates and variances. Individual post hoc parameter

Data missingness: In individual concentration-time profiles, non-quantifiable (NQ) values which occurred in a profile before the first measurable concentration were assigned a value of zero concentration. Additionally, if an NQ value occurred after a measurable concentration in a profile and was followed by a value above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ), then the NQ value was generally omitted. If two NQ values occurred in succession (after maximum observed concentration (Cmax)), the profile was deemed to have terminated at the first NQ value, and any subsequent concentrations were omitted. The mean/median value at a time with NQ values was reported (in tabular or graphical fashion) unless the resulting mean/median value was &lt;LLQ of the assay, in which case the value was assigned NQ. Outliers: There were six, one and three quantifiable concentrations for ofatumumab, F-ara-A and C, respectively measured prior to the first doses that were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, all trailing dose records, following the last available PK sample were also excluded from the analysis. Methodology: For ofatumumab, a population PK model has been previously reported using a target-mediated clearance model developed based on four phase I/II studies in subjects with CLL, follicular lymphoma, and rheumatoid arthritis (Struemper 2014, Patel 2015). This model was applied to the data in the present study to determine the post hoc estimates of individual parameters. Due to the limited sampling for both F-ara-A and C in Study OMB110913 following both ofatumumab + FC and FC, literature models characterizing the PK of both compounds were used to support pseudo-Bayesian analysis of available F-ara-A and C concentrations. For F-ara-A, the model published by Salinger et al (Salinger 2009) was employed and for C, the models by Kim et al (Kim 2013) and Hassan et al (Hassan 1999) were used as the basis for the Bayesian analysis. The models presented for both F-ara-A and C were two-compartment models describing concentrations following IV infusions, as was the case in Study OMB110913. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

estimates were generated. Assessment of DDI potential was conducted via visual comparison of concentrations vs. time plots after dose by cycle, visual inspection of the CI-VPC by treatment, evaluation of the statistical significance of including treatment as a covariate on CL and V1 in the population PK model, and comparison of AUC(0-τ) by treatment using box and whisker plots and conducting a formal assessment using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). For F-ara-A and C, the $PRIORS procedure in NONMEM was employed such that the literature data are used to provide supporting prior information on parameter estimates and variances. A sensitivity analysis using differing arbitrary variances in conjunction with a review of the Study OMB110913 data in relation to the published data and comparability of the literature population to a CLL population was used to determine the variance supplied for the fitting.

The applicability of the values used as prior information for the C model was checked using a CI-VPC (500 replicates) using parameter and variability values. Given the uncertainty in the priors, the different publications, the lack of Q and V2 estimates in duplicate, and the relatively high IIV observed in both the Hassan, et al and Kim, et al publications, the $THETAPV was set at 10,000 for the estimation of population PK model parameters of C from study OMB110913. The high value for $THETAPV allowed minimal influence of the prior estimates on the final parameter estimates given the high variability and the low compatibility with Study OMB110913. Verification of modelling software: Not reported. Deviations from MAP: Not applicable. Structural model: as described in Figure 2 for ofatumumab. For both F-ara-A og C, linear two-compartment models with first-order elimination was fitted to the data, respectively. Co-variate model: For ofatumumab, the base and final models contained fixed covariate effects. For both F-ara-A and C, no formal covariate testing was evaluated. However, as detailed in the population PK report, ofatumumab co-administration was investigated as a covariate in the population PK model to assess the potential DDI. Only treatment on CL and V1 was evaluated as a covariate in the population PK model for F-ara-A and C. Error model: All inter-individual variability (IIV) terms in the analysis were described by an exponential error model, or log-normal parameter distribution. For PK observations of ofatumumab and F-ara-A, the residual error model was described by a combined proportional and additive error model. For PK observations of C, the residual error model was described by a simplified version of above with just the proportional component. Assumptions: · Domains explored by the collected data/the incorporation of prior knowledge sufficiently sound to allow describing the PK of ofatumumab, F-ara-A and C in the target population with regards to selected patient population, population samples size, sample timing and numbers · PK/PD target appropriate Medicinal product no longer authorised

Figure 8: Cyclophosphamide CI-VPC by treatment Decision criteria: CI-VPCs, parameter estimates and their variability, diagnostics plots and parameters plots, where appropriate, were used to confirm the suitability of models to the available Study OMB110913 data. 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics and exposure-response relationship No new data related to the mechanism of action of ofatumumab have been submitted. Rapid, efficient, and sustained depletion of peripheral B cells was observed for the majority of CLL patients at all ofatumumab dosing regimens tested, beginning with the first infusion. In patients with relapsed or refractory  CLL,  previously  untreated  CLL  as  well  as  patients  receiving  maintenance  therapy,  ≥  80% reductions  in  B  cell  counts  were  seen  following  multiple  doses.  In  Study  OMB913,  the  ofatumumab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination elicited complete (40% of responders) or near-complete (80% of responders) Bcell depletion in relapsed CLL patients.

Previously, a trend of longer PFS was observed with higher ofatumumab AUC and was also noted with Cmax and Ctrough at certain time points (Summary of clinical pharmacology in maintenance CLL).  In  Study OMB913, higher ofatumumab exposure was also associated with greater reduction of B-cells, and longer PFS.  No  relationship  could  be  discerned  between  exposure  of  ofatumumab  and  occurrence  of  adverse events.

## Antibodies

In Study OMB913, 1 patient out of 170 with conclusive ADA data was confirmed ADA positive. In Study OMB991, no patients with positive ADA were identified (0 out of 42 with conclusive ADA data). In total, 2483 patients have been treated with ofatumumab; 2225 patients received ofatumumab by IV infusion. To date, 14/1882 patients were confirmed ADA positive across the clinical development program (0.7%). In CLL, 2/926 patients were confirmed ADA positive (0.2%). For patients with positive ADA results, there were no safety, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic consequences associated with the positive results in immunogenicity assays, where this could be assessed. The safety profile in patients with positive ADA results was similar to that in patients with all negative results.

The relationship between exposure and safety was assessed graphically by examining early and late onset AEs as follows: Cycle 1 Week 2 AUC(0-τ), Cmax, and Ctrough vs. adverse events occurring on or before 1 month of treatment, and Cycle 4 AUC(0-τ), Cmax, and Ctrough vs. adverse events occurring on or before 6 months of treatment. The assumption of this analysis is that the measure of exposure is representative of the exposure at the time of the AE regardless if the AE occurred before or after the exposure assessment.

2.3.4. PK/PD modelling Exposure-response Rapid, efficient, and sustained depletion of peripheral B cells was observed for the majority of CLL patients at all ofatumumab dosing regimens tested, beginning with the first infusion. In patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, previously untreated CLL as well as patients receiving maintenance therapy, ≥ 80% reductions in B cell counts were seen following multiple doses. In Study OMB913, the ofatumumab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination elicited complete (40% of responders) or near-complete (80% of responders) B-cell depletion in relapsed CLL patients. Previously, a trend of longer PFS was observed with higher ofatumumab AUC and was also noted with Cmax and Ctrough at certain time points. Database: All patients from study OMB110913 (data cut off: December 17, 2014) with at least one exposure variables and with the respective efficacy/safety endpoint were included in the analysis. Data missingness, outliers: For exposures; as described for the population-PK model. For the response endpoints; as described in the clinical study report. Methodology: Visual inspection of the exposure response relationship. The previously developed population PK model was applied to the data and used to generate post hoc ofatumumab PK parameter estimates for the individual subjects in Study OMB110913, including AUC(0-τ). Cmax and Ctrough were observed directly from the raw data. Ofatumumab exposure parameters (Cycle 4 AUC(0-τ) and Ctrough) were divided into quartiles and the relationship between exposure and PFS was explored using Kaplan-Meier plots. Cycle 4 AUC(0-τ) and Ctrough were chosen as the measures of exposure for the analyses because these exposure levels approximate steady state exposure. The relationship between ofatumumab exposure and B cell counts over time was also explored graphically by quartiles of Cycle 1 Week 2 AUC(0-τ) and Ctrough, and Cycle 4 AUC(0-τ) and Ctrough. Cycle 1 Week 2 AUC(0-τ) and Ctrough and Cycle 4 AUC(0 -τ) and Ctrough were chosen as the measures of exposure for the analyses to examine both the early and steady state ofatumumab exposure effect on the B cell count, respectively.

Finally, the proportion of subjects with ofatumumab Ctrough &gt; 10 μg/mL by cycle was computed directly from observed data. This target level was determined based on preclinical data where peripheral B-cell recovery in cynomolgus monkeys and tumour cell growth in tumour-bearing SCID mice were suppressed [Bleeker, 2008].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Purpose of use:

1. To explore the relationship between ofatumumab exposure and:
2. o Progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with relapsed CLL
3. o B cell count over time in subjects with relapsed CLL
4. o Selected adverse events (AEs) in subjects with relapsed CLL (all infections, Grade 3+ infections, pneumonia, decreased neutrophil count, decreased platelet count, decreased haemoglobin, other cytopenias and serious adverse events)
2. To determine the proportion of subjects with ofatumumab trough concentrations above 10 ug/mL, established as a target concentration based on peripheral B cell suppression data in the preclinical setting.
6. Outcome: 1. Exposure response analysis showed a. A general trend of longer PFS was observed with higher ofatumumab exposure (Cycle 4 AUC(0-τ) and Ctrough), an observation that is possibly attributable to response-induced decrease in drug clearance (Figure 9). b. B cell depletion was observed at all exposures, however, higher exposures were overall associated with a greater reduction of B cells (Figure 10). The exposure-related differences in B cell depletion across exposure quartiles are consistent with the drug mechanism of action and the observed exposure-related differences in PFS. c. There was no apparent relationship between exposure and the occurrence of selected adverse events. A high proportion of subjects (&gt;88%) in the study achieved Ctrough concentrations above the target of 10 ug/mL at steady state. 2. In Study OMB110913, simulations based on an existing model suggested that ofatumumab administered as 2 doses in the first cycle (300 mg on Day 1 and 1000 mg on Day 8), then 1000 mg on Day 1 of each 4-week cycle would maintain plasma concentrations above a target trough concentration of 10 µg/mL in the majority of subjects. Trough concentrations were measured at the end of Cycles 1 to 5 on the day of the next dose, but before the start of the infusion. The vast majority of subjects (&gt;88%) had Ctrough values above 10 µg/mL at steady state (after Cycle 3) (Table 4 : Summary of Ofatumumab Trough Concentrations across Cycles Table 4).

The clinical pharmacology of ofatumumab has been previously characterized, and previously submitted data are  not  reassessed.  The  new  clinical  pharmacology  data  presented  in  this  submission  are  from  Study OMB913,  and  consists  of  a  population  PK  analysis  as  well  as  visual  investigation  by  quartiles  and Kaplan-Mayer plots to explore the exposure response relationship. The presented data and analysis do not alter the understanding of ofatumumab pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or immunogenicity.

Based on the results of Study OMB913, ofatumumab exposure was similar when administered alone or in combination with fludarabine in relapsed CLL subjects, however there was indications of an interaction with cyclophosphamide at later cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with relapsed CLL receiving ofatumumab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, the geometric mean Cmax values after the first infusion (300 mg), the 1000 mg infusion on day 8, and the 1000 mg infusion at the fourth cycle were 61.4 µg/ml, 241 µg/ml and 313 µg/ml, respectively; the geometric mean AUC(0τ ) value at the fourth cycle was 89,091 µg.h./ml. The geometric mean CL and t½ values for ofatumumab were 11.2 ml/h (3.7-105 ml/h) and 19.9 days (1.4-47.1 days) after the fourth infusion.

The above information has been included in the SmPC section 5.2.

An exposure-response analysis in the form of cross-sectional visual inspections was presented to explore the potential relationship of exposure with both efficacy and safety. As expected due to B-cell mediated DD higher ofatumumab exposure was also associated with greater reduction of B-cells, and longer PFS. No relationship could be discerned between exposure of ofatumumab and occurrence of adverse events.

2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology The  presented  data  and  analysis  do  not  alter  the  understanding  of  ofatumumab  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or immunogenicity.  The results are in general consistency with previous findings of exposure to ofatumumab in subjects with CLL. Relevant information is included in the SmPC section 5.2. 2.4. Clinical efficacy 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies) No new dose response studies have been submitted with this application. The selected dose in the pivotal study is in line with the approved dose for previously untreated CLL patients (except that the maximum recommended number of cycles for relapsed CLL patients are 6 as opposed to 12 for previously untreated patients). The dose of ofatumumab, 1000 mg, was  selected based on the tolerability of the 1000 mg dose in previous and ongoing studies as well as PK modelling and simulation results that indicated that the proposed dosing regimen would maintain the target exposure in a high proportion of subjects. An initial dose of 300 mg of ofatumumab was given on Day 1, cycle 1 to minimize infusion-related events before introducing the higher dose at Day 8 cycle 1. The six cycle dosing schema at four week intervals was based on prior clinical experience with rituximab combined with fludarabine or FC [Byrd, 2005; Keating, 2005; Wierda, 2005] and was also thought to maximize the duration of ofatumumab exposure, and maintain chemosensitization of CLL to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide while enhancing response duration without causing additional toxicities. 2.4.2.

## Treatments

## Treatment Arm A (O+FC)

Ofatumumab: Cycle 1: 300 mg IV Day 1 (to minimize infusion-related reactions), 1000 mg IV on Day 8 Cycles 2-6: 1000 mg IV (1 dose every 28 days).  Subjects were premedicated at 30 minutes to 2 hours before each infusion of ofatumumab to reduce the incidence and

severity of infusion reactions.

Fludarabine: 25 mg/m2 IV, Days 1-3 every 28 days for 6 cycles Cyclophosphamide: 250 mg/m2 IV, Days 1-3 every 28 days for 6 cycles OR Treatment Arm B (FC) Fludarabine: 25 mg/m2 IV, Days 1-3 every 28 days for 6 cycles Cyclophosphamide: 250 mg/m2 IV, Days 1-3 every 28 days for 6 cycles In both treatment arms, disease status assessments to determine subject response or progression were performed monthly according to NCI Criteria. Patient  Reported  Outcome  (PRO)  measures  (EORTC  QLQ-C30,  EORTC  QLQ-CLL16,EQ-5D)  were performed  at  Baseline  (screening  visit)  and  at  Cycle  4-Day  85  treatment  visit.  A  Health  Change Questionnaire  was  performed  at  all  post  baseline  visits,  as  per  Protocol  Section  6.  If  a  subject experienced  progressive  disease  during  treatment,  PRO  measures  were  assessed  at  the  time progressive disease (PD) was assessed. Follow-up Phase After completion of the treatment phase (for subjects achieving CR, PR, or SD), survival and disease status assessments were performed 1 month post treatment and every 3 months for up to 5 years, as well safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Bone  marrow  examination  with  Minimal  Residual  Disease  (MRD)  assessment  was  required  for confirmation of CR at least three months post final treatment. CT-Scans were performed for subjects achieving a CR or PR three months post final treatment. PRO measures (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, EQ-5D and a Health Change Questionnaire) were performed  at  time  points  indicated  in  the  Time  and  Events  Schedule.  Subjects  that  had  disease progression during the follow-up phase were required to complete a PD follow-up visit. In subsequent visits the subject continued to be followed for survival status only, as per post PD follow-up schedule, until the end of the 5 years follow-up phase. Post PD follow-up Medicinal product no longer authorised

Follow-up  assessment  for  subjects  experiencing  disease  progression  during  the  treatment  phase required a 1-month  post-treatment safety assessment. Subsequent  follow-up visits included assessment of survival status, date of next CLL therapy, type of therapy and response to therapy, and could be either clinic visit or telephone visits.

## Disease status assessment - screening phase

Blood samples, physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scan and bone marrow examination were performed to determine baseline disease status and study eligibility. All examinations had to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performed  ≤14 days  prior  to  randomization,  with  the  exception  of  the  CT  scan  and  bone  marrow examination. The CT scan was performed within 6 weeks and the bone marrow examination within 6 months prior to randomization.

## Disease status assessment - during study period

In both treatment arms, disease status assessments to determine subject response or progression were performed monthly according to NCI criteria [Hallek, 2008] and included:

- Physical examination including lymph node examination, spleen and liver measurement

· Detection of constitutional symptoms · Peripheral blood sample evaluation of complete blood count (CBC) and differentialMonitoring and  treatment  of  potential  tumour  lysis  syndrome  was  performed  as  per  routine  oncology standard of care. Quality of life assessment The following patient reported outcome (PRO) measures were used in the study: · European  Organisation  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  Quality  of  Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) · EORTC QLQ Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 16 item module (EORTC QLQ-CLL 16) · EuroQoL Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) · Health Change Questionnaire (HCQ) The EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL 16, and EQ-5D questionnaires were collected at study Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, at the 1-month follow-up visit and every 3 months during follow-up. The HCQ was administered at Day 1 of Cycle 4, at the 1-month follow-up visit and every 3 months during follow-up. If a subject demonstrated disease progression, the measures should be completed at the progression visit and again one time after determination of progression. If a subject withdrew from the study then the questionnaires was administered at the point of withdrawal. Disease status assessment - follow-up phase After completion of the treatment phase (for subjects achieving CR, PR, or SD), survival and disease status assessments were performed 1-month post treatment and every 3 months for up to 5 years. Bone marrow examination was required for confirmation of CR at least three months post final treatment. Minimal  Residual  Disease  (MRD)  assessment  of  the  bone  marrow  aspirate  was  also  performed  for subjects demonstrating a CR. CT-Scans were performed for subjects achieving a CR or PR three months post final treatment. Disease status assessment - post PD follow-up Medicinal product no longer authorised

Follow-up  assessment  for  subjects  experiencing  disease  progression  during  the  treatment  phase required a 1-month  post-treatment safety assessment. Subsequent  follow-up visits included assessment of survival status, date of next CLL therapy, type of therapy and response to therapy, and could be either clinic visit or telephone visits.

Subjects that had disease progression during the follow-up phase were required to complete a PD follow-up visit. In subsequent visits, the subject continued to be followed for survival status only, as per post PD follow-up schedule, until the end of the 5 years follow-up phase.

## Objectives

## Primary objective:

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  (OMB110913/COMPLEMENT  2)  was  to  evaluate  and  compare whether treatment with ofatumumab (GSK1841157) plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (O+FC) improved the  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  compared  to  fludarabine  and  cyclophosphamide  (FC) alone in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

## Disease Markers:

· B-cell monitoring · Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) · Prognostic and biological markers correlating with clinical response Pharmacokinetics · Plasma ofatumumab concentrations Exploratory Endpoints: · Exploratory pharmacogenetics biomarkers · Cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS), a tool to measure comorbidity burden by assessing organ class functionality, more frequently used for assessment of previously untreated patients. For the present study, the CIRS-G (G=geriatric) was used. · Type of and response to next line treatment · Exploratory transcriptomic/pharmacogenomics biomarkers Randomisation Subjects were randomized with a block size of 2 to receive treatment arm A or B in a 1:1 ratio for the duration of the treatment period. Assignment of study drug was stratified according to two stratification factors: the number of prior CLL therapies (1 to 2 vs. ≥3) and Binet stage at Screening (A vs. B vs. C), resulting in six strata in total. Blinding Because of distinct  infusion  reaction  profile  of  ofatumumab,  blinding  was  not  possible.  In  order  to minimize potential bias, the primary endpoint was assessed by an IRC blinded to subjects' treatment. The  blinded  IRC  was  conducted  by  Perceptive  Informatics,  Inc.  (Perceptive),  utilizing  electronic CRF-collected data. The IRC reviewer did not receive subjects' AE data to avoid compromising the blinded treatment group. Sample size Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Study  OMB110913  was  an  event-driven  study  (disease  progression  as  determined  by  a  blinded Independent Review Committee or death), and the original protocol required 234 IRC-confirmed events to occur to trigger primary analysis. Blinded data were submitted to the IRC on an ongoing basis and the total number of events (i.e., blinded and irrespective of treatment arm) were returned to GSK to allow monitoring of the event rate. During this process, it became evident that the original study assumptions (13 vs. 9 months) underestimated the actual PFS and that events were occurring at a slower rate than projected. In addition, as data began to return from the IRC, more subjects than expected were found to have been censored for reasons such as withdrawal from study, starting new anti-cancer therapy prior

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  disease  progression,  extended  time  without  adequate  assessment,  and  disease  progression determined by the investigator but not by the IRC. It was also determined that among completed subjects, the drop-out rate was 31%. Thus, the event rate was anticipated to decrease further over time, due to the declining number of evaluable subjects who have not progressed or have been lost to follow-up. The delay in events, the lower event rate projections due to the decreasing pool of subjects over time, and the risk of losing additional subjects during follow-up resulted in a smaller evaluable subject population and prompted the re-evaluation of the sample size assumptions for median PFS for the study.

The  following  assumptions  were  made  in  the  estimation  of  the  required  sample  size  in  protocol amendment 02: · Event times are exponentially distributed. · A median PFS for fludarabine + cyclophosphamide is 20 months. · A median PFS for ofatumumab 1000 mg + fludarabine + cyclophosphamide is 30 months. · A 1:1 stratified randomization scheme. · An 80% chance of successfully declaring  a  difference  in  the  presence  of  a  true  underlying difference (power). · A 5% two-sided risk of erroneously claiming a difference in the presence of no true underlying difference. · Accrual rate is 10 subjects per month. Under the above assumptions, a minimum of 194 total events from both treatment arms combined were needed for the study to have 80% power. With a total sample size of 316 evaluable subjects, the total duration of the study was estimated to be approximately 50.5 months (under H1) to obtain the 194 total events. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, the total sample size for both arms combined was expected to be about 352 subjects and the total duration of the study will be about 54 months. Assuming a screening failure rate of 15%, the total number of subjects expected to be screened was approximately 416 subjects. The robustness and sensitivity of the above sample size calculation was considered in order to assess the impact on power should the assumed median PFS vary. The following table shows the estimated power for different median values of PFS for ofatumumab 1000mg + fludarabine + cyclophosphamide. The total number of events is 194 and the total number of evaluable subjects is 316. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Statistical analysis

The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set included data from all subjects who were randomized, regardless to which treatment arm they were randomized or which treatment they received. The ITT population was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

used for all efficacy assessments.

A Safety Analysis Set included data from subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of a study drug, with treatment assignments designated according to the actual treatment received.

The Per-protocol (PP) population was used in the primary endpoint analysis to check the robustness of the results for the ITT population, it was only used if the difference in the total number of subjects was &gt;10% of the ITT population.

No interim  analysis  was  planned  for  the  study.  PFS  was  tested  based  on  a  two-sided  test,  with  a significance alpha level of 0.05. The Kaplan Meier method was used for survival distributions, and the curved were compared using a stratified log-rank test. A Cox regression model was used and included covariates for treatment, stratification factors (Binet Stage (A vs. B vs. C) and number of prior therapies (1-2 vs &gt;3). Analytical results included the estimated hazard ratios along with 95% confidence intervals, and associated probabilities for the effect of treatment, stratification factors and the covariates. The hazard ratio for treatment expressed the risk of experiencing disease progression or death for O+FC vs. FC. The primary efficacy hypothesis (the null hypothesis) was to be rejected at the 2-sided significance level before the efficacy hypothesis for the secondary efficacy endpoints could be evaluated. If the primary hypothesis was rejected, the 5 secondary endpoints were to be sequentially tested at the 2-sided significance level of 0.03 as listed previously. The significance level was chosen in such a way that the overall Type 1 error rate of significance level was preserved at the 2sided significance level of 0.05. Five sensitivity analyses of PFS were conducted to confirm the robustness of the primary PFS analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for IRC-assessed PFS for the stratification factors (number of prior therapies and Binet stage) as well as gender, age, race, geographical distribution, Rai staging, ECOG performance  status,  presence  of  constitutional  symptoms,  presence  of  comorbidities,  creatinine clearance, type of previous therapy, and time to first diagnosis. Secondary efficacy analyses of IRC-assessed ORR and OS were considered as inferential secondary endpoints for this study, and were only tested if the primary endpoint was significant to control overall type I error rate based on the sequential gatekeeping strategy. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) analyses were performed using the ITT. The mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) was used to assess the treatment effect in the changes from baseline score in Global Health Status/HRQoL and in the B symptom index for data up to 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months.

## Post-treatment anti-cancer therapy

Administration of subsequent CLL therapy was at the discretion of the treating investigator per local standard of care.

Rituximab, as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, was the most frequently prescribed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

anti-cancer drug, see table below. Ofatumumab was not offered as part of a crossover or extension study, but was administered to 2% of subjects, primarily in the FC arm.

Concomitant medications The majority of subjects used concomitant medications during the study (O+FC: 96%, FC: 93%). The most commonly reported concomitant medications that were not a component of the infusion-pre-medication were antibiotics or antivirals, which were predominantly taken for prophylaxis. The same percentage of subjects in both treatment arms received antimicrobials (84%). Since known AEs associated with FC treatment include nausea and vomiting, anti-emetic drugs were commonly reported. Sixty-two percent of subjects received at least 1 transfusion (blood products or blood supportive care products) during the trial with a higher proportion of subjects receiving transfusions in the O+FC arm (69%) compared with the FC arm (56%). Red blood cells and/or platelets were administered to 26% of subjects in the O+FC arm and 30% of subjects in the FC arm. Blood products were administered to 29% of subjects (O+FC: 28%, FC: 31%) and blood supportive care products were administered to 50% of subjects (O+FC: 59%, FC: 40%). Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the treatment and prevention of neutropenia was administered to 56% of subjects in the O+FC arm and 40% of subjects in the FC arm. Erythropoietin was administered to 7% of subjects in the O+FC arm and 5% in the FC arm. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment compliance The majority (&gt;90%) of subjects randomized to receive ofatumumab received 100% of the expected total dose. Similarly compliance with the FC regimen was also good with &gt;95% of subjects receiving between 80% and 120% of the expected total daily dose. Variations in this range were expected due to the requirement to calculate dose based on body surface area. Conduct of the study Recruitment This is an International multicentre study where 365 subjects were included at 87 sites in 18 countries in USA, Canada, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, UK, Spain, Netherlands, Romania, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, Thailand and Ukraine.

## Numbers analysed

Efficacy and PRO analysis were conducted on the ITT population, which comprised all 365 randomized subjects (O+FC: N=183, FC: N=182) (see table below). The PP population (N=351) was a subset of subjects from the ITT population who did not have an important protocol deviation (see under 'Statistical methods'). The Safety population included 359 subjects (O+FC: N=181, FC: N=178) who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 6 subjects excluded from the Safety population were randomized, but did not receive any study treatment.

a. Subjects alive and progression-free, censored at LAA.

b. Subjects took alternative therapy prior to documented progression, censored at LAA.

C. No disease assessment after randomization.

d. Event (death or progression) occurred after 2 or more missed visits, censored at LAA.

e. Confidenceintervalswereobtained using theBrookmeyer-Crowleymethod.

Hazard ratios were obtained using the Pike estimator. A hazard ratio &lt;1 indicates a lower risk with O+FC compared with FC. The hazard ratio and p-value from the stratified log-rank test are adjusted for Binet stage and number of prior therapies.

IRC-assessed event-free survival Event-free survival - where PD, death, and the start of alternative CLL therapy prior to PD were considered events - resulted in a higher number of events compared with the primary PFS analysis (n=231). Median EFS in both treatment arms was 27.2 months in the O+FC arm and 16.5 months in the FC arm; HR=0.66, 95% CI: [0.51, 0.86], p=0.0012. IRC-assessed PFS without new anti-cancer therapy as an event or censored The analysis of PFS, where the start of alternative therapy was neither censored (like in the primary analysis of PFS) nor counted as event (like in EFS), resulted in a median PFS consistent with the primary analysis (28.1 months in the O+FC arm and 18.8 months in the FC arm; HR=0.68, 95% CI: [0.52, 0.90], p=0.0045). Covariates Cox regression with stepwise selection was conducted for IRC-assessed PFS with the following covariates: stratification factors, treatment, baseline characteristics, and prognostic factors. Covariates with p&lt;0.20 were selected by the model. The HR for O+FC compared with FC was significant, adjusting for other covariates (HR=0.67, 95% CI: [0.50, 0.92], p=0.011). This result was consistent with the primary PFS analysis. Additionally, the Cox regression showed a significant p-value for 17p deletion (reference='no aberration'; HR=6.29, 95% CI: [3.26, 12.16], p&lt;0.0001), controlling for other covariates. Potential bias related to timing of disease assessment Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Sensitivity analysis 5 was performed to address a potential assessment time bias introduced in the PFS analysis due to the follow-up visits being counted from the last dosing date for each subject. To investigate this, the progression dates and censoring dates were set to the protocol defined time points for scheduled visits ('common visits').

The median PFS for O+FC occurred in 'interval 12,' which corresponds to approximately 28.6 to 31.6 months. The median PFS for FC occurred in 'interval 8,' which corresponds to approximately 16.6 to 19.6 months. The HR for this analysis was 0.69 (95% CI: [0.53 to 0.91]; p=0.0043; which is consistent with the primary analysis.

Secondary endpoints The overall response rate (ORR) was also assessed by an IRC using the 2008 NCI-WG guidelines. The ORR was higher for OFA+FC versus FC (84% versus 68%, p=0.0003). Overall Survival The number of deaths reported was 67 (37%) in the O+FC group and 69 (38%) in the FC group. The OS data are still immature at the time of reporting.  With a median follow-up of 34 months median OS was 56.4 months for O+FC and 45.8 months for FC but the difference was not significant (see table and figure below).

Figure 15: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Overall Survival Time to progression and time to next therapy Time to progression as assessed by the IRC was significantly increased for subjects treated with O+FC compared with subjects treated with FC (table below). Investigator-assessed median time to progression was also significantly improved in the O+FC arm (32.3 months) compared with the FC arm (25.8 months) (HR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.83; p=0.0009). These results were consistent with the primary PFS endpoint analysis. Median time to next therapy was extended for subjects in the O+FC arm who required subsequent therapy approximately 8 months later than subjects in the FC arm (table below).

## Minimal residual disease

Negativity for MRD 6 months after the last treatment was 26% in the O+FC arm (48/183) compared with 6% in the FC arm (11/182) (Study OMB913). Three months after the last treatment, 39/183 subjects (21%) in the O+FC arm were negative for MRD, compared with 15/182 (8%) in the FC arm.

Over all Follow-up visits, 65 subjects (36%) in the O+FC arm and 21 subjects (12%) in the FC arm were MRD negative. Thirty-one of 52 subjects (60%) subjects who achieved an IRC assessed CR or CRi in the O+FC arm became MRD negative, compared to 33 of 101 (33%) subjects who achieved PR or nPR. In the O+B study (OMB991) 6% (3) were MRD negative during Follow-up.

B cell response Approximately 80% of responders in the O+FC arm (study OMB913) showed near-complete B cell depletion and almost 40% showed complete B cell depletion (whether IRC or Investigator assessed). Of non-responders  in  the  O-FC  arm,  7%  and  20%  had  complete  and  near  complete  B-cell  depletion respectively (IRC assessed). The proportion of responders in the FC arm with B cell depletion (complete or near-complete) was 4% and 23% respectively. Few non-responders in the FC arm had complete (2%) or near complete B cell depletion (8%), as assessed by the IRC. Depletion of CD5+CD19+ (CLL cells) after treatment was higher in the O+FC arm. The median CD5+CD19+ concentration at the 1-month Follow-up for subjects in the O+FC arm was 1 cell/µL compared with 64 cells/µL for subjects in the FC arm. B-symptoms and reduction of lymph node size In the Study OMB913, approximately two-thirds of subjects presented with 1 or more B-symptoms at Baseline. In both treatment arms, the number of subjects with B-symptoms decreased over time during treatment and over the course of follow-up. More subjects in the O+FC arm were B-symptom free and at earlier time points compared with the FC arm. In both treatment arms, the majority of subjects with a decrease in lymph node size had a reduction of &gt;50% compared with Baseline. A larger decrease in median lymph node size was noted in the O+FC arm (-3140.9 mm 2 ; range -9984 to -558) compared to the FC arm (-2177.9 mm 2 ; range -15991 to -111). In the Study OMB991  following the last dose of study treatment, 100% maximum reductions in lymph node size were reported for 30 of the 36 subjects (83%) who had lymphadenopathy reported at Baseline. Richter's transformation A total of 5 subjects, O+FC: 2/114 (1.8%), and FC 3/121 (2.5%) subjects had PD due to Richter's transformation. Patient reported outcomes Baseline  HRQoL  values  were  collected  at  screening  and  were  similar  for  both  treatment  arms  as determined from the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, 'B-symptoms' score, and EQ-5D for the ITT population.

## Ancillary analyses

Post-hoc analyses of TTP and TTNT.

Adding ofatumumab to FC resulted in an apparently larger gain in median TTP (approximately 15 months) than in median PFS (approximately 10 months). In the analysis of PFS 208 events were observed, of which 58 events were deaths (approximately 30% of all PFS events). These deaths (which occurred without progressive disease [PD]) were not considered as TTP events, but were censored in the TTP analysis. Among

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these deaths (30 in the O+FC arm and 28 in the FC arm), the time to death is longer in the O+FC arm (median 8.2 months) than the FC arm (7.4 months).

## Time to next therapy

The benefit seen across progression-related endpoints (PFS, EFS, and TTP) translated into a median prolongation in TTNT of approximately 8 months in the main analysis of TTNT (where death was censored). In a sensitivity analysis of TTNT where death was considered an event, the median prolongation in TTNT (approximately 9 months) is similar to the median prolongation in PFS (approximately 10 months). Furthermore, similar results were seen for PFS with and without censoring for NTX. Different definitions for event and censoring are employed for progression-related endpoints (PFS, EFS and TTP) and TTNT. To further explore the relationship between TTP and TTNT endpoints, subjects enrolled in Study OMB913 were categorized into 4 groups, as shown in the table below.

Table 28 : Categorization of subjects based on progression and NTX events in Study OMB913 (ITT population) Two of these groups can be considered as expected: a) subjects with PD who received NTX, and b) subjects who did not have PD and who did not receive NTX. The two other groups can be considered as being influenced by local clinical practice: c) subject who did not have PD but who received NTX, d) subjects who had PD but did not receive NTX. Depending on the balance in subjects categorized in groups c and d between the two arms, discrepant results for TTP and TTNT can be expected. Such a discrepancy is not truly reflective of a lack in consistency between the study endpoints and may be influenced by patient's condition and decisions, alternative available treatments or physician's judgement. When the influence of local clinical practice is removed from the analysis of TTNT (i.e., subjects in groups c and d), the median prolongation in TTNT (16.8 months) was similar to that observed for TTP (median 15.3 months), see table below.

Study population Subjects with previously untreated CLL and subjects with relapsed CLL, all received ofatumumab and bendamustine (O+B). Only data from the relapsed CLL population is included in this document, they had all received at least one prior CLL therapy and the response to the last therapy lasted at least 6 months. Similar to Study OMB913, subjects had to have active disease, and those with refractory CLL were excluded. Efficacy endpoints The primary endpoint of ORR was assessed for subjects (ATS population) who received at least one dose of both study drugs (O+B). ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects achieving an objective response (i.e. PR or better) at different time points (after 3 cycles, after 6 cycles, and after the last dose, if not after 6 cycles), as per Investigator evaluation, and in accordance with the IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines.  The  primary  efficacy  evaluation  did  not  include  the  use  of  CT  scan  findings.  Response evaluations were also presented for all subjects following their last dose of O+B treatment, to represent the response rates achieved in the full ATS population.

Secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using the ATS population and Investigator assessment and included: ORR and complete response rate (CRR) with CT scan assessment. PFS, defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of the first administration of study treatment and the earlier of the date of disease progression and the date of death due to any cause. OS, defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of the first administration of study treatment and the date of death due to any cause. TTR, defined as time from date of the first administration of study treatment to the first response (CR/CRi/nPR/PR). DOR, defined as the time (in months) from the initial response (CR/CRi/nPR/PR) to the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause. TTP, defined as the time from the date of the first administration of study treatment to the progression of disease. TTNT, defined as the time from the date of the first administration of study treatment until next anti-CLL therapy. Changes in B-cell levels, improvement in ECOG performance status and in constitutional symptoms (B-symptoms), reduction in lymph node size and organomegaly, and MRD. Subgroup analyses were performed for the following subgroups: Gender, age, ethnicity, presence of constitutional symptoms and comorbidities, stage, ECOG performance status and baseline prognostic factors: Cytogenetics, IgVH mutational status, VH3-21 usage, β 2-microglobulin and ZAP-70. Updated OS data for study OMB110913; Cut off 21 December 2015. As of cut-off date of 21-Dec-2015, with approximately one year of additional follow-up, there was a modest increase in the number of deaths; an additional 7 patients died in each treatment group (Table 2-12). The median OS was not reached in the O+FC group whereas median OS in the FC group changed slightly to 46.23 months (95% CI: 37.72, NE) from 45.8 months (95% CI: 37.3, NE) (HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.10). However, the censoring rates remain high in the updated analysis, 60% vs 58% in O+FC and FC, respectively and the OS data is still immature Medicinal product no longer authorised

Results were also similar between treatment groups in the analysis of investigator-assessed time to response (approximately 2 months). Median duration of response was approximately 5 months longer with O+FC compared  with FC but the result was not statistically significant (HR=0.77, 95% CI: [0.56, 1.05], p=0.09). It is a bit unexpected that the gain in PFS is not reflected in time to response and duration of response. However, it might be due to the fact that only responders are included in time to response and duration of response. Duration of response Medicinal product no longer authorised

Data Source: [Study OMB913-Figure 12.0130] Subgroup analyses for prognostic factors The  IRC-assessed  PFS  HRs  favored  O+FC  (study  OMB  913)  in  subgroups  usually  associated  with favorable prognosis: absence of cytogenetic aberration, aberration of 6q- or +12q or 13q-, mutated IGHV, and low serum B2 microglobulin. The PFS HRs also favored O+FC in subgroups usually associated with poor prognosis: unmutated IGHV, ZAP-70 positive, elevated B2 microglobulin, 11q-, or VH3-21 usage (Figure 3-5). Due to small numbers, no conclusion could be drawn on the ORR data. In Study OMB913, subjects in O+FC arm had a median OS larger than that of subject in the FC arm irrespective  of  prognostic  factors  (except  for  subjects  with  17p-,  where  due  to  small  numbers,  no conclusion could be drawn. PFS by Baseline comorbid condition burden In Study OMB913, HRs showed an improvement in PFS (IRC-assessed) with O+FC treatment, consistent with the overall study population, in most subgroups of Baseline fitness or comorbid condition burden, with  the  exception  of  the  exploratory  analysis  of  CIRS  &gt;10  (HR=1.14;  95%  CI:  0.56,  2.32;  n=30 subjects in the O+FC arm and n=23 subjects in the FC arm); Figure 3-6). In study OMB991, the results were generally consistent.  Due to small numbers, no conclusion on ORR data was possible. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The Patient population included in the OMB110913 study had active disease and indication for treatment was based on modified IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines [Hallek, 2008]. Relapsed CLL was defined as a subject who  received at least one prior CLL therapy and previously achieved a complete or partial remission/response, but after a period of 6 or more months demonstrated evidence of disease progression [Hallek, 2008]. Patients defined as treatment failure (failure to achieve a CR or PR) or disease progression within 6 months of last anti-leukemic therapy were defined as refractory and excluded from the study. However, as also mentioned in the CHMP scientific advice 2008, the exclusion of patients who progress within  6  months  of  prior  treatment  would  be  most  valid  for  patients  receiving  FC  previously.  Patients previously treated with other regimens could have been included in the study, especially as this study does not exclude further than first relapses and therefore may recruit patients who have gone through recurrent treatments (e.g. with chlorambucil) from which they relapse earlier each time. In this respect, the limit of 6 months leads to a selected patient population, as patients relapsing earlier than 6 months probably would also achieve response of new therapy. However, in the case of chlorambucil, only the oldest and most frail patients received this treatment according to current recommendations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Binet  and  Rai's  staging  systems  were  not  used  in  the  inclusion  criteria,  however,  as  mentioned  by CHMP/SAWP, since the definitions of both staging systems differ e.g. in the Hb cut-off for anaemia, it is considered a better choice to use the definition of disease activity irrespective of stage. Even though a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relatively fit population is enrolled, overall, it can be concluded that the key inclusion and exclusion criteria accurately reflect the target patient population in this variation application of Arzerra.

The method regarding randomisation (IVRS) seems appropriate. Subjects were randomized with a block size of 2 to receive treatment arm A or B in a 1:1 ratio for the duration of the treatment period. Assignment of study drug was stratified according to two stratification factors: the number of prior CLL therapies (1 to 2 vs. ≥3) and Binet stage at Screening (A vs. B vs. C), resulting in six strata in total. However, the applicant has adequately clarified the decision of a block size of 2 and how it might have compromised the randomisation.

The applicant chose to compare the combination of ofatumumab  (O) and fludarabine (F) + cyclophosphamide (C) with the combination of FC alone.  At the time of CHMP scientific advice (2008) and study start (2009), the combination FC was considered to be acceptable comparators for the eligible patient population. However, currently it is recommended to add the CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to FC. While it obviously would have been more in accordance with current guidelines if the comparator arm had consisted of FC + rituximab, it is acknowledged that in 2008 the comparators chosen were adequate. PFS has previously been accepted by CHMP as a primary endpoint in this clinical setting. At the time of data cut-off, which was the same for both studies, all subjects in both protocols had finished treatment. In study OMB913, 65% in the O+FC arm and 56% in the FC arm had completed the treatment phase. In study OMB991, 89% respectively completed the treatment phase and the majority of subjects (91% and 81%, O+FC and FC respectively) entered the Follow-up Phase. The proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinued in the OMB913 study was 35% and 49% respectively in the O+FC and FC arm, compared to 15% in the O+B study. In both studies the primary reason for withdrawal from study treatment was AEs. The dose and regimen of ofatumumab in the two studies was based on clinical experience in prior and ongoing clinical studies as well as pharmacokinetics. The dosing regimen with one 300 mg dose the first day in the first cycle to minimize infusion reactions followed by one 1000 mg at day 8 in cycle 1, and then at each subsequent 4-week cycle, achieved steady-state plasma trough concentrations above the target level in &gt; 90% of subjects in Study OMB913. Overall, demographics and baseline characteristics (age, sex, CLL history and prognostic factors) were generally well balanced between the treatment arms in the O+FC study (OMB913).  The median age was 61 years, and 63% of the subjects were &lt; 65 years of age. The median age of the study group was thus a little younger than expected in a relapsed CLL setting. Although more than 90% of subjects in both arms had intermediate/high risk disease and Binet stage B and C, one could suspect that the patients due to a younger age were more fit. The applicant has properly justified this and it is considered not to be an issue. In the Study OMB991, subjects were older (median 68 years) than those in Study OMB913.  In the O+B study (OMB991) a higher proportion of subjects received prior rituximab (51%), prior biologic therapy (58%) and prior fludarabine-containing regimens (75%) compared to subjects in Study OMB913 where 23% received rituximab-containing therapies, and 55% prior fludarabine-containing therapies.  Subjects in the OMB991 were generally more heavily pretreated compared with those of study OMB913 and median time since diagnosis longer (6.9 years compared with 4.6 years in both O+FC and FC treatment arms. In the O+FC study (OMB913), 32% and 35% respectively in the O+FC arm and FC arm had modified Rai high risk disease (Stage III, IV). While in the supportive OMB991 study, a higher proportion of subjects (57%) had high risk modified RAI stage. Although subjects enrolled in the two studies were representative of the intended target population of relapsed CLL it raises concern, that study design, age of subjects and the fact, that enrollment of subjects to study O+B (OMB913) started 3 years earlier than the OMB991 study. The clinical practice, study design and the populations were not the same in the two studies; the CHMP therefore raised a major objection.  The  applicant  endorsed  the  objection  concerning  the  combination  of  ofatumumab  and bendamustine for the treatment of relapsed CLL in the OMB991 study and has decided to withdraw this combination from the application.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses for pivotal study OMB913

The  primary  endpoint  of  study  OMB913,  PFS,  as  assessed  by  the  IRC  (ITT  Analysis  Set),  showed  a statistically significant increase in median PFS by 10 months, with the addition of ofatumumab to FC (O+FC: 28.9  months,  FC:  18.8  months,  HR=0.67  [95%  CI:  0.51,  0.88]  p=0.0032).  Investigator  analysis  and sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary analysis. Start of alternative CLL therapy can confound the median PFS assessment, this was censored for the primary analysis. The analysis of EFS, where the start of alternative CLL therapy was considered an event, and the analysis of PFS without censoring were both consistent with the primary analysis. Exploratory subgroup analysis on IRC-assessed PFS were performed, although no multiplicity adjustments were performed, and the sample sizes were small for some analysis, a PFS  prolongation  was  reported  irrespective  of  age,  gender,  disease  stage,  prior  therapy  and  for  most prognostic factors.  Whether subjects had received prior rituximab or not, they had an equal effect from addition of ofatumumab to FC.

Shortcomings in the study design (i.e. open label, single arm, only 53 previously relapsed CLL patients) raise considerable doubt with respect to the robustness of the provided efficacy data. The adequacy of this study in supporting an indication was therefore questioned by CHMP. Absence of a comparator arm makes it challenging to decide which patients will benefit from this therapy and determine the adequate place of this combination  in  the  hierarchy  of  treatment  options  for  relapsed  CLL.  Data  to  substantiate  any  clinical relevance of the observed anti-tumour effect of the combination of ofatumumab + bendamustine are also lacking. Although the ORR was 74%, this was not supported by a CR rate of 11%, nor of OS data.  The included patient population differs from the population enrolled in the pivotal study, consequently, direct comparisons or extrapolations between these two studies are difficult to make. Due to all these concerns relating to the ofatumumab + bendamustine combination in relapsed CLL, the applicant has decided to withdraw the claim based on this study from the application.

A statistically significantly higher ORR of 84% for O+FC arm vs. 68% for the FC arm was reported, primarily due to a higher proportion of subjects achieving a CR (27% vs. 7% respectively). The PR rate was similar in the treatment arms. Responses occurred equally in both arms, with a median time to response of 1 month. MRD negativity at 3- and 6- months post-treatment was 21% and 26% respectively in the O+FC arm compared  with  8%  and  6%  respectively  in  the  FC  arm,  indicating  a  robust  and  clinically  meaningful response. The median IRC-assessed TTP was increased in the O+FC arm (42.12 months, 95%CI: 28.94, 47.67) compared with the FC arm (26.78 months, 95% CI: 22.51, 31.87) (HR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.87; p=0.0036, no multiplicity adjustment applied). Analysis of other secondary endpoints such as DOR and TTNT showed a trend in favour of O+FC. Median OS data were numerically higher in the O+FC arm, 56.4 months compared with 45.8 months for the FC arm, but not significant. Subjects are continued to be followed for survival. OS data were updated with an additional  one  year  of  follow  up  as  of  cut-off  date  of  21  Dec  2015  and  were  still  immature  and  also confounded by later lines of therapy, median OS in the O+FC group was not reached, while the median OS in the FC group changed from 45.8 months to 46.23 months (95% CI: 37.73,NE).  The estimated HR was slightly higher (changed from 0.78 to 0.79). The OS data is. However, as OS data are still not mature, the CHMP recommends that the MAH should submit the mature OS data from this study within the final CSR (see RMP). Efficacy results for supportive study OMB991 Study OMB991 investigated the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab + bendamustine (n=97). The primary endpoint  of  this  study  was  ORR.  The  efficacy  results  showed  an  ORR  of  74%,  and  a  median investigator-assessed PFS of 22.5 months. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In conclusion, for previously treated patients with relapsed CLL, the difference in PFS and ORR between the 2 arms in the pivotal study OMB913, favouring the O+FC arm, in subjects with both good - and poor risk prognostic  factors,  is  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  and  seems  robust,  although  no significant effect on overall survival could be demonstrated.  The results were supported by the secondary endpoints and delay of time to progression and post-treatment anti-CLL therapy, which seems clinically meaningful in a disease with a relentless pattern of relapses. The efficacy results have been reflected in the SmPC.

In the study OMB991 combining ofatumumab and bendamustine, the benefit of ORR stands alone, there were several critical issues and the data seemed not robust for an approval. The applicant has therefore decided to withdraw the claim for this combination for the treatment of relapsed CLL. 2.5. Clinical safety Introduction In this submission, safety data from two clinical studies (the phase III registration study OMB110913 and the supportive phase II study OMB115991) in subjects with relapsed CLL are presented, data were pooled in order to characterize the safety profile of ofatumumab combination therapy. All safety summaries and analyses were performed using the safety population, defined as subjects who received at least one dose of study drug, in accordance with the study-specific statistical analysis plan (SAP) as documented within the CSR.

Patient exposure Of the 412 subjects randomized, 234 subjects received ofatumumab in combination with chemotherapy (FC or  bendamustine),  and  178  subjects  received  FC.  In  the  O+FC  group,  90%  received  3  to  6  cycles  of treatment and 92% in the O+B group. In both the O+FC and O+B groups, the dose of ofatumumab received was close to the planned dose, with a median dose received equal to 100% of the planned dose during each cycle. The median dose of ofatumumab in the O+Chemo group was 1300 mg for Cycle 1 (300 mg initial dose and 1000 mg subsequent dose for Cycle 1) and 1000 mg for all subsequent cycles.

## Adverse events

## Table 46 Adverse Event Overview

| authorised   |
|--------------|

The most common AEs were consistent with wellknown AEs related to chemotherapy and ofatumumab, and included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and anaemia (reported by ≥15% of subjects in either arm) (Table 38). Neutropenia was reported more frequently in the O+FC arm (O+FC: 55%, FC: 38%); while thrombocytopenia and anaemia were reported more frequently in the FC arm (O+FC: 20%, FC: 31%) and (O+FC: 13%, FC: 24%) respectively. Nausea was reported equally in both treatment arms (19%). AEs related to infusion reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria, pyrexia/chills, pruritus, dyspnea, hypotension, and flushing) were more frequently reported in the O+FC arm.

Adverse events The majority of subjects had 1 or more AEs, with a higher incidence of subjects in the O+FC arm compared with the FC arm. A higher proportion of subjects in the O+FC arm had AEs that were Grade ≥ 3,  related  to  study  treatment,  or  to  an  infusion  interruption/delay.  The  proportion  of  subjects  who discontinued due to AEs was similar in both treatment arms (Table 36). The proportion of subjects with fatal SAEs and deaths, was similar between treatment arms, although subjects in the O+FC arm had more SAEs than those in the FC arm.

## Adverse Events Leading to Dose Delay, Dose Reduction, or Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug

AEs leading to dose interruptions/delays were reported more frequently in the O+FC arm (55%) than the FC arm (22%), whereas the incidence of AEs leading to dose reduction was lower and similar in both arms (Table 50). With the exception of neutropenia, the AEs that led to dose delays, interruptions, or reductions in the O+FC arm were events typically associated with infusion reactions, few of which led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Haematologic events were the most common type of AE leading to discontinuation of study treatment and the proportion of subjects who discontinued due to AEs was similar in both treatment arms.

Fatal Serious Adverse Events The incidence of fatal serious AE was similar between treatment arms, the most frequently reported fatal SAEs being infections SOC (Table 47) especially pneumonia. Fatal SAEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator were reported in a similar proportion of subjects in both treatment arms (O+FC: 6%, FC: 5%).

## Adverse events leading to dose interruption/delay or adjustment

The  incidence  of  AEs  requiring  dose  interruption  or  delay  was  lower  in  the  FC  group  compared  to O+Chemo group (22% in FC vs. 58% in O+Chemo), primarily due to a higher incidence of neutropenia and AEs associated with infusion reactions (including rash, pruritus, and chills) in the O+Chemo group (Table 56, and under discontinuation).

The incidence of AEs leading to dose reductions was lower in the FC group compared to O+Chemo group (18% in FC vs. 26% in O+Chemo), primarily due to a higher incidence of neutropenia in the O+Chemo group. Table 57: Summary of adverse events leading to dose reductions by preferred term in at least 2% subjects (Safety Population) Adverse Events of Special Interest and of Clinical Significance AEs of special interests are cytopenias (including autoimmune haematologic complications), infusion reactions, infections, mucocutaneous reactions, and tumour lysis syndrome. Other clinically important AEs of special interests are cardiovascular events, neoplasms, liver events, and small bowel obstructions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cytopenias

The incidence of AEs associated with decreased neutrophil counts was higher in the O+FC arm (64%) than in the FC arm (48%) as were the incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia. The proportions of subjects with neutropenia SAEs were similar between the treatment arms (Table 48). The incidence of neutropenic sepsis was low (2%) in both treatment arms as were fatal SAEs of febrile neutropenia (1% in both treatment arms. Overall, the incidence of study drug discontinuations due to neutropenia AEs were low (8%), with a higher proportion of subjects discontinuing treatment due to neutropenia in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

O+FC arm (10%) compared with the FC arm (4%).

A higher incidence of overall and drug-related events was reported in the O+FC arm compared with the FC  arm  (Table  53).  This  higher  incidence  overall  was  influenced  by  a  greater  number  of  cases  of leukopenia in the O+FC arm than in the FC arm. The incidence of other cytopenia-related SAEs was low in both treatment arms.

The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs associated with decreased haemoglobin count was lower in the O+FC arm (25% and 20%, respectively) compared with the FC arm (35% and 30%, respectively). There was no significant  difference  between  treatment  arms  with  regard  to  incidence  of  SAEs  and treatment related SAEs.

|-------------|

The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs associated with platelet count decreases was lower in the O+FC arm (31% and 28%, respectively) compared with the FC arm (40% and 35%, respectively). No difference was noted between treatment arms with regard to incidence of SAEs and treatment related SAEs  or  proportion  of  subjects  who  permanently  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AEs  of thrombocytopenia. Autoimmune Haematologic Complications is a common complication to subjects having CLL. However, no  significant  difference  between  the  treatment  arms  with  regard  to  autoimmune  haematologic complications was reported. · Infusion Reactions (IR) Infusion reactions were defined as reactions that occurred after the start time of infusion and within 24hours of infusion end, and resulted in a temporary interruption or prolongation of infusion time or treatment  withdrawal.  A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  O+FC  arm  (60%)  reported  an infusion-related  AE  compared  with  subjects  in  the  FC  arm  (28%).  Infusion-related  AEs  primarily occurred between 1 and 2 hours post-infusion on the first day of infusion during Cycles 1 and 2, and numbers of  subjects  with  IRs  declined  over  the  course  of  the  treatment  period.  IRs  were  mild  to moderate in severity. Few infusion-related AEs led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment and none of them were fatal. The type of IR is noted in table 58, nausea and rash were the most common IRs.

The proportion of subjects having infectious AEs during the study was 46% and 49% respectively in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

O+FC arm and the FC arm, with 29% of subjects in both treatment arms having events that were Grade ≥ 3. In total, 20% of subjects (O+FC: 23%, FC: 17%) had infections related to treatment, with only 4% leading to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Serious infectious AEs were reported in a similar proportion of subjects in both treatment arms. In total, 34 subjects (9%) had fatal infections with 9 subjects (3%) having fatal infections related to study treatment. The proportion of subjects with fatal infections was 8% in the O+FC arm, compared with 11% in the FC arm. Fatal infections that were considered related to study treatment were similar between treatment arms.

Incidences of serious infections were similar between treatment arms, with respiratory tract infections being the most frequently reported SAE in both O+FC and FC subjects (Table 59).

Table 59 Serious Infections Reported as Adverse Events Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy No cases of PML was reported in this study. Hepatitis B Infection and Reactivation Two cases of HBV infection were reported, 1 in each treatment arm, and 1 case of HBV reactivation in the O+FC arm. · Mucocutaneous Reactions Mucocutaneous reactions included a variety of events affecting mucous membranes and skin, many of which overlapped with infusion reactions (Table 62). In total 24% (87/359 subjects) had AEs identified as mucocutaneous reactions. The incidence was higher in the O+FC arm (33%) compared with the FC arm (15%). Treatment-related mucocutaneous reactions were reported in 26% of subjects in the O+FC arm and 7% of subjects in the FC arm. The incidence of serious mucocutaneous reactions was low, and similar  between  treatment  arms  (Table  60).  Only  1  subject  in  the  O+FC  arm  discontinued  study treatment due to mucocutaneous reactions. No cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or fatal events were reported in the study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

· Tumour Lysis Syndrome Tumour lysis syndrome AEs were reported in 1 subject in the O+FC arm and 1 subject in the FC arm. · Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular AEs were reported in 36 subjects (10%) during the study. These AEs and SAEs were 8% and 4% respectively in the O+FC arm compared with 12% and 8% in the FC arm. In 2% (4 subjects) in the O+FC arm and 3% (6 subjects) in the FC arm, the SAEs were fatal. Three cardiovascular SAEs were considered related to study treatment, they were all in the FC arm. · Neoplasms The incidence of second malignancies/neoplasms during the study was low and higher in the O+FC arm compared with the FC arm (O+FC: 15 subjects [8%], FC: 5 subjects [3%]). All events were reported as SAEs.  In  both  treatment  arms,  the  most  frequently  reported  event  was  myelodysplastic  syndrome (O+FC: 3 subjects [2%], FC: 2 subjects [1%]). All remaining events such as acute myeloid leukaemia, colon adenocarcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma etc., were reported in 1 subject each, · Liver Events and Bowel Obstruction Per protocol, liver stopping criteria were defined for subjects in either treatment arm while on-treatment as meeting 1 or more of the following conditions: · Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;2 times ULN (&gt;35% direct bilirubin; bilirubin fractionation required [when available]), · ALT &gt;8 times ULN, and/or · ALT &gt;5 times ULN for more than 2 weeks. In total, 8 subjects (O+FC: 5 subjects, FC: 3 subjects) met liver stopping criteria during the study. Half of these subjects had an event while still receiving study treatment. One subject in each treatment arm reported a non-serious liver event as an AE. In the O+FC arm, the bilirubin increased together with hepatitis B reactivation, and in the FC arm, ALT increased.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematologic Assessment of Myelosuppression

Decreases in neutrophils, haemoglobin, or platelets from Baseline values occurred in similar proportions of subjects in both treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Haemoglobin and platelet worst-case shifts from Baseline to any grade were similar between treatment arms, with no shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4. The proportion of subjects with neutrophil worst-case shifts from Baseline to any grade was similar (O+FC: 90%, FC: 91%) in both treatment arms; neutrophil shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 were also similar between arms. A higher proportion of subjects in the O+FC arm (94%) had decreased leukocytes compared with the FC arm (76%), including events that were Grade 3 or Grade 4 in severity (O+FC: 70%, FC: 43%).

Overall, 50% of subjects received blood supportive care products after the start of study treatment, including a higher proportion of subjects in the O+FC arm (59%) compared with the FC arm (40%). Of the  subjects  who  received  blood  supportive  care  products,  48%  (O+FC:  56%,  FC:  40%)  received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and 6% (O+FC: 7%, FC: 5%) received erythropoietin. The median time to first dose of growth factors was 32.5 days (range: 2 to 173 days) in the O+FC arm and 30.0 days (range: 3 to 164 days) in the FC arm.

<!-- image -->

Neutrophils Median neutrophil counts at Baseline were similar between treatment arms (Figure 12). Neutrophil counts decreased during Cycle 1 and remained within a similar range in both treatment arms throughout the study. Prolonged Neutropenia Prolonged and severe neutropenia has been reported with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment and was therefore analyzed in the study using the definition of ' Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia that occurred while the subject was on study treatment and did not resolve within 42 days after the last dose of study treatment. Prolonged neutropenia occurred in 38 subjects (11%) (O+FC: 18 subjects [10%], FC: 20 subjects [11%]). The median time to first prolonged neutropenia was 70.5 days (range: 7 to 148 days) in the O+FC arm compared with 71.0 days (range: 8 to 162 days) in the FC arm. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Time to recovery from prolonged neutropenia was defined as the time from the first time point when the absolute neutrophil count was &lt;1000 cells/mm3 to the time point when it returned to ≥1500 cells/mm3. Thirteen of the 18 subjects with prolonged neutropenia in the O+FC arm recovered, with a median time to recovery of 253.0 days (range: 70 to 568 days). In the FC arm, 11 of 20 subjects recovered with a median time to recovery of 162.0 days (range: 91 to 323 days).

## Late Onset Neutropenia

Although  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibodies  usually  are  well  tolerated  and  have  an  acceptable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haematological toxicity, certain delayed adverse effects have been noted. One of these is late onset neutropenia, defined as 'Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia starting at least 42 days after the last treatment dose'.  In this study, 13 subjects (7%) in the O+FC arm and 5 subjects (3%) in the FC arm had events that  met  these  criteria.  The  median  time  since  last  dose  of  study  drug  to  the  event  of  late  onset neutropenia for O+FC subjects was 113.0 days (range: 75 to 771 days) and 91.0 days (range: 47 to 833 days) for FC subjects.

## Haemoglobin

Median haemoglobin counts were similar between the treatment arms at Baseline, but increased in the O+FC arm to levels greater than the FC arm from Cycle 2 to the end of treatment. Haemoglobin counts were similar between treatment arms during follow-up.

<!-- image -->

Most clinical chemistry parameters had worst-case shifts from Baseline to any grade that were similar between treatment arms. Most of the shifts were to Grade 1 or Grade 2, with few shifts occurring to Grade 3 or Grade 4 values. A higher proportion of subjects in the O+FC arm (38%) had ALT shifts to any grade compared with the FC arm (31%). Few subjects in either treatment arm had shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 in any parameter. Bilirubin shifts from Baseline to any grade were similar between treatment arms and included few increases to Grade 3 or Grade 4.

Platelets Median platelet counts were slightly higher in the O+FC arm compared with the FC arm at Baseline, and counts remained higher in subjects receiving O+FC compared with FC throughout treatment and during follow-up (Figure 14). Biochemistry Assessments The effects of O+FC treatment on clinical chemistry parameters were analyzed, and the majority of subjects did not experience abnormal chemistry values during the study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In both treatment arms, the majority of post-baseline shifts in serum chemistry parameters were to a maximum severity of Grade 1 (mild). Shifts to Grade 3 involved high glucose values, liver chemistry parameters (ALT, AST, bilirubin), or electrolytes (sodium, potassium) in subjects in both treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the O+FC arm, post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 (severe) occurred for a small number of subjects for parameters of ALT, AST, glucose, calcium, and creatinine kinase. In the FC arm, post-baseline shifts to Grade 4 occurred only for calcium and potassium, each reported for 1 subject.

## Immunoglobulins/immunogenicity

IgG levels were similar in both treatment arms at Baseline, 1-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. The current clinical data from studies OMB913 and OMB991 are consistent with immunogenicity data reported in previous submissions.

## Safety in special populations

No studies have been conducted in special subject populations in support of this application. 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety The safety profile of ofatumumab as single-agent and in combination has been well characterised in previous trials and in the original marketing application. Clinical safety data is available from a total of 234 subjects from the supportive and the main study who received  ofatumumab  (O)  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  All  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose ofatumumab. The majority of patients (n=181) were enrolled in the main study and had the combination ofatumumab+fludarabine +cyclophosphamide (O+FC). The number of patients in the supportive study that received ofatumumab+bendamustine (O+B), were limited (n=53), however the number of pooled patients were sufficient to evaluate the safety aspects of ofatumumab in combination with F+C or B. The supportive study was an open- label, single arm Phase II study with limited number of relapsed CLL patients and the efficacy  and  safety  of  the  combination  ofatumumab  with  bendamustine  is  not  considered  sufficiently documented.  In  their  Day  60  response,  the  MAH  decided  to  withdraw  the  application  regarding  the combination of ofatumumab with bendamustine. The unresolved issues associated with study OMB991 is therefore no longer valid. The combined analysis of safety data from Study OMB913 and Study OMB991 demonstrated an acceptable and manageable safety profile and most subjects were able to receive the planned dose/cycles. No new safety signals were reported, and the safety data were consistent with the known safety profile previously established in the approved indications. The adverse events for ofatumumab + FC arm were combined with the ofatumumab +bendamustine arm, O+Chemo, since the AEs in the two groups were similar. The combination regimens with chemotherapy (FC or bendamustine) did not reveal any new or unexpected AEs or SAEs, and included subjects with demographic and prognostic factors typical of subjects with relapsed CLL, including subjects with advanced age and multiple comorbid conditions. The most common AEs in the O+Chemo group were related to infusion reactions (i.e.  nausea, rash, pyrexia, pruritus), and cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia). Monoclonal antibodies has been associated  with  a  risk  of  infusion-related  reactions,  however  in  this  study,  they  were    mostly  mild  to moderate in severity with 8% subjects exhibiting reactions of grade 3 or higher. No fatal infusion related reactions were reported with the addition of ofatumumab. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the pivotal study (OMB110913) in relapsed CLL patients, prolonged neutropenia was reported in 38 (11%) patients (18 patients [10%] treated with ofatumumab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide compared to 20 patients [11%] in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide arm). Thirteen (7%) patients treated with ofatumumab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and 5 (3%) patients treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide had late onset neutropenia. This information is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of neutropenia (all grades and grade ≥ 3) was higher in the O+Chemo arm than the FC arm, but this was not associated with an increased risk of infections. In the O+Chemo group, SAE were reported for 56% of the subjects, and 23% had an AE leading to discontinuation. Fatal SAEs were reported in 18% of subjects, and for 6% of subjects, the fatal SAE was considered related to study treatment. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 AE, treatment-related SAEs, and fatal SAEs (including treatment-related fatal SAEs) were similar between the O+Chemo and FC groups.

The incidence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia were slightly less frequent in the O+Chemo arm than in the FC arm, indicating that ofatumumab did not worsen the myelosuppression.

Comparison of the O+Chemo with the FC arm, showed that a higher proportion of subjects in the O+Chemo arm had AEs that required infusion interruption/delay. The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation in the O+Chemo group was AE (24%) especially due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. AEs of special interest were identified and analyzed based on data from previous ofatumumab studies and events  observed  with  other  anti-CD20  mAbs.  Increased  neutropenia  is  well  described  for  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Incidences of grade ≥3 neutropenia and grade ≥3 infection in the O+Chemo group were comparable with those reported in the FCR (Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) group. The overall incidence of death was slightly lower in O+Chemo group compared to FC group (37% vs. 39%) and half of the deaths in both the groups were due to the disease under study. Of the 86 subjects (37%) in the O+Chemo group who died, the majority (77 subjects, 33%) died more than 60 days after last dosing, and only 4 subjects (2%) died while on treatment (i.e. within 30 days of last dose). Only one subject (in the O+FC arm) had a positive HAHA, at a single time point following treatment with ofatumumab. The presence of HAHA had no effect on safety, pharmacokinetics, or pharmacodynamics of ofatumumab. 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety In conclusion, ofatumumab in combination with chemotherapy with FC was generally well tolerated with no unexpected AEs or SAEs in subjects with relapsed CLL suggesting a safety profile consistent with previous knowledge of ofatumumab. Adverse events were all manageable. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly. The final CSR of study 913 will be provided (see RMP). 2.5.3. PSUR cycle The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.7. Update of the Product information As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 2.7.1. User consultation N/A 3. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Beneficial effects The study OMB913 demonstrated that addition of ofatumumab to FC resulted in  an improvement of 10.1 months in IRC-assessed PFS, with a median PFS of 28.9 months in the O+FC arm compared with 18.8 months in the FC arm (HR of 0.67, 95% CI (0.51, 0.88) stratified log-rank p = 0.0032). Investigator assessed analyses were consistent, and sensitivity analysis of PFS confirmed the primary analysis, thus the study met its primary endpoint. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Analyses of secondary endpoints were supportive, indicating a benefit of adding ofatumumab to FC. An improvement of IRC-assessed ORR in the O+FC arm was reported, 84%, compared with 68%in the FC, primarily due to a higher proportion of subjects achieving CR ( 27% vs. 7% respectively for the O+FC arm vs. the FC arm).

The median IRC-assessed time to progression (TTP) was improved with 15 months in the O+FC arm, (42.12 months compared with 26.78 months in the FC arm, (p=0.0036). Analysis of event free survival (EFS) also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

showed an improvement 10 months in the  O+FC  arm  (27.2  months  vs.16.5  months  for  the  FC  arm, p=0.0012).

Although numbers were small, the IRC-assessed MRD negativity at 3 - and 6 - months post-treatment were 21% and 26% respectively in the O+FC arm compared with 8% and 6% in the FC arm, indicating a clinically meaningful response.

B cell depletion versus tumour response: 39% (O+FC) vs. 4% (FC) for responders demonstrated complete B cell depletion. Median number of CLL cells/μL was 1 vs. 64 (at 1-month follow-up).

Consistent benefit in PFS with O+FC was demonstrated across subgroup analysis, although some were performed with small populations, for patients who had previously received 1-2 prior anti-CLL therapies, high  risk  RAI  stage,  un-mutated  IGVH  and  ZAP70  pos.  subjects.  Whether  subjects  had  received  prior rituximab containing therapy or not, they had an equal effect from addition of ofatumumab to FC.

No difference was observed in the incidence of treatment-related SAEs between the treatment groups, 31% in  the  O+Chemo  group  vs.  29%  in  the  FC  group.  The  incidence  of  fatal  AEs,  overall  as  well  as treatment-related, and the incidence of deaths was similar in the two groups. However the incidence of death was higher in patients ≥65, ≥75 vs. age &lt; 65 years. For 6% (n=13) in the O + Chemo group, the fatal events were considered treatment-related.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects In study OMB913 a numerical trend for benefit in terms of OS was reported with an 11 months prolongation in median OS, median OS was 56.4 months and 45.8 months respectively for the O+FC arm and the FC arm, however the difference did not reach statistical significance. The MAH will provide the final CSR from study 913 which will include mature data on OS (see RMP). Risks Unfavourable effects Data from the pivotal study OMB913 was presented together with data from the supportive study OMB991. O+Chemo results comprised both O+FC and O+B data. 94% in the O+Chemo group had at least one AE, compared with 86% in the FC group. The most common AEs were related to infusion-reactions, most were mild to moderate, and no fatal infusion related reactions were reported with the addition of ofatumumab. The incidence of grade ≥3AEs was slightly higher in the subgroups of patients ≥ 65 years and lower in the FC arm, compared with the O+FC arm. The most frequent ≥ Grade 3AEs in the O+FC arm was neutropenia, 51% compared with 37% in the FC arm. However, this did not affect the incidence of infections, which was similar in the O+FC and the FC arms, (46% vs 49%). No difference in incidence of serious infections or fatal serious infections was reported between the two treatment arms. The incidence of AEs leading to infusion interruption/delay was higher in the O+FC arm (55% vs. 22%) or ≥ Grade  3  (80%  vs.  72%)  compared  to  the  FC  arm,  however  this  did  not  lead  to  a  higher  permanent discontinuation of treatment. The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation in the O+Chemo group was AE (24%) especially due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Interestingly the proportion of subjects who withdrew from the study was higher in the FC group (29%) than the O+Chemo group (13%), primarily due to higher proportion of subjects voluntarily withdrawing from the study in the FC group (21%) compared to O+Chemo group (8%).

The  safety  profile  of  ofatumumab  in  both  combinations  is  consistent  with  the  well-known  profile  of ofatumumab from previous approved indications, as well as the safety profiles of FC and bendamustine.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No new or unexpected safety events were reported in these studies.

Benefit-Risk Balance Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects The addition of ofatumumab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide demonstrated in the pivotal study OMB913 a statistically significant improvement of PFS and ORR when compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Although no significant improvement was reported on OS, these data are robust and clinically meaningful. The efficacy of the combination of ofatumumab and bendamustine in the supportive study is less clear. Although a benefit on ORR was reported, only few subjects achieved CR, data were not supported by other endpoints, further the study revealed some weaknesses, with no control arm, no IRC confirmation of data and the inclusion of few subjects. However, the MAH decided to withdraw the application regarding the combination of ofatumumab with bendamustine and the unresolved issues associated with study OMB991 is therefore no longer valid. No new safety signals for ofatumumab were reported in these studies, AEs were as expected in this clinical setting with relapsed CLL treated with a combination of a monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy. Benefit-risk balance Based on the above discussion, the B/R balance in the indication: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Arzerra is indicated in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed CLL.

is considered positive

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Since CLL is a chronic, incurable disease with a history of recurrent relapses, and patients being refractory to  previous  treatment,  there  is  a  need  for  treatment  options  to  these  patients.  The  combination  of ofatumumab  and  FC  demonstrated  a  robust,  clinically  meaningful  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS,  which  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

supported by other secondary endpoints. AEs were as expected and manageable. The O+FC combination thus represents an alternative to relapse treatment in CLL.
