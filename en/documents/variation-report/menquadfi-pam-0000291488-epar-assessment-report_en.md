## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

Study MEQ00075 is a Phase I, open-label, age de-escalation study conducted in China (1 centre [1 satellite site of 1 main site]), to describe the safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (MenQuadfi) and two locally licensed meningococcal vaccines (i.e., Green Bamboo's and Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccines) in adolescents, children, toddlers and infants aged 3 months to 17 years.

MEQ00075 was conducted from 12 August 2023 (first participant first visit) to 22 October 2024 (last participant last contact). Last participant last visit was 25 May 2024.

Database lock for the provided CSR (Final Report Version 1.0, dated 1 July 2025) was 13 March 2025.

## Methods

## Study design

Approximately 300 healthy adolescents, children, toddlers, and infants were planned to be assigned into 1 of 5 cohorts (Cohorts I to V) and randomised 1:1 to the following 10 groups within those cohorts as follows:

Cohort I (adolescents aged 7 to 17 years, 1 vaccination)

- Group 1 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)
- Group 2 (Green Bamboo's MenAC conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)

Cohort II (children aged 2 to 6 years, 1 vaccination)

- Group 3 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)
- Group 4 (Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)

Cohort III (toddlers aged 12 to 23 months, 1 vaccination)

- Group 5 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)
- Group 6 (Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)

Cohort IV (infants aged 6 to 11 months, 2 vaccinations)

- Group 7 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)
- Group 8 (Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cohort V (infants aged 3 to 5 months, 3 vaccinations)

- Group 9 (MenACYW conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)
- Group 10 (Green Bamboo's MenAC conjugate vaccine; 30 participants)

## Blood sampling:

All participants were to provide a total of 2 blood samples for immunogenicity assessment. The first blood sample was to be provided at baseline (pre-vaccination) and the second blood sample was to be provided at 30 to 37 days post the last vaccination.

* At the discretion of the participant/parent(s)legally acceptable representative(s), an additional dose of Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccine was offered by the Sponsor to participants in Group 6 after the study procedure on the last visit of blood sampling (Visit 2), to comply with product's approved vaccination schedule. This second dose of Royal's vaccine was not part of the study assessment and needs to be administered at least 31 days after the study vaccination (first dose).

## Collection of safety data:

Safety data were to be collected as follows: Immediate adverse event (AE) information was to be collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination; solicited AE information was to be collected for 7 days after each vaccination; unsolicited AE information was to be collected for 30 days after each vaccination; serious adverse event (SAE) information was to be collected throughout the duration of the study.

Of note, adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were not to be collected in Study MEQ00075. However, if events that were collected as AESIs in past clinical trials occur, including generalized seizures (febrile or non-febrile), Kawasaki disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, they were to be reported as SAEs throughout the trial.

## Study participants

As per Protocol version 4.0 dated 10 Jan 2024:

a  At the discretion of the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s), an additional dose of Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccine was to be offered by the Sponsor to participants in Group 6 after the study procedure on the last visit of blood sampling, to comply with product's approved vaccination schedule. This second dose of Royal's vaccine was not part of the study assessment and needs to be administered at least 31 days after the study vaccination (first dose).

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary

## Safety

The following endpoints will be used for the evaluation of safety:

- Presence of any unsolicited systemic AEs reported in the 30 minutes after each and any study vaccination.
- Presence of solicited injection site reactions (pre-listed in the participant's DC and CRF) up to 7 days after each and any study vaccination.
- Presence of solicited systemic reactions (pre-listed in the participant's DC and CRF) up to 7 days after each and any study vaccination.
- Presence of unsolicited AEs up to 30 days after each and any study vaccination.
- Presence of SAEs, throughout the trial, i.e., from Visit 1 (first vaccination) to 6 months after the last study vaccination.

Depending on the items, the endpoints recorded or derived could include: nature (MedDRA preferred term), time of onset, duration/number of days of occurrence, intensity, relationship to the study vaccine, whether the AE led to early termination from the study, outcome, and seriousness criterion.

## Statistical Analyses

## Primary Endpoint

No statistical hypothesis will be tested.

Safety results will be described for participants in all vaccine groups after each and any study vaccination during the reported periods. The main parameters for the safety endpoints will be described by 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on exact Clopper-Pearson method.

Safety analysis will include but is not limited to:

- The number and percentage of participants reporting any immediate unsolicited systemic AEs occurring within 30 minutes after study vaccination by study group.
- The number and percentage of participants reporting any solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions occurring within 7 days after study vaccination by study group for intensity, time of onset, days of occurrence and action taken.
- The number and percentage of participants reporting any unsolicited non-serious AE occurring up to 30 days after study vaccination by study group, by intensity, time of onset, duration and by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), as well as by relationship to the study vaccine.
- The number and percentage of participants reporting an AE leading to study discontinuation by study group, within 30 days after study vaccination, respectively.
- The number and percentage of participants reporting at least one SAEs by study group, seriousness criterion, outcome and by MedDRA SOC and PT, as well as by relationship to the study vaccine.

Adverse events and SAEs will be also described according to the relationship status to the vaccine (adverse event related to the vaccination/ adverse event not related to the vaccination).

The SafAS will be used for safety analysis. Specific SafAS will be used after each study vaccination. All participants will have their safety data analysed after each study vaccination according to the vaccine they actually received, and after any study vaccination according to the first vaccine that they have received.

Safety data recorded for a vaccine received out of the protocol design will be excluded from the analysis (and listed separately).

## Secondary Endpoints

No statistical hypothesis will be tested.

Descriptive analyses on immunogenicity endpoints of A, C, Y and W serogroups (for participants in Groups 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) or A and C serogroups (for participants in Groups 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) measured using rSBA providing a blood sample at corresponding time points will include but not be limited to:

- GMT and 95% CI.
- Geometric mean of individual titre ratio (post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination) and 95% CI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Percentage of participants with rSBA vaccine seroresponse defined as rSBA titre s ≥1:8 at 30 days post-vaccination for participants with pre-vaccination rSBA titres &lt;1:8, or at least 4-fold increase in rSBA titres from pre- to 30 days post-vaccination for participants with prevaccination rSBA titre s ≥1:8 and 95% CI .
- Percentage of participants with titre ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 and 95% CI .
- Titre distribution and reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs).

In general, the 95% CIs of point estimates will be calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data assuming they are log-normally distributed, and the Clopper-Pearson method based on the exact binomial distribution for percentages.

The rSBA geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) and difference in the vaccine seroresponse rates between investigational MenACYW conjugate vaccine and local vaccine for serogroups A and C in each age group will be calculated and their 95% CIs will be provided. The CIs of GMTRs will be calculated using the log10 transformed titres for the difference and then antilog transformations will be applied to the results of the calculation to provide the results in terms of GMTs. The CIs of the difference in the seroresponse rates will be computed using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction. These comparisons are descriptive.

Immunogenicity analysis will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS) and the per-protocol analysis set (PPAS). All participants will be analysed according to the vaccine group to which they were randomised.

## Interim Analyses

The statistical analysis will be performed in 2 steps:

- The first statistical analysis will be done once all participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 have completed the 6-month follow-up, and all safety and immunogenicity data are available.
- The final statistical analysis will be done once all participants in Cohorts 3, 4 and 5 have completed the 6-month follow-up, and all safety and immunogenicity data are available. In the final statistical analysis, all cohorts will be included.

No statistical adjustment is necessary for these analyses because no hypotheses will be tested. In addition, this study will include 4 early safety data reviews.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Design and conduct

It is noted that the study report of this paediatric study (MEQ00075) was not submitted within 6 months after study completion as required with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, since the last contact of the last participant was on 22 October 2024, according to the CSR. It is also unclear why the database lock (dated 13 March 2025) was approximately 6 months after the last contact with the last participant, albeit the 6-month follow-up period was already included in the study period (12 August 2023 to 22 October 2024). However, given the negligible impact of this study on the overall benefit-risk balance of MenQuadfi, no issue is made.

Study MEQ00075 was a Phase I, randomised, open-label, age de-escalation study conducted in a single centre in China and intended to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi and two locally licensed meningococcal serogroups A and C vaccines (i.e., Green Bamboo's MenAC conjugate vaccine and Royal's MenAC conjugate vaccine) in approximately 300 healthy adolescents, children, toddlers, and infants, aged 3 months to 17 years. The participants were assigned to 1 of 5 cohorts (Cohorts I to V), depending on their age, and randomised 1:1 to receive either MenQuadfi (MenACYW conjugate vaccine) or one of the locally licensed meningococcal vaccines resulting in totally 10 groups with 30 participants each: Cohort I (aged 7 to 17 years, 1 vaccination, Group 1 MenQuadfi, Group 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Green Bamboo's), Cohort II (aged 2 to 6 years, 1 vaccination, Group 3 MenQuadfi, Group 4 Royal's), Cohort III (aged 12 to 23 months, 1 vaccination, Group 5 MenQuadfi, Group 6 Royal's), Cohort IV (aged 6 to 11 months, 2 vaccinations, Group 7 MenQuadfi, Group 8 Royal's), Cohort V (aged 3 to 5 neither of the aforementioned applied comparator vaccines is authorised in the EU.

At least 1 major protocol deviation was reported for 55 subjects (18.3 %): 2 (6.7%) participants in Group 1, 4 (13.3%) in Group 2, 5 (16.7%) in Group 3, 1 (3.3%) in Group 4, 0 in Group 5, 3 (10.0%) in Group 6, 6 (20.0%) in Group 7, 9 (30.0%) in Group 8, 12 (40.0%) in Group 9, and 13 (43.3%) in Group 10. The most frequently reported major protocol deviations were 'IMP administered but not physical visit, phone call or safety contact not performed within the protocol-specified time window', which was reported for 25 (8.3%) participants. This is all not considered concerning, considering that such deviations are expected in trials including the paediatric population. Male/female ratio varied to some extent but only in considerable extent for Cohort I, in which the male/female ratio of Group 1 was 0.36 and Group 2 was 0.76.

months, 3 vaccinations, Group 9 MenQuadfi, Group 10 Green Bamboo's). In this regard it is noted that Different dose regimens/vaccination schedules were investigated, depending on the age of the subjects at enrolment and thus their respective cohort. Cohorts I, II, and III, which included participants above 12 months of age received one vaccination at Visit 1, which is in accordance with the currently approved posology of MenQuadfi in the EU (1 single dose for primary vaccination + 1 single dose for booster vaccination for individuals aged 12 months and older). Cohort IV, which included subjects aged 6 to 11 months, received 2 vaccinations (at Visit 1 and Visit 2, 1 month apart). Cohort V, which included subjects aged 3 to 5 months, received 3 vaccinations (at Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3, 1 month apart respectively). MenQuadfi is authorised for individuals aged 12 months and older; a type II variation procedure to extend the indication to individuals aged 6 weeks to below 12 months is currently ongoing. Consequently, there is no approved posology for individuals below the age of 12 months for MenQuadfi at the moment. In total, 300 subjects were randomised, with 30 subjects in each of the 10 groups. Eligibility criteria seemed overall acceptable. Participants had to be either naïve as regards meningococcal vaccination (Cohort V, aged 3 to 5 months), or had received only the Group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPV-A) included in National Immunization Program (NIP) within 6 months prior to study participation (Cohorts III and IV, aged 6 to 23 months), or had received the last meningococcal vaccination more than 2 years prior to study participation (Cohorts I and II, aged 2 to 17 years). Vaccination with other vaccines (e.g., routine paediatric vaccines, influenza vaccine, and COVID-19 vaccine) was allowed if not 4 weeks before or after receipt of trial vaccination for Cohort I and II or 2 weeks before and after receipt of trial vaccination for Cohort III, IV, and V. Apparently, immunogenicity of non-meningococcal vaccines was not evaluated. within the protocol-specified time window', which was reported for 28 (9.3%) participants, and 'Study

Data was analysed descriptively. The primary objective and endpoint aimed at the evaluation of safety. Secondary objectives and endpoints evaluated immunogenicity by measuring rSBA (rabbit complement serum bactericidal assay) antibody titres against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W, which were expressed as seroresponse (defined as 30 days post vaccination rSBA titre s ≥1:8 for participants with pre vaccination rSBA titres &lt;1:8, or at least 4-fold increase in rSBA titres from pre to 30 days post vaccination for participants with pre vaccination rSBA titre s ≥1:8 ), Geometric mean titres (GMT) or percentages of subjects with rSBA antibody titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 . Application of only rSBA, instead of hSBA, or both, is not considered optimal as analyses based on hSBA titres are better established as correlate of protection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As regards sample size, the number of participants in each group was not hypothesis driven and no formal sample size calculations were performed. All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), defined as the participants who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine and had a valid post-vaccination serology result, and the per-protocol analysis set (PPAS), a subset of the FAS excluding participants with relevant protocol deviations. Safety was analysed using the Safety Analysis Set for Any Dose (SafAS), which included participants who have received at least one dose of the study vaccine and have any safety data available, and additionally, SafAS1, SafAS2, and SafAS3, each including participants who have received at least one dose of the study vaccine at Visit 1, 2, or 3, respectively, and have any safety data available.

## Immunogenicity data analyses

## Comparative data

Comparative immunogenicity data are only available for serogroups A and C, as a result of the application of comparators that include only these serogroups.

## Cohort I (7-17 yoa, single dose, comparator Green Bamboo's)

In Cohort I, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 31 after vaccination were significantly higher in Group 1 (MenQuadfi) than in Group 2 (comparator Green Bamboo's): 82.1% (95% CI: 63.1%; 93.9%) vs 19.2% (95% CI: 6.6%; 39.4%) for Serogroup A, and 96.4% (95% CI: 81.7%; 99.9%) vs 30.8% (95% CI: 14.3%; 51.8%) for Serogroup C, Group 1 vs Group 2 (PPAS), respectively. This was corroborated by rSBA GMTs at Day 31: 742 (95% CI: 517; 1066) vs 60.7 (95% CI: 29.1; 126) for Serogroup A, and 565 (95% CI: 370; 864) vs 3.89 (95% CI: 1.89; 8.03) for Serogroup C, Group 1 vs Group 2 (PPAS), respectively.

## In Cohort II (2-6 yoa, single dose, comparator Royal's)

In Cohort II, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 31 after vaccination were similar between Group 3 (MenQuadfi) and Group 4 (comparator Royal's): 88.0% (95% CI: 68.8%; 97.5%) vs 82.8% (95% CI: 64.2%; 94.2%) for Serogroup A, and 100% (95% CI: 86.3%; 100%) vs 100% (95% CI: 88.1%; 100%) for Serogroup C, Group 3 vs Group 4 (PPAS), respectively. However, rSBA GMTs at Day 31 were higher in Group 3 than in Group 4: 572 (95% CI: 400; 817) vs 349 (95% CI: 243; 502) for Serogroup A, and 695 (95% CI: 463; 1042) vs 433 (95% CI: 325; 577) for Serogroup C, Group 3 vs Group 4 (PPAS), respectively.

## In Cohort III (12-23 moa, single dose, comparator Royal's)

In Cohort III, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 31 after vaccination were higher in Group 5 (MenQuadfi) than in Group 6 (comparator Royal's) for Serogroup A: 96.6% (95% CI: 82.2%; 99.9%) vs 88.9% (95% CI: 70.8%; 97.6%), Group 5 vs Group 6 (PPAS), respectively. In contrast, for Serogroup C, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 31 were similar between both groups: 100% (95% CI: 88.1%; 100%) vs 100% (95% CI: 87.2%; 100%), Group 5 vs Group 6 (PPAS), respectively. Notably, rSBA GMTs at Day 31 were higher in Group 5 than in Group 6 for both serogroups: Serogroup A: 256 (95% CI: 160; 409) vs 91.7 (95% CI: 42.0; 200); Serogroup C: 550 (95% CI: 407; 744) vs 284 (95% CI: 199; 404); Group 5 vs Group 6 (PPAS), respectively.

## Cohort IV (6-11 moa, 2 doses, comparator Royal's)

In Cohort IV, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 61 after vaccination were higher in Group 7 (MenQuadfi) than in Group 8 (comparator Royal's) for Serogroup A: 96.0% (95% CI: 79.6%; 99.9) vs 76.2% (95%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CI: 52.8%; 91.8), Group 7 vs Group 8 (PPAS), respectively. In contrast, for Serogroup C, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 61 were similar between both groups: 100% (95% CI: 86.3%; 100%) vs 100% (95% CI: 83.9%; 100%), Group 7 vs Group 8 (PPAS), respectively. Of note, rSBA GMTs at Day 61 were higher in Group 7 than in Group 8 for both serogroups: Serogroup A: 89.3 (95% CI: 47.8; 167) vs 40.3 (95% CI: 13.0; 125); Serogroup C: 211 (95% CI: 151; 295) vs 47.6 (95% CI: 34.4; 65.8); Group 7 vs Group 8 (PPAS), respectively.

## Cohort V (3-5 moa, 3 doses, comparator Green Bamboo's)

In Cohort V, rSBA seroresponse titres at Day 91 after vaccination were significantly higher in Group 9 (MenQuadfi) than in Group 10 (comparator Green Bamboo's): 94.7% (95% CI: 74.0%; 99.9%) vs 11.1% (95% CI: 1.4%; 34.7%) for Serogroup A, and 100% (95% CI: 82.4%; 100%) vs 38.9% (95% CI: 17.3%; 64.3%) for Serogroup C, Group 9 vs Group 10 (PPAS), respectively. This was corroborated by rSBA GMTs at Day 91: 82.6 (95% CI: 34.3; 199) vs 1.71 (95% CI: 0.786; 3.74) for Serogroup A, and 159 (95% CI: 112; 227) vs 3.30 (95% CI: 1.58; 6.89) for Serogroup C Group 9 vs Group 10 (PPAS), respectively.

## Non-comparative data

Based on the provided data, elicitation of immune responses can be concluded for the majority of subjects in all cohorts for all serogroups. As regards Cohorts IV and IV, which included age cohorts below 12 months of age, rSBA seroresponse titres were for Cohort IV 88.0% (95% CI: 68.8%; 97.5%) for Serogroup Y and 96.0% (95% CI: 79.6%; 99.9%) for Serogroup W at Day 61 after 2 doses, and for Cohort V 100% (95% CI: 82.4%; 100%) for Serogroup Y and 100% (95% CI: 82.4%; 100%) for Serogroup W at Day 91 after 3 doses.

As regards serogroups A and C for which comparative analyses were possible, titres elicited by MenQuadfi were reportedly of higher magnitude than those elicited by the comparators. However, it is important to mention that multiple shortcomings impair interpretation of both the comparative and non-comparative immunogenicity data to a significant extent. Those are namely the open-label design, the limited sample size of 30 randomised subjects per group, the absence of an EU-authorised comparator, no hypothesis testing and descriptive data analyses only.

## Safety data analyses

Immediate unsolicited systemic AEs were collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination, solicited (pre-defined) AEs (solicited reactions) within 7 days after each vaccination (further distinguished in injection site reactions and systemic reactions), unsolicited AEs within 30 days after each vaccination (further distinguished in unsolicited adverse events and unsolicited adverse reactions [i.e., considered related]), and SAEs throughout the study period from Visit 1 until the end of the 6-month follow-up period after the last vaccination, and analysed with different safety analysis sets (see above 'Design and conduct'), which is all acceptable.

## Immediate unsolicited AEs within 30 minutes of each vaccination

Immediate unsolicited AEs within 30 minutes after vaccination were reported only in Group 10 (Green Bamboo's, Cohort V), one event (3.3%) of eyelid oedema after the first dose and one event (3.4%) of pallor after the second dose. Both events were Grade 1 and thus no concern is raised.

## Solicited AEs (solicited reactions) within 7 days after each vaccination

Cohort I (7-17 yoa, single dose, comparator Green Bamboo's)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Solicited reactions were reported for 8 (26.7%) participants in Group 1 and 10 (33.3%) in Group 2; no Grade 3 or above solicited reactions were reported. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction in both groups, with 23.3% (7 of 30) and 26.7% (8 of 30) of participants in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Erythema, 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 1 and 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 2, and swelling 6.7% (2 of 30) in Group 1 and 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 2, were less frequently reported. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in either group were headache (6.7%, 2 of 30), malaise (6.7%, 2 of 30), and myalgia (6.7%, 2 of 30) in Group 1. In both groups, most solicited injection site reactions and most solicited systemic reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days; none ongoing at Day 8 were reported.

## In Cohort II (2-6 yoa, single dose, comparator Royal's)

Solicited reactions were reported for 11 (36.7%) participants in Group 3 and 5 (16.7%) in Group 4 [Cohort II]; Grade 3 or above solicited injection site reactions were reported for 1 (3.3%) participant in Group 3 (injection site erythema). Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction in both groups, with 20.0% (6 of 30) and 10.0% (3 of 30) of participants in Groups 3 and 4, respectively. Erythema, 16.7% (5 of 30) in Group 3 and 6.7% (2 of 30) in Group 4, and swelling, 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 3 and 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 4, were less frequently reported. In both groups, most solicited injection site reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days; no solicited injection site reactions ongoing at Day 8 were reported. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction in either group was fever (10.0%, 3 of 30) in Group 3. In Group 3, most fever episodes started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved with medication after 4-7 days, most of the other solicited systemic reactions (i.e., headache, malaise, and myalgia) started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days. In Group 4, all solicited systemic reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days. All solicited systemic reactions had resolved by Day 8, except for a fever episode in a participant in Group 3 (Grade 2 from Day 8 post vaccination that lasted for 2 days and resolved with medication).

## In Cohort III (12-23 moa, single dose, comparator Royal's)

Solicited reactions were reported for 9 (30.0%) participants in Group 5 and 6 (20.0%) in Group 6; no Grade 3 or above solicited reactions were reported.

In Group 6, 3.3% (1 of 30) of participants experienced at least 1 injection site tenderness and 3.3% (1 of 30) of participants experienced at least 1 injection site erythema; no injection site swelling was reported in either group. In both groups, most solicited injection site reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days; no solicited injection site reactions ongoing at Day 8 were reported. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions were fever (16.7%, 5 of 30) in Group 5 and appetite lost (10.0%, 3 of 30) in Group 6. In both groups, most solicited systemic reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days. All solicited systemic reactions had resolved by Day 8, except for an appetite lost episode in a participant in Group 5 (Grade 2 from Day 5 post vaccination that lasted for 5 days and resolved spontaneously).

## Cohort IV (6-11 moa, 2 doses, comparator Royal's)

Solicited reactions were reported for 18 (60.0%) participants in Group 7 after any vaccination (14 [46.7%] participants after the first dose and 9 [31.0%] after the second dose) and 9 (32.1%) in Group 8 after any vaccination (4 [14.3%] participants after the first dose and 5 [19.2%] after the second dose); Grade 3 or above solicited systemic reactions were reported for 1 (3.3%) participant in Group 7

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

after any vaccination (0 participants after the first dose and 1 [3.4%] after the second dose, i.e., vomiting that lasted for 2 days and resolved spontaneously) and 1 (3.6%) participant in Group 8 after any vaccination (0 participant after the first dose and 1 [3.8%] after the second dose, i.e., fever that lasted for 4 days and resolved with medication and hospitalization). The most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction after any vaccination was erythema (6.7%, 2 of 30) in Group 7 and tenderness (3.6%, 1 of 28) in Group 8. Tenderness and swelling were reported for 3.3% (1 of 30) and 3.3% (1 of 30), respectively, of participants in Group 7; no erythema or swelling was reported for participants in Group 8. In both groups, most solicited injection site reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days; no solicited injection site reactions ongoing at Day 8 were reported. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction in both groups was fever, with 43.3% (13 of 30) of participants in Group 7 and 17.9% (5 of 28) in Group 8. Most solicited systemic reactions after any vaccination had resolved by Day 8, except for fever in 3 participants (1 in Group 7 that lasted for 2 days and resolved with medication, and 2 in Group 8 of which one was Grade 3, and the other lasted for 2 days and resolved with medication) and appetite lost in 1 participant in Group 7 (Grade 2 from Day 1 that lasted for 35 days and resolved spontaneously).

The most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction was injection site erythema (3.3%, 1 of 30) in Group 9 and injection site tenderness (6.7%, 2 of 30) and erythema (6.7%, 2 of 30) in Group 10. No tenderness or swelling was reported for participants in Group 9. Swelling was reported for 3.3% (1 of 30) of participants in Group 10. In both groups, all solicited injection site reactions started within Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved spontaneously after 1-3 days; no solicited injection site reactions ongoing at Day 8 were reported. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction after any vaccination in both groups was fever, with 33.3% (10 of 30) of participants in Group 9 and 26.7% (8 of 30) in Group 10. Most solicited systemic reactions after the first dose of vaccination had resolved by Day 8, except appetite lost in 1 participant in Group 9 (Grade 2 from Day 4 that lasted for 6 days and resolved spontaneously) and irritability in 1 participant in Group 10 (Grade 1 from Day 1 that lasted for 10 days and resolved spontaneously). Most solicited systemic reactions after the second dose of vaccination had resolved by Day 8, except vomiting and appetite lost, both reported in 1 participant in Group 10 (Grade 1 vomiting and a Grade 1 appetite lost from Day 8, both reactions lasted for 6 days and resolved spontaneously). Most solicited systemic reactions after the third dose of vaccination had resolved by Day 8, except fever in 1 participant in Group 9 (Grade 2 from Day 8 that lasted for 4 days and resolved with medication) and irritability in 1 participant in Group 10 (Grade 1 from Day 4 that lasted for 9 days and resolved spontaneously).

## Unsolicited AEs within 30 days after each vaccination

Cohort I (7-17 yoa, single dose, comparator Green Bamboo's)

Unsolicited AEs were reported for 20.0% (6 of 30) of participants in Group 1 and 23.3% (7 of 30) in Group 2, all were systemic. Participants most frequently experienced (at least 10% of participants in a

## Cohort V (3-5 moa, 3 doses, comparator Green Bamboo's)

Unsolicited AE within 30 days of any vaccination were reported for 93.3% (28 of 30) of participants in Group 9 and 83.3% (25 of 30) of participants in Group 10, all were systemic. Participants most frequently experienced cough: 53.3% (16 of 30) in Group 9 and 60.0% (18 of 30) in Group 10, rhinorrhoea: 33.3% (10 of 30) in Group 9 and 40.0% (12 of 30) in Group 10, pneumonia: 33.3% (10 in 30) in Group 9 and 13.3% (4 of 30) in Group 10, pyrexia: 26.7% (8 of 30) in Group 9 and 30.0% (9 of 30) in Group 10, diarrhoea: 16.7% (5 of 30) in Group 9, upper respiratory tract infection: 13.3% (4 of 30) in Group 9 and 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 10, functional gastrointestinal disorder: 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 9, bronchitis: 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 9, and myocardial necrosis marker increased: 10.0% (3 of 30) in Group 10.

In both groups, most unsolicited ARs started from Day 1 to Day 4 and resolved after 1-3 days.

## Discontinuation due to AE

No AEs leading to study discontinuation within 30 days after any vaccination were reported in either group. In Group 8 (Cohort IV), one participant was diagnosed with Atrial septal defect on Day 33 and discontinued the study due to the event. However, this event was considered as not related to the study vaccine by the Investigator, which can be agreed to.

SAEs throughout the study period from Visit 1 until the end of the 6-month follow-up period after the last vaccination.

No deaths were reported in either group during the study.

## Cohort I (7-17 yoa, single dose, comparator Green Bamboo's)

In Group 2, 1 participant (3.3%, 1 of 30) experienced blepharitis and febrile infection during the 6month follow-up period. Both events were considered as not related to study vaccine by the Investigator, which can be agreed taking into account that those were not within 30 days after vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## In Cohort II (2-6 yoa, single dose, comparator Royal's)

SAEs were reported for 13.3% (4 of 30) of participants in Group 3 (1 case each of appendicitis perforated, complicated appendicitis, febrile infection, pneumonia, and tonsilitis bacterial) and 10.0% (3 of 30) of participants in Group 4 (3 cases of bronchitis and 1 case each of influenza, pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infection); none were considered as related to study vaccine by the Investigator, which can be followed considering that only 1 SAE (tonsilitis bacterial) was reported within 30 days after vaccination and that this case is deemed unrelated.

## In Cohort III (12-23 moa, single dose, comparator Royal's)

SAEs were reported for 23.3% (7 of 30) of participants in Group 5 (5 cases of pneumonia, 2 cases each of bronchitis and pharyngitis, and 1 case each of gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal infection, influenza, and febrile convulsion) and 26.7% (8 of 30) of participants in Group 6 (5 cases each of bronchitis and pneumonia, 2 cases of influenza, and 1 case each of pyrexia, herpangina, and urticaria); none were considered related to study vaccine by the Investigator. This can be agreed to as the SAEs experienced within 30 days after vaccination were 2 cases of pneumonia and 1 case each of bronchitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis (Group 5) and 2 cases of pneumonia (Group 6), and the SAEs experienced within 7 days after vaccination were bronchitis and pneumonia (Group 5, 2 participants, 1 case each).

## Cohort IV (6-11 moa, 2 doses, comparator Royal's)

SAEs were reported for 43.3% (13 of 30) of participants in Group 7 (8 cases of pneumonia, 4 cases of tonsillitis bacterial, 2 cases of bronchitis, and 1 case each of functional gastrointestinal disorder, influenza, varicella, febrile convulsion, and urticaria) and 50.0% (14 of 28) of participants in Group 8 (6 cases of pneumonia, 4 cases of bronchitis, 3 cases of influenza, 2 cases of intestinal obstruction, and 1 case each of incarcerated inguinal hernia, herpangina, herpes pharyngitis, and tonsillitis bacterial); none were considered related to study vaccine by the Investigator. SAEs within 30 days after any vaccination were reported for 13.3% (4 of 30) of participants in Group 7 and 25.0% (7 of 28) in Group 8. SAEs within 7 days after any vaccination were reported for 10.0% (3 of 30) of participants in Group 7 and 3.6% (1 of 28) in Group 7. The case of febrile convulsion was experienced by participant (1560001-40031) 24 days after the first dose of MenQuadfi, who was diagnosed with respiratory adenovirus infection combined with acute bronchitis, febrile convulsion, and influenza A virus infection. The events resolved upon treatment and the participant continued in the trial and received the second dose. Hence, it is not objected to the relatedness judgments.

## Cohort V (3-5 moa, 3 doses, comparator Green Bamboo's)

SAEs were reported for 50.0% (15 of 30) of participants in Group 9 (17 cases of pneumonia, 4 cases of bronchitis, 3 cases of herpangina, 1 case each of functional gastrointestinal disorder, gastroenteritis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, influenza, tonsilitis bacterial, and upper respiratory tract infection bacterial) and 46.7% (14 of 30) of participants in Group 10 (9 cases of pneumonia, 3 cases of bronchitis, 2 cases each of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and herpangina, and 1 case each of diarrhoea infectious, gastroenteritis, and asthma); none were considered related to study vaccine by the Investigator, which can be agreed given the nature of these events.

In summary, although no significant concern arises from the observations reported, it is clearly noted that the sample size is deemed insufficient to conclude on safety adequately and the open-label setting adds even more concerns regarding interpretability.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH submitted data of Study MEQ00075 'Phase I Open-Label, Age De-escalation Safety and Immunogenicity Study of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Adolescents, Children, Toddlers, and Infants in China', a stand-alone study that is not included in the MenQuadfi Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP), as according to Article 46 of regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, the Marketing Authorisation Holders (MAHs) are requested to submit information on studies conducted in children of authorised medicines that have been completed since 26 January 2007 and are sponsored by the MAH, within 6 months of completion of each study.

MenQuadfi is authorised for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria (N.) meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Hence, parts of the study population of MEQ00075 (Cohort IV, comprising participants aged 6 to 11 months; Cohort V, comprising participants aged 3 to 5 months) are not covered by the currently effective EU Marketing Authorisation of MenQuadfi.

The MAH has not submitted any amendments to the Product Information as part of this Article 46 procedure.

As regards immunogenicity, although rSBA antibody titres elicited by MenQuadfi were reportedly of higher magnitude than those elicited by the comparators, these results have to be interpreted with caution as the interpretability of that data is significantly impaired by several shortcomings, namely the open-label design, the limited sample size of 30 randomised subjects per group, the absence of EUauthorised comparators, the fact that no hypothesis was formulated or tested and data was analysed only descriptively.

Concerning safety, the low sample size is deemed insufficient to adequately conclude on safety and the open-label setting adds even more concerns regarding interpretability.

Overall, no concerns arise from the study results and the benefit-risk balance of MenQuadfi remains positive in the approved indication. No updates of the PI are necessary.
