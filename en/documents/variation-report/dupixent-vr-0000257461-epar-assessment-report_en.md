## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Sanofi Winthrop Industrie submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 5 March 2025 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                   | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication for Dupixent to include treatment of moderate to severe Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older, whose disease is inadequately controlled by H1 antihistamines and who are naive to anti-IgE therapy, based on final results from 2 studies: EFC16461 (CUPID) study A and study C. Both of them were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group study of dupilumab in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1 antihistamine treatment in patients naïve to omalizumab. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The updated RMP version 13.0 and 13.1 has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes to the PI.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0353/2024 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0353/2024 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 26 March 2020 (EMEA/H/SA/2744/10/2020/II). The advice pertained questions concerning the clinical development program (study A and B of master protocol EFC16461) for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

This is a re-submission of the previously withdrawn extension of indication of Dupixent to CSU under

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0083. Indeed, the initial package for II/0083 included study A and Study B, but given that study B was stopped for futility, the trial results needed to be compelling and robust - which, at the time, was not sufficiently demonstrated. The response to treatment as observed in the overall population of study B that initially formed the basis for the sought indication was not considered convincing. The heterogeneity of the treatment effect was not well understood, the robustness of the overall treatment effect as well as within subgroups was unclear and lacked replication by a second trial in the same population. Overall, efficacy with study B had not been robustly demonstrated, and the company withdrew the Extension of Indication II/0083 on 14February-2025 and re-submitted within procedure EMA/VR/0000257461 using Study A and Study C as pivotal studies.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria, is characterized by the spontaneous appearance of pruritic wheals (hives) and flare-type skin reactions without a specific known cause that persists for more than 6 weeks, and which may be accompanied by angioedema. Wheals and pruritus represent the key urticaria symptoms. Owing to the unpredictability of the occurrence of pruritic wheals, the disease can have a substantial impact on patients' daily life. Significant exacerbations of chronic urticaria may result in emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## State the claimed the therapeutic indication

The new indication statement proposed for this submission is as follows:

Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and adolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamines and who are naive to anti-IgE therapy for CSU.

## Epidemiology risk factors

The prevalence and incidence of CSU are not precisely known and show considerable regional differences. A recent systematic review with meta-analysis indicates a point prevalence of chronic urticaria (including both entities, chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic inducible urticaria) in Europe of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0), in North America of 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1-0.1), and with the highest point prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI: 0.5-2.9) in Asian countries (Fricke et al., 2019). Epidemiologic data for CSU in the adolescent population is currently sparse; similar point prevalence estimates as for adults have been reported. Women are more frequently affected than men (approximately 70% of cases), although no sex-specific difference is reported in patients below 15 years of age.

## Aetiology and pathogenesis

CSU results from pathogenic activation of mast cells (MCs) and basophils. Still, disease pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. Activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor, Fc ε R1, is an important step in the development of CSU. The degranulation of skin mast cells leading to release of histamine is considered to be the initial event in the development of skin change. Higher levels of histamine release from mast cells have been observed in skin biopsies from patients with CSU. Unlike normal skin, patients with active CSU show deposition of basophils in skin and associated basopenia in blood.

Based on current knowledge, CSU pathogenesis is similar in adults and adolescents, while adolescent CSU exhibit clinical characteristics closer to adults CSU as compared to paediatric CSU. Pathologic activation of mast cells and basophils in patients with CSU is thought to occur via autoimmune and non-autoimmune mechanisms. In the non-autoimmune process, inappropriate activation of mast molecules (such as SYK) promotes spontaneous degranulation of mast cells/basophils with subsequent release of histamine and other mediators. Based on recent evidence, two autoimmune endotypes have been described as type I 'autoallergic' (which is associated with IgE antibodies against autoantigens) and type IIb autoimmune (which is driven by autoantibodies to FceR1 and/or IgE). Regional differences for autoimmune CSU endotypes are not well researched and understood.

Skin biopsies from patients with CSU have been shown to have an eosinophilic and T-helper (Th)2 immunopathology. IL-4 levels have been reported to be elevated in the serum of patients with CSU. The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 promote isotype class switching to IgE and act on mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. IL-4, and to a lesser extent IL-13, via IL4R α receptor can directly increase Fc ε RI α expression on mast cells and basophils, potentially priming these cells for allergen-induced activation. Preclinical data suggest that dupilumab inhibits the IL-4 mediated induction of B cell to plasma cell subclass switching from IgM to IgE, with consequent IgE lowering leading to reduction of Fc ε RI α expression. IL-4 and IL-13 can also induce IgE-dependent and IgE-independent gene expression changes in mast cells.

## Clinical presentation, diagnosis

CSU is characterized by the spontaneous appearance of pruritic wheals (hives) and flare-type skin reactions without a specific known cause that persists for more than 6 weeks, which may be accompanied by angioedema. CSU needs to be differentiated from other medical conditions where wheals, angioedema, or both can occur, for example anaphylaxis, autoimmune disorders, urticarial vasculitis, or bradykinin-mediated angioedema including hereditary angioedema. The diagnosis of CSU is based on a detailed patient history (duration of episodic and transient wheals for a period of 6 weeks or longer, use of medications, physical stimuli) and careful physical examination (characteristic erythematous, edematous wheals that wax and wane rapidly, with or without accompanying angioedema). Basic tests include a differential blood count and CRP and/or ESR, in all patients, and total IgE and anti-TPO, in patients in specialist care and can help to identify indicators for autoimmune CSU. The diagnostic approaches for CSU in adults and adolescents are similar.

## Management

The therapeutic goal in the treatment of CSU is to achieve complete freedom of symptoms. The current international guideline for urticaria) recommends a 4-step treatment approach for disease management (Zuberbier et al., 2022). The treatment algorithm in the guideline is the same for adult and adolescent patients. Step 1 starts with non-sedating H1-antihistamines at approved 'standard' doses. If symptoms are inadequately controlled after 2 to 4 weeks, an increase in H1-antihistamine dose up to 4-fold (unapproved dose) is recommended (Step 2). If symptoms still remain uncontrolled or are intolerable, omalizumab (anti-IgE) should be added (Step 3). Beyond this, Step 4 treatment options include add-on ciclosporin A, or montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist) to H1antihistamine. In case of acute exacerbations, treatment with sufficient doses of oral glucocorticoids can be given for a short period (up to a maximum of ten days) to reduce the duration and activity of the disease. Once symptom control is achieved and maintained, the current treatment guideline recommends to step down treatment to the lowest effective dose or even discontinue medication if remission is sustained.

## Unmet medical need

The burden for CSU patients is substantial, especially for patients with persistent disease that cannot be controlled. There is a therapeutic need for alternative treatment options next to Omalizumab (Xolair) in patients with persistent disease that cannot be adequately controlled by H1-antihistamines that target the underlying immune pathomechanisms in CSU.

## 2.1.2. About the product

DUPIXENT® (dupilumab) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4R α subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor. By blocking signaling of both IL-4 and IL-13 which are key cytokines involved in type 2 inflammation, dupilumab broadly suppresses type 2 inflammation.

Dupilumab is approved in the EU for the following indications:

## - Atopic dermatitis

## Adults and adolescents

Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.

## Children 6 months to 11 years of age

Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 11 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy.

## - Asthma

## Adults and adolescents

Dupixent is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older as add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fraction of exhaled nitric oxide who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.

## Children 6 to 11 years of age

Dupixent is indicated in children 6 to 11 years old as add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fraction of exhaled nitric oxide who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.

## - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis

Dupixent is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control.

## - Prurigo Nodularis

Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.

## - Eosinophilic esophagitis

Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, who are inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to, or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy.

## - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Dupixent is indicated in adults as add-on maintenance treatment for uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterised by raised blood eosinophils on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate.

## 2.1.3. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance

## Paediatric investigation plan

On 30 May 2024 the applicant submitted to the European Medicines Agency a request for a modification of the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan as set out in the Agency's decision P/0153/2021 issued on 16 April 2021. The proposed indication is 'Treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in patients aged 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with H1 antihistamine and an anti-IgE antibody treatment'.

The currently agreed measures of PIP 001501-PIP07-20 consist of four studies:

- Study 1 (EFC16461) consists of two independent phase 3, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies covered by the same master protocol EFC16461
- -Study A assesses the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults, adolescents (≥12 to &lt;18 years), and children (≥6 to &lt;12 years) with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine treatment
- -Study B assesses the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults and adolescents (≥12 to &lt;18 years) with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine treatment and are intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.
- Study 2 (PKM16982) consists of an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of dupilumab in children from 2 years to less than 12 years of age with chronic spontaneous urticaria.
- Study 3 consists of an extrapolation of the data generated from the adult and adolescent to the paediatric population.
- Study 4 consists of the later added replication study ( EFC16461 Study C ) which assesses the efficacy of dupilumab in paediatric patients from 6 years to less than 18 years of age (and in adults) with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine (same population as for Study A above).

The applicant sufficiently outlined that there are no changes to the design or intended purpose of the device (200mg and 300mg PFS-S and PFP presentations), nor is there a new medical device being introduced. The justification for not providing the notified body opinion is acceptable.

The applicant sufficiently outlined that the characteristics of the intended user and use environment for the new CSU indication is supported by existing usability data for the authorized presentations. Therefore, it is agreed that an additional usability study is not required.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

Pivotal Study B was included in the first submission of the Extension of Indication of Dupixent in CSU (procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0083). Indeed, the initial package for II/0083 included study A and Study B, but given that study B was stopped for futility, the trial results needed to be especially compelling and robust - which had not been sufficiently demonstrated. The MAH withdrew procedure II/0083 on 14-February-2025 , and resubmitted this variation EMA/VR/0000257461 including study A and C.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Bioanalytical methods

All methods used to assess functional dupilumab concentration and the immunogenicity to dupilumab (ADA and NAb) in samples collected from Study C, Study A, and Study B are the same as previously described in detail in the original marketing application for adult AD and in the subsequent adult and adolescent asthma marketing application.

## Pharmacokinetic data analysis

Samples for the analysis of functional dupilumab concentrations in serum were collected in Study A, B and C according to a protocol-specified sparse collection schedule, which included a baseline sample (ie, collected prior to treatment initiation) and samples collected at week 12, week 24, and follow-up at week 36. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the concentration data over time in patients with CSU. Concentrations of dupilumab in serum were summarized in the PK population using arithmetic and geometric means, SD, standard error of the mean (SEM), coefficient of variation (CV), minimum, median and maximum per sampling time. Concentrations that were BLQ were imputed as LLOQ/2.

## Population PK analysis

The global Pop PK base model developed using dupilumab data pooled from Phase 1 to Phase 3 studies in healthy subjects (adults) and in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD, adults) and asthma (adults and adolescents) in Study POH0668 was used in this analysis. Data from Study C, Study A and Study B were not included in the global Pop PK model development but were evaluated through a MAP Bayesian approach in which all Pop PK model parameters were fixed to the values of the global Pop PK model and individual concentrations were generated for patients with CSU. This approach is justified given that the observed PK data are similar across different disease populations (AD, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]). The suitability of the global Pop PK base model to describe dupilumab PK in patients with CSU was assessed by diagnostic plots, visual predictive checks (VPC), and quality criteria and then post hoc exposure parameters were generated. The Pop PK analysis was performed with NONMEM (Version 7.5.1) running on a LINUX cluster.

The global model is a two-compartment model with a first order absorption, and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination. The absorption process is parameterized in terms of first order absorption rate constant (Ka, day-1). The elimination process is described by the linear pathway parameterized in terms of linear elimination rate constant (Ke, day-1) and nonlinear Michaelis-Menten elimination represented by the two parameters Vmax (mg ∙ day/L) and Km (mg/L). The two compartments are represented by a distribution volume of central compartment (V2) and inter-compartment distribution

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rate constants (K23 and K32). Given the well characterized body weight effect on dupilumab PK, the covariate effect of weight on Ke, V2 and Vmax is included in the global Pop PK base model structure.

The suitability of the global Pop PK base model to describe dupilumab PK in patients with CSU was evaluated. The relative RMSE was calculated to be 39.1% for PRED. In general, the goodness-of-fit plots demonstrated the adequacy of the model fit for the observed dupilumab concentration data in patients with CSU. In the plot of conditional population weighted residuals (CWRES), a slight trend of higher CWRES values at Week 36 was observed. This can be attributed to 15 out of 190 participants having relatively elevated PK concentrations (range: 0.48-16.1 mg/L) after 12 weeks without dupilumab treatment, which differed significantly from the predicted concentrations (PRED range: 0.00236-0.256 mg/L).

VPC was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the global Pop PK base model in patients with CSU. Results of VPC showed that a large majority of the observed concentrations were within in the prediction range [5th-95th percentiles].

## Test and reference products, doses and mode of administration

Based on the known PK, safety, and efficacy of dupilumab, the selected dupilumab SC dosing (PFS) regimens for the Phase 3 Study C, Study A, and Study B were as follows:

- Adults ( ≥ 18 years of age) regardless of body weight and adolescents who weighed ≥ 60 kg: 300 mg q2w with a 600 mg loading dose on Day 1;
- Adolescents ( ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age) and children ( ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years of age) who weighed ≥ 30 to &lt;60 kg: 200 mg q2w with a 400 mg loading dose on Day 1;
- Children ( ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years of age) who weighed ≥ 15 to &lt;30 kg 300 mg q4w with a 600 mg loading dose on Day 1.

A matching placebo (including loading dose) was used as comparator.

## PK objectives and endpoints

## EFC16461 Studies A, B and C

Objective: To evaluate PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) outcome measures

## Endpoints:

- Functional dupilumab concentrations in serum and PK profile
- Pharmacodynamic response for selected biomarkers (total IgE)

## Population PK analysis

The main objectives of the popPK analysis were the following:

- To apply dupilumab global Pop PK base model to patients with CSU.
- To generate individual dupilumab post hoc exposures and assess the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on dupilumab PK in patients with CSU.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## PK/PD analysis

The objectives of the PK/PD analyses were to understand dupilumab Exposure- Response (E-R) relationships regarding to the key efficacy endpoints, and to identify covariates influencing this ER relationships, in participants with CSU from pooled data of EFC16461 Studies A and C.

## Analysis sets and Study Subjects

Study C: The randomized population consisted of 142 (94.0%) adults ( ≥ 18 years of age), 6 (4.0%) adolescents ( ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years), and 3 (2.0%) children ( ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years). The mean (SD) body weight was 73.5 (19.5) kg, with 21.9% of participants &lt;60 kg and 78.1% ≥ 60 kg. There were no participants with body weight &lt;30 kg in this study.

The PK population included 72 (out of 74) dupilumab treated participants and the ADA population included 147 participants (72 out 74 in the dupilumab group and 75 out of 77 in the placebo group), all with at least one post-baseline PK or ADA data point available.

Study A : The randomized population consisted of 132 (95.7%) adults ( ≥ 18 years of age), 4 (2.9%) adolescents ( ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years), and 2 (1.4%) children ( ≥ 6 years to &lt;12 years). The mean (SD) body weight was 76.48 (19.96) kg, with 19.0% of participants &lt;60 kg and 81.0% ≥ 60 kg. There were no participants with body weight &lt;30 kg in this study.

The PK population included 69 (out of 70) dupilumab treated participants and the ADA population included 135 participants (69 out 70 in the dupilumab group and 66 out of 68 in the placebo group), all with at least one post-baseline PK or ADA data point available.

Study B: The randomized population consisted of 106 (98.1%) adult participants ( ≥ 18 years of age) and 2 (1.9%) adolescent participants ( ≥ 12 years to &lt;18 years). The mean (SD) body weight was 77.68 (18.12) kg, with 80.6% of participants ≥ 60 kg. There were no participants with body weight &lt;30 kg in this study, (as per the exclusion criteria).

The PK population included 52 (out of 54) dupilumab-treated participants and the ADA population included 105 participants (52 out of 54 in the dupilumab group and 53 out of 54 in the placebo group), all with at least one post-baseline PK or ADA data point available.

In the Final Dataset, the PK data in adolescents and children with CSU was limited and only available in 6 adolescents and 3 children.

## Population PK analysis

After confirming the appropriateness of the MAP approach (i.e., external validation of the global Pop PK base model using data from patients with CSU), the global Pop PK base model was used to generate post-hoc estimates of individual steady-state exposures for each patient with CSU.

## Absorption, Distribution, Elimination

The parameters of dupilumab disposition in patients with CSU are consistent with those reported for dupilumab in the AD, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, and COPD populations based on observed data as well as Pop PK analysis utilizing a global Pop PK model previously established with data from healthy subjects and patients with AD and asthma.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

In Study C, Study A, and Study B, with a loading dose, the mean steady-state trough level was 73.0 mg/L, 63.1 mg/L, and 57.8 mg/L at Week 24, respectively. The steady state Ctrough was achieved by Week 12 for the dupilumab q2w regimen during treatment in patients with CSU.

Based on the Pop PK analysis (POH1089), the median time to steady-state was 10 weeks for 300 mg q2w with a loading dose in a typical individual, which is similar to AD and asthma studies. The modelbased predictions, which are not dependent on study design, represent a more accurate assessment of the time to steady state than those derived by observed data, which are in part dependent on the PK sampling scheme.

- b Out of 190 patients as PK population in Final Dataset, 185 patients (181 adults and 4 adolescents) received 300 mg q2w and 5 patients (2 adolescents and 3 children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age) received 200 mg q2w. Due to dose discontinuation before Week 22, 10 adult patients receiving 300 mg q2w, 1 adolescent receiving 300 mg q2w and 2 children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age receiving 200 mg q2w were excluded in this post assessment
- c AUC τ,ss = AUC[Week 24 - Week 22] for 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w. Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss were calculated over Week 22 and Week 24 for 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w in EFC16461 Study C, Study A and Study B.
- d For adults, CLCR value (mL/min) was derived using the equation of Cockroft and Gault and renal function categories were based on the following criteria: Normal: CLCR ≥90 mL/min; Mild renal impairment: 60 ≤ CLCR &lt; 90 mL/min; Moderate renal impairment: 30≤CLCR &lt;60 mL/min. For adolescents, CLCR value (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) was derived using the equation of GFR Bedside Schwartz and same renal function categories were used: Normal: CLCR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; Mild renal impairment: 60 ≤ CLCR &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; Moderate renal impairment: 30≤CLCR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .

The influence of selected intrinsic and extrinsic factors on dupilumab PK in patients with CSU was evaluated by the comparison of post hoc estimates of PK exposures. In conclusion, consistent with the finding in other populations, body weight was identified as the primary factor explaining dupilumab PK variability in CSU patients with a body weight range of 33 to 136 kg. The PK parameters of clearance (Ke, and Vmax) and volume (V2) decreased with decrease in body weight (hence exposure increased) in patients with CSU.

The model-predicted PK exposure (Cmax.ss and Ctrough.ss) for the CSU population of adolescents in weight group of 30 to &lt;60 kg and ≥ 60 kg were compared with each other and with the PK exposure in adults patients with CSU from EFC16461 Study A, Study B and Study C.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Through inhibition of IL 4 and IL 13 signaling via binding to the IL 4R α subunit shared by the IL 4 and IL 13 receptor complexes and potential to block IgE-dependent and IgE-independent pathways, dupilumab may provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents 12 years and above, with inadequate response to H1 antihistamines and who are naïve to anti-IgE therapy for CSU.

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

To date, there is no available validated CSU specific biomarker which can be used for disease activity evaluation or for treatment effect assessment. Total IgE was evaluated in the CSU development program to better understand and further characterize dupilumab's mode of action in CSU.

Concentrations of total IgE in serum were measured using a validated quantitative method: a fluoroenzyme immunoassay (ImmunoCAP™, Phadia™) was used globally while a comparable electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was used in China (Roche Elecsys® IgE II, COBAS®).

Study C: The median total IgE in serum concentrations at baseline were 137.5 IU/mL for the dupilumab group and 86.5 IU/mL for the placebo group. At Week 24, the median percent change from baseline in total IgE in serum concentrations was -53.36% for the dupilumab group and 0.97% for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo group, and -49.29% and -3.36% at the post-treatment follow-up visit at Week 36, respectively.

Study A: The median total IgE in serum concentrations at baseline were 109 IU/mL for the dupilumab group and 96.5 IU/mL for the placebo group. At Week 24, the median percent decrease from baseline in total IgE in serum concentrations were 48.2% for the dupilumab group and 6.3% for the placebo group, and 45.2% and 7.7% at the post-treatment follow-up visit at Week 36, respectively.

Study B: The median total IgE in serum concentrations at baseline were 72.1 IU/mL for the dupilumab group and 85.8 IU/mL for the placebo group. At Week 24, the median percent decrease from baseline in total IgE in serum concentrations were 63.0% and 0.0% for the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively, and 58.6% and 0.38% at follow-up Week 36, respectively.

The specific decline in total IgE indicated that type 2 mediated immunoglobulin class switching to the allergic phenotype (ie, IgM to IgE) was effectively blocked by dupilumab treatment. The total IgE profiles showed a similar median magnitude of effect over time in CSU, AD, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, and COPD patient populations.

## 2.4.4. PK/PD modelling

## Analysis of Concentration-Response-Relationships

The exposure-response (E-R) relationship for the key clinical efficacy endpoints in patients with CSU was investigated using both descriptive and model-based analyses.

## Descriptive approach

For the univariate descriptive analysis, the E-R relationship was explored by quartiles of steady-state trough concentration of dupilumab for the key efficacy endpoints UAS7, ISS7, and HSS7 at Week 24 with the data from each study (Study C, Study A, and Study B) in patients with CSU.

## Model-based approach

Empirical model-based PK/PD analyses were conducted with pooled data from Study C and Study A in patients with CSU for the efficacy endpoints UAS7, ISS7, and HSS7 at Week 24.

Steps of model built:

1. A base PK/PD model was used to select an E/R relationship form from linear, log-linear and Emax models. The fitted model with stable coefficient estimates and lowest goodness of fit criterion AICc (Akaike information criterion with sample size correction, the smaller the better) was selected.
2. Effects of additional baseline covariates, either as a main effect or an interaction effect with dupilumab concentration, were explored based on the selected best-fitted base model. Covariates already included in the base model were also screened for interaction at this step.
3. When multiple interaction effects and/or main effects were identified for inclusion consideration in the E/R model, a forward variable selection approach was applied to determine the final

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

covariates. A significant term (P value &lt; 0.05 for either main effect or an interaction) was considered in the final model determination.

Log-linear model was selected for analysis of UAS7, ISS, and HSS7.

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity to dupilumab was assessed in Study C, Study A, and Study B, and titer levels were provided for the positive samples in the ADA assay. Samples that were confirmed positive in the ADA assay were further characterized for the presence of anti-dupilumab NAb.

Blood samples for detection of ADA in serum were collected at baseline, on-treatment at Week 12 and Week 24, and follow-up at Week 36 in all 3 studies.

Two (2) patients (1.0%) in the dupilumab group and 3 patients (1.5%) in the placebo group had preexisting ADA. The treatment-emergent ADA incidence through Week 24 (on-treatment period) was 4.7% (N=9) in the dupilumab group compared to 0.5% (N=1) in the placebo group. Persistent ADA responses were observed in 0.5% (N=1) of patients receiving dupilumab compared to 0% for placebo. Of the 9 patients with treatmentemergent ADA in the dupilumab group, 8 had low titer (&lt;1000) and 1 had moderate titer (1000-10 000) responses. High titer ADA response (&gt;10 000) was not observed. A total of 2 (1.0%) patients receiving dupilumab were NAb-positive compared to 2 (1.0%) patients in the placebo group.

The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs through Week 36 was 11.4% in the dupilumab group compared to 1.5% in the placebo group. Persistent ADA responses were observed in 4.1% of patients receiving dupilumab compared to 0% for placebo. Of the 22 patients with treatment-emergent ADA in the dupilumab group, 20 had low titer and 2 had moderate-titer responses. High titer ADA response (&gt;10 000) was not observed. A total of 9.3% of patients receiving dupilumab were classified as NAbpositive compared to 1.0% of patients in the placebo group.

The relationship between ADA and clinical response (change from baseline in UAS7 and ISS7 at Week 24) was investigated in participants with treatment-emergent ADA responses. In the pooled ITT population, the evaluation of the association of a treatment-emergent ADA response with the change from baseline in UAS7 and ISS7 at Week 24 is based on a small population (12 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 participant in the placebo group). In the dupilumab group, mean changes from baseline in UAS7 and ISS7 to Week 24 were -21.03 and 10.64 for the participants with treatmentemergent ADA response (N=12), respectively. In the 122 participants in the dupilumab group with pre-existing immunoreactivity or negative ADA at all times, the mean changes from baseline in UAS7 and ISS7 to Week 24 were -18.45 and -9.68 in the dupilumab group.

## 2.4.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The application is supported by data from 3 independent Phase 3 studies that were conducted under the master protocol EFC16461: pivotal Study A and Study C as well as supportive Study B (stopped on sponsor's decision).

Study A, B and C were conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe CSU (UAS7 ≥ 16) who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1 antihistamine treatment and informed on dupilumab trough

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations, immunogenicity, and PD marker IgE. Studies C and A were conducted in adults, adolescents ( ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years), and children ( ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years) who were omalizumab -naïve. Study B was conducted in adults and adolescents ( ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years) who were intolerant to or incomplete responders to omalizumab. Pooling of data from all 3 studies is considered to be appropriate for analysis of PK and immunogenicity. Exposure-response analyses were presented pooled for study A and C, but separately for study B, which is supported. PK and PD results were compared with dupilumab data obtained in other indications.

All 3 studies utilized an adult SC dosing regimen with 300 mg dupilumab Q2W after a loading dose of 600 mg, which is already approved in other adult indications, namely AD, Asthma, and PN. Regarding adolescents ( ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age), 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg were used for the group ≥ 60 kg, while 200 mg q2w with a loading dose of 400 mg were applied in the group ≥ 30 kg to &lt;60 kg. Similar dosing criteria apply for the already approved adolescent indication AD, however, without a lower weight limit set (i.e. 200 mg q2w in adolescents 'less than 60 kg'). The introduction of a lower weight limit for adolescents with CSU is supported.

Previously established bioanalytical methods were applied. Bioanalytical reports were provided and acceptable method performance was reported.

Sparse PK sampling was conducted in the 3 studies with baseline sample and Ctrough samples at week 12 and 24 as well as at follow up (week 36); PK data from 196 patients are available. Descriptive statistics of dupilumab concentration by timepoint were presented for each study. In study C, the mean Ctrough values of functional dupilumab in serum were 62.0 mg/L at Week 12, 73.0 mg/L at Week 24, and 0.164 mg/L at Week 36. In study A, the mean Ctrough was 60.0 mg/L at Week 12, 63.1 mg/L at week 24, and 1.06 mg/l at week 36. In study B, the mean Ctrough was 53.3 mg/L at Week 12, 57.8 mg/L at week 24, and 1.00 mg/l at week 36. Overall, variability was high (CV% about 50). Results indicate that steady state is reached at week 12. All 3 trials obtained comparable results.

Furthermore, results were compared to PK results obtained in other indications: Mean dupilumab Ctroughs over 6 months of treatment were compared with concentrations obtained in other already approved indications. Throughout the investigated time period, Ctrough of dupilumab at steady-state for adults with CSU was within the mean concentration range observed in other populations who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (with or without loading dose).

Population PK analysis The applied population PK model was developed from a large dataset derived from HV, AD and asthma populations. Agreement between observed and predicted dupilumab concentrations in patients with CSU was assessed via external validation. Therefore, standard diagnostic criteria including goodness-of-fit plots, quality criteria, and VPC were applied. Dupilumab concentrations in CSU patients were adequately predicted by the model. Thus, the model was applied to the sparse PK data in patients with CSU through a MAP Bayesian approach to generate individual PK parameters and post hoc PK exposures.

Concentration-time profile of dupilumab in a typical adult patient with CSU (median weight of 74.8 kg) was simulated at 300 mg q2w (with a loading dose of 600 mg). The simulated PK profile was comparable to those simulated for a typical patient with AD, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, COPD, and PN by use of the respective popPK models. These data support the claim on PK similarity across different indications.

The influence of selected intrinsic and extrinsic factors on dupilumab PK in patients with CSU was evaluated by the comparison of post hoc estimates of PK exposures. The applicant claims that body weight was found to be the primary source of dupilumab PK variability in the CSU population. Although exposure was lower in this subgroup, there is no evidence for loss of efficacy based on available data. Other covariates, including baseline demographics, baseline lab parameters, ethnicity, CSU patient populations, baseline biomarker and disease characteristics and concomitant medication

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(H1-antihistamine) were classified as with no apparent effect on dupilumab PK in the CSU population as post-hoc predicted exposure was within or very close to the range of 0.8 to 1.25 relative to the reference subgroup. Higher differences were mainly present in subgroups with very small sample size (e.g. renal impairment), thus, data do not allow conclusion on impact on PK, which is adequately reflected in the SmPC. For ADA status the post hoc estimates of AUCt,ss are 1180 mg*day/L for ADA negatives and 748 mg*day/L for ADA positives. Higher mean body weight in ADA-positive patients (85.1 kg vs 75.4 kg in ADA negatives) might have contributed to this finding. The SmPC currently states: Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) responses were not generally associated with impact on dupilumab exposure, safety, or efficacy . The data base for ADA positive patients with CSU was low (N=22) compared to the large data base from other indications, where no clinically relevant impact of ADA on dupilumab exposure was determined. As also in the CSU population there was no evidence for loss of efficacy in the ADA positive subgroup and no safety issue occurred, the current SmPC wording is not challenged.

The number of patients with moderate renal impairment was low in the data set (N=2); no patients with severe renal impairment were included. The SmPC currently states: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. This is considered acceptable.

As the number of adolescents receiving the 200 mg q2w dosing regimen was low within the clinical trials (N=2), the dose justification for adolescent patients in the group ≥ 30 kg to &lt;60 kg will be partly based on simulation. Thus, the impact of the pharmacometrics exercise and model-based conclusions is considered of relevance for the adolescent dosage claim. PK simulations indicate that the 200 mg q2w (30 to &lt;60 kg) dosage regimen and the 300 mg q2w dosage regimen ( ≥ 60 kg) in adolescents with CSU result in dupilumab exposure similar to that for 300 mg q2w dose regimens in adult patients with CSU. Thus, the proposed adolescent dosage regimen is supported.

PD response: To date there is no available validated CSU specific biomarker. Biomarker total IgE was evaluated in order to further characterize dupilumab's mode of action in CSU. In all 3 clinical trials, there was a decrease from baseline in total IgE at week 12, which was further enhanced at week 24 (approximately -50%). Overall, results on IgE are considered supportive information only and do not raise concern.

Exposure response analysis: The E-R relationship for efficacy in patients with CSU was investigated using both descriptive and model-based analyses. For the univariate descriptive analysis, the E-R relationship was explored by the use of Week 24 concentration quartiles as PK metrics (where steady state of the fixed dose was reached) for the efficacy endpoints UAS7, ISS7, and HSS7. Results were presented pooled for study A and C as well as separately for study B. For study B, stopped for futility analysis, no clear exposure-response relationship was determined for any of the efficacy endpoints investigated. Furthermore, no such relationship was seen for the efficacy parameter HSS7 in the pooled data from study A and C. With regard to UAS7 and ISS7 from studies A and C, the descriptive analysis showed a greater mean change from baseline with increasing dupilumab concentration obtained by the use of the applied fixed dosing regimen. With exposure seen in 3 rd  quartile there seems to be a plateau reached (no greater effect with 4 th  quartile). In the presented data set, the number of patients was rather low (approximately 30 per quartile group) with a high variability in exposure and a high range of the efficacy outcome in each quartile as well as placebo group (e.g. for ISS7 -21.0 to 8.0).

Empirical model-based PK/PD analyses were conducted with pooled data from Study C and Study A in patients with CSU for the efficacy endpoints UAS7, ISS7, and HSS7. A log-linear model provided best fit to study data. In agreement with the descriptive approach, the model-based PK/PD analyses indicated a greater increase of efficacy response with an increase in concentrations. Also with theses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyses, a plateau was reached with the 3 rd  quartile which corresponds to a Ctrough concentration of 75.8 mg/L.

As high body weight is associated with reduced exposure and with the applied fixed dose an exposureresponse relationship was seen with lower efficacy response with lower exposure, further discussion on potential efficacy loss in patients with highest body weight was required. Upon request the applicant presented relevant additional analyses for patients with body weight ≥ 100kg (approximately upper 10% in the data set) vs body weight &lt; 100 kg . The mean Ctrough was lower in patients with high body weight (27.6 mg/L in patients with body weight ≥100 kg vs 71.8 mg/L in patients with body weight &lt;100 kg). However, efficacy results for UAS7 and ISS7 at week 24 showed that the treatment effect was similar in the ≥100 kg subgroup compared to the overall population. Thus, although exposure was lower in the subgroup with highest body weight there is no evidence for loss of efficacy based on available data. Absence of a dosing recommendation in the SmPC with regard to body weight is accepted.

Immunogenicity: In all 3 studies the immunogenic potential of dupilumab in the CSU population was investigated by collection of ADA/nAB samples at baseline as well as week, 12, 24 and 36. At week 24, 4.7% of adult/adolescent patients were ADA positive; approximately 0.5% exhibited persistent ADA responses and approximately 1% had neutralizing antibodies. After treatment completion at week 36, the ADA-positivity rate further increased to 11.4%; None had high ADA titer. Most ADA-positive subjects were also nAB positive.

For comparison of ADA rates between dupilumab indications, different treatment duration, ages and co-treatments need to be considered. Here, treatment was only 24 weeks, median age was 43 years, data were merged for adults/adolescents and no immunosuppressive co-medication was applied. However, ADA incidence rates were within the range of other approved indications.

There was only 1 patient in study B with moderate ADA titer who had a low dupilumab exposure. For several other ADA positive patients with low ADA titer, dupilumab exposure was low but within the exposure range of ADA negative patients. It is agreed with the applicant that with this limited number of ADA positive patients, there were no meaningful associations observed between ADA formation and loss of efficacy in CSU.

## 2.4.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The provided data package is adequate for assessment of dupilumab clinical pharmacology in the planned CSU indication. All 3 studies utilized an adult SC dosing regimen with 300 mg dupilumab Q2W after a loading dose of 600 mg, which is already approved in other adult indications. The PK of dupilumab is well-known and PK characteristics in CSU were comparable to other populations in these approved indications. Regarding adolescents ( ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age), 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg were used for the group ≥ 60 kg, while 200 mg q2w with a loading dose of 400 mg were applied in the group ≥ 30 kg to &lt;60 kg. The proposed adolescent dosage regimen is already approved for AD and supported by simulations for the CSU population.

Body weight had an apparent effect on dupilumab exposure as previously seen in other indications. However, there is no evidence for loss of efficacy in CSU patients with high body weight based on available data. Absence of a dosing recommendation in the SmPC with regard to body weight is acceptable.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

No dose response study was performed.

## 2.5.2. Main studies

Data for clinical efficacy is based on the pivotal Study A and Study C in CSU patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine treatment and who were naïve to treatment with omalizumab (anti-IgE therapy). An additional supportive Study B included patients who were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.

All three studies were similarly designed phase 3 studies; multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with a 24-week treatment period. The studies were conducted under one master protocol ( EFC16461 ) and enrolled participants aged 6 years to 80 years (Study A and C) or aged 12 to 80 years (Study B).

Of note, Study B was stopped for futility, the results were distributed to medical staff and patients; thus bias cannot be excluded. Study B was assessed in the withdrawn variation EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0083 (see EMA website for published EPAR).

## EFC16461 Study A

EFC16461 Study A was a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in participants with CSU who remained symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine and who were naïve to omalizumab.

## Methods

The study consisted of 3 periods:

- Screening period (2 to 4 weeks)
- IMP treatment period (24 weeks ± 3 days)
- Post IMP treatment period (12 weeks ± 3 days)

## Study participants

## Key inclusion criteria were:

- P articipants ≥6 to 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent
- Diagnosis of CSU &gt;6 months prior to screening visit
- Presence of itch and hives for &gt;6 consecutive weeks at any time prior to screening visit despite the use of H1-antihistamine during that time period.
- Participants using a study defined H1-antihistamine for CSU treatment and who were on a stable H1-antihistamine dose* for at least 3 consecutive days prior to the screening visit
- During the 7 days before randomization: UAS7 ≥ 16 and ISS7 ≥ 8, with no missing electronic diary (e-diary) (UAS7 and ISS7).
- Participants who were omalizumab naïve.

*Per protocol, participants should remain on their prescreening non-sedating H1-AH dose. Only up to 4 fold the recommended dose is allowed. If participants are on dose higher than 4-fold the recommended dose at screening, the Investigator can adjust the participant dose to the stipulated range at the screening visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Key exclusion criteria were:

- Body weight less than 30 kg in adults and adolescents and 15 kg in children aged ≥ 6 to &lt;12 years
- Clearly defined underlying etiology for chronic urticarias other than CSU (main manifestation being physical urticaria), such as inducible urticaria and diseases with possible symptoms of urticaria or angioedema.
- Presence of skin morbidities other than CSU that may interfere with the assessment of the study outcomes.
- Patients with active AD.
- Severe concomitant illness(es) that, in the Investigator's judgment, would adversely affect the patient's participation in the study.
- Diagnosed active endoparasitic infections; suspected or high risk of endoparasitic infection, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessment have ruled out active infection before randomization.
- Active chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the screening visit and during the screening period.
- Known or suspected immunodeficiency, including history of invasive opportunistic infections.
- History of systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy.
- Patient with any other medical or psychological condition including relevant laboratory or electrocardiogram abnormalities at screening that, in the opinion of the Investigator, suggest a new and/or insufficiently understood disease, may present an unreasonable risk to the study participant as a result of his/her participation in this clinical trial, may make patient's participation unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments.
- Current history of substance and/or alcohol abuse.
- Treatment with biologics as follows: Any cell-depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab within 6 months before the screening visit; Omalizumab within 4 months before the screening visit; other monoclonal antibodies (which are biological response modifiers): within 5 half-lives (if known) or 16 weeks before the screening visit (Visit 1), whichever is longer.

## Treatments

Dupilumab 300 mg q2w (adults and those adolescents ≥ 60 kg)

Dupilumab 200 mg q2w (adolescents &lt;60 kg)

Dupilumab 300 mg q4w (children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age &lt;30 kg and ≥ 15 kg)

Placebo administered as 1 SC injection of placebo matching dupilumab 300 mg or 200 mg

## Background Medication

Participants were expected to continue their established standard of care background therapy with long-acting non-sedating H1-antihistamines, at up to 4-fold the recommended dose (up to 2-fold for participants in Japan). If participants were on a dose higher than 4-fold (2-fold in Japan) the recommended dose at screening visit, the Investigator had to adjust the participant dose within the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stipulated range at the screening visit. Participants were expected to continue to take the same daily dose throughout the study unless they experienced a flare for which rescue therapy might be initiated.

## Rescue Medication

All participants on 1- to 3-fold the approved H1-antihistamine dose (maintenance dose used at screening) were allowed to take additional doses of their H1-antihistamine medications as rescue therapy as long as they did not exceed 4-fold the recommended dose (up to 2-fold for participants in Japan) during the study. If symptoms were still uncontrolled after receiving the maximum allowed dose (ie, 4-fold the recommended dose) of H1-antihistamine, or participants already using the maximum allowed H1-antihistamine dose could take a short course of OCS as rescue therapy during the treatment and follow-up periods.

## Objectives

Primary objective:

-  To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab in study participants with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamines in omalizumab naïve patients

The primary objective of both studies was to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab compared with placebo in improving urticaria activity as measured by UAS7 in participants with CSU (EU and EU reference countries). The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated at Week 24 in both studies.

## Secondary objectives

- To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on the reduction of itch severity (ISS7)
- To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on reduction of hives severity (HSS7)
- To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on urticaria control
- To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on angioedema
- To demonstrate improvement in health-related quality of life and overall disease status and severity
- To evaluate the ability of dupilumab in reducing the proportion of patients who require treatment with OCS

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint:

- Change from baseline in weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, composite patient reported itch and hive score) at Week 24

## Secondary endpoints (multiplicity controlled):

- Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24
- Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24
- Proportion of participants with ISS7 ≥ 5 response at Week 24
- Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 24
- Proportion of patients with UAS7 =0 at Week 24

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24

Other secondary endpoints

- Change from baseline in angioedema activity score over 7 days (AAS7) at Week 12 and Week 24
- Time-to-event and proportion of patients receiving OCS for CSU during the planned treatment period
- Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) in patients ≥ 16 years old, and in Children ' s Dermatology Life
- Quality Index (CDLQI) in patients ≥6 to &lt;16 years old at Week 12 and Week 24
- Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of CSU at Week 12 and Week 24
- Change from baseline in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) of CSU at Week 12 and Week 24

## Sample size

An absolute change of 10 in the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) and of 5 in the weekly itch severity score (ISS7) was considered the minimal clinically important difference (MDD). Based upon a SD of 14, a change of 10 in the UAS7 would correspond to an effect size of approximately 0.7. Based upon a SD of 7, a change of 5 in the ISS7 would correspond to an effect size of approximately 0.7. Based on these assumptions, plus the assumption of a 15% dropout rate, a 2-sided t-test with alpha = 0.05 has a power of 96% (to reject the null hypothesis of equal group means) if the effect size is 0.7 (between the dupilumab arm and placebo) and 65 patients per group are included. This sample size estimate applies to both ISS7 (primary endpoint for all countries except EU and EU reference countries) and UAS7 (primary endpoint for EU and EU reference countries).

## Randomisation

All participants were centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an interactive response technology (IRT). Sanofi generated the randomized intervention kit number list centrally and IMPs (dupilumab 300 mg, dupilumab 200 mg, or their matching placebo) are packaged in accordance with this list. The IRT generated the participant randomization list and allocated the intervention number and the corresponding intervention kits to the participants according to it.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control group, respectively. The randomization was stratified first by age (adults versus adolescents versus children; up to approximately 5% of total sample size for children and approximately 5% of total sample size for adolescents). In adults, randomization was stratified further by country. In adolescents/children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age, randomization was not stratified further.

## Blinding

This was a double-blind study. Dupilumab 300 mg/200 mg and placebo matching dupilumab 300 mg/200 mg was provided in identically matched 2 mL/1.14 mL pre-filled syringes that are visually indistinguishable for each dose. Syringes and box was labeled with a treatment kit number. While these were double-blind trials with regard to the treatment with either dupilumab or placebo, they were not blinded to weight-based dose levels, due to the different volume size (2 mL versus 1.14 mL) of the dose level of dupilumab (300 mg/matching placebo or 200 mg/matching placebo) that were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

used for the different weight categories for adolescents and children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age. In addition, in children, the study was not blinded to dose regimen due to the different frequency of IMP administration (q4w versus q2w).

## Primary and Secondary Estimands

The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints was the ITT population. The primary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline value of the primary endpoint, intervention group, presence of angioedema at baseline, and region as covariates, with intercurrent events and missing data being handled by a hybrid method of the worstobservation carried forward (WOCF) and multiple imputation.

## Intercurrent events and corresponding strategy:

- Prohibited medications and/or rescue medications : For participants taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications, their data after the medication start date were set to missing, and the worst postbaseline value on or before the time of the medication usage was used to impute missing Week 24 value (for participants whose postbaseline values were all missing, the baseline was used to impute).
- Discontinuation of study treatment:

Participants who discontinued the intervention prematurely were encouraged to follow the planned clinical visits and in these participants, who did not take the selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications, all data collected after intervention discontinuation was used in the analysis. For these participants, missing data may still happen despite all efforts to collect the data after intervention discontinuation.

- o Lack of efficacy: For participants who discontinued study intervention due to lack of efficacy, all data collected after discontinuation was used in the analysis, and a WOCF approach was used to impute missing Week 24 value if needed (ie due to study discontinuation).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Other reasons: For participants who discontinued study intervention not due to lack of efficacy, a multiple imputation approach was used to impute missing Week 24 value. This multiple imputation used all participants excluding participants who had taken the selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications on or before Week 24 and excluding participants who discontinued due to lack of efficacy on or before Week 24. Each of the imputed complete data was analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model as described above. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data was combined using Rubin's rule.

The secondary estimands largely correspond to the primary estimands.

## Supplementary Analysis for Primary Endpoint

## 1. Pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo after WOCF

After using the WOCF approach to impute data after taking the select prohibited/rescue medications and to impute missing data for participants who discontinue treatment due to lack of efficacy (as described for the primary analysis) the primary endpoint was analyzed with imputed missing Week 24 values using a pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo. This copy increment from placebo implies that when participants discontinue intervention early, they continue to take advantage of their previous therapy, but they progress in the same way as participants in the placebo group.

The imputed dataset was analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model same as the one in primary analysis.

## 2. Pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo without WOCF

All data after taking the select prohibited/rescue medications was set to missing. The primary endpoint was analyzed with imputed missing Week 24 values using a pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo (described above).

## 3. Tipping point analysis for missing data

After using the WOCF approach to impute data after taking select prohibited/rescue medications and to impute missing data for participants who discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy (as described for the primary analysis), a tipping point analysis was performed for the primary endpoint with imputed missing Week 24 values as follows:

- Step 1. Monotone missing pattern was induced by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using PROC MI: for participants who had intermediate missing values, the intermediate missing values was imputed assuming a multivariate normal distribution over observations from all visits. 40 datasets with a monotone missing pattern was obtained using this method.
- Step 2. For each of the imputed dataset with monotone missing pattern obtained in Step 1, the remaining missing data was imputed using the regression method for the monotone pattern with adjustment for covariates including response variable, intervention groups, angioedema at baseline, region, and baseline value of the corresponding endpoint. All available data in the monotone missing pattern data was used. One imputed dataset was obtained for each of the imputed dataset at Step 1. So, 40 fully imputed datasets were obtained altogether.
- Step 3. The imputed values in dupilumab group were added by a positive amount d for each imputed data set.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Step 4. The imputed values in placebo group were subtracted by a positive amount p for each imputed data set.
- Step 5. Change from baseline in endpoint was analyzed using ANCOVA model same as the one in primary analysis. Then the SAS MIANALYZE procedure was used to generate statistical inferences by combining results from the 40 analyses using Rubin's formula.

Step 3 to Step 5 was repeated iteratively until the p-value for treatment effect of dupilumab compared to placebo estimated in Step 5 was &gt; 0.05.

LS mean difference between dupilumab and placebo in change from baseline in primary endpoint at Week 24 and the corresponding p-values was provided for each combination of shift parameters.

The following supplementary analysis was performed:

- As-observed analysis (Including all data after taking selected prohibited and/or rescue medications):

The data collected after taking the select prohibited medications and/or rescue medications was included in the sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results with respect to the intercurrent event handling strategy while taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications (eg. treatment policy strategy). For missing data, a multiple imputation approach was used to impute missing Week 24 value, and this multiple imputation will use all participants.

## Multiplicity

A multiplicity procedure was defined in the SAP to control the overall type-I error rate for testing the primary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall alpha is 0.05. The comparisons with placebo will be tested based on the hierarchical order below at 2-sided α = 0.05:

1. Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24
2. Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24
3. Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤6 at Week 24
4. Proportion of patients with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24
5. Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24
6. Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 12
7. Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 12
8. Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤6 at Week 12
9. Proportion of patients with MID (ISS7 ≥5) response at Week 24
10. Proportion of patients with MID (ISS7 ≥5) response at Week 12
11. Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 12
12. Proportion of patients with UAS7 = 0 at Week 12
13. Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24
14. Change from baseline in UCT at Week 12

Study A is considered positive when the primary endpoint (change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24) achieves statistical significance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subgroup Analyses

To assess the homogeneity of the treatment effect across various subgroups, analyses were performed on the primary endpoint across the following subgroups:

- Age group (&lt;median, ≥ median; &lt;65, ≥65 years)
- Gender (Male, Female)
- Baseline weight ( &lt;median, ≥median, &lt;60, ≥60 kg)
- Baseline BMI (&lt;25, ≥25 -&lt;30, ≥30 kg/m 2)
- Region
- Territory
- Race (White, all the Others)
- Ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic)
- Angioedema at baseline (Yes, No)
- Baseline UAS7 score (&lt;28, ≥28)
- Baseline ISS7 score (&lt;13, ≥13)
- Duration of disease (&lt;2, 2 -10, &gt;10 years)
- H1-AH baseline dose (1-fold, 2-4-fold)
- Baseline Total serum IgE (&lt;median, ≥ median)

To assess the consistency of the treatment effects across the subgroup levels, subgroup analyses was conducted for the primary endpoint at Week 24. The analysis was performed based on imputed datasets from the primary analysis.

To test the interaction between intervention and subgroup factor, an ANCOVA model incorporating subgroup-by-treatment interaction was built for each subgroup variable. The model included all the covariates in the main statistical model plus the subgroup variable (if not one of the covariates adjusted in the main model already) and the subgroup-by-treatment interaction. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data was combined using Rubin's rule. A p-value for the test of interaction was provided based on the combined inference.

In each subgroup, the primary endpoint was analyzed using the primary approach for the primary endpoint, but on the specific subgroup of the imputed primary analysis population.

The primary analysis data cut-off:

05 October 2021

## Conduct of the study

Protocol amendments (related to Study A): The original master protocol dated 24 October 2019 was modified per 3 global amendments (amendment 02 dated 30 April 2020, amendment 04 dated 29 April 2021, amendment 05 dated 17 March 2022) and 2 local amendments (amendment 01 for Japan dated 10 February 2020, amendment 03 for France dated 09 October 2020). Amendment 02 included a switch of the primary and the key secondary endpoints to establish the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) as the primary endpoint for European Union (EU) and EU reference countries based on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recommendations from European Medicines Agency (EMA). Amendment 04 and Amendment 05 were not applicable to Study A.

COVID-19 pandemic: EFC16461 Study A was conducted during the global COVID-19 pandemic which began in March 2020. The study began in February 2020 and continued without stoppage during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The overall impact of the pandemic however was minimal on the conduct of EFC16461 Study B, in terms of the ability to retain participants on study treatment, to complete study visits, to conduct study monitoring, and to collect and verify the efficacy and safety data. The integrity of the study data and the scientific validity of the study remained intact.

Protocol deviations: Major protocol deviations were reported in 12 (17.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 10 (14.7%) in the placebo group. The most frequently reported major protocol deviations were in the categories of \"Assessments/procedures\" (2 [2.9%] participants in the dupilumab group and 5 [7.4%] in the placebo group), \"Concomitant medications/therapy\" (4 [5.7%] and 2 [2.9%], respectively), and \"Inclusion/exclusion criteria\" (4 [5.7%] and 2 [2.9%]). There were no deviations assessed as critical in this study.

Breaking of the blind: There was no breaking of the blind during the study either by the Sponsor for regulatory purposes (as there were no reported suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [SUSAR]) or by the Investigator for safety purposes.

## Baseline data

## Demographics

The mean (SD) age of the participants was 41.3 (15.5) years with a range of 8 to 77 years, 65.9% were females, and the majority of participants (68.8%) were White. There were 132 adults (95.7%), 4 adolescents (≥12 to &lt;18 years) (2.9%), and 2 children (≥6 to &lt;12 years) (1.4%) randomized in the study. The mean body weight at screening was 76.48 kg, with 26 (19.0%) participants weighing &lt;60 kg and 111 (81.0%) participants weighing ≥60 kg. No participants weighed &lt;30 kg at screening.

## Baseline disease characteristics

The mean (SD) age at onset of CSU was 36.1 (16.2) years. The mean (SD) time since first diagnosis of CSU prior to study entry was 5.7 (8.5) years; 70.3% of participants had more than 1 year of disease duration prior to study participation. The mean (SD) ISS7 and UAS7 scores at baseline were 15.9 (4.0) and 31.3 (7.7), respectively, indicative of severe itch and urticaria activity at baseline for the enrolled participants. Per protocol, all participants had at least moderate urticaria activity (UAS7 score =16 to 27 at baseline) with the vast majority of participants (70.3%) with severe urticaria activity (UAS7 score of ≥28 at baseline). A total of 62 (44.9%) participants presented with angioedema at baseline (AAS7 &gt;0). At baseline, all participants were receiving H1-antihistamines for CSU, with 52.2% on standard approved dose, 31.2% on 2- to 3-fold of standard dose, and 16.7% on 4-fold of standard dose. The mean total IgE at baseline was 540.3 IU/mL and the median total IgE at baseline was 101.0 IU/mL.

## Medical history and concurrent illnesses

The most common predefined medical history was angioedema, reported in 52.2% of participants overall. Other common predefined medical histories (in &gt;10% of participants overall) included allergic rhinitis (29.0%), asthma (15.2%), and allergic conjunctivitis (10.1%). As required by protocol eligibility criteria, no participants had active AD at study entry; although 5.8% of participants had previous history of AD. There were 8 participants with medical history of CSU associated autoimmune

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

disorders such as autoimmune thyroiditis (6 [4.3%] participants), and Basedow's (Grave's) disease (2 [1.4%] participants).

## Prior and concomitant medications

The prior medications used for CSU, including H1-antihistamines and oral corticosteroids (OCS), were balanced between intervention groups. The most commonly used H1-antihistamine was cetirizine/cetirizine hydrochloride (58.7%), and the most commonly used OCS was prednisone (7.2%).

No participants had omalizumab as prior medication, as per inclusion criteria I 07 for this study. One participant had prior exposure to ligelizumab (an experimental anti-IgE agent) more than 3 years before entering this study. During the study, 5 participants (3 in the dupilumab group and 2 in the placebo group) received omalizumab which was prohibited per protocol.

At baseline, all participants were receiving H1-antihistamines for CSU, with 52.2% on standard dose, 31.2% on 2- to 3-fold of standard dose, and 16.7% on 4-fold of standard dose.

## Numbers analysed

All randomized participants (n= 138; dupilumab: 70; placebo: 68) were included in the final efficacy population (ITT population).

## Primary efficacy endpoint

## Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 was -20.53 in the dupilumab group versus 12.00 in the placebo group with a LS mean difference of -8.53 (95% CI: -13.16, -3.90; p=0.0003).

In the dupilumab group, the mean (SD) UAS7 score improved from a severe activity score of 31.86 (7.18) at baseline to mild urticaria status (11.54 [12.22]) at Week 24. In comparison, the mean (SD) UAS7 score in the placebo group decreased from severe (30.76 [8.19]) at baseline to 19.75 (14.58) at Week 24, reaching moderate urticaria activity status.

WOCF: Worst observation carried forward; MI: Multiple imputation

a Each of the imputed complete data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with the corresponding baseline value, intervention group, presence of angioedema at baseline, and regions as covariates.

Note: Data collected after study intervention discontinuation were included. Data post select prohibited/rescue medications were set to missing and imputed by WOCF. Missing data after study intervention discontinuation for lack of efficacy were imputed by WOCF; other missing data were imputed by MI. Descriptive statistics at Week 24 include participants after WOCF at Week 24, and participants whose values were imputed by MI at Week 24 were excluded from the descriptive analysis.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

## Proportion of participants with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 24

At Week 24, 45.7% of participants in the dupilumab group had their CSU symptoms well controlled (UAS7 ≤ 6) compared with 23.5% in the placebo group, with a statistically significant odds ratio (OR) versus placebo (95% CI) of 2.848 (1.301, 6.234); p = 0.0075.

## Proportion of participants with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24

A statistically significant proportion of participants in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group achieved complete resolution of CSU symptoms with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24: 31.4% in the dupilumab group versus 13.2% in the placebo group, with an OR versus placebo (95% CI) of 2.908 (1.173, 7.209); p = 0.0199.

## Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24 was -10.24 in the dupilumab group versus 6.01 in the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant (-4.23, 95% CI: -6.63, -1.84, p=0.0005).

## Proportion of ISS7 minimal important difference (MID) (≥5 points) responders at Week 24

A greater proportion of participants with an ISS7 MID response at Week 24 compared with placebo (52.2 with an OR versus placebo of 3.413 (95% CI: 1.596, 7.299; p=0.0014) was observed.

## Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24 was -10.28 in the dupilumab group versus -5.90 in the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant (LS mean difference versus placebo: -4.38, 95% CI: -6.78, -1.98, p=0.0003).

## Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in UCT at Week 24 was 7.71 in the dupilumab group versus 4.88 in the placebo group. A greater increase in UCT was observed in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group at Week 24 (LS mean difference: 2.84, nominal p=0.0004). At Week 24, approximately half of participants (34 [48.6%]) treated with dupilumab were well-controlled (UCT ≥ 12) compared to 21 (30.9%) participants treated with placebo.

## Angioedema activity score over 7 days (AAS7)

At baseline, only 28 (40%) participants in the dupilumab group and 34 (50%) of participants in the placebo group had active angioedema (AAS7 score &gt;0), with a mean AAS7 score of 32.14 and 35.29, respectively. At Week 24, the LS mean change (decrease) from baseline in AAS7 was -22.51 in the dupilumab group and -23.13 in the placebo group, showing no difference between the two groups.

## Treatment effect after study intervention discontinuation

## Change from baseline in ISS7 and UAS7 post-treatment

In Study A, a total of 56 participants in the dupilumab group and 51 participants in the placebo group reported post-intervention data at Week 36 for UAS7, ISS7, and HSS7. Post treatment, the mean ISS7 and UAS7 scores in the dupilumab group remained lower compared with the placebo group during the 12-week follow-up period. The mean (SD) UAS7 score in the dupilumab group was 11.54 (12.22) at Week 24 and 13.10 (13.45) at Week 36, compared with 19.75 (14.58) (Week 24) and 18.77 (15.27) (Week 36) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) ISS7 score in the dupilumab group was 5.83 (6.08) at Week 24 and 6.86 (6.97) at Week 36, compared with 10.19 (7.52) (Week 24) and 9.83 (7.97) (Week 36) in the placebo group.

## EFC16461 Study C

EFC16461 Study C was a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in participants with CSU who remained symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine and who were naïve to omalizumab.

The study served as a replication study for Study A and was conducted under the same master protocol (EFC16461) and included overall the same design elements as Study A.

## Methods

See Study A

## Study participants

The same inclusion and exclusion criteria as for Study A were used:

- Study C enrolled adult patients up to 80 years and paediatric patients aged ≥6 to &lt;18 years

## Treatments

Same treatment and background or rescue medication as within Study A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives, Outcomes/endpoints

Same objectives and endpoints as for Study A.

## Sample size

Assumptions for sample size calculations for Study C were based on Study A results.

An effect size of 0.564 or higher is assumed. Based upon an SD of 7.5 (pooled SD from the observed data in Study A), a treatment difference of 4.23 in the ISS7 would correspond to an effect size of approximately 0.564. Based upon an SD of 14.3 (pooled SD from the observed data in Study A), a treatment difference of 8.53 in the UAS7 would correspond to an effect size of approximately 0.597. Based on these assumptions, plus the assumption of a 10% dropout rate, it is estimated that 75 participants per group will provide 90% power to detect an effect size of 0.564 or higher between the dupilumab arm and placebo using a 2-sided t-test with alpha = 0.05. This sample size estimate applies to both ISS7 and UAS7 (primary endpoint for EU and EU reference countries).

## Randomisation

Randomization was in general performed as for Study A.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control group, respectively. The randomization was stratified first by age (adults versus adolescents versus children; up to approximately 5% of total sample size for children and approximately 5% of total sample size for adolescents). In adults, randomization was stratified further by country and angioedema. In adolescents/children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age, randomization was not stratified further.

In Study A, overall 52% of participants received H1-AH at recommended doses as background therapy, and 45% of participants presented with angioedema at baseline. To maintain consistency between the study population in studies A and C, and reflect the real-life distribution of patients with angioedema and uncontrolled by both standard dose or maximal H1-AH therapy, it was planned that Study C would include not more than approximately 50% (n=75) of participants having their H1-AH therapy at recommended doses, and not less than approximately 30% (n=45), and not more than approximately 45% (n=68) of participants presenting with angioedema at baseline. It was anticipated that approximately 30%-40% of enrolled participants will have angioedema.

## Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study with the same blinding procedures as in Study A. See there for details.

## Statistical methods

Statistical methods were overall the same as for Study A.

Analysis Populations and Estimands: Same as in Study A.

Supplementary Analysis for Primary Endpoint: Overall, the same sensitivity analyses were planned as in Study A (see above).

The Pattern mixture model with copy increment from placebo without WOCF was dropped. Additionally, a worst possible score analysis and an as-observed analysis was planned.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Multiplicity

A multiplicity procedure was defined in the SAP to control the overall type-I error rate for testing the primary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall alpha is 0.05. The comparisons with placebo will be tested based on the hierarchical order below at 2-sided α = 0.05:

1. Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24
2. Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24
3. Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24
4. Proportion of patients with MID (ISS7 ≥5) response at week 24
5. Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 24
6. Proportion of patients with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24
7. Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 12
8. Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24

Study C was to be considered positive when the primary endpoint (change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24 in non-EU countries or change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 in EU and EU reference countries) achieved statistical significance.

## Subgroup Analyses

The same subgroup analyses were planned as in study A. In addition, the primary endpoint was to be analyzed in the subgroups of adults and adolescent participants. China subpopulation was to be considered for primary efficacy, key secondary efficacy, and important safety analyses (which are for China submission and may be performed outside of the main Clinical Study Report).

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments (related to Study C)

The original master protocol dated 24 October 2019 was modified per 3 global amendments (amendment 02 dated 30 April 2020, amendment 04 dated 29 April 2021, amendment 05 dated 17 March 2022) and 2 local amendments (amendment 01 for Japan dated 10 February 2020, amendment 03 for France dated 09 October 2020).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Amendment 02 included a switch of the primary and the key secondary endpoints to establish the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) as the primary endpoint for European Union (EU) and EU reference countries based on recommendations from European Medicines Agency (EMA). Amendment 04 was not applicable to Study C. Amendment 05 introduced the conduct of Study C into the master protocol. As compared to Study A, Study C included not more than approximately 50% of participants having their H1-AH therapy at recommended doses, and not less than approximately 30% but not more than approximately 45% of participants presenting with angioedema at baseline. Stratification by presence of angioedema at baseline was added in Study C.

## Protocol deviations

Major protocol deviations were reported in 31 (41.9%) participants in the dupilumab group and 22 (28.6%) in the placebo group. The most frequently reported major protocol deviations were in the categories of \"Concomitant medications/therapy\" (12 [16.2%] and 10 [13.0%]), \"Randomization procedure\" (11 [14.9%] and 4 [5.2%]), and \"Informed consent procedures\" (6 [8.1%] and 5 [6.5%]). Major deviations pre-identified as potentially impacting the primary endpoint were reported in 4 (5.4%) participants in the dupilumab group and 3 (3.9%) participants in the placebo group.

d Includes 1 participant on .5 standard dose and 1 participant on 1.285 standard dose both in the Study C dupilumab group.

## Medical history and concurrent illnesses

The most common predefined medical history was angioedema, reported in 29.8% of participants overall. Other common predefined medical histories (in &gt;10% of participants overall) included allergic rhinitis (7), asthma (14.6%), and allergic conjunctivitis (24.5%). There were 3 participants with medical history of CSU associated autoimmune disorders including 1 (1.4%) participant in the dupilumab group with autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), 1 (1.3%) participant in the placebo group with both primary biliary cholangitis and Sjogren's syndrome, and 1 (1.3%) participant in the placebo group with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

## Prior and concomitant medications

The prior medications used for CSU, including H1-antihistamines and oral corticosteroids (OCS), were balanced between intervention groups. The most commonly used H1-antihistamine was bilastine (32.5%), and the most commonly used OCS were dexamethasone dipropionate (4.6%) and prednisone (4.6%). One (0.7%) participant had prior exposure to omalizumab and was thus not considered as naïve to omalizumab. One (0.7%) participant had prior exposure an experimental anti-IgE antibody more than 2.5 years before entering the study.

## Numbers analysed

All randomized participants (n= 151; dupilumab: 74; placebo: 77) were included in the final efficacy population (ITT population).

## Primary efficacy endpoint

## Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 was -15.86 in the dupilumab group versus 11.21 in the placebo group with a LS mean difference of -4.65 (95% CI: -8.16, -0.65; p=0.0226).

In the dupilumab group, the mean (SD) UAS7 score improved from a severe activity score of 28.57 (7.09) at baseline to mild urticaria status (11.98 [12.15]) at Week 24. In comparison, the mean (SD) UAS7 score in the placebo group decreased from severe (28.07 [7.88]) at baseline to 15.96 (12.68) at Week 24, being closely below the threshold for reaching moderate urticaria activity status (UAS7=16).

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

## Proportion of participants with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 24

At Week 24, 40.5% of participants in the dupilumab group had their CSU symptoms well controlled (UAS7 ≤ 6) compared with 23.4% in the placebo group, with a statistically significant odds ratio (OR) versus placebo (95% CI) of 3.137 (1.371, 7.176); p = 0.0045.

## Proportion of participants with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24

A statistically significant proportion of participants in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group achieved complete resolution of CSU symptoms with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24: 29.7% in the dupilumab group versus 18.2% in the placebo group, with an OR versus placebo (95% CI) of 2.677 (1.127, 6.359); p = 0.0187.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24 was -8.64 in the dupilumab group versus -6.10 in the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant (-2.54, 95% CI: -4.65, -0.43, p=0.0184).

## Proportion of ISS7 minimal important difference (MID) (≥5 points) responders at Week 24

A greater proportion of participants with an ISS7 MID response at Week 24 compared with placebo (70.3% versus 51.9%), with an OR versus placebo of 2.507 (95% CI: 1.231, 5.107; p=0.0109) was observed.

## Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24 was -7.27 in the dupilumab group versus -5.11 in the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant (LS mean difference versus placebo: -2.17, 95% CI: -4.15, -0.19, p=0.0316).

## Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24

The LS mean change from baseline in UCT at Week 24 was 5.09 in the dupilumab group versus 4.16 in the placebo group. No difference between the groups could be detected (LS mean difference: 0.93, p= 0.1940).

## Treatment effect after study intervention discontinuation

## Change from baseline in ISS7 and UAS7 post-treatment

Post treatment, the mean ISS7 and UAS7 scores in the dupilumab group remained lower compared with the placebo group during the 12-week follow-up period. The mean (SD) ISS7 score in the dupilumab group was 5.83 (6.08) at Week 24 and 6.86 (6.97) at Week 36, compared with 10.19 (7.52) (Week 24) and 9.83 (7.97) (Week 36) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) UAS7 score in the dupilumab group was 11.54 (12.22) at Week 24 and 13.10 (13.45) at Week 36, compared with 19.75 (14.58) (Week 24) and 18.77 (15.27) (Week 36) in the placebo group.

## Supportive studies

## EFC16461 Study B (supportive)

EFC16461 Study B was a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adult and adolescent participants with CSU who remained symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine and who were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab. Study B was conducted together with Study A and C (see 11.2.1 and 11.2.2) under one master protocol (EFC16461) and included overall the same design elements but with a different study population recruited. Differences in study design as compared to Study A and C are described in the following.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

See Study A

## Study participants

The same inclusion and exclusion criteria as for Study B were used with the following exceptions:

- Study B enrolled adult and adolescent patients (≥ 12 to 80 years)
- Study B enrolled participants who were omalizumab intolerant or incomplete responders

Participants were considered as intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab if they were treated for CSU with at least 300 mg (q4w) of omalizumab for at least 3 months (minimum of injections) and had an inadequate response or were intolerant, resulting in treatment discontinuation, as confirmed by Investigator assessment. Information about intolerance or incomplete response to omalizumab had to be well documented in the patient´s medical records.

## Treatments

Same treatment and background or rescue medication as for Study A and C.

## Objectives, Outcomes/endpoints

Same objectives and endpoints as for Study A and C.

## Sample size

An absolute change of 10 in the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) was considered the minimal clinically important difference (MDD). Based upon a SD of 14, a change of 10 in the UAS7 would correspond to an effect size of approximately 0.7. Based on these assumptions, plus the assumption of a 15% dropout rate, a 2-sided t-test with alpha = 0.05 has a power of 90% (to reject the null hypothesis of equal group means) if the effect size is 0.7 (between the dupilumab arm and placebo) and 52 patients per group are included. This sample size estimate applies to both ISS7 (primary endpoint for all countries except EU and EU reference countries) and UAS7 (primary endpoint for EU and EU reference countries).

Considering the reduced drop-out rate of 10% observed during the study, an interim analysis (introduced with Amendment 4, 29 Apr 2021) had been performed when the first 83 randomized patients had completed their Week 24 visit by the interim analysis cut-off date. Using the O'BrienFleming approach with information fraction 0.77 and overall type-I error controlled at 0.05, the alpha spending at this interim analysis was 0.021, and the alpha spending at the final analyses when all 108 patients completed the study was 0.043.

At the interim analysis, it was estimated that 42 patients per group would provide 77% power to detect a treatment effect of 10 or higher with SD 14 and MDD of approximately 7.4 for UAS7 between the dupilumab arm and placebo using a 2-sided t-test with alpha = 0.021. The overall power for the study was approximately 88%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

All participants were centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an interactive response technology (IRT). Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control group, respectively.  The randomization was stratified first by age (adults versus adolescents; up to approximately 5% of total sample size for adolescents). In adults, randomization was stratified further by country. In adolescents/children ≥6 to &lt;12 years of age, randomization was not stratified further.

## Blinding

This was a double-blind study with the same blinding procedures as in Study A. See there for details.

In addition, to maintain the study integrity following the interim analysis (IA) with respect to subsequent study conduct and/or data analyses, a dissemination plan was prepared prior to IA database lock to clearly define and set up 2 separate study teams (blinded and unblinded), an independent-to-Sponsor statistical group for IA, and an independent-to-Sponsor Interim Analysis Review Committee (IARC). For the 2 separate study teams, appropriate steps were implemented to ensure that the study remained blinded to all individuals involved in the conduct of the study and/or analysis after the IA, and to protect the overall blinding and integrity of the Study B data following the IA. The IA was performed by the independent-to-Sponsor statistical group and the IA results were reviewed by the independent-to-Sponsor IARC. The IARC was responsible for analyzing and reviewing the interim efficacy results and providing guidance on the outcome (ie, 'efficacy at IA', 'stop for futility', or 'continue up to EOT for the primary analysis').

## Statistical methods

Statistical methods were largely in line with Study A with the following key differences:

## Multiplicity

A multiplicity procedure was proposed to control the overall type-I error rate for testing the primary and selected secondary endpoints. The overall type-I error is controlled at 0.05. The alpha spending at the interim analysis (introduced with Amendment 4, 29 Apr 2021) was 0.021, and the alpha spending at the final analyses when all 108 patients completed the study was 0.043.

At the interim analysis, the comparisons with placebo was tested based on the hierarchical order below at 2-sided alpha=0.021, at the final analysis based on the hierarchical order below at 2-sided alpha=0.043.

The hierarchical order of the endpoints was defined as:

1. Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24
2. Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24
3. Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24
4. Proportion of patients with MID (ISS7 ≥ 5) response at Week 24
5. Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤ 6 at Week 24
6. Proportion of patients with UAS7 = 0 at Week 24
7. Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24

## Interim Analysis

An interim analysis (IA) was performed when the first 83 randomized participants would have completed their 24-week treatment period by the interim analysis cut-off date 17.12.2021. This interim analysis used the O'Brien-Fleming approach with information fraction 0.77 and overall type-I error controlled at 0.05, with an alpha spending at the interim analysis of 0.021, and an alpha spending at the final analysis (when all 108 patients complete the study) of 0.043.

The possible outcomes from this interim analysis are summarized below:

## Recruitment

## EFC16461 Study B

First participant enrolled:

03 March 2020

Last participant visit:

23 June 2022

The primary analysis data cut-off:

18 July 2022

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments (related to Study B)

The original master protocol dated 24 October 2019 was modified per 3 global amendments (amendment 02 dated 30 April 2020, amendment 04 dated 29 April 2021, amendment 05 dated 17 March 2022) and 2 local amendments (amendment 01 for Japan dated 10 February 2020, amendment 03 for France dated 09 October 2020).

Amendment 02 included a switch of the primary and the key secondary endpoints to establish the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) as the primary endpoint for European Union (EU) and EU reference countries based on recommendations from European Medicines Agency (EMA). Amendment 04 introduced an interim analysis for Study B after 80 randomized participants completed their 24week treatment period. Amendment 05 was not applicable to Study B.

## COVID-19 pandemic

EFC16461 Study B was conducted during the global COVID-19 pandemic which began in March 2020. The study began in February 2020 and continued without stoppage during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, contingency measures in study conduct were introduced in amendment 02, which allowed implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms such as phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled staff (as permitted per local regulation) to ensure the study continuity and protect participants' safety. No waivers to deviate from protocol enrolment criteria due to COVID-19 were granted. Remote monitoring was implemented when on-site monitoring was not allowed. All temporary mechanisms utilized and deviations from planned study procedures were documented as being related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Interim analysis (protocol amendment 04)

An interim analysis (IA) of Study B was introduced via protocol amendment 04 to allow an earlier declaration of efficacy, continuation of the study, or study stop for futility (see 'Statistical methods; 5.4.2.1)). The proposed IA was to be conducted when the first 80 randomized participants (out of 104 planned) would have completed their 24-week treatment period by the IA cut-off date (17 Dec 2021). To maintain the study integrity following the IA with respect to subsequent study conduct and/or data analyses, a dissemination plan was prepared prior to IA database lock to clearly define and set up two separate study teams (blinded and unblinded), an independent-to-Sponsor statistical group, and an independent-to-Sponsor Interim Analysis Review Committee (IARC). The independent-to-Sponsor statistical group (WCG/ACI Clinical Services, Bala Cynwyd, PA, USA) was responsible for performing the interim efficacy analysis and providing the results to the IARC. The IARC was composed of 2 external experts (one statistician and one clinician) who were independent of Sponsor and without any involvement in the EFC16461 studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of the interim analysis (see Outcomes and estimation) met the protocol specified efficacy statistical criteria for futility and the Sponsor sent a notification to Investigators and sites on 18 February 2022 with instructions that the Investigators were to contact and inform participants who were still receiving study treatment and organize an early end-of-treatment visit. A public disclosure (press release) of interim analysis futility was issued on the same day (18 February 2022).

Given the status of the 25 participants not included in the interim analysis, the Sponsor decided to maintain the study integrity following the interim analysis with respect to subsequent study conduct and/or data analyses and conduct a final analysis after the conclusion of Study B when all randomized participants (ITT population) had completed their last study visit.

At the time of the interim analysis, the recruitment target had been met and recruitment had been closed at 108 randomized participants. The status of the 25 participants not included in the interim analysis (ITT24 population) at and/or after the public disclosure of futility (18 February 2022) was as follows:

- 1 participant had discontinued treatment (10 November 2021).
- 9 participants had completed their scheduled end-of-treatment visit.
- 12 participants were scheduled to complete their end-of-treatment visit within 1 month of public disclosure of futility and completed study treatment period.
- 3 participants discontinued study intervention (2 due to Sponsor Notification and 1 due to lack of efficacy).

## Protocol deviations

Major protocol deviations were reported in 24 participants overall, evenly distributed between the two intervention groups (12 [22.2%] participants in each group). The most frequently reported major protocol deviations were in the categories 'Inclusion/Exclusion criteria' (7 [13.0%] participants in the dupilumab group and 5 [9.3%] in the placebo group) and 'Concomitant medications/therapy' (2 [3.7%] in the dupilumab group and 5 [9.3%] in the placebo group). There were no deviations assessed as critical in the study.

In the 'Inclusion/exclusion criteria category', 7 participants had deviations related to not meeting inclusion criteria I 04 (all due to not meeting 'stable H1-antihistamine dose for at least 3 consecutive days prior to the screening'). 3 participants had deviations related to exclusion criteria E 17 'omalizumab treatment taken within 4 months before screening.' The 3 participants signed informed consent less than 4 months after the last omalizumab treatment, but all 3 participants were randomized more than 4 months after the last omalizumab treatment. 1 participant in the dupilumab group had a deviation related to not meeting inclusion criteria I 05 'During the 7 days before randomization: UAS7 ≥ 16 and ISS7 ≥ 8' due to missing 1 day of e-Diary entry in the 7 days before randomization.

7 participants had deviations in the 'Concomitant medications/therapy' category, all related to background H1-antihistamines not administered as per protocol (1 participant discontinued H1-AH after Week 14 per Investigator's decision for lack of efficacy, 2 participants had missing H1-AH doses for more than 7 days, 3 participants had missing H1-AH doses for 3 to 7 days, and 1 participant had an incident of taking 5-fold of standard H1-AH dose).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breaking of the blind

For the purpose of interim analysis, the blind was broken for the independent IARC and for the predefined unblinded team according to the dissemination plan. Post IA, the study was conducted by the blinded study team and proceeded to early EOT visit for all ongoing participants, as appropriate.

## Baseline data

## Demographics

The mean (SD) age of the participants was 47.7 (15.9) years with a range of 14 to 79 years, 72.2% were females, and the majority of participants (77.8%) were White. There were 106 (98.1%) adults and 2 (1.9%) adolescents ( ≥12 to &lt;18 years) randomized in the study. The mean body weight was 77.68 kg, with 21 (19.4%) of participants &lt;60 kg and 87 (80.6%) participants ≥ 60 kg. Two adolescents, one per each treatment group, were included in the study. There were no participants with body weight &lt;30 kg as per proto col defined exclusion criteria.

## Baseline disease characteristics

The mean (SD) age at onset of CSU was 39.1 (17.1) years. The mean (SD) time since first diagnosis of CSU prior to study entry was 9.1 (9.0) years; 98.1% of participants had more than 1 year of disease duration prior to study participation. The mean (SD) ISS7 and UAS7 scores at baseline were 16.0 (3.9) and 31.5 (8.0), respectively, indicative of severe itch and urticaria activity at baseline for the enrolled participants. Per protocol, all participants had at least moderate urticaria activity (UAS7 score =16 to 27 at baseline) with the vast majority of participants (69.4%) with severe urticaria activity (UAS7 score of ≥ 28 at baseline). A total of 53 (49.1%) participants presented with angioedema at baseline (AAS7 &gt;0). At baseline, there were 104 (96.3%) participants who were incomplete responders to omalizumab and 4 (3.7%) participants who were intolerant to omalizumab, with 56.5% of participants previously treated with omalizumab for ≥ 6 months. The majority (81.5%) of participants had previous exposure to the approved omalizumab 300 mg q4w dose regimen and 3.8% of participants had a dose regimen higher than the highest approved dose of 300 mg. All participants were receiving H1-antihistamines for CSU (including 1 participant in the placebo group whose baseline H1antihistamine treatment was confirmed after database lock), with 36.4% on standard approved dose, 38.3% on 2- to 3-fold of standard dose, and 25.2% on 4-fold of standard dose. The mean total IgE at baseline was 223.2 IU/mL and the median total IgE at baseline was 77.0 IU/mL.

## Medical history and concurrent illnesses

The most common predefined medical history was angioedema, reported in 64.8% of participants overall. Other common predefined medical histories (in &gt;10% of participants overall) included asthma (19.4%) and allergic rhinitis (17.6%). One participant in the placebo group had active AD at study entry which was an exclusion criterion and was reported as a minor protocol deviation; 5.6% of participants had previous history of AD overall.

Additionally, 12 (11.1%) participants had a medical history of at least 1 CSU-associated autoimmune disorder: autoimmune thyroid disease in 8 (7.4%) participants (4 with autoimmune thyroiditis and 4 with Basedow's [or Grave's] disease) and vitiligo in 4 (3.7%) participants.

## Prior and concomitant medications

The prior medications used for CSU, including H1-antihistamines and oral corticosteroids (OCS), were balanced between intervention groups. The most commonly used H1-antihistamine was cetirizine/cetirizine hydrochloride (46.3%), and the most commonly used OCS was prednisolone (12.0%). The majority of participants (70.4%) reported the use of prior medications within 1 month of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

screening for reasons other than CSU ([16.2.4.3.3] and [16.2.4.3.4]). The most frequently used prior medications for reasons other than CSU (in &gt;5% of participants) included levothyroxine sodium/levothyroxine (13.9%), paracetamol (10.2%), amlodipine besilate (6.5%), and salbutamol (5.6%).

All patients received background antihistamine treatment that had to remain stable throughout the study. At baseline, all participants were receiving H1-antihistamines for CSU, with 36.4% on standard dose and 63.6% on 2- to 4-fold of standard dose. OCS as concomitant medication (any purpose) was reported for 8 (14.8%) participants in the dupilumab group and 11 (20.4%) in the placebo group with prednisolone and prednisone being the most common. The 3 most frequently used concomitant medications other than H1-antihistamine or OCS included paracetamol (11.1% in the dupilumab group and 14.8% in the placebo group), levothyroxine sodium (13.0% and 5.6%, respectively), and salbutamol (9.3% and 1.9%, respectively).

## Numbers analysed

All randomized participants (n= 108; 54 in each intervention group) were included in the final efficacy population (ITT population). For the interim analysis (IA), the ITT24 population (n=83; 43 in the dupilumab group and 40 in the placebo group) was analysed.

## Primary efficacy endpoint

## Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24

Baseline mean UAS7 was 30.99 and 31.93 in the dupilumab and placebo groups. The LS mean (SE) decrease from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 was -14.37 (2.16) in the dupilumab group versus -8.54 (2.14) in the placebo group. The LS mean difference versus placebo (95% CI) was -5.83 (-11.37, 0.30); p=0.0390; SAPspecified threshold p&lt;0.043). In the dupilumab group, the median UAS7

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

improved to a mild urticaria activity score of 14.00 (&lt;16 , in comparison, to 28.00 in the placebo group.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

## Change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24

Baseline mean ISS7 scores were 15.86 and 16.19 in the dupilumab and the placebo group, respectively. The LS mean change from baseline in ISS7 at Week 24 was -7.68 in the dupilumab group versus -4.81 in the placebo group; the difference was -2.87 (95% CI: -5.68, -0.07, p=0.0449) (not meeting the SAP specified threshold of p&lt;0.0430). Dupilumab treatment led to a reduction over time in mean ISS7 through the 24-week treatment period.

## Change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24

Baseline mean HSS7 was 15.13 and 15.74 in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. The LS mean change from baseline in HSS7 at Week 24 was -6.64 in the dupilumab group versus -3.63 in the placebo group. The LS mean difference versus placebo was -3.01, (95% CI: -5.88, -0.14, nominal p=0.0397). Dupilumab treatment led to a reduction over time in mean HSS7 through the 24-week treatment period.

## Proportion of ISS7 minimal important difference (MID) ( ≥ 5 points) responders at Week 24

Approximately 20% more participants treated with dupilumab versus placebo reached an ISS7 MID response at Week 24 (32/54 (59.3%) versus 21/54 (38.9%)), with an OR versus placebo of 1.987 (95% CI: 0.835, 4.729; nominal p=0.1203).

## Proportion of participants with UAS7 ≤6 at Week 24

The proportion of participants with their CSU symptoms well controlled (UAS7 ≤6) was 24.1% in the dupilumab group and 18.5% in the placebo group at Week 24 (OR: 1.899, 95% CI: 0.577, 6.247, nominal p=0.3107).

Proportion of participants with UAS7=0 at Week 24 The proportion of participants with complete resolution of their CSU symptoms (UAS7=0) was 13.0% in the dupilumab group and 9.3% in the placebo group at Week 24 (OR: 1.180, 95% CI: 0.268, 5.201, nominal p=0.8373).

## Change from baseline in UCT at Week 24

At baseline, the urticaria symptoms for participants in both groups were not controlled (UCT &lt;12) with a median baseline UCT score of 4.00 for both the dupilumab and placebo groups. At Week 24, the median UCT score was 11.00 in the dupilumab group versus 7.50 in the placebo group. The LS mean (SE) increase from baseline in UCT at Week 24 was 5.33 (0.77) in the dupilumab group versus 3.38 (0.74) in the placebo group. The LS mean difference versus placebo (95% CI) was 1.94 (-0.03, 3.92), with a nominal p-value of 0.0534.

At Week 24, 44.4% of participants in the dupilumab group improved to the well-controlled status (UCT ≥ 12) for their urticaria disease versus 20.4% in the placebo group, with an OR versus placebo of 2.381 (95% CI: 0.872, 6.501); nominal p = 0.0931.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Angioedema activity score over 7 days (AAS7) at Week 24

At baseline, only 20 (37.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 33 (61.1%) of participants in the placebo group had active angioedema (AAS7 score &gt;0), with a mean AAS7 score of 38.00 and 42.94, respectively. At Week 24, the LS mean change (decrease) from baseline in AAS7 was -16.29 in the dupilumab group and -16.54 in the placebo group, showing no difference between the two groups.

## Treatment effect after study intervention discontinuation

## Change from baseline in ISS7 and UAS7 post-treatment

In Study B, a total of 40 participants in the dupilumab group and 44 participants in the placebo group reported post-intervention data at Week 36 for UAS7, ISS7, and HSS7. Post treatment, the residual treatment effects diminished gradually, but did not return to baseline by the end of the 12-week follow-up period in both intervention groups. The mean ISS7 and UAS7 scores in the dupilumab group remained numerically lower compared with the placebo group during the 12-week follow-up period.

## Ancillary analyses

## Interim Analysis

The interim analysis population for the efficacy endpoints was the ITT24 population, defined as all participants who were randomized at least 24 weeks before the IA cut-off date and would have completed the Week 24 visit by the IA cut-off date.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The interim analysis (cut-off date: 17 Dec 2021) met the protocol specified statistical criteria for futility:

- UAS7: The LS mean difference versus placebo for change from baseline at Week 24 was -3.15 (95% CI: -9.79, 3.49), p=0.3529; which was not statistically significant and met futility criteria of p &gt;0.1.
- ISS7: The LS mean difference versus placebo for change from baseline at Week 24 was -1.96 (95% CI: -5.33, 1.42), p=0.2555; which was not statistically significant.

The Sponsor sent a notification to investigators and sites dated 18 February 2022 with instructions that the investigators were to contact and inform participants who were still receiving study treatment and organize an early End of Treatment (EOT) visit. A public IA futility announcement (press release dated 18 February 2022) was issued the same day stating that patients will stop due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis.

Three participants (out of the 25 participants not included in the IA) discontinued due to IA futility announcement. A final data analysis including all the randomized participants' data based on the final database lock was conducted.

WOCF: Worst observation carried forward; MI: Multiple imputation

a Each of the imputed complete data were analyzed by fitting an ANCOVA model with the corresponding baseline value, intervention group, presence of angioedema at baseline, and regions as covariates.

Note: Data collected after study intervention discontinuation were included. Data post select prohibited/rescue medications were set to missing and imputed by WOCF. Missing data after study intervention discontinuation for lack of efficacy were imputed by WOCF; other missing data were imputed by MI. Descriptive statistics at Week 24 include participants after WOCF at Week 24, and participants whose values were imputed by MI at Week 24 were excluded from the descriptive analysis.

## Clinical studies in special populations

## Efficacy data for adolescents (aged ≥ 12 years and &lt;18 years)

Overall, 2 adolescents ( ≥12 to &lt;18 years old) (1 in each intervention group) were enrolled in Study B and completed the treatment period of the study.

The 2 adolescents had nearly identical baseline values in ISS7, HSS7, and UAS7. During the treatment period, numerical improvements (decreases) in ISS7, HSS7, and UAS7 were observed in both participants. For the adolescent in the dupilumab group, a greater initial improvement was seen in ISS7, HSS7, and UAS7 by Week 12 (compared with the adolescent in the placebo group).

## Use of rescue medication

H1-antihistamine use as rescue treatment: In both studies, the initial background H1-antihistamine dose had to be remained stable throughout the study and participants had to resume their maintenance dose once rescue treatment was no longer required.

In Study A and C, at baseline, all participants were receiving H1-antihistamines for CSU, with 49.0% and 52.2%, respectively, on standard dose, 51.0% and 47.8%, respectively, on 2- to 4 -fold of standard dose. Rescue treatment with H1-antihistamines as initiated by the Investigators during the treatment period was observed in 1 (1.4%) participant in the dupilumab group versus 2 (2.6%) participants in the placebo group in Study C and 1 (1.4%) participant in the dupilumab group versus 4 (5.9%) participants in the placebo group in Study A.

Corticosteroid use: Overall use of OCS was low as rescue treatment for symptoms of CSU in both pivotal studies. There were 1 (1.4%) participant in the dupilumab group versus 5 (6.5%) participants in the placebo group for Study C and 3 (4.3%) participants in the dupilumab group versus 5 (7.4%) participants in the placebo group for Study A requiring OCS rescue during the treatment period.

## UAS7 subgroup analyses

In the pooled ITT population, there was a generally consistent trend of dupilumab treatment benefit in the UAS7 across the majority of prespecified demographics and baseline disease characteristics subgroups analyzed (gender, baseline angioedema, baseline ISS7 and UAS7 score, H1-antihistamine baseline dose, and baseline serum total IgE). Most subgroups showed a numerically greater treatment effect of dupilumab as compared with placebo in UAS7 reduction at Week 24, except for 3 subgroups (Age group &lt;18 years [N=15], Latin America [N=26], and Hispanic [N=48]).

A nominally significant qualitative treatment-by-subgroup interaction was detected with regard to age groups &lt;18 and ≥18 years for UAS7 (nominal p=0.0456). For the subgroup of participants &lt;18 years (N=15), the sample size was small and thus the results should be interpreted with caution. A numerically lower improvement from baseline was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group with LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 of 15.12 in the dupilumab group versus -24.75 in the placebo group; the LS mean difference versus placebo had a wide confidence interval (3.72 [95% CI: -6.17, 13.60]). While adolescents and children in the dupilumab group (N=8) had a generally similar improvement (LS mean change -15.12) to the dupilumab pooled ITT population (-19.29), those in the placebo group (N=7) demonstrated a large improvement (LS mean change -24.75) compared to the placebo pooled ITT population (-13.13), indicating a high number of spontaneous remissions in this small subgroup.

No treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed for region for UAS7. However, a numerically lower improvement from baseline was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group in the Latin America subgroup with LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 of -18.60 in the dupilumab group versus -20.33 in the placebo group; the LS mean difference versus placebo was 1.73 (95% CI: -9.85, 13.31).

A nominally significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was detected with regard to ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic) for UAS7 (nominal p=0.0254). In the subgroup of Hispanic participants (N=48), a numerically lower improvement from baseline was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group with LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 of -16.47 in the dupilumab group versus -17.14 in the placebo group; the LS mean difference versus placebo had a wide confidence interval (0.66 [95% CI: -7.73, 9.06]).

A nominally significant quantitative treatment-by-subgroup interaction was detected with regard to duration of disease (&lt;2 years versus 2 to 10 years versus &gt;10 years) for UAS7 (nominal p=0.0226). In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the subgroup of duration of disease &gt;10 years (N=49), a numerically higher improvement from baseline was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group with LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 of -23.94 in the dupilumab group versus -6.49 in the placebo group; the LS mean difference versus placebo was -17.45 (95% CI:  24.60, 10.31).

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Clinical efficacy data are based on results of two phase 3 studies ( Study A and Study C ) conducted in participants with CSU who remained symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamine and who were naïve to omalizumab. Both studies were similarly designed multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies with a 24-week treatment and a 12-week follow-up period that were conducted under one master protocol ( EFC16461 ).

Additional data are derived from Study B, also conducted under the same master protocol, however with a different study population enrolled, ie. patients who already had received omalizumab and showed an intolerant or incomplete response to the therapy. The supportive value of this study is limited as discussed further below.

For all studies, depending on the participants weight, dupilumab 300 mg q2w or dupilumab 200 mg q2w, were compared in adult and adolescent patients with placebo treatment. This is the same dose regimen as currently approved for atopic dermatitis (see PK/PD assessment).

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

## Study A, C and B

Study populations: Study A and C enrolled adult patients, adolescent patients aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years , and children aged &gt;6 years with CSU who were symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamines and who were naïve to omalizumab (anti-IgE therapy). Concomitant use of the established standard of care background therapy with a long-acting non-sedating H1-AH, at up to 4-fold the recommended dose was used during both studies. The diagnosis of CSU had to be confirmed at least 6 months prior to screening with active CSU symptoms (presence of itch and hives) for a minimum of 6 consecutive weeks under antihistamine therapy. In both studies, participants had a history of inadequate response to antihistamines as defined by presence of CSU symptoms for at least 6 weeks at any time prior to screening without any requirement to the antihistamine dose.  Dose adaptations before screening were allowed if doses were stable for at least 3 consecutive days prior to screening.

Study B enrolled a different study population (i.e.adult and adolescent patients with CSU who were symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamines and who were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy) reflecting a more refractory group of patients.

Study design: The sample size calculations for all studies are overall reproducible. It is noted, however, that the assumptions on the minimally clinical important difference (10 points) for UAS7 was substantially higher in Study A than the observed effects. The assumed effect in Study C was based on Study A and was identical to the LS mean difference previously observed. Even this substantially lower effect could not be observed in Study C.Patients in Studies A and C were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and randomization was stratified for age and within adults additionally for country and in Study C additionally for angioedema. In both studies, subjects were enrolled in 9 countries. This led to 9 strata in adults in Study A and even 18 strata in Study C. Given the small sample sizes of the studies, it was clear that the average sample size per stratum was to be small (i.e. even with strata of equal size). In fact, the strata were quite imbalanced in both studies. In Study A 19 subjects (13.8%) were enrolled in Argentina, 34 in Canada (24.6%), 21 in China (15.2%), 2 in France (1.4%), 1 in Hungary (0.7%), 12 in Japan (8.7%), 22 in Russia (15.9%), 5 in Spain (3.6%), and 22 in the USA (15.9%). In Study C 7 subjects (4.6%) were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enrolled in Argentina, 50 in Canada (33.1%), 23 in China (15.2%), 7 in France (4.6%), 9 in Germany (6.0%), 2 in Hungary (1.3%), 27 in Japan (17.9%), 22 in Spain (14.6%), and 4 in the USA (2.6%). Only 22.5% of subjects enrolled in Study C presented with angioedema. Many strata were consequently very sparsely populated or even empty. Stratified randomization per country is not considered helpful in such a case and even less so in combination with another stratification factor (angioedema). A relatively pronounced imbalance for subjects with angioedema was observed between arms with 28.6% in placebo and 16.2% in dupilumab arm. This indicates that especially Study C was over-stratified and that stratification was not helpful to achieve a balanced treatment allocation within these subgroups.

All studies were double-blind, which was considered acceptable by CHMP.

Primary endpoints: In all studies, the change from baseline in the weekly UAS7 at Week 24 was used as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline in the UAS7 subscores ISS7 and HSS7, as well as the ASS7 to capture changes in the angioedema activity over time. Changes in quality of life were evaluated by DLQI or CDLQI in children, respectively. All endpoints are acceptable to the CHMP.

Statistical methods: The methods to analyse the data were overall considered adequate. The Applicant defined estimands for key endpoints and planned for multiple supplementary and sensitivity analyses. These are overall considered meaningful and supported.

## Study A

Study conduct: The study was conducted between February 2020 and August 2021. A total of 183 participants were screened and 138 participants were randomized to treatment.

Baseline data: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 41.3 (15.5) years with a range of 8 to 77 years, 65.9% were females, and the majority of participants (68.8%) were White. Study A included 4 adolescent participants (2 in each group). About 8 participants were enrolled in the EU. More than 2/3 of participants (70.3%) presented with severe CSU symptom as indicated by an UAS7 ≥ 28.

Per protocol, all patients received concomitant background H1-antihistamine treatment during the study. No participants had omalizumab as prior medication, as defined in the inclusion criteria. There is no information on the number of patients with one of the currently described autoimmune endotypes of CSU (i.e. autoimmune type I CSU mediated by IgE autoantibodies, type II autoimmune CSU mediated by IgG autoantibodies) as this information have not been collected during the study. It remains unclear whether these patients show a different or the same response to dupilumab as compared to patients with a nonautoimmune CSU endotype.

## Study C

Study conduct: The study was initiated in August 2022 after Study A had been completed. Data presented are based on the primary completion of the study in 2024 when all participants had completed the 24-week intervention period or had discontinued treatment before. A total of 215 participants were screened and 151 participants were randomized to treatment.

Baseline data: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 44.7 (16.9) years with a range of 8 to 79 years, 70.2% were females. Most of the participants were White (46.4%) or Asian (41.1%). A total of 6 adolescent participants (3 in each group), and 3 paediatric participants below 12 years were also included. A total of 26.5% of participants were enrolled in the EU. The mean disease duration (6.5 years) was balanced and comparable to Study A.

Regarding concomitant H1-antihistamine treatment, it is overall comparable to Study A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study B

Study conduct: A total of 137 participants were screened and 108 participants were randomized to treatment.Study B was conducted during the global COVID-19 pandemic (first patient enrolled: 03 March 2020) without stoppage. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the efficacy data interpretation can be considered minimal but led to difficulties in enrolment of intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab which were the rationale to include an interim analysis with a protocol amendment. The interim analysis was planned to be conducted when 80 randomized participants of study B would have completed their 24-week treatment period. This accounts for ~80% of the initially planned patients and was conducted with the cut-off date 17 Dec 2022. At this time, week-24 data from 75 patients (dupilumab: 39; placebo: 36) were analysed. The IA met the specified criteria for futility and the sponsor instructed the sites and investigators to organize early end-of-treatment visits on 18 Feb 2022. By the time of futility notification, 25 participants were remaining of whom 1 participant had already discontinued treatment before the interim analysis; 3 participants (dupilumab: 1; placebo: 3) discontinued treatment after the futility announcement. 9 participants had already completed their end of-treatment visit while the remaining 12 participants were scheduled to complete their end-of-treatment visit within one month. As such the sponsor decided to wait for the remaining week 24 data to be obtained and conduct a final analysis when all randomized participants had completed their last study visit. For more information, please refer to the EPAR for procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0083.

Baseline data: The mean age of the participants was 47.7 years with a range of 14 to 79 years, 72.2% were females, and the majority of participants (77.8%) were White. Only 2 adolescent participants (one per each group) were enrolled in Study B. A total of 25.9% of participants were enrolled in the EU.

The majority of participants were included based on incomplete response to omalizumab (96.3%), despite the concomitant use of H1 antihistamine treatment.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## Study A

The study met its primary endpoint. At week 24, reductions in UAS7 (LS mean decrease from baseline) were -20.53 in the dupilumab group and -12.00 in the placebo group, respectively. The LS mean difference was -8.53. Statistical significance was reached (p=0.0003). Improvements in UAS7 started to appear early. Change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 12 were -16.81 and -11.79 in the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively, with a LS mean difference of -5.02. Still, the largest mean differences between dupilumab and placebo were only achieved after &gt;Week 20, indicating that the maximal clinical response was achieved near the end of the 24-week study treatment period. Whether patients might have shown further improvements under treatment with dupilumab beyond 24-week was not evaluated.

What is apparent from the data, is a notable number of participants with UAS7 improvements also in the placebo group reflecting the in part self-limiting nature of the CSU characterized by a spontaneous onset but also possible spontaneous remissions. As consequence, the observed group difference in UAS7 (8.53) was closely below the threshold for clinical meaningfulness (difference of 10 points in UAS7), as also used for sample size calculation during study planning. Still, on an individual patient-level, disease control (UAS7 ≤6) or complete resolution of CSU symptoms (UAS7=0) representing symptom improvements greater than 10-point change was achieved in an increased number of participants in the dupilumab group as compared to placebo (45.7% vs. 23.5% and 31.4% vs. 13.2%) with statistically significant differences detected.

Similar changes in ISS7 and HSS7 as for UAS7 were observed at week 24 indicating that the improvements in urticarial symptoms were driven by both a reduction in itch and reduction in hives. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LS mean difference in ISS7 versus placebo at week 24 was -4.23 . The LS mean difference in HSS7 versus placebo at week 24 was -4.38. As for the primary endpoint, LS mean group differences were slightly below the established MIDs (5-point change). Of note, the proportion of participants with an ISS7 MID response at Week 24 was 72.9% vs 42.6% in the placebo group.

At Week 24, approximately half of participants (34 [48.6%]) treated with dupilumab were well-controlled (UCT ≥ 12) compared to 21 (30.9%) participants treated with placebo. Improvements in angioedema were seen for both groups with no difference observed (-22.51 vs. -23.13).

## Study C

At week 24, reductions in UAS7 were -15.86 in the dupilumab group and -11.21 in the placebo group, respectively. The LS mean difference was -4.65. Statistical significance was reached (p=0.0226). As in Study A, improvements in urticarial were consistently seen for the secondary endpoints ISS7 and HSS7.

Of note, a smaller treatment effect was observed in Study C as compared to Study A (-4.65 [C] vs. -8.53 [A]) which was mainly attributable to smaller symptom improvements in the dupilumab group while improvements in the placebo group were similar in both studies (-11.21 [C] vs. -12.00 [A]) indicating a lower effectiveness of dupilumab in the enrolled patient population. The upper bound of the 95% CI was close to 0. Consequently, a meaningful difference in UAS7 (10-point change) could not be demonstrated on a group level in Study C.

Still, similar to the observations made in Study A, patients with the highest reduction in UAS7 (ie. patients with disease control (UAS7 ≤ 6) or complete resolution of CSU symptoms (UAS7=0)) were significantly increased (40.5% vs. 23.4% and 29.7% vs. 18.2%) providing some reassurance that on an individual patient-level a higher number of patients experienced symptom improvement greater than a 10-point change in UAS7 in the dupilumab group.

## Study B

At the end of the treatment period (week 24), a reduction in UAS7  was observed in both treatment arms (dupilumab: -14.37; placebo: -8.54) with a LS mean difference of -5.83  that reached statistical significance . Improvements in UAS7 started to appear early with similar differences between dupilumab and placebo already observed at Week 12 (LS mean difference: -5.11. A 10-point change was again not reached on a group-level. Moreover, similar numbers of participants  achieved disease control (UAS7 ≤ 6) or complete resolution in CSU symptoms (UAS7=0); only a slight numerical increase in the dupilumab group was observed.

As outcome of the interim analysis, the LS mean difference for UAS7 was -3.15; p=0.3529) and -1.96 for ISS7, respectively. Consequently, the interim analysis (IA)  met the pre-specified criteria for futility which was communicated to the investigators and to the public on 18 Feb 2022. Given the status of the participants not included in the interim analysis of whom a majority had already completed the 24-week visit or had already scheduled an end-of-treatment visit within the next months, the sponsor decided to conduct a final analysis including all remaining 15 participants. As the futility analysis was non-binding, from a technical perspective no type 1 error inflation occurred and in principle adequate type 1 error control was in place at both analyses. However, given that the decision was made to stop the study for futility, it is not considered possible to revert this decision and to consider the study successful after the fact. The trial was considered negative by the Sponsor and this was communicated via a press release and to trial participants. This decision cannot be ignored or overruled.

Of note, there is a large shift in mean UAS7 reductions in favour of the dupilumab arm in participants that were analysed after the IA (n=24). At the interim analysis, the effect of UAS7 (change from baseline to week 24 versus placebo) was -3.15. This result was based on n=83 patients. At the primary analysis, with n=108 patients, the result nearly doubled to -5.83. Even if blinding was maintained during the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study, the patient's knowledge of the declared futility of study treatment could have led to a biased UAS7 evaluation making the validity of the final analysis as well as the analysis of follow-up data uncertain. Moreover, it also shows that the results are very volatile and change substantially by adding only 25 subjects (23% of all enrolled patients).

Overall, the supportive value of the results of Study B is considered very limited, as bias cannot be excluded and validity of study results is questionable. Thus, the efficacy evaluation is primarily based on the results obtained in Study A and C.

## Pooled analysis (Study A and C)

In the pooled analysis of Study A and C, the LS mean change from baseline in UAS7 at Week 24 was higher in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group (-19.29 versus -13.13), represents a LS mean difference of -6.15. A greater proportion of participants treated with dupilumab had their CSU symptoms well controlled (UAS7 ≤ 6) compared to placebo at Week 24 (43.1% versus 23.4%).

Treatment effect after study intervention discontinuation: Patients were treated for only 24 weeks. In both studies, there was no clear loss of response in UAS7 or ISS7 and HSS7 after treatment discontinuation during the 12-week follow-up period while first indications for a worsening in urticarial symptoms appeared to emerge. Given these data, it is uncertain whether long-term therapy with the proposed posology is needed to maintain improvements in CSU symptoms once a satisfactory clinical response is achieved.

Treatment effect in subgroups: Most subgroups showed a numerically greater treatment effect of dupilumab as compared with placebo in UAS7 reduction at Week 24. Improvements in UAS7 seem to be strongly related with the duration of disease prior to study entry. A nominally significant quantitative treatment-by-subgroup interaction was detected. The strongest improvements in UAS7 were observed in patients with a long duration of disease &gt;10 years while the lowest improvements were seen in patients with disease duration of less than 2 years. This observation was driven by both higher improvements from baseline in UAS7 in the dupilumab group but also a lower reduced placebo response in patients with long disease duration. Since longer disease duration is considered a predictor for a more persistent CSU disease, this indicates better efficacy in this subgroup while spontaneous remission seems more likely to occur in patients with shorter disease duration.

## Claimed indication

The proposed indication is in line with the study population enrolled in Study A and C, ie. patients with CSU who were symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamines and who have not used anti-IgE therapies before. During the procedure, the wording was aligned with the existing indication of Xolair (omalizumab) while after CHMP discussion it was decided to not mandate treatment as add-on therapy next to existing H1-antihistamines. Indeed, in both studies, CSU patients were on stable background antihistamine doses to which they had already shown an inadequate response. These doses were maintained throughout the study while the use of rescue medication was low. In case of response to dupilumab (indicating blockage of upstream immune CSU pathology), further treatment with antihistamines that were shown to be ineffective in patients may not be needed. In accordance with current CSU treatment guidelines (recommending adjustments of treatments in case of symptom control or disease remission) reductions or even complete stop of antihistamines can be considered by the treating physician.

SmPC section 5.1 reflects that concomitant use of H1- antihistamines treatment was carried out throughout the studies in CSU.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SmPC

Given the overall moderate treatment effect observed in Study A and C and the notable number of participants with improvements in the placebo group, it can be anticipated that a considerable number of patients may not receive additional benefit with dupilumab. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment. In addition, it is uncertain whether long-term therapy with the proposed posology is needed to maintain improvements. Thus, the need for continued therapy needs be periodically assessed by the prescribing physician. This has been incorporated in the SmPC section 4.2.

The MAH provided additional data on efficacy in Elderly subjects ( &lt;65, ≥ 65 and ≥ 75 years), that, while numbers are very small, showed a similar a trend to the overall study population.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The primary endpoints in Study A and C showed statistical significance, and a although the beneficial treatment effect was not yet fully demonstrated on a group-level, the additional analysis demonstrated that numbers of participants with substantial symptom improvements (&gt;10 point change in UAS7) were increased as compared to placebo.

The placebo response observed in both studies could be attributable to spontaneous remissions. Considerations to stop treatment in case of no response and the periodical assessment of the need for continued treatment has been included in the SmPC section 4.2.

Extrapolation of efficacy from adults to adolescents is acceptable to the CHMP.

Additional data provided sufficiently justify the SmPC statement on efficacy in elderly subjects in section 5.2.

While Patients were on stable background H1-antihistamine doses during the studies, further treatment with antihistamines in patients with an inadequate response to H1 antihistamines may not be needed. Reductions or even complete stop of antihistamines can be considered by the treating physician.

Overall, the efficacy results in studies EFC16461 Study A and C support the approval of dupilumab in adult and adolescent patients with CSU who are naïve to anti-IgE therapy.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Introduction

## Main data

The main clinical safety data were derived from the CSU clinical development programme which included 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 24-week intervention studies (EFC16461 Study C, EFC16461 Study A, and EFC16461 Study B).

Based on the results of EFC16461 Study C, Study A, and Study B, and supportive analyses, the proposed dupilumab SC dose regimens in patients with CSU aged 12 years and older whose disease is inadequately controlled by H1-antihistamines and who are naïve to anti-IgE therapy for CSU are as follows:

- 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg for adults (≥18 years of age),
- 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg for adolescents (≥12 to &lt;18 years of age) ≥60 kg,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 200 mg q2w with a loading dose of 400 mg for adolescents (≥12 to &lt;18 years of age) ≥30 to &lt;60 kg.

## Supportive data:

The following additional supportive safety data from other sources are also provided:

- No new SUSARs or deaths from ongoing Phase 2/3 and Phase 4 interventional studies across the dupilumab program were received as of 01 October 2024 (cut-off date for SUSARs and deaths of the most recent marketing application for dupilumab) .
- Brief safety summary of completed clinical programs in other approved populations (AD, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, and COPD) .
- Data from post-marketing surveillance for approved indications.

The results described in this SCS are based on pooled data from completed Study C (151 participants), Study A (138 participants), and Study B (108 participants) (Table 29). The cutoff date of Study C was the primary completion date defined as the date of the Week 24/EOT visit for the last participant (01 August 2024).

## Demography

Demographics and participant characteristics at baseline in the pooled safety population were balanced between intervention groups (Table 32). The mean (SD) age of the randomized population was 44.4 (16.3) years, with a range of 8 to 79 years. The majority of participants were adults aged 18 to 64 years (329 [82.9%]); 12 (3.0%) participants were adolescents (age group 12 to 17 years) and 5 (1.3%) were children (age group 6 to 11 years). There were 40 (10.1%) elderly participants randomized in the age group 65 to 74 years and 11 (2.8%) in the age group ≥75 years. Overall, 30.7% of participants were male and 69.3% were female. The mean (SD) body weight was 75.68 (19.34) kg, with 20.2% of participants &lt;60 kg and 79.8% of participants ≥60 kg. T here were no participants with baseline body weight &lt;30 kg.

## Disease characteristics at baseline

Overall, disease characteristics at baseline were balanced between intervention groups in the pooled safety population and indicative of severe uncontrolled CSU. The mean (SD) time since first diagnosis of CSU prior to study entry was 6.9 (9.2) years. The mean (SD) baseline ISS7 score was 15.7 (3.9) (score range: 3 to 21). The mean (SD) baseline UAS7 score was 30.2 (7.8) (score range: 5 to 42, with ≥16 corresponding to moderate urticaria activity and scores of 28 to 42 corresponding to severe urticaria activity). The majority of participants (66.0%) had severe CSU disease activity at baseline (UAS7 score ≥28 ). The mean (SD) UCT score at baseline was 4.4 (2.9) (score range: 0 to 16, with low scores [UCT &lt;12] indicative of low disease control). Angioedema at baseline (AAS7 score &gt;0) was observed in 149 (37.5%) participants, with a mean (SD) AAS7 score of 39.1 (26.3) (score range: 4 to 104, with high scores indicative of high angioedema activity). All participants were receiving H1-antihistamines for CSU at baseline, with 46.7% on standard dose, 36.6% on 2- to 3-fold of standard dose, and 16.7% on 4-fold of standard dose.

## Medical history and comorbid conditions associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria

Overall, the medical history and comorbid conditions associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria were balanced between intervention groups. The most common CSU and allergic comorbidity medical history was angioedema, reported in 47.1% of participants overall (42.4% in the dupilumab group and 51.8% in the placebo group). Other common medical history terms (ongoing at study entry in &gt;10% of participants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overall) included allergic rhinitis (23.2%) and asthma (13.1%). A total of 36 (9.1%) participants had ongoing food allergy. Thirty-two (8.1%) participants had a previous history of AD, with 9 (2.3%) participants (3 [1.5%] in the dupilumab group and 6 [3.0%] in the placebo group) having ongoing AD at study entry. One participant in the placebo group met exclusion criterion E 04 (ie, patients with active AD) at screening, which was reported as a minor protocol deviation. Overall, there were 45 (11.3%) participants (25 [12.6%] in the dupilumab group and 20 [10.1%] in the placebo group) with a medical history of a CSU-associated autoimmune disorder, such as chronic gastritis (20 [5.0%] participants), autoimmune thyroiditis (11 [2.8%] participants), Graves' disease (6 [1.5%] participants), and vitiligo (4 [1.0%] participants). Other CSU-associated autoimmune disorders were reported in ≤2 participants overall.

## Prior medications

The prior medications used for CSU, including H1-antihistamines and OCS, were balanced between intervention groups (100% of participants in both treatment groups). All participants were receiving H1antihistamines for CSU at baseline as per the anatomic class of dermatologicals (therapeutic class of antipruritics, including antihistamines). A total of 109 (27.5%) participants were previously exposed to omalizumab (4 were intolerant and 105 were incomplete responders). Of note, this included 1 participant who was enrolled in Study C (dupilumab group), which was reported as a major protocol deviation. Omalizumab treatment was stopped due to incomplete response approximately 4 months before first IMP administration.

The most frequently used prior medications (taken within 1 month of screening) for reasons other than CSU by standardized medication name were: paracetamol (30 [7.6%] participants), levothyroxine sodium (29 [7.3%] participants), salbutamol (19 [4.8%] participants), colecalciferol (17 [4.3%] participants), and ibuprofen (16 [4.0%] participants).

## Concomitant medications

All participants received concomitant medications during the intervention period, as they continued their established standard of care H1-AH. In the pooled safety population, 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) participant in the placebo group received omalizumab during the ontreatment period (defined as concomitant medications used at any time from first IMP intake up to IMP intake + 14 days). Oral corticosteroid use was allowed during the study as a rescue treatment. Nineteen (9.6%) participants in the dupilumab group and 23 (11.6%) participants in the placebo group received concomitant OCS.

## Comparison across studies

All 3 studies had similar mean baseline disease characteristics with the exception of:

- Time since first diagnosis of CSU: participants enrolled in Study B had an overall longer urticaria disease duration at baseline (9.1 years) compared to Study A and Study C (5.7 years and 6.5 years, respectively).
- Baseline UAS7 score (&lt;28, ≥28): t he percentage of participants with severe CSU disease activity (UAS7 ≥28 to ≤42) was lower in Study C (59. 6%) compared to Study A and Study B (70.3% and 69.4%, respectively).
- Presence of angioedema at baseline: the percentage of participants with angioedema at baseline was lower in Study C (22.5%) compared to Study A and Study B (44.9% and 49.1%, respectively).
- Baseline AAS7 score: the mean AAS7 score at baseline was lower in Study A (33.9) compared to Study C and Study B (45.5 and 41.1, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- High-dose H1-antihistamine use at baseline: the percentage of participants receiving a 4-fold standard dose was higher in Study B (25.2%) compared to Study C and Study A (10.6% and 16.7%, respectively).

## Comparison across chronic spontaneous urticaria studies

Overall, there were no unique safety concerns identified in the individual studies. The percentage of participants with any TEAE was comparable between the dupilumab and placebo groups among Study C, Study A, and Study B (52.7% and 53.2%, respectively, in Study C; 54.3% and 58.8%, respectively, in Study A; and 61.1% and 53.7%, respectively, in Study B). A low incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was observed in all 3 studies (dupilumab versus placebo: 4.1% and 1.3 %, respectively, in Study C; 2.9% and 7.4%, respectively, in Study A; and 5.6% and 3.7 %, respectively, in Study B).

Reported TEAEs were comparable across the 3 studies with the exception of the SOCs General disorders and administration site conditions and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

General disorders and administration site conditions SOC

- In Study C, the number (%) of participants with TEAEs in the General disorders and administration site conditions SOC was higher (≥5% difference) in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (10 [13.5%] and 4 [5.2%], respectively), mainly driven by injection site reactions.
- In Study A, the number (%) of participants with TEAEs in the General disorders and administration site conditions SOC was similar in the dupilumab and placebo groups (9 [12.9%] and 10 [14.7%], respectively).
- In Study B, the number (%) of participants with TEAEs in the General disorders and administration site conditions SOC was lower in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (4 [7.4%] and 7 [13.0%], respectively).

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC

- In Study C, the number (%) of participants with any TEAE in the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC was similar between dupilumab and placebo groups (13 [17.6%] and 12 [15.6%], respectively). The most frequently reported PTs were angioedema (3 [4.1%] participants and 1 [1.3%] participant in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively) and chronic spontaneous urticaria (2 [2.7%] and 3 [3.9%], respectively).
- In Study A, a lower incidence of par ticipants with any TEAE (≥5%) was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (10 [14.3%] and 18 [26.5%] participants, respectively), mainly driven by PTs of chronic spontaneous urticaria (3 [4.3%] and 6 [8.8%] participants, respectively) and angioedema (1 [1.4%] and 5 [7.4%] participants, respectively). CSU-related TEAEs (in the HLGT of angioedema and urticaria) were reported in 19 (13.8%) participants overall (6 [8.6%] in the dupilumab group and 13 [19.1%] in the placebo group). This was consistent with the clinical presentation of patients with uncontrolled CSU, as some of the TEAEs observed more frequently in the placebo group were related to CSU flares eg, PTs of chronic spontaneous urticaria, idiopathic urticaria, urticaria, and angioedema.
- In Study B, a higher incidence of participants with any TEAE (≥5%) was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (11 [20.4%] and 6 [11.1%] participants, respectively), mainly driven by an imbalance in the PT of chronic spontaneous urticaria (7 [13.0%] and 3 [5.6%] participants, respectively). CSU-related TEAEs (in the HLGT of angioedema and urticaria) were reported in 14 (13.0%) participants overall (10 [18.5%] in the dupilumab group versus 4 [7.4%] in the placebo group). Of note, for the majority of participants in the dupilumab group, these TEAEs occurred early in the study intervention period (by Week 12, range of 3 to 86 days).

In the pooled safety population, CSU-related TEAEs (in the HLGT of angioedema and urticaria) were balanced between intervention groups: 22 (11.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 23 (11.6%) participants in the placebo group.

## Adverse events in adolescents and children

A total of 12 adolescents (aged 12 to &lt;18 years) were included in the safety pool (6 in each intervention group). TEAEs were reported for 1 out of 6 adolescents in the dupilumab group (PT: nasopharyngitis) and 3 out of 6 adolescents in the placebo group (PTs: COVID-19, post-procedural fever [due to covid vaccine injection], and dermatitis). None of these events were assessed as serious, severe, or led to permanent study intervention discontinuation. All events resolved and none were assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP. Five children (aged 6 to &lt;12 years) were included in the safety pool, 3 of them in the dupilumab group and 2 in the placebo group. There were no TEAEs reported in the 3 children in the dupilumab group. TEAEs of diarrhea and tonsillitis streptococcal were reported in 1 child in the placebo group; both events were assessed by the Investigator as nonserious, mild, and resolved (Table 37).

## Treatment-emergent adverse events by Investigator causality assessment

TEAEs assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP were reported in 29 (14.6%) participants in the dupilumab group and 27 (13.6 %) participants in the placebo group.

The majority of IMP-related TEAEs in the dupilumab and placebo groups were Injection site reactions (HLT; 18 [9.1%] participants and 15 [7.5%] participants; respectively), which included PTs of injection site erythema (7 [3.5%] and 6 [3.0%]), injection site reaction (7 [3.5%] and 4 [(2.0%]), injection site pain (4 [2.0%] and 4 [2.0%]), injection site induration (2 [1.0%] and 0), injection site swelling (0 and 2 [1.0%]), injection site pruritus (1 [0.5%] and 1 [0.5%]), injection site hematoma (1 [0.5%] and 0), and injection site dermatitis (1 [0.5%] and 0).

## Treatment-emergent AEs by severity

The majority of TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as mild or moderate in intensity with similar incidences in both intervention groups. TEAEs assessed by the Investigator as severe were reported in 6 (3.0%) participants in each intervention group.

In 5 out of the 6 participants in the dupilumab group with severe TEAEs, at least 1 event was reported as a treatment-emergent SAE: depression (Study A), hepatic steatosis (Study C), angina unstable (Study C), concussion (Study C), and intestinal obstruction (Study B).

Other reported nonserious severe events in the dupilumab group (by PT) were fall (in the same participant with the SAE of concussion) and angioedema .

In 5 out of the 6 participants in the placebo group with severe TEAEs, at least 1 event was reported as a treatment-emergent SAE: completed suicide (Study A), dermatitis atopic (Study A), asthma (Study C), angioedema (Study A), and dyspnea , abdominal pain upper , and nausea (Study A).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other reported nonserious severe events in the placebo group (by PT) were depression (in the same participant with the SAE of completed suicide), abdominal pain , and blood creatine phosphokinase increased .

## Deaths

There were no TEAEs leading to death reported in the dupilumab group. One (0.5%) participant in the placebo group died due to completed suicide.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Other serious adverse events

Treatment-emergent SAEs are shown in Table 38 and were reported in 10 (5.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 8 (4.0%) participants in the placebo group.

All treatment-emergent SAEs were assessed by the Investigator as not related to IMP in both intervention groups and most events were reported as resolved. For the majority of participants, no action was taken with IMP as a result of the SAEs; IMP was temporarily interrupted in 1 participant in the dupilumab group (PT: pneumonia bacterial) and permanently discontinued in 1 participant in the dupilumab group (PT: depression) and 1 participant in the placebo group (PT: completed suicide).

Hypersensitivity events confirmed as being systemic after sponsor's medical review were reported in 1 (0.5%) participant in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) in the placebo group. TEAE of moderate urticaria, assessed as not related to IMP.

Furthermore, participants with TEAEs of conjunctivitis were identified based on the conjunctivitis CMQs narrow and broad, and conjunctivitis FDA cluster criteria. Conjunctivitis groupings (based on conjunctivitis CMQ broad and narrow criteria, and conjunctivitis FDA cluster criteria) each identified the same 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab group. One additional participant in the dupilumab group was identified based on the CMQ broad criteria only (PT: xerophthalmia). In the placebo group, each conjunctivitis grouping identified the same 3 (1.5%) participants. All of the events were nonserious and of mild or moderate intensity. One TEAE in each intervention group (PTs: conjunctivitis allergic in the dupilumab group and conjunctivitis in the placebo group) were assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP.

Treatment-emergent AESI of pregnancy were reported for 1 (0.5%) participant in each intervention group. Information is available on one pregnancy that resulted in a normal delivery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No AESIs of significant ALT elevation (AESI), defined as ALT &gt;5×ULN if baseline ALT ≤2×ULN; or ALT &gt;8×ULN if baseline ALT &gt;2×ULN, were reported.

TEAEs of potential drug-related hepatic disorder (other selected AE grouping) were reported in 7 (3.5%) participants in the dupilumab group (PTs: ALT increased, AST increased, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic cyst) and 1 (0.5%) participant in the placebo group (PTs: ALT increased and AST increased). None of the events led to permanent study intervention discontinuation. Except for 1 event of severe hepatic steatosis in the dupilumab group that led to hospitalization, none of the events were serious. Two participants in the dupilumab group had TEAEs of potential drug-related hepatic disorder which were assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP.

Treatment-emergent AEs of accidental overdose (defined per protocol as at least twice the intended dose during an interval of &lt;11 days) were reported in 9 (4.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 4 (2.0%) participants in the placebo group; all were asymptomatic. Of note, a TEAE of accidental overdose was initially reported as symptomatic in 1 participant in the dupilumab group. After the primary completion date of Study C, this TEAE was confirmed to be an asymptomatic overdose and thus no longer met the protocol definition of an AESI. Therefore, no participants in either the dupilumab group or placebo group were reported with an AESI of symptomatic overdose with IMP. No events of symptomatic overdose with NIMP were reported.

## Injection site reaction (HLT; other selected AE groupings)

Injection site reactions (HLT; including PTs of injection site erythema, injection site reaction, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site dermatitis, injection site hematoma, injection site pruritus, and injection site swelling) were reported in 20 (10.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 16 (8.0%) participants in the placebo group.

The 3 most common injection site reactions by PT were injection site erythema (7 [3.5%] participants in the dupilumab group and 7 [3.5%] participants in the placebo group), injection site reaction (8 [4.0%] participants and 4 [2.0%] participants, respectively), and injection site pain (5 [2.5%] participants and 4 [2.0%] participants, respectively). In most participants injection site reactions were assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP: 18 participants out of 20 participants in the dupilumab group and 15 out of 16 participants in the placebo group.

All the events of injection site reaction were assessed by the Investigator as nonserious and of mild or moderate intensity. All resolved without corrective treatment and without permanent intervention discontinuation. None of the participants with injection site reactions had a positive ADA response at or before the injection site reaction.

## Severe or serious infection (other selected AE groupings)

## A total of 2 participants had serious infections: pneumonia bacterial and COVID-19 pneumonia Malignancy (other selected AE groupings)

An event of malignancy ( colorectal adenocarcinoma ) was reported in 1 (1.4%) participant in the dupilumab group in EFC16461 Study C.

## Other significant treatment-emergent adverse events

Herpes viral infections (HLT): In the pooled safety population, 3 (1.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 3 (1.5%) participants in the placebo group had TEAEs of herpes viral infection (HLT). These included PTs of oral herpes (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group and 2 [1.0%] participants in the placebo group), herpes zoster (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group and 1 [0.5%] participant in the placebo group), and varicella (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group and 0 participants in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo group). All events were nonserious, assessed by the Investigator as mild or moderate in intensity, and reported as resolved. There were no TEAEs of eczema herpeticum in either intervention group.

Arthralgia: In the pooled safety population, 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab and 0 participants in the placebo group were reported with TEAEs of mild arthralgia . Both events were nonserious and assessed by the Investigator as not related to IMP.

Adverse events related to COVID-19 infection or associated with COVID-19 vaccine / Adverse events related to COVID-19 infection: TEAEs related to COVID-19 infection were identified based COVID-19 narrow search including PTs of COVID-19 (12 [6.1%] participants in the dupilumab group and 10 [5.0%] in the placebo group), COVID-19 pneumonia (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group and 1 [0.5%] participant in the placebo group), suspected COVID-19 (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group and 0 participants in the placebo group), and SARS-CoV-2 test positive (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group and 0 participants in the placebo group) (All TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as mild or moderate in intensity and not related to IMP. Except for an SAE of COVID-19 pneumonia in 1 participant in the placebo group, all TEAEs were nonserious).

## Laboratory findings

Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions were reported in 20 (10.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 16 (8.0%) participants in the placebo group (see section above).

## Severe or serious infection (other selected AE groupings)

A total of 2 participants had serious infections; one patient with moderate pneumonia bacterial in the dupilumab group on Day 58 (ie, 15 days after the 5th IMP dose), and one in the placebo group with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia on Day 33 (ie, 4 days after the 4th IMP dose).

## Malignancy (other selected AE groupings)

An event of malignancy was reported in 1 (1.4%) participant in the dupilumab group in EFC16461 Study C.

## Herpes viral infections (HLT)

In the pooled safety population, 3 (1.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 3 (1.5%) participants in the placebo group had TEAEs of herpes viral infection (HLT) (see discussion above).

## Arthralgia

In the pooled safety population, 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab and 0 participants in the placebo group were reported with TEAEs of arthralgia. Both events were nonserious and assessed by the Investigator as not related to IMP.

## Adverse events related to COVID-19 infection or associated with COVID-19 vaccine

Adverse events related to COVID-19 infection : COVID-19 events were reported in 15 (7.6%) and 11 (5.5%) participants in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively; see discussion above.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the pooled safety population, the number (%) of participants who had at least 1 TEAE reported by the Investigator as the reason for permanent study intervention discontinuation was 2 (1.0%) in the dupilumab group and 5 (2.5%) participants in the placebo group (Table 40). All TEAEs were reported by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

single participants only, except for the PT of chronic spontaneous urticaria which was reported in 2 participants in the placebo group. All events were assessed by the Investigator as not related to IMP, with the exception of 1 TEAE of arthritis and 1 TEAE of chronic spontaneous urticaria, both in the placebo group. All TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation had resolved, except for the TEAE of borderline personality disorder in the dupilumab group and the TEAE of completed suicide in the placebo group. The pregnancy was completed by delivery without complications.

Treatment-emergent AEs that led to permanent intervention discontinuation in the dupilumab group are described in the Table 40 below:

## Adverse drug reactions

The assessment for ADRs was conducted on the pooled safety population (Study C, Study A, and Study B), which was comprised of all participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention (N=397 participants).

- Injection site reactions : At the PT level, injection site reaction was reported in 8 (4.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 4 (2.0%) participants in the placebo group . At the HLT level, injection site reactions were reported in 20 (10.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 16 (8.0%) participants in the placebo group. In the dupilumab group, all events of injection site reaction were assessed by the Investigator as nonserious, mild in intensity, and resolved without corrective treatment; none of them led to study intervention discontinuation.

In 18 out of 20 participants in the dupilumab group, TEAEs of injection site reaction were assessed by the Investigator as related to the study intervention. Most injection site reactions occurred on the same day of an IMP administration in the dupilumab group. In addition, 12 out of 20 participants in the dupilumab group had recurrent TEAEs of injection site reaction. These observations are also biologically plausible

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and consistent with what might be expected after injection of a biologic agent. Based on available data, injection site reactions are considered an ADR of dupilumab in participants with CSU.

· COVID-19 : At the PT level, COVID-19 was reported in 12 (6.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 10 (5.0%) participants in the placebo group. Based on search criteria, COVID-19 events were reported in 15 (7.6%) and 11 (5.5%) participants in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively.

In the dupilumab group, none of the events were assessed by the Investigator as severe or serious, none led to permanent treatment discontinuation, and all were reported as resolved. In the placebo group, 1 event of COVID-19 pneumonia was serious. None of the COVID-19 events were assessed by the Investigator as related to IMP. Among the 15 participants in the dupilumab group, time-to-onset since first dose was inconsistent, ranging from 10 days to 8 months. In four participants, the TEAE was reported more than 60 days after the last dose of dupilumab. Available experimental evidence from vaccination of patients with therapeutic levels of dupilumab with yellow-fever vaccine supports the hypothesis that dupilumab does not suppress anti-viral Th1 responses and would not impair the generation of neutralizing anti-viral antibodies.

Beyond COVID-19 events, reported events of infection within the safety pool were also reviewed with inconsistent findings. Participants with TEAEs reported at the level of the SOC Infections and infestations were balanced between treatment groups (44 [22.2%] participants in the dupilumab group versus 46 [23.1%] participants in the placebo group). Participants with TEAEs reported in the HLGT Viral infectious disorders were more common in the dupilumab group (23 [11.6%] participants in the dupilumab group versus 18 [9.0%] participants in the placebo group). In contrast, participants with TEAEs reported in the HLTs of Lower respiratory tract and lung infection and Upper respiratory tract infections were more common in the placebo group (1 [0.5%] participant in the dupilumab group versus 5 [2.5%] participants in the placebo group and 13 [6.6%] participants in the dupilumab group versus 17 [8.5%] participants in the placebo group, respectively). In addition, an updated evaluation of the relationship between dupilumab and COVID-19 was performed as part of the EoE extension of indication submission for Dupixent (pediatric participants ≥ 1 year old). Based on the review of clinical database, global pharmacovigilance database, external database, worldwide scientific literature, and nonclinical information, the totality of available evidence did not support a causal relationship between dupilumab and COVID-19. Based on available data, COVID-19 is not considered an ADR of dupilumab in participants with CSU.

· Pharyngitis : TEAEs of pharyngitis (PT pharyngitis) were reported in 5 (2.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 2 (1.0%) participants in the placebo group (HR: 2.42 [95% CI: 0.47 to 12.49]). In 2 of the 5 participants in the dupilumab group, TEAEs of pharyngitis were reported during the safety follow-up period at 11.5 and 13.4 weeks after the final dose of dupilumab. All events in both treatment groups were nonserious, mild or moderate in intensity, and were assessed by the Investigator as not related to the study intervention. In the dupilumab group, no action was taken with dupilumab for any events. In 4 out of 5 participants in the dupilumab group, TEAEs of pharyngitis were reported as resolved. No participant in the dupilumab group had recurrent TEAEs of pharyngitis. Time to onset since first dose among participants in the dupilumab group was inconsistent, ranging from 7 to 35 weeks. Among the 5 participants reporting pharyngitis in the dupilumab group, 3 had potential alternative etiologies, while a fourth participant's pharyngitis occurred 94 days after the final dose of dupilumab, suggesting the presence of an alternative etiology. In contrast to events of pharyngitis, TEAEs of nasopharyngitis occurred with a lower frequency in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (6 [3.0%] participants in the dupilumab group and 12 [6.0%] participants in the placebo group). In addition, at the level of the HLT Upper respiratory tract infections, the frequency was also lower in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (13 [6.6%] participants in the dupilumab group and 17 [8.5%] participants in the placebo group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on available data, pharyngitis is not considered an ADR of dupilumab in participants with CSU.

· Potential drug-related hepatic disorders: TEAEs of potential drug-related hepatic disorders  were reported in 7 (3.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) in the placebo group. The majority of these events were alanine aminotransferase increased (PTs), reported in 6 (3.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) participant in the placebo group. Other potential drugrelated hepatic disorders were hepatic steatosis (3 [1.5%] participants in the dupilumab group and 0 in the placebo group), aspartate aminotransferase increase (1 event in each intervention group), and hepatic cyst (1 event in the dupilumab group).

One treatment-emergent SAE was reported in the dupilumab group in a participant who had a medical history of hepatic steatosis (ongoing for 3 years) prior to the study start and also had nonserious TEAEs of hepatic cyst of unknown cause and ALT increased. The serious TEAE of hepatic steatosis (severe) occurred 75 days after the last dose of the IMP. All other events were assessed by the Investigator as mild or moderate in intensity and none led to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

For each participant in the dupilumab group, at least one relevant risk/confounding factor or potential alternative etiology was identified.. Plausibility for dupilumab-induced liver injury is low. Autoimmune hepatitis may be considered as a mechanism, but no cases of autoimmune hepatitis were reported in the safety pool. Nonclinical safety studies that were performed with the monkey surrogate mAb for dupilumab (REGN646) showed no adverse effect on target organs, including the liver.

In addition, a relevant review of post-marketing data was recently performed via a cumulative search through 30-Apr-2024 in the Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database using SMQ 'Drug related hepatic disorders - comprehensive search (broad),' which identified 1294 cases of potential drug-induced liver injury reported with dupilumab as a suspect drug. Of these 1294 cases, 167 were selected for a comprehensive analysis based on criteria which aimed to identify cases with the most meaningful information for medical assessment. Of these 167 cases, 5 had compatible chronology without relevant confounders reported among which there was no clear pattern identified. Based on the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM), 3 of the 5 cases were assessed as unlikely related to dupilumab and missing information precluded assessment in the remaining 2 cases. There was no significant new safety information identified from review of post-marketing reports of liver toxicity. Overall, these data did not suggest a causal association between dupilumab and liver injury.

Based on available data, drug-related hepatic disorders, including ALT increased, are not considered an ADR of dupilumab in participants with CSU.

· Accidental overdose : TEAEs of accidental overdose (PT accidental overdose) were reported in 9 (4.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 4 (2.0%) participants in the placebo group. Eight of 9 events of accidental overdose in the dupilumab group were reported as asymptomatic, while the ninth event was reported as symptomatic but was confirmed to be asymptomatic after database lock. 8 events were assessed as not related. No participant had recurrent TEAEs of accidental overdose. Time to onset since first dose was inconsistent, ranging from 2 weeks to 5 months in dupilumab participants. For the majority of participants, accidental overdose was a result of a protocol deviation.

Based on available data, accidental overdose is not considered an ADR of dupilumab in participants with CSU. Of note, dupilumab 300 mg qw has been approved for the treatment of patients with EoE (body weight ≥40 kg ) and has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with no new safety concerns.

Previously established ADRs for approved indications : The following PTs were reported with an incidence ≥2% in the dupilumab group and greater than placebo group and were reviewed for potential causal relationship with dupilumab:  Injection site reaction: See discussion above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The frequency of all other PTs in the dupilumab group was less than 2% and/or less than or similar to that in the placebo group.

## Conclusion

In summary, injection site reactions (20 [10.1%] participants in the dupilumab group versus 16 [8.0%] participants in the placebo group) were identified as an ADR in participants with CSU.

Overall, the incidence of injection site reaction in the dupilumab group was similar or lower than that observed in approved indications.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

## Laboratory values over time

No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in mean values of RBC, platelets, or WBC throughout the treatment-emergent period in the dupilumab and placebo groups.

## Blood eosinophil count

The mean (SD) blood eosinophil counts at baseline were similar between intervention groups (0.176 [0.160] Giga/L in the dupilumab group and 0.174 [0.148] Giga/L in the placebo group) and below the adult ULN (0.8 Giga/L). The maximal value observed at baseline was 1.09 Giga/L in the dupilumab group and 1.07 Giga/L in the placebo group. No difference in the mean change from baseline was observed at Week 12 between the dupilumab group and placebo group. At Week 24, a slight increase in the change from baseline in mean (SD) blood eosinophil count was observed in the dupilumab group (+0.015 [0.235] Giga/L), which returned to baseline value at Week 36 (0.178 Giga/L) and that was driven by a few

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outliers. Although not clinically significant, this slight increase was observed in Study B, but not in Study C and Study A.

## Potentially clinically significant abnormality

The overall number of participants with PCSAs for hematology parameters during the treatment-emergent period was low and without clinically meaningful differences between the intervention groups.

## Blood eosinophil PCSAs

Among the participants with normal or missing values at baseline, the number (%) of participants with post-baseline PCSAs for high blood eosinophil count (ie, &gt;ULN or ≥0.5 Giga/L if ULN &lt;0.5 Giga/L) was 7 (3.7%) participants in the dupilumab group and 4 (2.1%) in the placebo group.

A similar percentage of participants was observed with post-baseline peak blood eosinophils ≥0.5 Giga/L (regardless of baseline value) in the dupilumab and placebo groups (14 [7.3%] and 15 [7.8%], respectively). No post-baseline peak blood eosinophil count ≥5 Giga/L was reported in any participant.

Of the 13 participants with postbaseline PCSAs, peak values between &gt;0.8 and &lt;1.1 Giga/L were observed in 6 participants (2 in the dupilumab group and 4 in the placebo group). Peak values of ≥ 1.1 Giga/L were observed in 7 participants (6 in the dupilumab group and 1 in the placebo group).

All cases of eosinophilia were reported abnormal laboratory findings without any associated symptoms.

## Individual clinically relevant abnormalities

No participants were reported with TEAEs related to hematological abnormalities that were reported as treatment-emergent SAEs or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

## Clinical chemistry

## Metabolic parameters

Laboratory values over time: No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in mean metabolic parameters (glucose, total cholesterol, creatine kinase [median], and total protein) throughout the treatment-emergent period in the dupilumab and placebo groups.

Potentially clinically significant abnormality: The overall number of participants with PCSAs for metabolic parameters during the treatment-emergent period was low and without clinically meaningful differences between the intervention groups.

Individual clinically relevant abnormalities: No participants were reported with TEAEs related to metabolic abnormalities that were reported as treatment-emergent SAEs and/or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

## Electrolytes

Laboratory values over time: No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in mean electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and bicarbonate) throughout the treatmentemergent period in the dupilumab and placebo groups.

Potentially clinically significant abnormality: There were no PCSAs for sodium, chloride, bicarbonates, nor calcium. In the dupilumab group, there was 1 PCSA for low potassium and 1 PCSA for high potassium identified throughout the treatment-emergent period. In the placebo group, there was 1 PCSA for high potassium.

Individual clinically relevant abnormalities: No participants were reported with TEAEs related to electrolyte laboratory test abnormalities that were reported as treatment-emergent SAEs and/or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal function

Laboratory values over time: No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in mean renal function parameters (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urate, and creatinine clearance) throughout the treatment-emergent period in the dupilumab and placebo groups.

Potentially clinically significant abnormality: The proportion of participants with PCSAs for renal function parameters (regardless of baseline values) was similar between intervention groups during the treatment-emergent period, with the exception of PCSAs for high urate, which we more frequently reported in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (16.1% versus 8.2%).

Among the participants with normal or missing values at baseline, PCSAs for low, mild decreases in creatinine clearance (adults) were reported with a higher incidence in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group (10.6% versus 6.3%).

Creatinine was elevated (ie, increase from baseline at least grade 2 [adults]) for only 1 participant in the placebo group.

For the 12 adolescents and 5 children, there were no PCSAs for low GRF identified.

Individual clinically relevant abnormalities: No participants were reported with TEAEs related to renal function abnormalities that were reported as treatment-emergent SAEs and/or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

## Liver function

Laboratory values over time: No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in mean liver function parameters (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, and albumin) throughout the treatment-emergent period in the dupilumab and placebo groups.

Potentially clinically significant abnormality: The number of participants with PCSAs for liver function parameters was low and similar between intervention groups. No participants had liver function abnormalities that met laboratory criteria for Hy's Law (ALT &gt;3×ULN and total bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN).

Among the participants with normal or missing ALT values at baseline, 4 (2.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 2 (1.0%) participants in the placebo group had PCSAs for ALT &gt;3×ULN. Of these, 2 (1.1%) participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) participant in the placebo group also had PCSAs for ALT &gt;5×ULN. For all 4 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 participant in the placebo group, these PCSAs were reported as a TEAE of ALT increased. The second participant in the placebo group with no medical history of liver function abnormalities and a baseline ALT value of 0.42xULN had a PSCA for ALT &gt;5xULN (5.33xULN) on Day 253 (Week 36 [EOS]), which was not reported by the investigator as an AESI of significant ALT elevation as it was not considered clinically meaningful due to the participant's significant alcohol use. ALT values returned to &lt;3xULN before the last dose of IMP in 2 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 participant in the placebo group. Two participants in the dupilumab group (both in EFC16461 Study A), 1 with a PCSA for ALT &gt;3xULN and 1 with a PCSA for ALT &gt;5xULN, had abnormal ALT and AST values at baseline which were not reported as TEAEs.

Individual clinically relevant abnormalities: No participants were reported with TEAEs related to liver function abnormalities that were reported as treatment-emergent SAEs and/or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation. As per the AESI criteria, there were no significant ALT elevations. As per the other selected AE groupings criteria, 7 (3.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) participant in the placebo group were reported with nonserious potential drug-related hepatic disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Vital signs, examinations

## Vital signs

Parameter value over time: No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed for vital sign parameters (SBP, DBP, heart rate, weight, respiratory rate, and body temperature) throughout the treatment-emergent period in the dupilumab and placebo groups.].

Potentially clinically significant abnormality: Among the participants with normal or missing vital sign parameters at baseline, the percentage of participants with post-baseline PCSAs was low and similar between intervention groups. During the treatment-emergent period (regardless of baseline PCSA status), a lower percentage of participants in the dupilumab group had weight-related PCSAs (decrease from baseline) as compared to the placebo group (5.7% versus 12.2%).

Individual clinically relevant abnormalities: No participants were reported with TEAEs related to vital sign abnormalities that were reported as treatment-emergent SAEs and/or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

## Electrocardiogram

Potentially clinically significant abnormality: ECG results were not summarized for the pooled safety population; ECG data are provided in the individual study reports.

In EFC16461 Study C, the incidence of PCSAs for ECG parameters were &lt;8% in both intervention groups, except for PCSA of high heart rate (at least Grade 1) (6 [9.0%] participants in the dupilumab group and 2 [2.9%] participants in the placebo group). Grade 3 PCSAs included high PR interval in 0 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (1.4%) participant in the placebo group and high QTc interval in 0 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 (1.4%) participant in the placebo group.

In EFC16461 Study A, the incidence of PCSAs for ECG parameters was &lt;5% in both intervention groups, except for PCSA of Grade 1 high QTc interval (4 [5.9%] in the dupilumab group and 5 [7.8%] in the placebo group). There were no Grade 3 PCSAs.

In EFC16461 Study B, the incidences of PCSAs for ECG parameters were &lt;8% in both intervention groups. Most of the PCSAs for ECG parameters were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. One participant in the dupilumab group had a grade 3 PCSA for high PR interval and 1 participant in the placebo group had a Grade 3 PCSA for high and increase from baseline in heart rate.

Individual clinically relevant abnormalities: In EFC16461 Study C, Study A, and Study B, no participants were reported with TEAEs related to ECG abnormalities that were reported as treatmentemergent SAEs and/or TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation.

## Immunogenicity

Incidence and characterization of anti-dupilumab antibodies: In the pooled ADA population (Studies C, A, and B), the majority of participants were ADA-negative (88.6% and 98.5% in dupilumab and placebo group, respectively).

During the on-treatment period, treatment-emergent positive ADA responses were identified in 10 participants overall, of which 9 (4.7%) participants were in the dupilumab group and 1 (0.5%) participant was in the placebo group. Most were of lowtiter (&lt;100 0) responses (8 [4.1%] participants in the dupilumab group and 1 [0.5%] participant in the placebo group). There were 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 3 (1.5%) participants in the placebo group with pre-existing immunoreactivity, but no treatmentboosted ADA response (≥4×baseline ADA titer). A total of 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab group were classified as NAb-positive compared to 2 (1.0%) participants in the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the treatment-emergent period (24 weeks on-treatment and 12 weeks follow-up), treatmentemergent positive ADA responses were identified in 25 participants overall, of which 22 (11.4%) participants were in the dupilumab group and 3 (1.5%) participants were in the placebo group. In the dupilumab group, most were lowtiter (&lt;1000) responses (20 [10.4%] participants). There were 2 (1.0%) participants in the dupilumab group and 3 (1.5%) participants in the placebo group with preexisting immunoreactivity, but no treatment-boosted ADA response (≥4×baseline ADA titer) . A total of 18 [9.3%] participants in the dupilumab group were classified as NAb-positive compared to 3 [1.5%] participants in the placebo group.

Association of anti-dupilumab antibodies to adverse events: In the pooled ADA population (Studies C, A, and B), analyses of all TEAEs and focused analyses of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, and injection site reactions. No TEAEs of anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, severe injection site reactions lasting more than 24 hours, or serious injection site reactions were reported in participants with treatment-emergent or treatment boosted ADA.

In the dupilumab group, 14 (63.6%) out of the 22 ADA-positive participants and 93 (55.0%) out of 169 ADA-negative participants had at least 1 TEAE. In the placebo group, 1 (33.3%) out of 3 ADA-positive participants and 105 (55.9%) out of 188 ADA-negative participants had at least 1 TEAE. Of the 14 ADApositive participants in the dupilumab group who had at least 1 TEAE, 6 participants  had TEAEs on or after the first identified ADA response.

In summary, there was no significant impact of ADA formation on safety in the 22 participants in the dupilumab group with positive ADA responses. Overall, comparison of the type and frequency of TEAEs during the study intervention period did not show meaningful differences between the ADA positive and ADA negative groups in the dupilumab and placebo groups.

## Safety in special populations

## Intrinsic factors

The following intrinsic factors were analyzed for their effects on the incidence of number of participants with any TEAEs, any treatment-emergent SAEs, and any TEAEs leading to study intervention discontinuation: Age group, Gender, Race ,Ethnicity, Baseline weight, Baseline BMI, Baseline disease characteristics (prior omalizumab treatment, presence of angioedema, duration of disease, UAS7, ISS7), Concomitant or background medications, Biomarkers.

No meaningful differences in TEAE incidence were observed between the dupilumab and placebo groups across subgroups based on demographics and baseline disease characteristics

## Extrinsic factors

The following extrinsic factors were analyzed for their effects on the incidence of number of participants with any TEAEs, any treatment-emergent SAE, and any TEAE leading to study intervention discontinuation: Region (Asia, Latin America, Western Countries , and Eastern Europe), and Territory (North America, European Union &amp; United Kingdom, Rest of World).

No meaningful differences were observed between the dupilumab and placebo groups across subgroups based on region and territory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug interactions: No new data are available on drug interactions. H1 antihistamine treatment was used cconcomitantly during the CSU studies.

Use in pregnancy and lactation: Additional information about pregnancies in adult and adolescent patients treated with dupilumab is provided in the initial application for AD indication and subsequent submissions for AD, CRSwNP, asthma, EoE, and PN. See the reports on the EMA website.

Overdose: There were 9 (4.5%) participants in the dupilumab group and 4 (2.0%) participants in the placebo group who had accidental overdose events with IMP; all were asymptomatic. Of note, a TEAE of accidental overdose was initially reported as symptomatic in 1 participant in the dupilumab group but was confirmed to be an asymptomatic overdose later.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the pooled safety population, the number (%) of participants who had at least 1 TEAE reported by the Investigator as the reason for permanent study intervention discontinuation was 2 (1.0%) in the dupilumab group and 5 (2.5%) participants in the placebo group (Table 41). All TEAEs were reported by single participants only, except for the PT of chronic spontaneous urticaria which was reported in 2 participants in the placebo group. All events were assessed by the Investigator as not related to IMP, with the exception of 1 TEAE of arthritis and 1 TEAE of chronic spontaneous urticaria, both in the placebo group. All TEAEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation had resolved, except for the TEAE of borderline personality disorder in the dupilumab group and the TEAE of completed suicide in the placebo group. The pregnancy was completed by delivery without complications.

## Post marketing experience

Dupilumab is approved for indications in AD, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, and COPD and has been approved in Japan, United Arab Emirates, and Brazil for the treatment of patients with CSU. Postmarketing safety surveillance includes routine pharmacovigilance activities such as adverse reaction reporting and signal detection, and the following additional pharmacovigilance activities:

- Pregnancy and lactation (post-marketing pregnancy registry [Study R668-AD-1639] and pregnancy outcome database study [Study R668-AD-1760] in participants with AD)
- Registry-based long-term safety study in pediatric participants aged ≥6 months to &lt;6 years with AD
- Phase 3 open-label extension study (Study R668-AD-1434) in pediatric participants aged ≥6 months to &lt;6 years with AD

No new safety findings were identified based on the post-marketing data in the most recently submitted global Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report covering the period from 29 March 2023 to 28 March 2024. Based on post-marketing surveillance through 28 March 2024, with a cumulative exposure of 1.9 million patient-years, the benefit-risk profile of dupilumab across all authorized indications remain favorable.

## Clinical trial data across indications

The safety data from placebo-controlled studies of other dupilumab indications approved in 1 or more countries used for comparison of safety profiles across indications and between adults and adolescents were:

- The primary safety pool in the initial AD submission in adults: 1047 participants exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q2w or 300 mg qw (R668-AD-1021, R668-AD-1334, and R668-AD-1416, 16-week safety pool). In adolescent with AD: 165 participants exposed to dupilumab q2w tiered by weight (200 mg if body weight &lt;60 kg or 300 mg if body weight ≥60 kg) during 16 weeks in Study R668 -AD-1526.
- The primary safety pool in adults and adolescents with asthma: 1499 adults and 68 adolescents exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q2w or 200 mg q2w (DRI12544, 24-week safety pool, adults only; EFC13579, 52-week safety pool, adults and adolescents).
- The primary safety pool in adults with CRSwNP: 440 participants exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q2w (EFC14146 and EFC14280, 24-week safety pool).
- The primary safety pool in adults and adolescents with EoE: 54 adults and 27 adolescents exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 108 adults and 37 adolescents exposed to dupilumab 300 mg qw (R668EE-1774 Part A and Part B, 24-week treatment period and R668-EE-1324, 12-week treatment period).
- The primary safety pool in adults with PN: 152 participants exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q2w (EFC16460 and EFC16459, 24-week safety pool).
- The primary safety pool in adults with COPD: 938 participants exposed to dupilumab 300 mg q2w (EFC15804 and EFC15805, 52-week safety pool). At the time of the EFC15805 interim analysis data cut-off date, 78.7% of the enrolled participants had completed the Week 52/EOT visit or discontinued the study prior to Week 52. Dupilumab has been approved by one or more health authority for the treatment of COPD.

Injection site reactions, serum sickness, serum sickness-like reactions, and anaphylaxis are considered ADRs across indications. Based on data from completed clinical trials, serum sickness and serum-sickness

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

like reactions were observed rarely and only in AD clinical trials and anaphylaxis related to dupilumab was observed rarely and only in an asthma clinical trial. However, they are considered ADRs across indications as hypersensitivity is not expected to be indication-specific. In completed clinical studies in AD, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, conjunctivitis bacterial, blepharitis, dry eye, eye pruritus, herpes simplex, eosinophilia, and oral herpes were identified ADRs. Conjunctivitis is also an ADR in the CRSwNP and PN indications, although it occurred at a lower incidence in CRSwNP and PN studies compared to AD studies. In AD, asthma, and EoE indications, the safety profile is comparable between adults and adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years). Pediatric patients with AD (6 months to &lt;12 years), asthma (6 to &lt;12 years), and EoE (1 to &lt;12 years) also showed a similar safety profile compared to adults and older pediatric patients. Additional ADRs of enterobiasis and eosinophilia were identified in the pediatric asthma population.

Systemic hypersensitivity and conjunctivitis and keratitis-related events in AD patients are considered important identified risks of dupilumab. Eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms in patients with asthma or CRSwNP and comorbid asthma is an important potential risk, based on cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic pneumonia reported in asthma clinical trials (as well as in adult patients with comorbid asthma in the CRSwNP development program). These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. A causal association between dupilumab and these conditions has not been established.

Based on the data reported, no new safety concerns were identified and the safety observed in CSU was generally consistent with that observed in the other approved indications. Regarding long-term use, dupilumab has been extensively evaluated with several studies, including a 5-year open-label extension study in participants with AD (R668-AD-1225) and a 3-year open-label extension study in participants with asthma (LPS15023). The type and incidence of TEAEs did not increase during 52-weeks treatment with AD, asthma and CRSwNP studies. Therefore, it is not expected that the type of TEAEs observed with dupilumab treatment will increase for CSU patients during 52-week treatment. The data from the R668AD-1225 study and LPS15023 study provide evidence that long-term treatment with dupilumab 300 mg qw/q2w had a safety profile similar to that of treatment with the dupilumab for shorter durations. These data provide support for the long-term use of dupilumab for adults and adolescents with CSU over 24 weeks. In conclusion, the safety profile in CSU clinical program in adults and adolescents was consistent with other completed dupilumab clinical programs in adults and adolescents (AD, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, and COPD) and no new safety concerns were identified in the CSU programme.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

## Database

The pooled safety population included 397 participants in total (151 participants from Study C, 138 participants from Study A, and 108 participants from Study B): 198 participants in the dupilumab group and 199 participants in the placebo group. Data from study A and B were already assessed during procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0083. The applicant pooled the new safety data generated in study C with those from studies B and A which is agreed. A short separate analysis and comparison of the safety results across the individual studies were provided.

Hitherto available safety data from adolescents and paediatric participants development programme including the approved indications AD, asthma, CRSwNP, COPD, PN and EoE. The safety profile of the approved indications is relatively consistent between adults and adolescents as well as across the different indications. Overall, a large safety database is available for comparison with the newly submitted data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In comparison to procedure II/0083, the focus is now on studies C and A that enrolled participants who had been omalizumab-naïve. Safety data include data from the 24-week treatment period and the additional 12-week follow-up period as of the cut-off date for Study C (1 August 2024), as well as data from the 24-week study intervention period and the additional 12-week follow-up period for Studies A and B. The received dose was mainly 300 mg Q2W. Studies C, A and B had a similar study design as to periods and doses, however, study populations differed as to their pre-treatment. Study B had enrolled adult and adolescent participants with CSU who remained symptomatic despite the use of H1antihistamine and who were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab, whereas participants enrolled in study A and C were omalizumab-naïve. Overall, the safety pool includes data from 12 adolescents and 5 children. Supportive data come from post-marketing surveillance for approved indications.

## Exposure

The majority of participants was exposed for ≥24 weeks. The exposure was highest in study C and balanced between the treatment groups. The exposure of adolescent patients was extremely low due to the limited participant number and low prevalence in the paediatric population, respectively. It is acknowledged that there is an extensive safety data base existent from other indications, but safety data from adolescents are generally more limited. The PDCO considered that the completed studies were compliant with the latest decisions, therefore a partial compliance check has been validated. As noted before, no long-term safety data is to be expected. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups, as well as disease characteristics at baseline. The majority had severe disease activity at baseline and all were receiving concomitant use of H1-antihistamines for CSU. As it was concurred before, participants enrolled in EFC16461 Study B were a more recalcitrant study population.

## Adverse events

In the pooled safety population percentages of participants with at least one TEAE during the observation period (see above) was similar in both treatment groups, also regarding the exposure-adjusted incidence rates. Further incidences of TEAE, SAE and AESI were balanced between the treatment groups, only treatment emergent other selected AE were reported in more participants assigned to the dupilumab group mainly due to TEAEs of injection site reactions. As to the TEAE severity, the majority of TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as mild or moderate in intensity.

Overall, incidences of TEAEs were similar between the treatment groups at SOC and PT levels, with minor differences as to PTs Injection site reaction, Accidental overdose, Pharyngitis, and Alanine aminotransferase increased that occurred with a higher frequency in the dupilumab group.

Severe TEAE were balanced between the treatment groups and PT occurred individually.

The proportions of study participants that experienced at least one SAE during the treatment-emergent period were similar in both treatment groups. All treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for single participants only and were all not related to the study intervention. No specific pattern was observed. Permanent discontinuation occurred in one participant of both treatment groups.

The incidence of treatment-related AESI was comparable in both treatment groups. One hypersensitivity reaction and one pregnancy occurred in each group. The majority of treatment-related other selected AE were injection site reactions with a slightly higher frequency in the dupilumab group. Treatmentemergent AEs of potential drug-related hepatic disorder were more frequently reported in the dupilumab group, as already noticed and discussed in procedure II/0083; one of these events that were reported in study C, was assessed as related, however it was mild and resolved spontaneously. Further PTs were balanced between the treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Permanent discontinuation of the study drug following TEAEs were rarely reported in the pooled safety population and more rarely in the dupilumab group. Reasons for study drug discontinuation were deemed unrelated. In the Placebo group, 2 participants discontinued the study intervention due to CSU.

Criteria determined for ADR assessment are endorsed. TEAEs of potential drug-related hepatic disorders were analysed in more detail upon request during procedure II/0083; the submitted overview on postmarketing reports of liver toxicity and the data did not suggest a causal association between elevated transaminases and dupilumab treatment, and data collected throughout the dupilumab development program (indications AD, plot, CRSwNP, EoE, and COPD) do not indicate a potential for drug-induced liver injury. It is thus not considered an ADR.

It is agreed that no new ADR should be included in the Dupixent Product Information.

## Laboratory findings

The mean blood eosinophil counts of participants assigned to the dupilumab group in study B peaked around week 24 but the rise of eosinophils was of transient nature, a phenomenon that has been observed during development programmes of approved indications. Post-baseline PCSA for high eosinophil count were thus slightly higher in the verum group but remained below the threshold for eosinophilia TEAEs ( ≥5 Giga/L ) and were not associated with clinical symptoms. PCSAs for liver function parameters were rarely observed. Few patients had transient elevations of ALT. The renal function was unaffected by dupilumab throughout the studies. 4 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 participant in the placebo group had PCSAs reported as a TEAE of ALT increased, however, in 2 participants assigned to the dupilumab group ALT values returned to &lt;3xULN before the last dose of IMP in 2 participan ts, and the 2 other participants had already presented with abnormal ALT and AST values at baseline and similar declines during the course of the study. No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in mean metabolic parameters, electrolytes, and renal function parameters. No clinically relevant abnormalities were reported as to vital signs and physical examinations. As to ECG results, PCSA were balanced between the treatment groups of the individual studies.

## Immunogenicity

During the on-treatment period, treatment-emergent positive ADA responses were identified in a few patients, most were low-titer responses. None of the observed TEAEs with onset after the first identified ADA response led to IMP discontinuation or was considered related to IMP. It is concurred that there was no significant impact of ADA formation on safety.

## Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety

In the dupilumab group only one TEAE was reported in an adolescent participant (PT: nasopharyngitis, not related to study drug).

Studies A and C included paediatric patients from the age ≥ 6 to &lt;18 years, whereas study B enrolled paediatric participants aged ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years. Overall, the safety pool includes data from 12 adolescents. As such, the paediatric participant number is very limited, and no conclusion can be drawn on safety aspects in this specific subpopulation. The acquisition of long-term safety data in paediatric (CSU) patients was discussed during procedure II/0083 (see EPAR for procedure EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0083 on the EMA website). ..

The dupilumab exposure in paediatric participants enrolled in the CSU Studies was considered to be reflective of the prevalence of CSU in the paediatric population and extrapolation of safety data from the adults CSU population was deemed acceptable due to the existence of supportive long-term safety data generated in paediatric patients currently available from the Dupixent clinical development programmes

of approved indications, as well as from the post-marketing setting including a registry (AD, asthma, and EoE indications, PEDISTAD registry, and OLE Study R668-AD-1434, ≥ 6 months to &lt;18 years) . The safety profile of the approved indications is hitherto relatively consistent between adults and paediatric patients as well as across the different indications.

Additional data on safety in Elderly subjects ( &lt;65, ≥ 65 and ≥ 75 years), were provided by the MAH that, while numbers are very small, showed a similar a trend to the overall study population.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Based on the analysis of the provided safety data, no new safety concerns were identified and dupilumab appears to be well tolerated in study participants with CSU. So far, the presented safety data in adults are consistent with the hitherto known safety profile of dupilumab and no new ADR were identified that should be included in the Product Information. As comorbidities like AD and asthma share common pathophysiological mechanisms with specific endotypes of CSU, it can be assumed that the safety profile is consistent during long term use in adults and adolescents.

There are no new safety concerns arising from Study C data. The safety findings are consistent with those of Studies A and B. No update of the Product information is required.

## 2.8. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes to the PI.

## 2.8.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria, is a skin disease characterized by the spontaneous appearance of pruritic wheals (hives) and flare-type skin reactions without a specific known cause that persist for more than 6 weeks, and which may be accompanied by angioedema in approximately 40-50% of patients. Although all age groups can be affected, the peak incidence occurs between 20 and 40 years of age with women more frequently affected than men. Itch is the most predominant symptom in CSU. Severe itch and unpredictable occurrence of wheals and angioedema are responsible for limitations on daily life, deteriorating patients' performance at school and work, as well as causing psychiatric disorders in these patients. Significant exacerbations of chronic urticaria may result in emergency room visits and hospitalizations. The underlying pathologic mechanism for CSU is believed to be related to mast cell and basophil activation by both IgE-mediated and non-IgE mediated mechanisms.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

The current treatment guidelines for the management of CSU recommend the use of non-sedating oral H1-antihistamines as first-line therapy. The only other approved treatment for CSU in adolescents and adults is the  antiIgE treatment, omalizumab. The treatment approaches for CSU in children &lt;12 years

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of age are similar to that in adults and adolescents. However, omalizumab is not approved for treatment of pediatric patients with CSU aged &lt;12 years. The current international guideline (initiated by the European societies European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology [EAACI]/Global Allergy [GA2LEN]/and Asthma European Network European Dermatology Forum [EDF] in collaboration with the World Allergy Organization [WAO]) recommends a 4-step treatment approach to direct primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. In Step 1, the treatment starts with non-sedating H1-antihistamines at approved doses. If symptoms are inadequately controlled after 2 to 4 weeks, an increase in H1antihistamine dose up to 4-fold (unapproved dose) is recommended (Step 2). If symptoms still remain uncontrolled or are intolerable, omalizumab (anti-IgE) should be added (Step 3). Beyond this, Step 4 treatment options include add-on ciclosporin A or montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist) to H1-antihistamine. Once symptom control or remission is achieved and maintained, stepping down treatment is recommended. There is a therapeutic need for alternative treatment options for patients with persistent disease that cannot be controlled by H1-antihistamines.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Data for clinical efficacy are based on the results from two pivotal randomized, double-blind, parallelgroup, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 24-week treatment studies (EFC16461 Study A and EFC16461 Study C). Both studies were conducted under one master protocol and enrolled patients with moderateto-severe CSU who were symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamines and who have not received anti-IgE therapy before. The studies enrolled adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients. For both studies, dupilumab 300 mg q2w, dupilumab 200 mg q2w, or placebo were evaluated in adult and adolescent patients (≥12 to &lt;18 years of age). Patients were followed up until week 36. Additional data from a third supportive study (EFC16461 Study B) conducted in CSU patients who were symptomatic despite the use of H1-antihistamines and who had either previously shown an inadequate response or intolerance to antiIgE therapy with omalizumab were also provided. The safety evaluation is based on the pooled analysis from all three studies.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

In both studies (Study A and C), a reduction in the key urticarial symptoms (i.e. itch and hives) as measured by change in UAS7 was observed at week 24. In Study A, the LS mean decrease from baseline was -20.53 and -12.00 in the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively, with a LS mean difference of 8.53 (95% CI: -13.16, -3.90; p=0.0003). In Study C, the LS mean decrease from baseline was -15.86 and -11.21 in the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively, with a LS mean difference of -4.65 (95% CI: -8.65, -0.65; p=0.0226). Symptom improvements were similarly driven by a reduction in itch and hive severity as seen by consistent reductions in the UAS7 subcomponents ISS7 and HSS7 (evaluated as secondary endpoints) and were consistent between participants with moderate or severe disease activity.

In both studies, the proportion of participants with well-controlled CSU symptoms (UAS7 ≤ 6) was increased compared to placebo (Study A: 45.7% vs. 23.5%; OR: 2.848, 95% CI: 1.301, 6.234; p=0.0075; Study C: 40.5% vs. 23.4%; OR: 3.137, 95% CI: 1.371, 7.176; p=0.0045). Similar higher number of responders were seen for participants with complete resolution of CSU symptoms (UAS7=0) in both studies (Study A: 31.4% vs. 13.2%; Study C: 29.7% vs. 18.2%).

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

In studies A and C, changes in UAS7 did not reach the minimal important difference on a group-level. There is an apparent number of participants with improvements in the placebo arm, likely representing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

spontaneous remissions. Given the overall heterogenous response characteristics in both studies and a number of participants with improvements in the placebo group, it can be anticipated that a considerable number of patients may not receive additional benefit with dupilumab.

It is unclear whether the observed treatment effect can be linked to a certain CSU subpopulation or CSU endotype as no data to discriminate these subgroups have been collected during the studies.

Long-term efficacy data are missing as the treatment period in both studies was only 24 Weeks. No longterm extension studies were conducted for the new indication of CSU. In both studies, there was no clear loss of response in UAS7 or ISS7 and HSS7 after treatment discontinuation during the 12-week follow-up. It is uncertain whether long-term therapy with the proposed posology is needed to maintain improvements in CSU symptoms once a satisfactory clinical response is achieved. The need for continued therapy needs to be periodically assessed by the prescribing physician. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The percentage of participants who reported at least 1 TEAE was very similar between treatment groups (DUP 55.6% vs. Placebo (PBO) 55.3%). The most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC ( ≥10%) in the dupilumab group as compared with placebo were infections and infestations (22.2% vs. 23.1%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (17.2% and 18.1%), general disorders and administration site conditions (11.6% and 10.6%), and injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (12.1% and 5.5%).

The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT (≥2%) in the dupilumab group with a difference of greater 1% as compared to placebo were COVID-19 (6.1% vs. 5.0%), injection site reaction (4.0% vs. 2.0%), accidental overdose (4.5% vs. 2.0%), pharyngitis (2.5% vs. 1.0%), and alanine aminotransferase increased (3.0% vs. 0.5%).

One participant with a medical history of psychiatric disorders assigned to the placebo group died following suicide. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 5.1% (DUP) vs. 4.0% (PBO). One serious CSU and idiopathic angioedema event were reported in the dupilumab group as well as one case each of colorectal adenocarcinoma, bacterial pneumonia, concussion, intestinal obstruction, unstable angina, hepatic steatosis, and depression.

Adverse event of special interest (AESI) occurred in 1.5% of the participants in the dupilumab group vs. 1.0% of the Placebo group. In both groups one participant each experienced a systemic hypersensitivity reaction and became pregnant. Furthermore, injection site reactions were observed in 10.1% of the patients (DUP) vs. 8.0% (PBO) and the majority thereof was considered related to the study drug. Potential drug-related hepatic disorder was reported for 3.5% (DUP) vs. 0.5% (PBO) participants. Hypersensitivity events were observed in 0.5% of each treatment group.

Severe TEAEs occurred in 3.0% participants of both treatment groups.

TEAEs that were considered related to the study intervention by the investigator were reported in 14.6% participants in the dupilumab group vs. 13.6% participants in the placebo group. Most of the study intervention-related TEAEs were recorded in SOC injection site reactions HLT 9.1% (DUP) vs. 7.5% (PBO).

Treatment discontinuations caused by TEAEs were reported in 1.0% of the participants assigned to the dupilumab group and in 2.5% of those in the placebo group.

No new ADR were identified. The incidence of ADAs was overall low without relevant impact on safety and efficacy.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The overall percentages of recorded TEAEs in the pooled safety population were balanced across the treatment groups. The majority of observed common TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, unrelated to the study intervention, and self-limiting or resolved with corrective treatment.

Qualitatively, the observed TEAEs were consistent with those reported in previous clinical development programmes. No deaths occurred in the dupilumab group. Serious adverse events were balanced across both treatment groups and SAEs were reported for single participants only and considered unrelated to IMP.

Treatment-related TEAEs were slightly more frequently observed in the placebo group, no specific cluster as to PTs is existent in both treatment groups.

Treatment-emergent AESIs were balanced in percentage terms between the treatment groups; injection site reactions were mostly considered related to the study drug, however, mild to moderate, decreased over time and resolved spontaneously. Eye-related adverse events were rarely observed and conjunctivitis events were also balanced across the treatment groups. No further AESIs were observed in the safety pool.

All the TEAEs leading to premature and permanent intervention discontinuation were less frequently reported in the dupilumab group and considered unrelated.

Overall, the paediatric data available do not reveal additional safety concerns not already seen in the children/adolescent/adult populations with AD, but it has to be highlighted that the numbers recruited are so limited that no conclusion on safety data can be drawn.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The burden for CSU patients is significant, especially if the disease is not well controlled. A substantial number of patients does not achieve adequate symptom control with existing H1-antihistamine therapies, even when doses are increased up to 4-fold leaving a large proportion with persistent symptoms on the skin that are severely impacting their quality of life.

In CSU patients whose disease is inadequately controlled by H1-antihistamines and who are naïve to antiIgE therapy, treatment with dupilumab led to substantial improvements in urticaria symptoms with consistent reductions in itch and hives. The treatment effect was, however, heterogenous, with distinct numbers of patients also improving under placebo treatment, reflecting the spontaneous and possible self-limiting nature of the disease. Consequently, in both studies a clinically meaningful difference compared to placebo was not fully reached on a group-level. Still, a statistically significant higher number of patients achieved clinically meaningful symptom improvements versus placebo as seen by UAS7 responder analysis. Overall, the data suggest that substantial symptom improvement was only achieved in certain patients that may be belong to a distinct group of CSU patients, but it was not possible to identify this population more precisely with the available data.

Despite the limitations in the efficacy data, dupilumab can present an alternative treatment option in CSU patients. Given the overall heterogenous response observed in both studies and the still remaining uncertainties, consideration must be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment. In addition, since long-term data beyond 24 weeks are missing and no clear worsening of symptoms after the end of dupilumab treatment was observed, the need for continued therapy needs to be periodically assessed. This is reflected in the SmPC. During the studies patients were on stable background H1-antihistamine therapy. Still, as patients with an inadequate response to H1-antihistamines will be treated with dupilumab, further treatment with antihistamines may not be needed if a response is observed. Reductions or even complete stop of antihistamines can be considered by the treating physician.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only 12 adolescent participants were enrolled which is consistent with the PIP. No conclusion on CSUspecific efficacy and safety results can be drawn from these numbers as they are too limited. However, extrapolation of results obtained for adults to the adolescent population is considered justified given the similarities in disease pathology. The safety profile of dupilumab in adolescents with CSU is anticipated to be comparable to adults.

As immunomodulatory drug with a subcutaneous route of administration, the most relevant safety concerns associated with dupilumab treatment are systemic hypersensitivity including events with immunogenicity helminthic infections, eosinophilic conditions, and conjunctivitis and keratitis related events which predominantly occurred in atopic dermatitis patients. There were no reported events of anaphylactic reactions, one event of systemic hypersensitivity reaction was observed in either of the treatment groups. Participants who experienced TEAEs of infections were balanced across the treatment groups; especially no helminthic infections were reported. Conjunctivitis-related events were balanced, no further eye-related events occurred. No events of clinically symptomatic eosinophilia were reported. Furthermore, the available immunogenicity data do not rise concerns. The observed treatment-emergent adverse events were predominantly mild to moderate and resolved without additional treatment.

The exposure of study participants included in this submission is considered sufficient. Principally, the safety profile of Dupixent remains unaltered based on the presented data. As the studies are completed, no further long-term data explicitly for CSU patients are to be expected. Atopic diseases have been commonly reported in CSU patients, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, AD and food allergy suggesting pathogenic similarities. Currently available long-term safety data in AD and asthma are therefore considered informative as regards the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in the CSU patients. Based on this, it can be accepted that no further dedicated long-term safety data beyond routine pharmacovigilance will be collected.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The therapeutic need of dupilumab in CSU patients who remain symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine treatment is acknowledged. While a meaningful benefit may not be achieved in all patients due to the spontaneous onset and remission of the disease, dupilumab can present an effective alternative treatment option as demonstrated by the results of both studies showing a relevant reduction in the key urticarial symptoms severity (i.e. itch and hives), and were consistent between participants with moderate or severe disease activity. The safety data appear consistent with the hitherto known safety profile bearing in mind the limited exposure, especially of paediatric patients, where the extrapolation approach is accepted.

Overall, the results are considered sufficiently robust to demonstrate a benefit for patients in the sought indication.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                    | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include Dupixent for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents 12 years and above, with inadequate response to H1 antihistamines and who are naive to anti-IgE therapy, based on final results from 2 studies: EFC16461 (CUPID) study A and study C; both of them were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group study of dupilumab in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1 antihistamine treatment in patients naïve to omalizumab.  As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 13.0 and 13.1 of the RMP have also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes to the PI.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0353/2024 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
