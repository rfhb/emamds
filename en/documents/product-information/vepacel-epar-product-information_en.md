This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

VEPACEL suspension for injection in multidose container Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (whole virion, inactivated, prepared in cell culture)

<!-- image -->

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: Influenza virus (whole virion, inactivated), containing antigen* of strain: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) 7.5 micrograms** * produced in Vero cells ** haemagglutinin This is a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection. Clear to opalescent suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. This indication is based on immunogenicity data from subjects from the age of 6 months onwards following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared with H5N1 subtype strains (see section 5.1). The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. Adults and children from 6 months onwards: Medicinal product no longer authorised

4.2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh, depending on the muscle mass.

See section 6.6 for administration instructions.

## 4.3 Contraindications

History of anaphylactic reactions to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). If vaccination is considered necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need (see section 4.4).

Immunoglobulin is not to be given with VEPACEL unless it is necessary during a medical emergency to provide immediate protection. If necessary, VEPACEL may be given at the same time as normal or specific immunoglobulin into separate limbs.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use This vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin and Vero host cell protein, which are used during the manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of a similar whole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during a pandemic period. Such reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with no known allergy. Immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. VEPACEL must not be administered intravascularly. There are no data with VEPACEL using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. A protective immune response may not be induced in all individuals receiving the vaccine (see section 5.1). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction There are no data on co-administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing treatment with immunosuppressants.

Following influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HTLV-1. In such cases, the western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

The safety of VEPACEL in pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed in clinical trials.

Animal studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3).

Healthcare providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient before prescribing VEPACEL. The use of VEPACEL during pregnancy and lactation may be considered in a pre-pandemic situation, taking into account official recommendations. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines VEPACEL has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects a) Summary of safety profile · Adults, older people, and special risk groups Clinical trials were conducted with the H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on the H5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3700 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years and 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. The adverse reactions observed are shown in the table below. The safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is similar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older people. · Infants, children, and adolescents Children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: In a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were administered the H5N1 vaccine. The incidence and nature of symptoms after the first and second vaccination were similar to those observed in the healthy adults and older people. Infants and children aged 6 to 35 months: In a clinical trial the H5N1 vaccine was administered to 36 infants and children aged 6 to 35 months. The observed adverse reactions from a paediatric clinical trial with the H5N1 vaccine are listed below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01

This section describes the clinical experience with the H5N1 vaccine.

Pandemic and Pre-pandemic vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as 'novel' antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the H5N1 vaccines will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with H5N1 vaccines are relevant for the pandemic and pre-pandemic vaccines.

Seroneutrali zation rates (MN titer ≥ 20) at 21 days after a booster vaccination with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain vaccine, tested against both the homologous and heterologous strains, were as follows: Seroneutralization rate* Tested against 12 Month Booster * MN titer ≥ 20 Information from non-clinical studies The protective efficacy of VEPACEL against morbidity and mortality induced by the infection with lethal doses of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus was assessed non-clinically in a ferret challenge model. Sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated. All ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent H5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. The A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced by full survival, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals. All control animals succumbed to the infection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

VEPACEL suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (whole virion, inactivated, prepared in cell culture)

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: Influenza virus (whole virion, inactivated), containing antigen* of strain: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) 7.5 micrograms** * produced in Vero cells ** haemagglutinin The vaccine is available in a single dose pre-filled syringe. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection. Clear to opalescent suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. This indication is based on immunogenicity data from subjects from the age of 6 months onwards following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared with H5N1 subtype strains (see section 5.1). The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Adults and children from 6 months onwards: Medicinal product no longer authorised

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

other paediatric Population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh, depending on the muscle mass.

See section 6.6. for administration instructions.

## 4.3 Contraindications

History of anaphylactic reactions to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). If vaccination is considered necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need (see section 4.4).

Immunoglobulin is not to be given with VEPACEL unless it is necessary during a medical emergency to provide immediate protection. If necessary, VEPACEL may be given at the same time as normal or specific immunoglobulin into separate limbs.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use This vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin and Vero host cell protein, which are used during the manufacturing process. Therefore, hypersensitivity reactions may occur. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of a similar whole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during a pandemic period. Such reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with no known allergy. Immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. VEPACEL must not be administered intravascularly. There are no data with VEPACEL using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. A protective immune response may not be induced in all individuals receiving the vaccine (see section 5.1). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction There are no data on co-administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing treatment with immunosuppressants.

Following influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

The safety of VEPACEL in pregnancy and lactation has not been assessed in clinical trials.

Animal studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3).

Healthcare providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient before prescribing VEPACEL.

The use of VEPACEL during pregnancy and lactation may be considered in a pre-pandemic situation, taking into account official recommendations. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines VEPACEL has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects a) Summary of safety profile · Adults, older people, and special risk groups Clinical trials were conducted with the H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on the H5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3700 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years and 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. The adverse reactions observed are shown in the table below. The safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is similar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older people. · Infants, children, and adolescents Children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: In a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were administered the H5N1 vaccine. The incidence and nature of symptoms after the first and second vaccination were similar to those observed in the healthy adults and older people. Infants and children aged 6 to 35 months: In a clinical trial the H5N1 vaccine was administered to 36 infants and children aged 6 to 35 months. The observed adverse reactions from a paediatric clinical trial with the H5N1 vaccine are listed below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01

This section describes the clinical experience with the H5N1 vaccine.

Pandemic and Pre-pandemic vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as 'novel' antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the H5N1 vaccines will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with H5N1 vaccines are relevant for the pandemic and pre-pandemic vaccines.

Sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated. All ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent H5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. The A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced by full survival, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals. All control animals succumbed to the infection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

C. OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION · Periodic Safety Update Reports The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. PSUR submission when VEPACEL is used during an influenza pandemic: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time. Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated. In addition, during a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared and the prepandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit more frequent simplified periodic safety update reports with a format and a periodicity defined in the \"CHMP Recommendations for the Core Risk Management Plan for Influenza Vaccines prepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier context\" (EMEA/49993/2008), and any subsequent update.

## D. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

## · Risk Management Plan (RMP)

<!-- image -->

- The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. An updated RMP should be submitted: · At the request of the European Medicines Agency · Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Package leaflet: Information for the user VEPACEL suspension for injection

Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (whole virion, inactivated, prepared in cell culture)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

<!-- image -->

if you have previously had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of VEPACEL (these are listed at the end of the leaflet - section 6) or to any substances that may be present in trace (very low) amounts: formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to have the vaccine, provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an allergic reaction.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. -If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet: 1. What VEPACEL is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive VEPACEL 3. How VEPACEL is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store VEPACEL 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What VEPACEL is and what it is used for VEPACEL is a vaccine for use in individuals aged 6 months and older. It is intended to be given before the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around the world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of an ordinary flu but are usually more severe. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. As with all vaccines, VEPACEL may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 2. What you need to know before you receive VEPACEL You should not receive VEPACEL Medicinal product no longer authorised

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

You should tell your doctor before vaccination:

- -if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be vaccinated with VEPACEL.
- -if you have had any allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine (see section 6 at the end of the leaflet) or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose, trypsin, Vero host cell protein). Allergic reactions, including sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have been reported following use of a similar vaccine for H1N1 influenza during a pandemic period. Such reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with no known allergy.

-if you have a weakened immune system as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. taking of corticosteroids or treatment for cancer. -if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. If you need a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses in the first few weeks after vaccination with VEPACEL, the result of the test may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting the test that you have recently received VEPACEL. The vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel. In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. Other medicines and VEPACEL Please tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or if you have recently received any other vaccine. There is no information on administration of VEPACEL with other vaccines. However, if this cannot be avoided, the other vaccine should not be injected into the same arm used for VEPACEL. You should be aware that side effects may be intensified. If you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment that affects the immune system (such as radiotherapy), VEPACEL can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor. VEPACEL should not be given at the same time as immunoglobulins. However, if this cannot be avoided, the immunoglobulins should not be injected into the same arm used for VEPACEL. Pregnancy, breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice if you should receive VEPACEL. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Driving and using machines

VEPACEL may affect your ability to drive and use machines.
