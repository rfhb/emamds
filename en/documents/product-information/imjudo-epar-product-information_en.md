| Advanced or unresectable HCC | IMJUDO 300 mg a as a single dose administered in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg a at Cycle 1/Day 1, followed by durvalumab monotherapy every 4 weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Metastatic NSCLC             | During platinum chemotherapy: 75 mg b in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks (21 days) for 4 cycles (12 weeks). Post-platinum chemotherapy: Durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance c therapy every 4 weeks. A fifth dose of IMJUDO 75 mg d,e should be given at week 16 alongside durvalumab dose 6. | Up to a maximum of 5 doses. Patients may receive less than five doses of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy if there is disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. |

a  For IMJUDO, HCC patients with a body weight of 40 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to IMJUDO 4 mg/kg until weight is greater than 40 kg. For durvalumab, patients with a body weight of 30 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to durvalumab 20 mg/kg until weight is greater than 30 kg.

b  For IMJUDO, metastatic NSCLC patients with a body weight of 34 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to 1 mg/kg of IMJUDO until the weight improves to greater than 34 kg. For durvalumab, patients with a body weight of 30 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to durvalumab 20 mg/kg until the weight improves to greater than 30 kg.

c  Consider maintenance administration of pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous tumours who received treatment with pemetrexed and carboplatin/cisplatin during the platinum-based chemotherapy stage.

d  In the case of dose delay(s), a fifth dose of IMJUDO can be given after Week 16, alongside durvalumab.

e  If patients receive fewer than 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, the remaining cycles of IMJUDO (up to a total of 5) alongside durvalumab should be given during the post-platinum chemotherapy phase.

Dose escalation or reduction is not recommended during treatment with IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab. Treatment withholding or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.

Guidelines for management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are described in Table 2 (refer to section 4.4 for further management recommendations, monitoring, and evaluation information). Refer also to the SmPC for durvalumab.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.2). Data on patients aged 75 years or older with metastatic NSCLC are limited (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment of IMJUDO is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment of IMJUDO is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. IMJUDO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of IMJUDO in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not been established with regard to HCC and NSCLC. No data are available. Outside its authorised indications,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab has been studied in children aged 1 to 17 years with neuroblastoma, solid tumour and sarcoma, however the results of the study did not allow to conclude that the benefits of such use outweigh the risks. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2.

## Method of administration

IMJUDO is for intravenous use, it is administered as an intravenous infusion after dilution, over 1 hour (see section 6.6).

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab

For advanced or uHCC, when IMJUDO is given in combination with durvalumab, administer IMJUDO as a separate intravenous infusion prior to durvalumab on the same day. Refer to the SmPC for durvalumab administration information.

## IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy

For NSCLC, when IMJUDO is given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, IMJUDO is given first, followed by durvalumab and then platinum-based chemotherapy on the day of dosing.

When IMJUDO is given as a fifth dose in combination with durvalumab and pemetrexed maintenance therapy at week 16, IMJUDO is given first, followed by durvalumab and then pemetrexed maintenance therapy on the day of dosing.

IMJUDO, durvalumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as separate intravenous infusions. IMJUDO and durvalumab are each given over 1 hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. For pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. Separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion should be used.

During cycle 1, IMJUDO is to be followed by durvalumab starting approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the IMJUDO infusion. Platinum-based chemotherapy infusion should start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the durvalumab infusion. If there are no clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the physician's discretion, subsequent cycles of durvalumab can be given immediately after IMJUDO and the time period between the end of the durvalumab infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Refer to section 4.2, Table 2 for recommended treatment modifications. For suspected immunemediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude alternate aetiologies. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is worsening or no improvement.

Severe infusion-related reactions have been reported in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab (see section 4.8). Infusion-related reactions should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. For Grade 1 or 2 severity, may consider pre-medications for prophylaxis of subsequent infusion reactions. For Grade 3 or 4, manage severe infusion-related reactions per insititutional standard, appropriate clinical practice guidelines and/or society guidelines.

## Disease-specific precaution

## Metastatic NSCLC

Limited data are available in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended.

## Patients excluded from clinical studies

## Advanced or unresectable HCC

Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: Child-Pugh Score B or C, main portal vein thrombosis, liver transplant, uncontrolled hypertension, history of, or current brain metastases, spinal cord compression, co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C, active or prior documented gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 months, ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months, hepatic encephalopathy within 12 months before the start of treatment, active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. In the absence of data, tremelimumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.

## Metastatic NSCLC

Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of tremelimumab or durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent); uncontrolled intercurrent illness; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of tremelimumab or durvalumab. In the absence of data, tremelimumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting tremelimumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).

No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with tremelimumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of tremelimumab.

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of tremelimumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, and placental transfer of human IgG2, tremelimumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). IMJUDO is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

## Breast-feeding

There is no information regarding the presence of tremelimumab in human milk, the absorption and effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG2 is known to be excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with IMJUDO and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

## Fertility

There are no data on the potential effects of tremelimumab on fertility in humans or animals. However, mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see Section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these findings for fertility is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Tremelimumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Tremelimumab is associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of tremelimumab. The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions are based on 2280 patients from nine studies across multiple tumour types who received tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks or 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This combined safety dataset excludes the POSEIDON Study (and patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy). Details for the significant adverse reactions for tremelimumab when given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison to tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab.

## Immune checkpoint inhibitor class effects

There have been cases of the following adverse reactions reported during treatment with other immune checkpoint inhibitors which might also occur during treatment with tremelimumab: pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 2075 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg or 1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Two-hundred fifty-two patients (12.1%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 10.0% (208/2075) patients. The presence of ADAs did not impact tremelimumab pharmacokinetics, and there was no apparent effect on safety.

In the HIMALAYA study, of the 182 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 300 mg as a single dose in combination with durvalumab and evaluable for the presence of ADAs against tremelimumab, 20 (11.0%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 4.4% (8/182) patients. The presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the POSEIDON study, of the 278 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy and evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 38 (13.7%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 11.2% (31/278) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety.

## Elderly

Data from HCC patients 75 years of age or older are limited.

In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of age or older are limited to a total of 74 patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuation of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 years of age or older treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older who received platinum-based chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no information on overdose with tremelimumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates. ATC code: L01FX20

## Mechanism of action

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) is primarily expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, limits effector T-cell activation, through a number of potential mechanisms, but primarily by limiting co-stimulatory signalling through CD28.

Tremelimumab is a selective, fully human IgG2 antibody that blocks CTLA-4 interaction with CD80 and CD86, thus enhancing T-cell activation and proliferation, resulting in increased T-cell diversity and enhanced anti-tumour activity.

The combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor and durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor results in improved anti-tumour responses in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The efficacy of IMJUDO 300 mg as a single dose in combination with durvalumab was evaluated in the HIMALAYA Study, a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in patients with confirmed uHCC who did not receive prior systemic treatment for HCC. The study included patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C or B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) and Child-Pugh Score Class A.

The study excluded patients with brain metastases or a history of brain metastases, co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C; active or prior documented gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 months; ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months; hepatic encephalopathy within 12 months before the start of treatment; active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.

Patients with esophageal varices were included except those with active or prior documented GI bleeding within 12 months prior to study entry.

Randomisation was stratified by macrovascular invasion (MVI) (yes vs. no), aetiology of liver disease (confirmed hepatitis B virus vs. confirmed hepatitis C virus vs. others) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1). The HIMALAYA study randomised 1171 patients 1:1:1 to receive:

- Durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks
- IMJUDO 300 mg as a single dose + durvalumab 1500 mg ; followed by durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks
- Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily

Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival assessments were conducted every month for the first 3 months following treatment discontinuation and then every 2 months.

The primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS) for the comparison of IMJUDO 300 mg as a single dose in combination with durvalumab vs. sorafenib. Secondary endpoints included Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Investigator-assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DoR) according to RECIST v1.1.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. The baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (83.7%), age &lt; 65 years (50.4%), White (44.6%), Asian (50.7%), Black or African American (1.7%), Other race (2.3%), ECOG PS 0 (62.6%); Child-Pugh Class score A (99.5%), macrovascular invasion (25.2%), extrahepatic spread (53.4%), baseline AFP &lt; 400 ng/ml (63.7%), baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml (34.5%), viral aetiology; hepatitis B (30.6%), hepatitis C (27.2%), uninfected (42.2%), evaluable PD-L1 data (86.3%), PD-L1 Tumour area positivity (TAP) ≥ 1% (38.9%), PD-L1 TAP &lt; 1% (48.3%) [Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay].

Results are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1.

## NSCLC - POSEIDON study

POSEIDON was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab with or without IMJUDO in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. POSEIDON was a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in 1013 metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC were eligible for enrolment. Patients had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 status confirmed by using the Ventana PD-L1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(SP263) assay. Patients had a World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment.

The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of IMJUDO or durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMJUDO and/or durvalumab (see section 4.4).

Randomisation was stratified by tumour cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% vs. TC &lt; 50%), disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB, per the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer), and histology (non-squamous vs. squamous).

Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:

- Arm 1: IMJUDO 75 mg with durvalumab 1500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy. A fifth dose of IMJUDO 75 mg was given at Week 16 alongside durvalumab dose 6.
- Arm 2: Durvalumab 1500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy.
- Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients could receive 2 additional cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomisation), as clinically indicated, at investigator's discretion.

Patients received one of the following platinum-based chemotherapy regimens:

- Non-squamous NSCLC
- Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. Unless contraindicated by the investigator, pemetrexed maintenance could be given.
- Squamous NSCLC
- Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m 2  on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.
- Non-squamous or squamous NSCLC
- Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2  on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.

IMJUDO was given up to a maximum of 5 doses unless there was disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Durvalumab and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance therapy (when applicable) was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.

The dual primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 2) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). The key secondary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for IMJUDO + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) and platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). PFS, ORR, and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between study arms. Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (76.0%), age ≥ 65 years (47.1%), age ≥ 75 years (11.3%) median age 64 years (range: 27 to 87 years), White (55.9%), Asian (34.6%), Black or African American (2.0%), other (7.6%), non-Hispanic or Latino (84.2%), current smoker or past-smoker (78.0%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (33.4%) and WHO/ECOG PS 1 (66.5%). Disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

characteristics were as follows: Stage IVA (50.0%), Stage IVB (49.6%), histological sub-groups of squamous (36.9%), non-squamous (62.9%), brain metastases (10.5%), PD-L1 expression TC ≥ 50% (28.8%) and PD-L1 expression TC &lt; 50% (71.1%).

The study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with IMJUDO + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 3). IMJUDO + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The results are summarised below.

Hazard Ratio (95% CI)

## Elderly population

A total of 75 patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in the IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (n=35) and platinum-based chemotherapy only (n=40) arms of the POSEIDON study. An exploratory HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was observed for IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy within this study subgroup. Due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn, but caution is suggested when considering this regimen for elderly patients.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not been established. Study D419EC00001 was a multi centre, open-label dose finding and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab followed by durvalumab monotherapy in paediatric patients with advanced malignant solid tumours (except primary central nervous system tumours) who had disease progression and for whom no standard of care treatment exists. The study enrolled 50 paediatric patients with an age range from 1 to 17 years with primary tumour categories: neuroblastoma, solid tumour and sarcoma. Patients received IMJUDO 1 mg/kg either in combination with durvalumab 20 mg/kg or durvalumab 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab as monotherapy every 4 weeks. In the dose finding phase, IMJUDO and durvalumab combination therapy was preceded by a single cycle of durvalumab; 8 patients in this phase however discontinued treatment prior to receiving IMJUDO. Thus, of the 50 patients enrolled in the study, 42 received IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and 8 received durvalumab only. In the doseexpansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set. No new safety signals were observed relative to the known safety profiles of IMJUDO and durvalumab in adults. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed for tremelimumab as monotherapy,in combination with durvalumab and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PK of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 750 mg or 10 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy, or at a single dose of 300 mg. PK exposure increased dose proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady state was achieved at approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included patients (n = 1605) who received tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with other medicinal products in the dose range of ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the estimated tremelimumab clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) were 0.309 l/day and 6.33 l, respectively. The terminal half-life was approximately 14.2 days. The primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.

## Special populations

Age (18-87 years), body weight (34-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab.

## Renal impairment

Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown; the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to influence tremelimumab exposure.

## Hepatic impairment

Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN or bilirubin &gt; 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) and moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown; the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is not expected to influence tremelimumab exposure.

## Paediatric population

The PK of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab was evaluated in a study of 50 paediatric patients with an age range from 1 to 17 years in study D419EC00001. Patients received tremelimumab 1 mg/kg either in combination with durvalumab 20 mg/kg or in combination with durvalumab 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab as monotherapy every 4 weeks. Based on population PK analysis, tremelimumab systemic exposure in paediatric patients ≥ 35kg receiving tremelimumab 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks was similar to exposure in adults receiving 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks, whereas in paediatric patients &lt; 35kg, exposure was lower relative to adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Animal toxicology

In the chronic 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with tremelimumab was associated with dose-related incidence in persistent diarrhoea and skin rash, scabs and open sores, which were dose-limiting. These clinical signs were also associated with decreased appetite and body weight and swollen peripheral lymph nodes. Histopathological findings correlating with the observed clinical signs included reversible chronic inflammation in the cecum and colon, mononuclear cell infiltration in the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of mononuclear cell infiltration with or without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the salivary gland, pancreas (acinar), thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, heart, esophagus, tongue, periportal liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular muscles), and choroid plexus of the brain. No NOAEL was found in this study with animals treated with the lowest dose of 5 mg/kg/week, however the intermediate dose of 15 mg/kg week was considered the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD). This dose provided an exposure-based safety margin of 1.77-5.33 to clinical relevant exposure based on the clinical dosing regimen of either a 300 mg single dose or 75 mg every three weeks.

## Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity

The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of tremelimumab has not been evaluated.

## Reproductive toxicology

Mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat dose toxicity studies. Since animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab, the relevance of these findings for fertility is unknown. In reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or effects on pregnancy losses, foetal weights, or external, visceral, skeletal abnormalities or weights of selected foetal organs.

## 1. What IMJUDO is and what it is used for

IMJUDO is an anti-cancer medicine. It contains the active substance tremelimumab, which is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody. This medicine is designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. IMJUDO works by helping your immune system fight your cancer.

IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab is used to treat a type of liver cancer, called advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is used when your HCC:

- cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and
- may have spread within your liver or to other parts of the body.

IMJUDO is used to treat a type of lung cancer called advanced non-small cell lung cancer in adults. It will be used in combination with other anti-cancer medicines (durvalumab and chemotherapy).

As IMJUDO will be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines, it is important that you also read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, ask your doctor.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given IMJUDO

## You should not be given IMJUDO

if you are allergic to tremelimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Talk to your doctor if you are not sure.

## Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor before you are given IMJUDO if:

- you have an autoimmune disease (an illness where the body's immune system attacks its own cells)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have had an organ transplant
- you have lung or breathing problems
- you have liver problems.

Talk to your doctor before you are given IMJUDO if any of these could apply to you.

When you are given IMJUDO, you can have some serious side effects .

Your doctor may give you other medicines that prevent more severe complications and to help reduce your symptoms. Your doctor may delay the next dose of IMJUDO or stop your treatment with IMJUDO. Talk to your doctor straight away if you get any of the following side effects:

- new or worsening cough; shortness of breath; chest pain (may be signs of lung inflammation)
- feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting; feeling less hungry; pain on the right side of your stomach; yellowing of skin or whites of eyes; drowsiness; dark urine or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal may be signs of liver inflammation)

## ANNEX IV

## SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tremelimumab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on polymyalgia rheumatica, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and polymyalgia rheumatica is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing tremelimumab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tremelimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tremelimumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
