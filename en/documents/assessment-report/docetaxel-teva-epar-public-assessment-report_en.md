## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Docetaxel Teva concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion is a generic medicinal product containing the active substance docetaxel. The reference medicinal product is Taxotere concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion authorised 27 November 1995.

Docetaxel  in  an  antineoplastic  agent  that  acts  by  promoting  the  assembly  of  tubulin  into  stable microtubulues  and  inhibits  their  assembly,  which  leads  to  a  decrease  of  free  tubulin  and  to  cancer death.

## Gastric adenocarcinoma

The safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  breast  cancer,  non-small  cell  lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma and head and neck cancer has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR for the reference medicinal product. In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing  experience  contributing  to  the  knowledge  of  the clinical use of this active substance. The indication for Docetaxel Teva is identical to that approved for Taxotere and is as follows: Breast cancer  Docetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node- positive breast cancer.  Docetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  not  previously  received  cytotoxic therapy for this condition.  Docetaxel Teva monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent.  Docetaxel  Teva  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  Docetaxel  Teva  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included an anthracycline. Non-small cell lung cancer  Docetaxel Teva is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.  Docetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for this condition. Prostate cancer  Docetaxel Teva in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Docetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Docetaxel 40 mg/ml, concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous yellow to yellow-brown solution.  It  is  supplied  with  an  additional  vial  of  solvent  (13%  ethanol  in  water  for  injection).  The solvent  is  used  to  premix  the  concentrate  in  order  to  obtain  a  sterile,  preservative-free  solution intended for dilution with 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride prior to intravenous infusion.

The excipients used in the formulation are polysorbate 80, ethanol and citric acid.

The formulation of this product is qualitatively similar to the reference product Taxotere. There are only minor quantitative differences in the amount of citric acid.

Active Substance Docetaxel is an efficient inhibitor of eukaryotic cell replication, blocking cells in the late G2-M phase of the cell cycle. It promotes abnormal assembly of microtubules via stabilization. Docetaxel is manufactured by two different manufacturers. The Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure was followed for the active substance for both manufacturers. It  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder,  synthesised  in  the  anhydrous  form.  At  25ºC  docetaxel  is  freely soluble in ethanol and tetrahydrofuran; sparingly soluble in acetonitrile; soluble in methanol, acetone and ethyl acetate; insoluble in n-hexane and water. Its partition coefficient (log P) is 4.26. Docetaxel is manufactured from N-Deboc Docetaxel, which is obtained from 10- deacetyl baccatin III, a natural product extracted from yew tree. The stereogenic centres naturally occurring in 10-DAB III are kept through the synthetic processes. Docetaxel is chemically designated as N-Debenzoyl-N-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)-10-deacetyltaxol, the molecular formula is C43H53NO14 and its molecular weight is 807.88.

##  Manufacture

Docetaxel is manufactured in 5 steps but only one step involves chemical reactions, all other steps involve  crystallisation  and  purification  of  the  active  substance.  The  route  of  synthesis  was  briefly

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

described  in  the  open  part  but  the  details  were  provided  in  the  restricted  part  of  the  ASMF.  The process was acceptably described for both manufacturing sites.

The chemical structure was determined by XRD, IR, 1 H-NMR,  13 C-NMR, DSC and TGA and is well established. Structural studies to demonstrate the evidence of the chemical structure of docetaxel and to  evaluate  polymorphism,  potential  isomerism  and  solvated  forms  were  performed.  XRD  results confirm that the same crystalline form is consistently obtained in the manufacturing process

Discussion about impurities and residual solvents has been presented. Impurities are well controlled in the active substance and limits are in line with ICH Q3Aand ICH Q3C guidelines.

##  Specification

Specification  is  in  agreement  with  the  new  monograph  for  docetaxel  trihydrate, with  relevant modifications regarding the anhydrous state . The specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identification (IR, HPLC), assay, purity  and  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  acetic  acid  (HPLC),  water  content  (Karl  Fisher), residue on ignition, heavy metals, specific rotation, residual solvents (GC) and microbial purity. The analytical methods are essentially the same in both manufacturing sites and are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The methods have been well described and validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). All batches reported for both manufacturing sites comply with the specification.  Stability Docetaxel is stored in a glass flask as primary container under nitrogen atmosphere, inside a double polyethylene  bag  sealed  individually  with  an  appropriate  tie,  inside  an  aluminium  bag.  Stability studies have shown that these materials provide adequate protection for the active substance. Stability data were performed on 6 batches stored at 40 ± 2 o C / 75 ± 5 % RH (accelerated conditions) for  6  months and 9 batches stored at 25 ±2 o C  /  60  ±  5  %  RH  (long  term  conditions) for up to 36 months. Photostability studies have not been performed since it has been established that docetaxel is unstable when exposed to UV light in solution and in solid form. The parameters tested included appearance, assay, purity and water content. The results provided did not show significant degradation and the batch data are in compliance with the proposed specification. An agreed re-test period has been established. Medicinal Product Medicinal product no longer authorised

Docetaxel Teva 40 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous yellow to yellowbrown solution available in 0.5 ml and 2 ml single use vials. It is supplied with an additional vial of solvent (13% ethanol in water for injection). The solvent is a clear colourless solution, available in vials containing 1.5 ml and 6 ml of the solvent solution. The solvent is used to premix the concentrate in order to obtain a sterile, preservative-free solution intended for dilution with 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride solution prior to intravenous infusion.

The container closure system for both the concentrate and the solvent consists of clear glass Type I vials closed with a bromobutyl stopper capped with aluminium seal with a propylene cover.

##  Pharmaceutical development

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  formulation  of  Docetaxel  is  qualitatively  similar  to  that  of  the  reference  product  Taxotere  40 mg/ml concentrate, manufactured by the innovator company Sanofi Aventis. The excipients used in the formulation are polysorbate 80 and citric acid.  Polysorbate 80 is used as a solubiliser and citric acid as an acidifying agent. The active substance is insoluble in water and solubilisation is achieved by adding a surfactant to the formulation. Polysorbate 80 forms drug micelles and precipitation of the drug in aqueous solution does not occur. Citric acid is used in the formulation for chemical stability of the  active  substance.    All  the  excipients  comply  with  their  respective  European  Pharmacepoeia monograph. Satisfactory certificates of analysis have been provided for all excipients.

It was considered that small differences in citric acid content between generic and reference product would be unlikely to have any significant effect on micelle characterisation or disposition of docetaxel in vivo .

The  specifications  for  Docetaxel  40  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  include  tests  for: appearance (visual examination) identification (U-HPLC retention time and UV absorption), assay of docetaxel (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), colour of solution, particulate contamination (visible particles), clarity, closure integrity, extractable volume, particulate contamination (subvisible particles),  pH,  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The  analytical  methods  for  assay  of  docetaxel  and related substances were well described and validated. All other methods are described in the PhEur and therefore validation was deemed to be unnecessary.

Although the composition of Docetaxel Teva and Taxotere differ only in the amount of citric acid present, but considering the micellar nature of the product, it was important to characterise the micelle solution and compare it to the reference product prior to administration, i.e., in the infusion bag. The characterisation of the micelle solution included the determination of the pH, micelle size and micelle size  distribution.  The  results  of  the  studies  showed  the  similarity  of  both  products  with  regards  to micellar characteristics. Considering these comparable in vitro results and the similarity of this generic formulation to the formulation of the reference product, it was considered that taken together, these findings could be used to support a biowaiver for this 'complex' injectable.  Adventitious Agents None of the excipients used in the formulation of docetaxel concentrate for solution for infusion are of animal origin.  Manufacture The manufacturing process for Docetaxel Teva comprises four main steps (using a non-standard process): preparation of the bulk solution, sterile filtration (0.2  m), aseptic filling, followed by closing the vials and packaging. Prior to preparation of the bulk solution polysorbate 80 is purified. Batch analysis data on three production scale batches confirmed that the defined process reliably produces product which meets the proposed release specification. The solvent for docetaxel 40 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is manufactured using a standard process comprising sterile filtration and final sterilization. The process is well defined and controlled. Validation data was provided on two production scale batches.  Product Specification Medicinal product no longer authorised

Batch  results  were  provided  for  four  batches  of  the  finished  product.  The  results  were  to  be  in compliance with the proposed specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Stability of the Product

Two  bulk  solutions  of  docetaxel  40  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  have  been manufactured at the commercial site using the commercial process at production scale and filled in two batches of 0.5 ml and two batches of 2.0 ml presentation,. These four batches have been stored at 5ºC  3ºC  (long  term  conditions)  for  up  to  12  months  and  at  25ºC  2ºC/60%  5%  RH  (accelerated conditions)  for  6  months.  The  results  of  all  studies  complied  with  the  product  specification  in  all batches and no changes were observed. Additional in-use stability data of the product diluted with 5% glucose and 0.9% sodium chloride were also provided. The in-use stability data demonstrated that the product ready to use is physically and chemically stable in the in-use conditions defined in the SPC. This was further supported by the studies performed on the characterisation of the micellar solutions.

In summary, the stability results support the shelflife and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects The active substance and finished product have been adequately described. The finished product is manufactured using a non-standard process. Sufficient validation data has been provided to assure that the process is robust and well controlled and produces a uniform product. The medicinal product consists of a micellar solution, i.e., the active substance is solubilised in surfactant micelles. The differences between the generic and the reference product in terms of formulation, including amount of citric acid have been shown not to affect the relevant physico-chemical properties of the product with particular regard to the characteristics of the micellar phase. Therefore, similarity between Docetaxel Teva and the reference product Taxotere can be accepted and no additional human bioequivalence study was considered necessary in this particular case. 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects The Applicant has submitted 72 publications up to 2008. No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided. Pharmacology Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that belongs to the taxoid class and promotes formation of stable microtubules that are resistant to disassembly. Microtubules are components of eukaryotic cells that play a relevant role in chromosome movement during mitosis, regulation of cell morphology, hormone secretion, transport of granules, anchorage of receptors in the membrane and cellular motility. Cells exposed  to  taxoids  accumulate  dysfunctional  microtubules  that  can  not  undergo  the  normal  mitotic process  and  results  in  cell  death.  Docetaxel  enhances  both,  the  rate  and  the  extent  of  microtubule assembly, inhibiting depolymerization. Docetaxel  acts  at  the  level  of  tubulin.  Tubulin  is  the  main  component  of  microtubules.  In  normal conditions, there is equilibrium between tubuline and microtubules. In vitro studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Docetaxel is an inhibitor of cell replication in vitro and it has been found to be cytotoxic against both murine and human cell lines. These cytotoxic effects are greater on proliferating rather than quiescent cells.  About  thirteen  human  cell  lines  from  various  tumour  types  have  been  exposed  to  increasing concentrations of docetaxel over 24 h, resulting in a plateau-shaped dose response curve. Increased cell death is therefore more dependent on exposure duration than on concentration. In several human ovarian carcinoma cell lines including lines resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, docetaxel was 1000 times more cytotoxic than cisplatin and etoposide; and 100 times more than doxorubicin.

## In vivo studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel activity has been studied in different tumour models including murine (Table 1) and human (Table 2) xenografts in nude mice.

The mean optimal dose of docetaxel that produced body weight loss and no delayed toxicity was 80 mg/kg.  Docetaxel  has  been  found  to  be  active  by  i.p.  and  i.v.  routes  but  inactive  by  oral  route. Different  schedules  of  administration  have  been  tested  and  it  was  concluded  that  docetaxel  was schedule-independent for the maximal tolerated dose. In addition dose-response relationship has been shown. Mechanism of resistance The main mechanism of resistance to taxoids is due to overexpression of the cell surface drug transporter glycoprotein GP170 encoded by the multidrug resistance gene (MDR). Docetaxel has been found to be active on some but not all cell lines overexpressing the p-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug resistant gene. Pharmacokinetics Non-clinical pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been investigated in mice, rats and dogs. A study in mice receiving i.v  bolus  doses  of  13-62  mg/kg  showed  a  biphasic  plasma  concentration-time  curve with a short distribution half-life of 7 minutes and an apparent elimination half-life of 1h. The total body  clearance  was  1.6  l/h/kg  and  plasma  AUC  was  17  µgh/ml.  Similar  data  were  obtained  when doses of 2.5, 10 and 33 mg/kg were administered i.v. to female FVB mice. Exposure of docetaxel in the tumours was very high (AUC range from 17 to 71 µgh/g) due to a  slow tumour elimination halflife, more than 20 h, compared with a plasma elimination half-life of 1.1 to 2-4 h in other tissues such as liver, kidney, spleen or muscle. Half-life in rats was comparable to mice (1.5 l/kg). In beagle dogs, a larger volume of distribution (9 l/kg) was seen. Distribution  studies  with  radiolabelled  docetaxel  have  showed  that  is  rapidly  distributed  in  tissue, especially into liver, bile, intestine and gastric contents. It was also distributed to spleen, myocardium, bone marrow, pancreas and salivary gland. It was detected as well in foetal tissue and milk. Low levels of  docetaxel  were  detected  in  brain;  however  penetration  can  be  increased  by  inhibition  of  pglycoprotein. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In vitro binding to plasma proteins has been found high in mouse (89-95%), rat (70-76%), dog (8389%) and human (90%). In human plasma was mainly bound to albumin and α 1-acid glycoprotein . In vivo plasma protein binding was also high.

Several studies have shown that hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion are the major elimination pathway of docetaxel in all species. Only a minor fraction of the dose was excreted in the form of uncharged parent drug. Studies in rat  and  human liver  microsomes  have  indicated  that  the  CYP3A subfamily is the main responsible for docetaxel biotransformation. Further studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 were the most active for the oxidation of docetaxel to the primary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolite RPR104952 and for subsequent oxidation of RPR104952 to RPR111059 and RPR 111026. All  four  of  the  principal  metabolites  of  docetaxel  have  greatly  reduced  cytotoxic  activity  against cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo .

Faecal  excretion  has  been  shown  to  account  for  more  than  80%  of  the  dose  and  occurred  mainly during the first two days. Recovery of radioactivity after 7 days was &gt;95% in mice, &gt;85% in rats and &gt;90% in dogs. Urinary excretion was low (&lt;10%).

## Drug Interactions

Docetaxel is a substrate of CYP3A liver enzymes, therefore its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant  administration  of  compounds  which  induce,  inhibit  or  are  metabolised  by  cytochrome P450-3A. In  vitro studies  have  showed  that  ketoconazol,  midazolam,  erythromycin,  testosterone, orphemnadrine  and  troleandomycin,  inhibitors  of  CYP3A,  reduced  docetaxel  metabolism.  No interactions were observed with cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine and vinblastine.

<!-- image -->

Studies in mice have showed that the main toxicity effects were seen on haematopoietic parameters, neurotoxicity (doses &gt; 144 mg/m 2 ) and testicular atrophy (doses &gt; 285 mg/m 2 ).

Further  studies in  vivo have  shown  that  ritonavir  inhibited  docetaxel  metabolism.  Ranitidine  and diphenhydramine, metabolized by CYP3A, did not alter docetaxel metabolism. Synergistic inhibition of  tumour  growth  in  breast  and  colorectal  cancer  has  been  observed  when  docetaxel  was  given  in combination with capecitabine. The combination of sunitinib and docetaxel and the combination of sunitinib, docetaxel and cetuximab showed additive effects. No interaction have been observed when dexamethasone was administered s.c. simultaneously with docetaxel i.v. to mice. Neverthelss, COX-2 inhibitors enhanced the activity of docetaxel in vitro and in vivo in several studies. The  most  toxic  was  the  combination  of  docetaxel  and  cisplatin,  while  the  least  toxic  was  the combination with vinca alkaloids. Toxicology Single-dose toxicity Results for single-dose toxicity studies are summarised in table 3. Table 3. Single dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs (dose in mg/m 2 ). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  rats,  mortality  was  seen  at  doses  &gt;  120  mg/m 2 .  Main  toxic  effects  were  alopecia  and  testicular atrophy (doses &gt; 120 mg/m 2 ) and hematopoietic toxicity (doses &gt; 60 mg/m 2 ). Abnormal mitosis and single cell necrosis was observed 4 days after treatment but disappeared 29 days after. However, in dogs doses of 30 mg/m 2 caused moderate diarrhoea and white blood cell reduction.

In monkeys, single doses of 50 mg/m 2 produced leukopenia and gastrointestinal effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  gastrointestinal  and  hematopoietic  effects  were  reversible,  whereas  testicular  and  neurotoxic effects were partially reversible or irreversible. Overall, these effects are consistent with the toxicities observed with other antimitotic agents.

## Repeated-dose toxicity

-  Five-day repeated dose toxicity

Table 4 summarises the results obtained in 5-day repeated toxicity studies in mice and dogs.

Table 4. Results of 5-day sub-acute studies in mice and dogs (dogs in mg/m 2 )

Docetaxel administered as a daily regimen showed a cumulative toxicity. Docetaxel should therefore preferably be given as an intermittent-dose regimen to allow recovery of haematopoietic effects.  Intermittent-dose toxicity studies Docetaxel was administered at 21 days intervals. Up to 10 (rat and beagle dog) and 12 (cynomolgus monkey) subsequent courses were given. Studies in rats at doses up to 60 mg/m 2 for 3 or 10 treatment courses, showed hematopoietic toxicity, thymic and testicular atrophy.  Studies in dogs at doses up to 30 mg/m 2 for 5 or 10 treatment courses, showed  hematopoietic  and  gastrointestinal  toxicity  and  dermal  effects  (similar  as  the  observed  at single-dose and repeated dose studies). Studies were performed in monkeys at doses of 25 mg/m 2 and 50 mg/m 2 ,  however the highest dose was  discontinued  due  to  the  severity  of  the  toxicity.  Toxic  effects  found  at  25  mg/m 2 after  12 treatment courses were: moderate neutropenia/ lymphopenia, mild reduction in RBC parameters and moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. In all species haematological parameters recovered during day 21 of the period in between treatment courses.  In  addition,  no  increase  of  severity  or  incidence  of  adverse  effects  was  seen  with  the progression of the study. Local tolerance and sensitization Tolerance  studies  in  rabbits  at  doses  3  times  higher  than  administered  to  humans,  including  i.v., intradermal  or  intra-arterial  routes,  have  shown  good  tolerance.  External  and  histopathological evaluation of injection sites in toxicity studies revealed no signs of irritation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In mice, guinea pigs and rabbits there was no evidence of sensitisation. However, a mild reaction was seen following intradermal re-challenge of docetaxel in pre-treated rabbits.

## Genotoxicity

Docetaxel has been evaluated for potential genetic toxicity in a battery of standard tests in vitro and in vivo .  Results  of  genotoxicity  have  indicated  that  docetaxel  is  neither  mutagenic  nor  clastogenic, however it increased the incidence of micronucleated, aneuploid and polyploidy cells in vitro and in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vivo .  This effect is consistent with the pharmacological activity of the drug on microtubules and has been reported for other antineoplastic drugs.

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted.

## Reproductive toxicity

Fertility  studies  in  male  and  female  rats  have  shown  that  docetaxel  produced  maternal and paternal toxicity with a reduction in fertility parameters. It was considered to be embryotoxic at daily doses &gt; 0.9 mg/m 2 .

- Docetaxel  was  also  studied  in  pregnant  rats  and  rabbits  treated  during  the  organogenesis  phase  of gestation.  It  was  shown  that  docetaxel  was  embryotoxic  and  foetotoxic,  however  it  was  not teratogenic. Studies on impurities The impurities specified in Doctaxel Teva, concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion are:  Two  specified  impurities,  both  present  at  a  concentration  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q3B(R2) requirements and within qualification threshold of 0.2%.  10-Oxodocetaxel for which the accepted qualification limit is 0.4 % at release. The Applicant has provided  a  description  of  toxicological  aspects  and  a  toxicity  prediction  assessment  for  this impurity.  The  influence  of  the  chemical  group  on  the  10-position  of  the  main  ring  structure  of taxanes has been well characterized. Compounds related to taxol or docetaxel and modified on the 10-position  have  been  tested  for  antitumour  activity  by  several  different  research  groups.  All authors of the cited references conclude that the chemical group at the 10-position is not essential for  the  cytotoxicity  of  taxanes.  Branching  of  large  groups  on  the  10-position  results in a loss of activity, but compounds without a functional group or with any polar substituent are as potent as taxol. Although this has mainly been investigated for taxol-derivates, results on 10-deoxytaxotere demonstrated that also for docetaxel the group on the 10-position makes only a small contribution to  the  antitumor  activity.  No  antitumour  activity  has  been  measured  for  the  impurity  10-oxodocetaxel  itself,  neither  has  a  toxicological  study  been  done.  However,  based  on  the  antitumour activity of 10C-derivatives, the pharmacological activity of 10-oxo-docetaxel is considered to be in line with other 10C-derivatives and thus comparable to that of docetaxel itself. No accumulation of 10-oxo-docetaxel will occur in the body, as 10-oxo-docetaxel will be metabolized in the same way as docetaxel itself, which is mainly on the side chain. In addition toxicity prediction assessment was carried out using the DEREK database to assess the potential  toxicology  of  10-oxo-docetaxel.  The  analysis  revealed  three  structural  alerts  including nephropathy in  rodents  and  considered  not  to  be  a  hazard  to  human  health.  Also,  a  potential  to cause  skin  sensitisation  but  of  minor  concern  taking  into  account  the  intravenous  route  of administration and a third structural alert. This third alert refers to chromosome damage in vitro in human cells that is predicted plausible for 10-oxo-docetaxel. In conclusion, the pharmacological/toxicological profile of 10-oxo-docetaxel does not differ from that of the parent compound. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Environmental Risk Assessment

No environmental risk assessment has been submitted.

## Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects

The non-clinical literature review presented by the Applicant provided an adequate overview of the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of docetaxel. There were no major issues raised for the approval of Docetaxel Teva, concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  qualification  limits  set  for  the  impurity  10-Oxodocetaxel  are  higher  than  the  qualification threshold of 0.2% mentioned in the ICH Q3B(R2) for new drug products. However 10-Oxodocetaxel is  not  a  novel  impurity,  being  allowed  up  to  0.3%  in  the  draft  PhEur  specification  for  docetaxel trihydrate drug substance. Since drug product specifications are generally more relaxed than those for drug  substances,  a  release  level  of  0.4%  for  the  10-oxodocetaxel  impurity  in  drug  product  is considered reasonable. Qualification limits on impurities might be exceeded on a case by case basis if properly justified  as  it  has  been  the  case  for  Docetaxel  Teva,  a  semi-synthetic  drug  substance  from plant origin. DEREK and SAR assessments did not reveal any toxicology profile different from the parent compound. In addition, taking into account that docetaxel is intended to treat advanced stage cancer patients and it is not intended as a long-term treatment, additional studies are not warranted since it is not likely to have an impact on the clinical efficacy or safety of the product and its predicted side effects are already covered in the labelling for originator product. Taking into account all these considerations, specification limits of 0.4 at release are acceptable for the impurity 10-Oxodocetaxel.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

The  applicant  has  provided  an  updated  review  of  the  clinical  use  of  docetaxel  for  the  proposed indications with 95 publications from 1993 to 2008.

There were no detailed study reports from clinical trials submitted by the applicant. The application was submitted in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, where the applicant was not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests and of clinical trials as the medicinal product is a generic  of  a  reference  medicinal  product  which  is  authorised  for  6/10  years  in  a  MS  or  in  the Community.

Docetaxel Teva monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent.

Exemption The Applicant has claimed that Docetaxel Teva, concentrate for solution for infusion, is an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the reference product, and therefore, it is subject to the exemption of bioequivalence studies (as per Section 5.1.6 of the guideline 'Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98'). Docetaxel Teva , like the reference product Taxotere, is a micellar solution, and in this regard it may be considered as 'complex'. Therefore data about the main characteristics of the micellar solution (physico-chemical properties, micelle size and size distribution) in the product ready to use as well as comparison data with the micellar solution from Taxotere were submitted (see Quality section). Results of these studies confirmed pharmaceutical comparability of Docetaxel Teva and the reference product Taxotere, thus bioequivalence studies were not required. Clinical studies The application contains adequate clinical data from the review of the publication literature submitted for the proposed indications: Breast cancer Docetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer. Docetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition.

For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at 750 mg/m 2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 administered as a 30-minute to 3 hour infusion, followed by 5fluorouracil 1000 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.

Gastric adenocarcinoma Docetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Head and neck cancer Docetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive breast cancer, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 is given in combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ). In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2 every three weeks, with trastuzumab administered weekly. In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 every three weeks, combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m 2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period. In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen is docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single agent. The recommended dose of docetaxel for prostate cancer patients is 75 mg/m 2 . Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily is administered continuously (see section 5.1). The recommended dose of docetaxel for gastric adenocarcinoma patients is 75 mg/m 2 as a 1 hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 , as a 1 to 3 hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg /m 2 per day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, determined in 23 patients receiving 20-115 mg/m 2 , are linear, with clearance independent of the administered dose and with plasma AUC increasing in proportion to dose.

The pharmacokinetic profile of docetaxel is consistent with a three-compartment model at clinically relevant doses (60-100 mg/m2). Half-lives for the  ,  and  were 4 minutes, 36 minutes and 11.2 hours, respectively after a dose of 100 mg/m 2 after 1 hour infusion. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Following the administration of a 100 mg/m 2 dose given as a one to two hour infusion a mean peak plasma level of 2.41-3.67  g/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.59-5.93  g.h/ml. Mean values for steady-state volume of distribution were 67.3-149 1/m 2 . In vitro studies have demonstrated that docetaxel is extensively bound to albumin and  -acid glycoprotein and that the latter is the main determinant of variability in docetaxel serum binding. In human plasma docetaxel was found to be bound for more than 98%. It is not known whether docetaxel is distributed into breast milk.

Renal excretion of unchanged docetaxel is very low (&lt;5% of the dose). The major pathway of elimination of docetaxel is hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion. Mean values for total body clearance was 21 l/h m 2 . The pharmacokinetic profile of docetaxel is characterized by substantial interpatient variability. In a population pharmacokinetic study of more than 600 patients receiving docetaxel 75-100 mg/m 2 , which used a limited sampling scheme with the last sampling time-point at 24 hours post-infusion, the median clearance was 36 l/h (5 th -95 th percentile: 17-59 l/h), representing approximately 3.5-fold variation in this population. In a more recent study in which patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and an extended sampling scheme to 8 days post infusion was utilized, approximately 10-fold variation in drug clearance was observed when patients with outlier values were not excluded from the analysis.

Docetaxel is primary metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme to one major and three minor largely inactive metabolites (RPR104952 (hydroxydocetaxel) and for subsequent oxidation of RPR104952 to RPR111059 and RPR111026). The major pathway of elimination of docetaxel is hepatic metabolism. Docetaxel metabolites are produced by successive oxidation (to alcohol, aldehyde and then acid) of the tert-buty ester group on the side-chain. Based on catalytic potential, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the most important enzymes among the four members of the CYP3A subfamily (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP3A43) involved in docetaxel metabolism and elimination. The metabolites demonstrate substantially reduced cytotoxic activity compared with the parent drug, making biotransformation by CYP3A a major route of inactivation. A few small studies demonstrated that variation in CYP3A activity, as assessed by different probe drugs, is a determinant of docetaxel clearance. However, so far the clinical usefulness of individualized dose based on CYP3A activity has not been demonstrated by reducing inter-individual variability in docetaxel pharmacokinetics, toxicities or activity. Because of the important role of CYP3A in the metabolism of docetaxel, pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that influence the activity of these enzymes or that are metabolized by the enzymes are to be expected. The major metabolites of docetaxel and &lt; 10% of the parent drug are excreted primarily in the faeces via the biliary tract, with only a small proportion (&lt;10%) excreted unchanged in the urine. In a study in three patients with cancer, faecal and urinary excretion accounted for ~75% and 6% of a radiolabelled dose of docetaxel within 7 days. The majority of the dose recovered in the faeces was excreted in the first 48 hours (~ 80% as metabolites and &lt;8% as unchanged drug). In addition to CYP3A-mediated elimination, docetaxel is also a substrate for the efflux membrane-localised transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the gene ABCB1. ABCB1mediated intestinal secretion has been demonstrated to contribute significantly to faecal elimination of taxane drugs both in mice lacking ABCB1 and in humans.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  PSUR

The PSUR submission schedule for Docetaxel Teva should follow the PSUR submission scheduled for the reference medicinal product, Taxotere.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information.

 Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system, version 6 dated 21 Nov 2008, as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.  Risk Management Plan No description of the Risk Management Plan has to be provided by the Applicant. Discussion on Clinical aspects Docetaxel Teva meets the requirement on safety and efficacy required for a marketing authorisation application under Article 10 (1) 'generic' and a biowaiver for not submitting bioequivalence studies has been granted. Therefore no further clinical data was required. The current knowledge concerning the safety and efficacy of docetaxel has been evaluated by means of an updated literature search. An RMP was considered not required as the application concerns a medicinal product containing a known active substance for which no additional safety concerns requiring specific risk minimisation activities have been identified with respect to the reference medicinal product. The active substance has been in use for many years and the safety profile of the products is well established. It was considered that routine pharmacovigilance according to the Detailed Description of Pharmacovigilance System was sufficient for safety monitoring. 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data.  A  benefit/Risk  ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Docetaxel Teva in the treatment of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric  adenocarcinoma,  head  and  neck  cancer  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the marketing authorisation.
