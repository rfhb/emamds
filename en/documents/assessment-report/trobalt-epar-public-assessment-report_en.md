## Scientific Advice

The Applicant has received a CHMP Scientific Advice in 2005. The main issues pertaining to efficacy and safety concerned the duration of the treatment maintenance phase. Moreover, it was recommended that the induction potential should be investigated. The sufficient number of subjects and patients with epilepsy was also an issue, and finally, assessment of the cardiovascular safety was an important topic.

The preclinical advice related to the preclinical program in general and the investigation of the toxicity (including cardiovascular toxicity) of the N-acetyl metabolite of RTG (NAMR) in dogs in particular.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Epilepsy  is  a  common  neurological  disorder,  with  a  worldwide  estimated  prevalence  of  0.7%  of  the population  (50  million  people).    It  is  characterized  by  excessive  electrical  discharges  in  the  brain leading to seizures.  For epidemiological purposes, the definition requires more than one unprovoked seizure of any type.

Patients with epilepsy have an increased mortality risk compared to the general population. Overall, this risk is due primarily to the aetiology of epilepsy.  However, in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, the greatest seizure related risk of mortality is due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Patients  who  participate  in  clinical  trials  of  investigational  antiepileptic  drugs  (AEDs)  generally  have had epilepsy for more than 10 years, have failed multiple AED therapies, and are considered unlikely to become seizure free with currently available AED therapy.

The  therapeutic  strategy  in  treating  epilepsy  involves  reducing  neuronal  excitability  through  various mechanisms.  Most  current  therapies  work  via  blocking  sodium  gated  neuronal  channels  or  via potentiating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated transmission. Medicines with novel mechanisms  of  action  are  needed  to  try  to  address  the  unmet  clinical  need  for  seizure  control  in patients  with  treatment-resistant  epilepsy.    Current  agents  have  minimal  to  no  effects  on  neuronal potassium gated channels, in spite of the fact that these channels have a major role in the control of neuronal excitability.  Retigabine facilitates the opening of neuronal potassium channels and hence is a novel agent which offers an additional treatment option for seizure control.

According to the current International Classification of Epileptic Seizures [ILAE on Classification, 1981], the classification of epileptic seizures depends upon the age of onset and clinical symptoms and signs. Both aetiology (idiopathic, symptomatic and cryptogenic) and localization (partial vs. generalized) are considered crucial prerequisites for an adequate evaluation and treatment of epileptic disorders.  For partial seizures, there is a focal epileptic zone (site of seizure onset), and seizure activity is initially limited  to  one  hemisphere.  Partial  seizures  can  be  further  sub-divided  into  simple  partial  (without impairment of consciousness), complex partial (with impairment of consciousness with or following a simple partial onset) and secondarily generalized (i.e. partial seizures, either simple or complex, which evolve to generalized tonic-clonic seizures). Simple partial seizures, depending on the anatomical site of  origin  of  the  seizure,  may  have  motor,  somatosensory  or  special  sensory,  autonomic  or  psychic signs or symptoms. Generalized seizure disorders do not have a focus and are classified as absence, myoclonic,  tonic,  clonic,  tonic  clonic  or  atonic  seizures.    Partial  seizures  (simple,  complex  and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic) account for the majority (60 to 70%) of seizures in adults with epilepsy. The  treatment  of  an  individual  patient  with  partial  seizures  is  focused  on  reduction  of  seizure frequency, with seizure freedom as the ultimate goal. Usually, treatment consists of daily anticonvulsant  medication.  Antiepileptic  drugs  exert  their  therapeutic  effect  in  the  central  nervous system (CNS), and generally have similar CNS side effects, i.e. sedation, somnolence, lethargy and ataxia. Variable efficacy and individual differences in tolerability require a treatment regimen that is adjusted  to  the  individual  patient.    Over  the  past  decade,  several  new  antiepileptic  drugs  were developed and marketed to expand the therapeutic spectrum and to improve the risk/benefit profile. Despite this, up to 30% of patients remain refractory to conventional treatment and continue to have uncontrolled  seizures.  Uncontrolled  epilepsy  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  mortality  due  to SUDEP.  In addition, the quality of life in medically refractory patients is poor, as they cannot drive a car,  and  they  have  difficulties  working  or  living  independently.  Additionally,  many  patients  have behavioural, neurological and/or intellectual disturbances, as sequelae of their seizure disorder. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Retigabine  has  been  developed  and  studied  to  demonstrate  efficacy  and  safety  in  the  treatment  of partial onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures in a population of patients who have failed to adequately respond to currently available AEDs.

The claimed and approved indication is 'adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults aged 18 years and above with epilepsy'. The dosing starts on 300 mg daily with increasing doses optimized to an effective dose between 600 to 1200 mg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This is a centralised application, submitted to the EMA, according to Article 3(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

An application for an initial Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for retigabine was submitted to EMA in December 2007. The Paediatric Committee's (PDCO) positive opinion for the initial PIP, issued in July 2008, and the EMA decision on the modification of an agreed PIP, issued on 9 October 2009, confirmed a deferral and partial waiver for paediatric studies.

The Applicant has received a CHMP Scientific Advice in 2005. The main issues pertaining to efficacy and safety concerned the duration of the treatment maintenance phase. Moreover, it was recommended that the induction potential should be investigated. The sufficient number of subjects and patients with epilepsy was also an issue, and finally, assessment of the cardiovascular safety was an important topic.

The preclinical advice related to the preclinical program in general and the investigation of the toxicity (including cardiovascular toxicity) of the N-acetyl metabolite of RTG (NAMR) in dogs in particular.

The description of the manufacturing process, characterisation of the active substance and impurities are in general in accordance with the EU guideline on Chemistry of new active substances .

2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction Trobalt contains the active substance retigabine. For other ingredients see the SmPC. The product is formulated as immediate-release film-coated tablets in the strengths 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg. The product is packaged in PVDC/PE/PVC/Alu blisters. 2.2.2. Active Substance Retigabine (RTG) is a well-characterized white to slightly coloured solid. It is neither optically active nor  hygroscopic.  The  active  substance  is  poorly  soluble  in  water  at  pH  ≥2.8.    There  are  no  chiral centres in the molecule. The substance exhibits polymorphism; there are several polymorphic forms one of which was selected for development. All significant non-clinical, clinical and formulation studies with  RTG  were  performed  using  this  solid-state.  Each  of  the  known  solid-state  forms  can  be differentiated using X-ray powder diffraction and IR spectroscopy. The particle size is controlled by the recrystallisation and  milling process. Manufacture The synthesis  involves  a  multi  step  synthesis  with  a  recrystallisation  and  milling  step.  The  route  of synthesis  has  not  changed  since  the  initiation  of  clinical  studies,  although  changes  to  solvents  and process parameters have been introduced during development. Starting materials are well characterised,  specifications  and  testing  procedures  being  acceptable.  The  impurity  limits  for  the starting  materials  and  isolated  intermediates  have  been  set  and  justified  by  spiking  experiments demonstrating satisfactory purification in the down stream synthesis.

## Specification

The active substance is tested for description, identity by HPLC, polymorphic form by X-ray diffraction, assay and related substances by HPLC, residual solvents by GC, particle size by laser light diffraction, nickel content by ICP, residue on ignition and heavy metals.

The requirements in the active substance specification are in accordance with the relevant European guidelines  and  Ph.  Eur.  The  analytical  methods  are  validated  in  accordance  with  relevant  European guidelines and found to be acceptable.

A detailed discussion of potential impurities is present and their control is described. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies and found safe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The reference materials have been described and characterised and information on the source of all impurity standards is available.

## Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  four  pilot-scale  batches  manufactured  at  the  commercial facility  and  data  covering 24 months are provided. Improvements to the process were implemented after the manufacture of the primary stability batches. The stability data presented indicate that the active substance is stable, although out of specification results for a subsequently identified process related impurity are seen. The content of this impurity has been reduced by the changes to the process implemented for the commercial process.

Additional  stability  data  covering  9  months  for  active  substance  batches  manufactured  using  the commercial process are available. The stability data support a re-test period. There is no strict need for the additional proposed precautions for storage: 'Protect from light' and 'Store up to 30 ° C', based on the presented stability and photostability results. Based on experience with past batches, darkening of the active substance may occur, if exposed to light.

During  development  of  the  finished  product  several  different  formulations  have  been  used  and  also differences in active substance particle size have been introduced as mentioned above. Bioequivalence between clinical phase III IR and market image IR batches has been extensively discussed. As a result of this discussion, limits for particle size have been tightened accordingly.

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Retigabine is provided as an immediate-release, film-coated tablet in five different strengths (50, 100, 200,  300,  and  400  mg).  The  five  different  strengths  of  the  Retigabine  Tablets  are  coated  in  three different colours and are differentiated by a combination of size, colour and shape. The tablet cores are in addition to the active substance composed of microcrystalline cellulose, hypromellose croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate.  The manufacturer uses commercially available film coat mixtures. Pharmaceutical Development The development work is satisfactorily described in accordance with the relevant European guideline on pharmaceutical  development.  The  composition  of  the  five  strengths  is  directly  dose-proportional  as they  are  made  from  a  common  granulation  blend.  Compatibility  between  the  active  substance  and excipients has been demonstrated. It  has  been  recognised  that  the  active  substance  particle  size  is  likely  to  affect  bioavailability.  The applicant provided some  comparative particle size data from several stages of the product development. However, since a different method has been used for determination of the particle size of the active substance used in the initial IR tablet, this particle size cannot be compared with the particle size  of  the  active  substance  used  in  clinical  trial  IR  batches  and  market  image  IR  batches.  The applicant was asked to perform a new comparison between Initial IR tablets and Clinical IR tablets in terms  of  particle  size  of  the  active  substance,  using  the  method  submitted  in  Module  3  of  the marketing  authorisation  application.  Satisfactory  results  of  particle  size  studies  between  Initial  IR Tablets and Clinical IR tablets were provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Dissolution of the tablets is fast in the chosen medium. The acceptance criteria after tightening of the dissolution limit during the procedure reflect the obtained results and are set to control a consistent manufacture and quality.

## Adventitious agents

Only one material of animal origin is used in the manufacture of the finished product. Carmine is used as a colouring agent in one of the film coating mixtures and is extracted from insects. As insects are not subject to BSE/TSE infection, there is no risk of BSE/TSE transmission.

## Manufacture of the product

The  description  of  the  manufacturing  process,  in-process  controls  including  testing  frequency  and validation studies are acceptable and in accordance with relevant European guidelines. Evidence has been  provided  that  no  solid-state  transformation  of  the  active  substance  occurs  during  product manufacturing  and  storage.  Stability  data  supporting  the  proposed  holding  times  for  manufacture intermediates have been provided. Primary packaging may be conducted at a different site than the bulk manufacturing site, and information on the stability of bulk film-coated tablets has therefore been provided supporting a bulk holding time.

Process  validation  has  been  conducted  on  full-scale  for  the  granulation  and  blending  steps.  A commitment has been made to conduct process validation on commercial scale batches prior to placing the product on the market. A satisfactory process validation scheme has been provided.

## Product specification

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

The  specification  of  the  finished  product  covers  appropriate  parameters  for  the  dosage  form.  The product is tested for description, identification by UV and HPLC, assay and related impurities by HPLC, dose  uniformity  by  mass  variation,  dissolution  and  microbial  purity.  The  acceptance  criteria  for dissolution  have  been  tightened  to  reflect  the  actual  dissolution  profiles  obtained.  Test  for  related substances  has  been  included  in  the  finished  product  release  specification.  Non-routine  testing  of microbial quality is acceptable. The shelf-life specification includes tests for related substances and the limits for specified impurities; these are acceptable based on qualification, batch analysis and stability results. The  analytical  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  the European validation guidelines, and the stability-indicating nature and specificity of impurity methods have been demonstrated. Stability of the product Stability studies on pilot scale batches of the finished product have been conducted in accordance with general European requirements, applying a bracketing approach (three batches for each of the lowest and highest strength, one batch for each of intermittent strengths). The stability batches were packed in  blisters  of  clear  PVDC/PE/PVC  film  with  aluminium  foil  backing.  The  finished  product  is  stable  at 25 ° C/60% RH up to 18 months. Significant changes to description, related substances and assay are seen at accelerated conditions together with a drop in dissolution. Significant changes in impurities are also seen at intermediate conditions. For  commercial  presentation  an  opaque  PVDC/PE/PVC  film  will  be  used,  to  avoid  changes  in appearance of the tablets seen with the clear film, due to darkening of the active substance, when exposed to light. The adequacy of the light-protective properties of the commercial blister configuration has been confirmed by photostability studies conducted under ICH conditions. In general, the results of stability studies support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Initially  three  major  objections  related  to  active  substance  particle  size,  discriminatory  properties  of the dissolution method and bridging between Initial IR tablets and Clinical trial IR tablets were raised. All of these are now considered resolved (see above in the Pharmaceutical Development section).

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Pivotal toxicology/toxicokinetic studies have been performed in accordance with GLP or performed to high scientific standards comparable to GLP. However, several of the safety pharmacology studies were not conducted in compliance with GLP. Nevertheless, this was deemed acceptable as the studies are conducted before the guideline came into effect.

Initial  development  activities  were  conducted  with  the  dihydrochloride  salt  of  retigabine  (RHCl). However, due to weak positive responses in the Ames' test probably caused by low levels of genotoxic impurities owing to the synthesis of RHCl, the subsequent development was based on the free base (RTG).

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The mechanism of action of RTG is thought to involve activation of specific KCNQ2-5 voltage-gated potassium channels. KCNQ2, KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 are expressed in neural tissues in addition to urinary bladder  (all  but  predominantly  KCNQ3),  intestine  (KCNQ3  in  combination  with  KCNQ1)  and  skeletal muscles (KCNQ5). KCNQ4 is mainly expressed in the cardiovascular and auditory systems.

RTG  concentration  dependently  and  reversibly  enhanced  the  outward  current  mediated  by  these receptors. In addition, RTG caused a hyperpolarising shift, which is likely to increase the activity of these channels at sub-threshold potentials.

The EC50 values were all with the range a few micromolar for KCNQ2-4 and KCNQ2/3. Thus, RTG is only  likely  to  cause  a  slight  positive  modulation  of  the  KCNQ-mediated  currents  at  clinical  relevant concentrations  considering  a  human  plasma  protein  binding  of  80%  and  a  Cmax  of  5  µM  following administration of MRHD.

Electrophysiological  recordings  conducted  in  cultured  native  neurons  confirmed  the  anti-epileptic potential of RTG due to its potentiation of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential leading to a decrease in neural  firing.  More  importantly,  RTG  was  effective  against  epileptiform  discharges  in  brain  slice preparations obtained from rats and from epileptic patients who underwent neurosurgery.

RTG was effective in several genetically-, electrically- and chemically-induced seizure models following intraperitoneal (IP) and per os (PO) administration. Interestingly, RTG was ineffective against seizures induced  chemically  by  some  compounds  inhibiting  the  GABAA  receptor  complex  (picrotoxin  and bicuculline) and the glycine receptor (strychnine). RTG showed significant anticonvulsant effect against seizures induced by two GABAergic antagonists (e.g., pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and penicillin).

Medicinal product no longer authorised

RTG was evaluated following  IP  and  PO  administration  in  several  models  that  are  considered  to  be predictive  of  complex  partial  seizures  in  humans,  e.g.,  amygdala  and  hippocampal  kindling  model. Overall,  RTG  inhibited  the  establishment  of  partial  seizures  in  the  two  kindling  models  as  the progression of seizures in terms of frequency and initiation was inhibited and in some instances RTG also  reduced the severity of the established seizures. RTG showed greater potency than other antiepileptic drugs currently on the market. However, the effect on inhibition of kindling epileptogenesis was less obvious.

RTG was shown to be effective in a rat model of status epilepticus following IP and PO administration.

Although some variation was observed, RHCl and RTG generally appeared equipotent when tested in the same type of animal seizure models (i.e., MES, PTZ, amygdale kindling, and audiogenic models).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition  to  the  effect  on  the  KCNQ  channels,  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  data  indicated  that  RTG  may influence the neurochemical regulation of the excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, e.g., RTG seemed to  inhibit  GABA  metabolism  and  to  lower  brain  concentrations  of  the  excitatory  neurotransmitter glutamate  and  its  precursor  glutamine.  The  pharmacological  effects  of  RTG  main  metabolite  NAMR were tested in several in vivo models and it was concluded that NAMR did not contribute significantly to the overall activity profile of RTG.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Like  several  other  antiepileptic  drugs,  RTG  showed  some  potential  for  neuroprotective  actions  in several in vitro and in vivo models. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it was considered likely that the inhibitory effect on the potassium channels in itself would provide some neuroprotection due to reduced release of excitatory amino acids such as glutamate.

## Safety pharmacology programme

RTG showed CNS-related effects following IP and PO administration. Generally, effects were observed at  dose  levels  below  those  used  in  the  clinical  program.  The  effects  of  RTG  on  the  cardiovascular system were investigated in several in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies using mice, rats, guinea pigs,  pigs  and  dogs.  RTG  had  no  significant  effect  on  the  recombinant  rat  potassium  channels belonging  to  the  same  receptor  family  as  the  hERG  at  10  µM.  However,  a  partially  reversible concentration-dependent inhibition was observed for recombinant hERG channels at concentrations ≥1 µM.  Furthermore,  a  concentration-dependent  irreversible  inhibition  of  the  cardiac  KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels was observed at ≥1 µM with an IC50 value a round 100 µM. The exposure margin at this concentration was approximately 1000-fold assuming a human plasma protein binding of 80% and a Cmax of 5 μM. Other in vitro studies using murine arteries, feline ventricular myocytes, canine purkinje fibres and hearts from guinea pigs also indicated a safety margin of at least 100-fold. RTG and NAMR administration were not associated with ECG effects in dogs when investigated in the safety  pharmacology  cardiovascular  (CVS)  studies  and  long-term  toxicity  studies  up  to  52  weeks duration.  RTG  reached  an  AUC  of  approximately  8,300-25,300  ng·hr/mL  (52  week  dog  study). Following  NAMR  administration  (13-  week  dog  study),  the  AUC  for  NAMR  reached  36,400-55,900 ng·hr/mL at the top dose of 100 mg/kg/day. These values provide a safety margin of &lt;0.8 and &lt;2.4, respectively. Evaluation in conscious telemetered dogs showed dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure (up to 21%), cardiac output (up to -11%), heart rate (up to -42%) and left ventricular contractivity (up to 36%) following intravenous (IV), intradermal (ID) and PO administration. RTG caused a 20% fall in dynamic compliance in anaesthetised guinea pigs (10 mg/kg IV) and a slight increase in airway resistance leading to an increase in respiratory rate and respiratory minute volume in anaesthetised intubated spontaneously breathing dogs (100 mg/kg ID). The changes observed were not considered statistically or biologically significant. RTG had no significant effect on gastrointestinal transit in mice. Several effects were observed on the renal system (urinary bladder function) in rodents (see Section 3.3.4 Toxicology). Pharmacodynamic drug interactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Several pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies were performed on mice and rats.

The  interaction  of  RTG  with  conventional  AEDs  (Carbamazepine,  Valproate  and  Lamotrigine)  was investigated in several studies to assess any additive or synergistic effects after maximal electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions. A low potential for interaction was shown.

The  effect  of  retigabine  in  combination  with  four  anaesthetics  (halothane,  methohexital,  thiopental, propofol)  was  evaluated  in  a  rat  study  to  determine  effects  on  sleep  time  and  righting  reflex.  This study  demonstrated  that  halothane-  and  methohexital-induced  sleep  times  were  not  significantly influenced by retigabine, but an increase in respiratory depression was observed. Retigabine weakly affected  (~1.4 times)  propofol-induced  sleep  time  but  strongly  prolonged  (~14 times)  thiopentalinduced sleep time. Respiratory depression was not increased by retigabine in thiopental or propofolinduced anaesthesia. These results suggest a potential interaction between retigabine and thiopental, but  no  or  weak  interactions  with  the  other  tested  anesthetic  agents.  Those  results  are  reflected  in section 5.1 of the SmPC even though there are no clinical data confirming these findings.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant has agreed to monitor the interactions between retigabine and anaesthetic drugs as part of  routine  pharmacovigilance  and  to  consider  the  need  to  update  the  SmPC  as  further  information becomes available.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  parameters  of  RTG  were  examined  in  more  than  50  ADME  studies  in  a range of species including mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and minipig. The mouse, rat and dog were the predominant species employed in the toxicity studies; while the rabbit was used for developmental toxicity  investigations.  The  PK  studies  focused  on  the  oral  route  of  administration,  since  this  is  the intended clinical route. IV studies were also undertaken to further characterize the systemic PK of RTG. Samples  from  a  majority  of  the  PK  studies  were  assayed  using  validated  bioanalytical  methods. However, data from some exploratory studies were generated with non-validated methods.

The PK data for RTG and NAMR were obtained from single-dose studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys  and  minipigs.  Repeat-dose  toxicokinetic  (TK)  data  were  obtained  from  toxicity  studies  in mice, rats, rabbits (developmental toxicity), dogs, monkeys and minipigs.

<!-- image -->

The  bioavailability  of  the  metabolite  NAMR  was  also  high  in  rats  and  dogs  indicating  that  sufficient systemic exposure will be achieved in these species following PO administration. Contrary to RTG, the T½ of NAMR did not vary significant between species (rats, rabbits and dogs; 1.7-10 hr).

Methods of analysis A  series  of  bioanalytical  methods,  all  employing  high-pressure  performance  liquid  chromatography (HPLC), were developed for the quantification of RTG and metabolites in plasma and other biological matrices from non-clinical species. The methods varied based on the specifics of the HPLC conditions. The  extraction methods  were  primarily  protein  precipitation or on-line or off-line solid-phase extraction, and quantification methods were primarily ultraviolet (UV), fluorescence detector (FD) or mass spectroscopy (MS) for non-labelled compound. As additional information on the metabolic profile became available, additional/alternate analytes (metabolites) were included in the validations and the methods  were  optimized  to  minimize  potential  breakdown  of  metabolites  during  analysis.  Those methods  of  analysis  were  considered  of  adequate  quality  and  consistent  with  those  applied  in  the clinical studies. Absorption In  all  tested  species,  RTG  was  rapidly  absorbed  from  the  gastro-intestinal  tract  following  single  PO administration  (&lt;  2  hr).  Dietary  dosing  in  rodents  expectedly  resulted  in  substantially  lower  Cmax values obtained several hours after treatment. A high variability was generally observed in the elimination half-life values (T½) of RTG. The T½ was in the range of 1.4-9 hr in rats, 4-22 hr in rabbits, 0.9-20 hr in dogs, compared to 6-10 hr in humans. Thus,  rats  were  generally  having  lower  values  for  T½  than  rabbits,  dogs  and  humans.  The bioavailability  of  RTG  following  PO  administration  was  in  the  high  end  (&gt;60%)  in  rats,  dogs  and humans. A dose-dependent increase in exposure was recorded with no indication of drug accumulation. Gender-related differences were only observed in mice regardless of the strain used as the exposure of RTG  in  male  mice  exposure  was  recorded  as  being  twice  the  exposure  in  females.  The  volume  of distribution  was  approximate  3-6-fold  larger  than  the  total  body  water  of  the  respective  species indicating that RTG is widely distributed throughout the body. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Distribution

The tissue distribution of [14C]-RTG was investigated in rats following a single PO administration. Most of the RTG-related radioactivity was recovered in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver, but also in most other tissues, e.g., adrenal, kidney, heart and spleen. Tissue Cmax was obtained within first 4 hours after dosing. The tissue elimination half-life was longer compared to plasma and 72-hour postdosing  RTG-related  radioactivity  was  still  present  with  highest  concentrations  observed  in  the  liver, adrenal gland and kidneys.

In  pregnant  rats,  the  tissue  distribution  pattern  was  similar  in  dams  and  foetuses  but  the  tissue exposure in foetal tissue was lower and more uniform with no high concentration organs as seen in the

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dams. The tissue elimination half lives in dams were between 4-18 hours and in foetuses between 6-12 hours.

In lactating rats, less than 2 % of administrated dose was recovered in milk and tissues of the pups at &gt;24 hours post-dosing.  The  majority  of  radioactivity  (up  to  85  %)  in  rat  milk  was  related  to  a  rat specific metabolite with a milk/plasma ratio of 35:1. Nevertheless, the combined data indicated that minor paediatric exposure through milk ingestion in clinical use could not be excluded. Those findings are reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.

RTG showed a relatively  low  and  reversible  binding  (around  77-87%)  to  plasma  proteins  in  all  the tested  species  including  humans.  The  degree  of  binding  to  plasma  proteins  was  similar  in  both genders. NAMR protein binding was lower (39-49%) in all the tested species including humans.

## Metabolism

The primary routes of RTG metabolism were dominated by phase II processes involving hydrolysis/Nacetylation to form NAMR and N-glucuronidation of RTG and NAMR. There was no evidence of direct oxidative metabolism of RTG in any species. There was no evidence of NAMR formation in the dog and little NAMR formation in the Cynomolgus monkey. All evaluated species formed N-glucuronides of RTG. N-glucoside metabolites of RTG were also observed in dog and humans. Excretion In rat and dogs studies evaluating the excretion of RTG and NAMR showed that RTG and metabolites were excreted in both faeces and urine, with an approximate 2:1 faeces:urine split of the eliminated dose. Studies with bile duct cannulated rats showed that a major part of the RTG-related radioactivity in  faeces  originated  from  the  bile.  NAMR  was  excreted  to  a  greater  extent  in  the  urine,  i.e., approximately one-half to two-third of the dose. Elimination patterns were similar following both PO and IV dosing, and the elimination of drug via the faeces following IV dosing was in accordance with significant biliary excretion. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions The enzyme-inducing capacity of RTG was evaluated in vitro in hepatic microsomes obtained from rats treated orally with RTG (8.25, 26.1 or 82.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days). RTG did not induce the CYP P450 isozymes  or  N-acetyltransferases  (NATs).  Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  RTG  had  no  capacity  to induce CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2E1, CYP3A, NAT1 or NAT2 in rats. Metabolism data from human in vitro studies  (D-23129/9321030009)  also  indicated  that  RTG  is  not  a  significant  substrate  for  CYP  P450 enzymes. RTG inhibition of human CYP-450 isoenzymes has been investigated in vitro. Similar to the observations in the rodent, there was no evidence of inhibition of human P450 isozymes observed at clinically-relevant concentrations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

However,  a  dose-dependent  induction  by  RTG  of  hepatic  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases  (measured using p-nitrophenol as substrate) was observed in rats (D-23129/FB20299). This induction was more pronounced in female rats than male rats as the increases in enzyme activity were 1.6 and 3.8-fold in males  and  females,  respectively,  at  the  top  dose.  The  increase  in  females  was  comparable  to  that observed for phenobarbital. RTG also showed the potential for induction of its own metabolism. The induction  was  dose-dependent  and  a  statistically  significant  increase  of  RTG  glucuronidation  was observed  being  approximately  3-fold  in  females.  Based  on  this  information,  it  was  considered  that auto-induced glucuronidation of RTG  and  other substrates, was possible with repeated  RTG administration in rats.

Studies  of  P-gp  mediated  transport  indicated  that  RTG  was  not  a  substrate  of  P-gp,  although  the metabolite NAMR had inhibitory activity.

Due  to  the  low  plasma  protein  binding  of  RTG  and  its  principal  metabolite  NAMR,  the  potential  for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with highly protein bound drugs was considered low for RTG.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity studies with RTG and RHCl were conducted in mice (3 studies) and rats (4 studies) using both oral and IV routes of administration.

Additional  single  dose  toxicity  data  were  available  from  a  feasibility  study  in  minipigs  and  from  2 single-dose TK studies in mice and rats. Apart from two studies (one in CD rats and one in minipigs), all single-dose studies were GLP-compliant.

The majority of the toxicities observed with RTG were directly or indirectly attributable to its effects on KCNQ channels. The primary signs of toxicity in single dose toxicity studies were CNS-related and were considered as extended pharmacological activity of RTG on the KCNQ receptors and associated with lethality at high doses. The minimal lethal dose was around 100 mg/kg in rats and 1000 mg/kg in mice following  PO  administration.  Intravenous  lethal  dose  levels  were  lower  than  seen  with  PO  dosing. Based on extrapolation via allometric scaling, RTG was lethal in mice and rats at exposures 0.8 to 4fold the MRHD (60 kg human).

The findings consisted primarily of toxic effects on the CNS, the urinary and renal system, the liver and the thyroid.

## Effects on the CNS

CNS toxicity was observed in rats in the form of hypoactivity, hyperactivity, coordination disturbances and  clonic  convulsions.  In  dogs,  clinical  signs  of  CNS  toxicity  consisted  of  salivation,  hypoactivity, coordination  disturbances,  decreased  muscle  tone,  loss  of  righting  reflex,  hypothermia  and  clonic convulsions.  The  reversibility  of  these  effects  and  the  lack  of  histopathological  findings  in  the  CNS suggested that these findings might result from extended pharmacology. A toxicity study for a CNS active drug would include an extended histopathological evaluation of the brain.

## Effects on the urinary system

Expression of KCNQ1, 3 and 5 has been demonstrated in rat urinary bladder and expression of KCNQ3 and  5  has  been  demonstrated  in  human  urinary  bladder  smooth  cells.  The  effects  of  RTG  on  the urinary bladder were probably primarily mediated via an activation of KCNQ3 since mRNA for KCNQ2 and  4  was  not  detected  in  the  urinary  bladder  and  the  effect  of  RTG  on  KCNQ1  and  KCNQ5  was insignificant as compared to the effect on KCNQ3. RTG causes KCNQ channel mediated urinary bladder relaxation. The smooth muscle relaxation induced by RTG resulted in an inhibition of micturation and bladder distension, with secondary effects on the kidney produced by increasing urinary tract pressure. Based on the conducted repeat-dose toxicity studies, the sensitivity to retigabine-induced urinary and renal system toxicity was mice&gt;rats&gt;dogs. It was considered that the higher sensitivity of the rodent species to the bladder and renal effects might be due to the normal inability of rodents to exert central control over bladder musculature.

In mice, rats and dogs, histopathological findings in the urinary bladder included distension, thickened urinary  bladder  wall,  inflammation  in  the  urinary  bladder  and  in  rodents  also  bladder  calculi  and urothelial  hyperplasia.  Secondary  effects  in  the  kidneys  were  observed  in  rodents  such  as  dilated pelvis,  papillary  necrosis  and  tubular  degeneration/regeneration/dilation  including  focal  haemorrhage in the urinary bladder and proliferation of the smooth muscle. Reversibility of the effects was observed following a 6-week recovery period.

Urinary  bladder  epithelial  hyperplasia  was  reported  in  two  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies: following  13/26-weeks  treatment  of  male  mice/rats  at  doses  ≥  100  mg/kg.  Based  on  plasma  AUC values,  the  hyperplasia  was  observed  in  mice  and  rats,  respectively,  at  doses  0.7  and  1.8-fold  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinical  plasma  exposure  at  the  Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). Histological analysis indicated that the proliferative activity in the urinary bladder epithelia in RTG-treated mice appeared to be compensatory to epithelial inflammation. This conclusion was supported by the lack of carcinogenic potential of retigabine following 2-years dosing of rats although the plasma exposure levels obtained were only 0.7 to 0.8-fold the clinical AUC at the MRHD in males and females, respectively.

## Gall Bladder and Resulting Localized Dog Liver Toxicity

RTG caused relaxation of isolated guinea pig gall bladder via an effect on KCNQ channels; similarly RTG-treatment  in  dogs  caused  gall  bladder  dilation.  in  the  52-week  study  in  dogs,  the  liver  tissue directly overlying the distended gall bladder was affected by focal chronic degeneration/inflammation, accompanied by significant increases in ALT levels in some dogs. A mechanistic study demonstrated that gall bladder volume both at fasting and postprandial states were increased in RTG treated animals compared to controls. There was no evidence of any treatment-related gall bladder histopathology. The local liver toxicity associated with mechanical pressure from a dilated gall bladder occurred in dog at plasma exposure levels 10-fold lower than the clinical AUC at the MRHD.

Rodent hepatic Effects Dose-dependent increases in liver weight and centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy were observed in multiple mouse and rat studies. Those findings were considered to be representative of an adaptive effect of induction of metabolizing enzymes, rather than being toxic effects. Indeed, a dose-dependent induction  by  RTG  of  hepatic  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases  was  observed  in  rats.  The  findings  were associated  with  typically  mild-moderate  dose-dependent  changes  in  liver  enzyme  activities.  It  was concluded that there were no degenerative histopathological correlates for the hepato-biliary marker enzymes elevations in the mouse and rat. There were a range of similar examples of test substances that have produced increases in hepato-biliary marker enzymes in rodents with only adaptive changes such  as  hypertrophy  or  minimal  toxicological  findings  (Amacher,  1998).  It  was  therefore  concluded that the hepatic changes for RTG in rodent species were indicative of reversible effects associated with the  induction  of  drug  metabolizing  enzymes  and  further  non-clinical  testing  was  not  considered necessary. Rodent thyroid Effects Slight thyroid follicular hypertrophy and an increase to T3, T4 and TSH were observed in mice and rats. These effects were considered to be an adaptive response to increased metabolic activity of the liver resulting  in  increased  glucuronidation  of  thyroid  hormone,  and  a  compensatory  response  to  restore thyroid hormone homeostasis. Perturbations  of  the  pituitary-thyroid  axis  by  various  xenobiotics  were  considered  more  likely  to predispose  the  rat  to  higher  incidences  of  thyroid  proliferative  lesions  in  response  to  chronic  TSH stimulation than is the case for the human thyroid. The sensitivity of the rodent thyroid is to a great extent  related  to  the  shorter  plasma  half-life  of  T4  compared  to  that  of  humans,  due  to  major differences in the transport proteins for the thyroid hormones, including the lack of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). TBG is found in humans and dogs (Casarett &amp; Doull's, 2001; Greaves, 2007). There is no  evidence  from  the  clinical  studies  performed  that  RTG  induces  any  thyroid  changes  in  patients, which confirms the well-established rodent specificity for effects on this endocrine organ. Genotoxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Various genotoxicity studies demonstrated that the initial synthetic process of RTG was associated to a mutagenic response of RTG. The results of the Ames' test were in several cases considered negative even though a statistically significant dose-response relationship was identified. The marginal nature of the increase in the mutagenic index (&lt;2- or &lt;3-fold increase depending on the strain) indicated that the statistical responses were not biologically relevant but it was considered that the dose-dependent increase  might  indicate  the  presence  of  a  genotoxic  impurity  for  which  there  was  insufficient  assay sensitivity due to the presence of the active substance. In order to eliminate the mutagenicity effects, RTG  was  synthesized  by  the  commercial  route  and  was  tested  in  a  battery  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo mutagenicity assays to detect potential gene mutation, chromosome aberration and DNA damage.

RTG tested negative for mutagenicity in the Ames test and an extensive number of later batches were shown to be non-mutagenic.

RTG also  tested  negative  in  two  independent  mammalian  cell  forward  gene  mutation  assays  in  the presence  and  absence  of  S-9,  and  did  not  induce  chromosome  aberrations  in  cultured  human lymphocytes following pulse treatment for 3 or 4 hours in the absence and presence of S-9. Following

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

continued treatment for 20 or 22 hours in this test system, RTG induced chromosome aberrations, but only in the absence of S-9 and at relatively high cytotoxic doses.

Finally, RTG tested negative in two in vivo assays, micronucleus test in bone marrow of mice and in the in vivo / in vitro UDS assay in hepatocytes in rats. Based on those findings, it was concluded that RTG was not genotoxic.

The principal human and rat plasma metabolite NAMR tested negative in the Ames' test but showed a significant  increase  in  structural  chromosomal  aberrations  in  the  in  vitro  chromosomal  aberration assay. However, the increase was observed under conditions of high cytotoxicity and at an exposure approximately 1000-fold higher than that observed in humans following administration of the MRHD (based on human Cmax for NAMR). No significant neoplastic findings were observed in the neonatal mouse  carcinogenicity  study  using  a  species  in  which  NAMR  has  also  been  identified  as  a  plasma metabolite. , The increase in structural chromosomal aberrations is therefore not considered relevant for humans.

The active substance itself was considered non-genotoxic in vitro and in vivo but a thorough evaluation of  the  impurities/potential  impurities  for  genotoxicity  was  necessary  to  conclude  on  the  genotoxic profile of RTG (see  section 'Impurities' in this section).

Carcinogenicity RTG was shown to be non-carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study using PO administration of 5, 20 and 50 mg/kg/day (gavage). The exposure margins for RTG and its principal rat/human metabolite were 0.73 and 0.43 as compared to the level following administration of MRHD (based on AUC). Furthermore the potential  for  in  particular  genotoxic  carcinogenicity  of  RTG  was  investigated  in  a  neonatal  mouse carcinogenicity study, where mice were fed by gavage once on postnatal day (PND) 8 and once on PND 15 with RTG (32, 64 or 96 mg/kg PO).  There was no significant increase in the incidence of neoplasms in the lungs and livers, i.e., the most sensitive target organs of this model (Flammang et al., 1997; McClain  et  al.,  2001).  Based  on  the  absence  of  hyperplastic  histopathology  changes  in  repeat  dose toxicology studies and the negative findings in the rat- and neonatal mouse carcinogenicity study, that the CHMP concluded that RTG was unlikely to be carcinogenic. Reproduction Toxicity The reproductive and developmental toxicity program for RTG was comprehensive and encompassed fertility,  early  embryonic,  embryo-foetal,  pre-  and  postnatal  development.  These  studies  were complemented by juvenile animal toxicity studies. The pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with applicable GLP regulations and standards. The  influence  of  RTG  on  fertility  and  general  reproductive  performance  was  evaluated  in  rats  at exposures  0.6 times  the  MRHD,  based  on  AUC.  No  significant  effects  on  male  or  female  fertility  or reproductive performance and early embryonic development were observed at any of the tested dose levels. Maternal findings related to the extended CNS pharmacological effects of RTG were observed at oral doses  above  20  mg/kg  in  rats.  RTG  was  not  tolerated  in  pregnant  animals  at  doses  above 30mg/kg/day  in  rabbits  and  70mg/kg/day  in  rats.    No  treatment-related  influence  of  RTG  on reproductive parameters was noted in the two pivotal rat studies; however, increased incidence of soft tissue variations were recorded at 46.4 mg/kg in a dose-range finding study.

The pivotal studies in rabbits were performed with two different strains (Himalayan rabbits and New Zealand White). The maternal NOAEL was comparable between strains, i.e., 12-10 mg/kg but not the foetal toxicity. In Himalayan rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity was observed at 26.1 mg/kg in form of a reduced foetal weight and a decreased survival rate of foetuses while in New Zealand White rabbits no foetal toxicity was recorded at 40 and 60 mg/kg/day.

Overall, RTG caused several effects on the reproductive system, foetal toxicity and malformations (i.e., soft  tissue  variations).  The  RTG  AUC0-24  values  in  both  rats  and  rabbits  were  estimated  to  be approximately  0.6-fold  of  the  daily  human  exposure  at  the  highest  intended  RTG  clinical  dose.  The NOAEL  regarding  embryo-foetal  toxicity  and  developmental  effect  was  46.4 mg/kg  in  rat  and  12.1 mg/kg in the most sensitive rabbit strain corresponding to an estimated RTG plasma AUC 0.02-fold the MRHD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Maternal toxicity was recorded at 61.9 mg/kg in the rat prenatal and postnatal development study in the form of clinical signs of CNS toxicity and reduced body weight gains. Signs of reproductive toxicity at  61.9  mg/kg  included  slightly  (4%)  prolonged  gestational  length,  increased  number  of  postimplantation losses, increased number of dead pups, and reduced pup survival, mostly during the first four  days  postpartum.  Pup  weights  were  lower  compared  to  controls  at  61.9  mg/kg  and  a  related ≤1 day delay in the auditory startle response was observed at this dose level. A marginal effect on pup weight was observed at 17.8 mg/kg. Hence, the NOAEL was 17.8 mg/kg and 4.64 mg/kg for the F0 and F1 generation, respectively.

No  toxicokinetic  measurements  were  performed  but  the  plasma  exposure  levels  obtained  were considered to be most likely below what those obtained clinically at the MRHD. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the reproductive and developmental toxicity profile in rats and rabbits had not been fully characterised and the Applicant was requested to evaluate if additional reproductive studies in rat and  rabbit  with  different  dosing  regimen  could  provide  an  exposure  significantly  above  clinically relevant plasma exposure levels.

In the responses to the D120 List of questions, the Applicant adequately justified the low dose range used  in  the  reproductive  studies  and  the  effects  observed.  The  impossibility  to  increase  exposure margins by altering dose routes or changing dosing regimens was acknowledged but the data provided were considered insufficient and not adequate to justify the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Toxic effects on the foetuses could not be excluded and a strict recommendation for not using retigabine in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential not using contraception was included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. Toxicity studies in juvenile animals Overall,  identical  target  organs  were  identified  in  the  juvenile  and  adult  toxicity  studies.  However, based on toxicokinetic data, the studies suggested that juvenile animals were more sensitive towards RTG than adult animals. Moreover, the animal sensitivity appeared to be influenced by the post partum age of the animals. Hence, 30 mg/kg PO (gavage) RTG was associated with mortalities in post-natal day (PND) 21 rats but not in rats which were 28 days old. In addition, an increased mortality rate was observed in PND 7 rats dosed with 0.6 mg/kg RTG. The treatment-related findings consisted of clinical signs of CNS toxicity and centrilobular hypertrophy of the liver. The plasma exposure obtained in the high-dose animals corresponded roughly to what was obtained in patients treated with 1200 mg RTG. Based on CNS development, a 28 day old rat corresponds approximately to a 6 year-old child thus caution should be exercised if attempting treatment of younger children. Local Tolerance Local RTG effects following IV, i.a. and p.v. dosing to dogs were similar to those observed with the vehicle control, indicating that RTG has a low potential to cause local tissue toxicity. Other toxicity studies · Impurities Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  Applicant  provided  an  extensive  evaluation  of  the  genotoxicity  of  the  impurities/potential impurities in RTG, testing the isolated impurity in concentrations ≥250 µg/plate.

Three  impurities  are  specified  in  the  RTG  active  substance  specifications.  Considering  the  structural similarities  of  two  of  these  impurities,  they  are  controlled  to  a  combined  TTC  limit  of  &lt;1.5  μg/day (equivalent  to  &lt;1.25  μg/g  [~1.2  ppm]  based  on  the  1200  mg  maximum  RTG  daily  dose)  which  is defined in the CHMP Guideline on the limits of Genotoxic Impurities.

For  the  third  impurity,  taken  into  consideration  the  available  non-clinical  data  and  the  As  Low  As Reasonable Practicable (ALARP) principle, the CHMP requested the applicant to lower the specification limit.

In  the  DFB  micronucleus  study,  bone  marrow  exposure  (i.e.,  systemic  exposure)  was  not  directly assessed;  however,  adverse  CNS  signs  consisting  of  ataxia,  reduced  motility  and  dyspnoea  were observed  at  the  Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (MTD  =  1000 mg/kg),  which  suggested  that  adequate systemic exposure had been achieved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Negative DFB Ames data indicated that the potential for mutagenicity of DFB had been appropriately addressed. Ethyl chloroformate (ECF) was not mutagenic in the Ames test

On  consideration  of  all  data  pertaining  to  potential  genotoxic  impurities,  the  CHMP  considered  that there was no genotoxicity risk with the RTG active substance.

## · Immunotoxicity

The  antigenic/allergenic  potential  of  RTG  was  investigated  in  male  Guinea  pigs  by  the  passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test. Repeated intraperitoneal injections of RTG with or without adjuvants were administered to attempt to develop an antigenic reactin. Ovalbumin was used as positive control. RTG induced no passive or active anaphylactic response under the conditions of the study.

To evaluate the potential skin-sensitizing properties of RTG, a Buehler test was performed in guinea pigs.  The  results  indicated  that  RTG  had  no  sensitizing  properties  on  the  skin  of  guinea  pigs.  No systemic toxicity was observed.

RTG was found to be non-allergenic in guinea-pigs in two different tests for immunogenicity · Dependence Potential No evidence of physical dependence to RTG was generated from a 45 day abuse potential rat study. RTG was not considered to have a significant potential for clinical dependence or abuse. · Metabolites NAMR, the  N-acetyl  metabolite  of  RTG,  was  the  only  significant  non-glucuronide  metabolite  of  RTG present in the human circulation (AUC(0-24) NAMR values at 600 mg and 1200 mg RTG are ~12700 and ~22970 ng ⋅ h/mL, respectively). The potential toxicity of NAMR was evaluated as part of nonclinical studies conducted to assess RTG toxicity in rodents. Dogs, due to their deficiency of the N-acetyl transferase enzyme, were not systemically exposed to NAMR in toxicology studies of RTG; therefore, the potential toxicity of NAMR could not be assessed during the evaluation of RTG toxicity in dogs. In view of this and to complement the toxicology program, two 13-week studies were conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity of NAMR following oral administration in dogs. Significant treatment-related clinical, haematology and pathology changes were observed at daily oral dose levels of ≥30 mg/kg (AUC0-24h ≥ 24900 and 13500, in males and females, respectively). The mechanism(s) underpinning the haemato-pathology changes resulting in the severe clinical signs associated with NAMR administration at ≥30 mg/kg/day in dogs have not been identified. Overall,  the  pattern  of  clinical,  haematology  and  pathology  findings  identified  in  dogs  administered NAMR at daily dose levels of ≥30 mg/kg were not present in rats at any of the administered oral dose levels (NAMR  at dose levels of ≤120 mg/kg/day (males; AUC0-24h = 155734 ng.h/mL) or ≤100 mg/kg/day (females; AUC0-24h = 167797 ng.h/mL) for 13 weeks. The toxicity  observed  with NAMR dosing to dogs, but not in rats, is believed to represent a species-specific toxicity. Nevertheless, clinical  and  hematologic  changes  associated  with  NAMR  administration  in  dogs  were  periodically monitored for in clinical trials. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Special toxicity and Mechanistic studies

Mechanistic  studies  were  conducted  to  further  investigate  the  relationship  between  RTG  effects  on KCNQ-related smooth muscle contraction in the urinary bladder and the gall bladder, to characterize the pathogenesis of urinary tract lesions and to evaluate the gastrointestinal and the liver toxicity of RTG.

Results of these studies demonstrated that the activation of the Kv7 channels in the gall bladder by RTG leads to a dose-dependent reduction in gall bladder contractility. Effects on urinary tract in mice were  probably  dependent  from  the  effects  of  RTG  on  KCNQ  channels  suggesting  that  these  effects directly  inhibit  bladder  contractility  and  lead  to  inhibition  of  micturation.  Effects  of  RTG  on  liver

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in dogs are probably species specific and are due to a mechanical pressure necrosis of the liver due to the distended gall bladder.

## · Phototoxicity

Based on data from rat distribution studies and from in vitro studies, it was concluded that RTG had no phototoxic potential.

## · Compatibility with human blood

The blood compatibility of RTG was analysed in vitro . The results indicated that RTG was compatible with human blood at intended clinical doses.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  environmental  risk  assessment  submitted  by  the  Applicant  as  part  of  this  application  was considered insufficient by the CHMP. Based on theoretical considerations, the Applicant considered that it was unnecessary to perform a sediment toxicity study even though the conditions for such a study were met. This was not considered acceptable by the Committee and the Applicant was requested to evaluate the potential toxicity of retigabine to sediment organisms and update the PEC estimates and the respective PEC:PNEC comparisons within 1 year of approval of the present application. The MAH was also requested to undertake additional Kow testing and to provide the relevant report concurrent with the proposed sediment toxicity testing. The  results  from  the  additional  studies  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 of Regulation 726/2004 having regard to the requirements of Article 8(3) (ca) of Directive 2001/83. 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Potassium  channels  are  one  of  the  voltage-gated  ion  channels  found  in  neuronal  cells  and  are important  determinants  of  neuronal  activity.  In  vitro  studies  indicate  that  retigabine  acts  primarily through opening neuronal potassium channels (KCNQ2 [Kv7.2] and KCNQ3 [Kv7.3]). This stabilises the resting  membrane  potential  and  controls  the  sub-threshold  electrical  excitability  in  neurons,  thus preventing  the  initiation  of  epileptiform  action  potential  bursts.  Mutations  in  the  KCNQ  channels underlie several human inheritable disorders, including epilepsy (KCNQ2 and 3). The  mechanism of action  of  retigabine  on  potassium  channels  has  been  well  documented,  however other  mechanisms  by  which  retigabine  may  assert  an  antiepileptic  effect  have  yet  to  be  fully elucidated. In  a  range  of  seizure  models,  retigabine  increased  the  threshold  for  seizure  induction  produced  by maximal  electroshock,  pentylenetetrazol,  picrotoxin  and  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA).  Retigabine also displayed inhibitory properties in multiple kindling models. In addition, retigabine was effective in preventing  status  epilepticus  seizures  in  rodents  with  cobalt-induced  epileptogenic  lesions,  and inhibiting  tonic  extensor  seizures  in  genetically  susceptible  mice.  The  relevance  of  these  models  to human epilepsy, however, is not known. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Maximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated pharmacologic effects of retigabine (including ataxia, hypokinesia and tremor). At no observed effect levels, animal exposure in  these  studies  was  generally  less  than  that  reached  in  humans  at  recommended  clinical  doses. Distension of the gall bladder was seen in studies with dogs, but there was no evidence of cholestasis or other signs of gall bladder dysfunction, and bile ejection volume was unchanged. The gall bladder distension in the dog resulted in focal compression of the liver. No signs of gall bladder dysfunction were seen clinically.

Non-clinical  data  revealed  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  studies  of  genotoxicity  or carcinogenic potential.

Retigabine had no effect on fertility or general reproductive performance. However the plasma levels achieved in the reproductive toxicity studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses due to maternal toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It  is  considered  problematic  that  retigabine  has  not  been  characterized  with  respect  to  toxicity  to reproduction especially considering that it is a first-in-class compound. However, the problem cannot be  resolved  non-clinically  as  higher  exposure  in  the  animals  cannot  be  achieved  due  to  maternal toxicity.  Epilepsy  with  partial  onset  seizures  is  a  prevalent  disease  (around  0.45%  of  the  European population) and women of child-bearing potential will undergo long-term treatment. As the risk from using  retigabine  during  pregnancy  could  not  be  excluded,  a  strict  recommendation  for  not  using retigabine in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential not using contraception has been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC.

The environmental risk assessment that was provided is considered insufficient  and  a  fully  updated ERA should be provided within 1 year of approval of the present application.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

In  general,  the  non-clinical  properties  of  Trobalt  have  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the requirements to support this application.

<!-- image -->

The study was conducted as a single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose crossover study in healthy  male  subjects  (n=12),  three  single  doses  of  retigabine  were  administered  under  fasting conditions with a washout period of at least 5 days between treatments: 50 mg retigabine as an IV infusion over 15 minutes, 200 mg retigabine as 2 × 100 mg IR capsules orally with 200 mL of tap water; or, 80 mg of retigabine diluted in 180 mL of apple juice.

2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics The Applicant has submitted an application for a dose starting on 300 mg daily with increasing doses optimized to an effective dose between 600 to 1200 mg/day. However, nearly all studies conducted in order to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of retigabine used much lower doses. The analytical methods, the pharmacokinetic data analysis, and the statistical analysis on which this application is based have been evaluated according to best standard and were well described. Absorption · Bioavailability In Study 3065A1-123, the absolute bioavailability of retigabine administered as an oral solution and as oral immediate release (IR) capsules were determined. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Serial blood samples for determining retigabine concentrations were obtained from each subject up to 48  hours  after  the  end  of  the  15  minute  IV  infusion  of  retigabine  and  up  to  72  hours  post-dose following oral administration of retigabine.

Plasma concentrations of retigabine increased rapidly with a Cmax being achieved at a median Tmax of approximately 0.5 h. The t1/2 values were similar for the oral and IV dosage forms (7.2-9.4 h). The absolute  bioavailability  (Fabs)  of  both  the  oral  solution  and  the  IR  capsule  of  retigabine  were approximately  60%  and  the  relative  bioavailability  (Frel)  of  the  capsules  versus  oral  solution  was approximately 100%, indicating that absorption of a solid dosage form of retigabine administrated as an oral IR capsule appears complete relative to solution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion,  Retigabine  was  rapidly  absorbed  following  oral  administration  with  the  absolute bioavailability of retigabine from both the oral solution and the IR capsule being approximately 60%. The similar bioavailability of retigabine for the IR capsule and the solution suggests that retigabine was fully released from the capsule.

## · Bioequivalence

The following formulations were used in clinical studies:

- Retigabine Capsules. IR capsules (formulated in 4 strengths, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg) were used in the early Phase I and II studies, including the pivotal Phase IIb Study 205.
- Clinical Trials IR Tablets. The Clinical Trials IR tablets (50, 100 and 300mg tablets) were used in the pivotal Phase III studies (Studies 301 and 302) and for Phase I clinical pharmacokinetic and clinical pharmacology studies that were conducted after initiation of the Phase III program. The  Clinical  Trial  IR  tablets  had  the  same  tablet  core  composition  as  the  initial  tablet formulation with minor changes in the tablet coating to enhance the stability of the product.

Studies  investigating  the  bioequivalence  between  the  market  image  tablets  and  the  clinical  trial  IR tablets  showed  bioequivalence  with  regard  to  AUC,  but  only  Study  RTG113287  demonstrated bioequivalence for Cmax. As the better powered study showed robust equivalence, it was agreed by the Committee that bioequivalence had been established between the clinical trial IR and the market image tablets.

· The Final Market Image IR Tablets were developed using an identical tablet core composition as was used for the Clinical Trials IR tablets, with minor changes in appearance and coating. An Initial Immediate Release Tablet (200 mg) was also formulated but was not used in any safety or efficacy studies in patients with epilepsy. Bioequivalence of the 200 mg initial IR tablet versus the 200 mg capsule formulation under fasting conditions  was  shown  in  Study  3065A1-110.  The  geometric  mean  ratios  of  Cmax  and  AUC  were approximately  100%  when  the  1x 200 mg  tablet  was  compared  to  1x  200 mg  capsule  and  the corresponding 90% CI were all within the equivalence limits of 80-125%. Two studies were conducted to bridge between the highest intended commercial tablet strength (400 mg) and the lower strength tablets (50 and 300mg) used in the Phase III clinical trials. Study VRX-RET-E22-105 showed that the retigabine market image tablet was equivalent to the clinical trial tablet on the basis of overall systemic exposure (AUC), but not Cmax.  The upper end of the 90% confidence  interval  (133%)  for  the  peak  concentration  (Cmax)  exceeded  the  traditional  acceptance range for equivalence (125%) and the geometric mean of the market image tablet was 16% higher than that of the clinical trial tablet. This 16% higher Cmax appeared to be driven by individuals with low Cmax values for clinical trial tablets rather than high Cmax values for the market image tablet. The clinical trial IR tablets used for this study were from a batch with the largest particle size of all active  substance  batches  that  were  used  in  the  phase  III  trials  and  it  was  considered  that  the difference in particle size could explained the difference in Cmax that was observed. In addition, it was acknowledge that this study was underpowered. Study RTG113287 was completed after the submission of the application and submitted at D121 of the procedure. This study showed bioequivalence between the market image IR tablet and the clinical trial IR  tablet  since  the  90%  confidence  intervals  for  AUC  and  Cmax  values  were  completely  contained within the range 0.80 to 1.25. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No  bioequivalence  studies  linking  the  formulations  used  in  the  clinical  development  program  were provided.  This  was  justified  by  the  Applicant  by  the  fact  that  the  only  difference  between  the  two formulations was a minor change to the tablet coating.

## · Influence of food

The effect of administration of retigabine IR capsules with a high fat breakfast on the rate and extent of retigabine absorption was investigated in Study 3065A1-106

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of this study showed that administration of retigabine capsules with a high fat breakfast had no significant effects on the AUC or Cmax values of retigabine relative to dosing in a fasted state. However, there was a delay in the median time to reach Cmax by approximately 2.75 h.

The effect of a high fat breakfast on the rate and extent of absorption of retigabine from the initial IR tablet was investigated in Study 3065A1-110.  Administration of the initial tablet formulation with a high  fat  meal  had  no  marked  effects  on  the  AUC.  However  Cmax  was  increased  by  14%  when retigabine was administered with a high fat meal relative to dosing in a fasted state.

In Study VRX-RET-E22-104, the effect of a high fat breakfast on the rate and extent of absorption of retigabine  from  the  Market  Image  IR  tablet  was  investigated.  This  study  showed  that  food  did  not affect  the  extent  of  oral  absorption  of  retigabine  from  the  market  image  tablets,  but  did  result  in  a 38% higher Cmax.

In those three clinical studies, food did not influence the extent of absorption of the active substance. However,  food  increased  the  Cmax  of  the  market  image  tablets  by  38%  compared  to  only  a  14% increase for the clinical trial tablets. It was considered that the lower inter-subject variability under fed conditions may be due to delayed gastric emptying.

## Distribution

The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of retigabine was 2-3 L/Kg after IV administration (dose range: 1-50 mg) (Study 3065A1-117).

Retigabine binding to both human plasma proteins and human serum albumin was about 80%. Thus, the drug is essentially bound only to albumin. Binding was not concentration-dependent over a range 0.1 - 8 µg/mL for HSA and 0.1-2 µg/mL for human plasma proteins. Due to the relatively low binding, no relevant increase in free concentration is expected as a result of interactions with other drugs.

## Metabolism and Elimination

Study  3065A1-108  was  an  open-label,  non-randomized  single-dose  study  conducted  in  order  to characterize the mass balance, route of elimination and metabolic pathways of retigabine after single dosing.

Six healthy male subjects were enrolled and received a single oral dose of retigabine 200 mg (200 µCi [14C]-retigabine) following an overnight fast. All enrolled subjects completed the study.

Retigabine  metabolic  pathways  were  primarily  formation  of  the  N-acetyl  metabolite  of  retigabine (NAMR), and N-glucuronidation of both retigabine and NAMR. In addition, a small amount of an Nglucoside  of  retigabine  was  observed  as  was  a  cyclised  product  derived  from  NAMR.  There  was  no evidence  of  oxidative  metabolism  of  retigabine.    Retigabine  or  retigabine  radio-equivalents  did  not partition preferentially into the whole blood constituents and there was no evidence for a retigabine metabolite that would be expected to accumulate to a greater degree than parent itself.

Blood,  urine  and  fecal  samples  were  collected  up  to  240 hours  post-dose  in  order  to  assess  the metabolic profile and the amount of drug related material that was excreted.

Comparison of plasma total [14C]-retigabine-derived radioactivity versus concentrations of retigabine and N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine (NAMR) indicated that the majority of plasma radioactivity was attributable to a retigabine metabolite other than NAMR at all sampling time. T1/2 values for retigabine (9h),  NAMR  (11h)  and  total  radioactivity  (8.5h)  were  similar  indicating  that  none  of  the  retigabine metabolites would be expected to accumulate to a greater extent than retigabine.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  plasma  concentration  time  curves  for  both  14C-retigabine-derived  radioactivity  and  unchanged drug showed a secondary plasma peak in all subjects, which indicates hepato-biliary re-circulation. The major metabolite identified was N-glucuronide. The secondary peak of retigabine is in agreement with the observation that glucuronide deconjugation may occur in the intestine.

The  whole  blood-to-plasma  ratio  for  the  radioactivity  ranged  from  0.55  to  0.68  indicating  that retigabine did not significantly partition into cellular components of blood.

Data  showed  that  retigabine  and  its  metabolites  were  almost  exclusively  excreted  with  the  urine: following oral administration of 14C-retigabine (200 mg), 84% of administered radioactivity dose was recovered in the urine (13.5% recovered in the faeces). The main retigabine-related compounds found in the urine were the unchanged drug (36% of the administered dose), the N-glucuronide M1 (17% of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  administered  dose)  and  the  acetyl  metabolite  M2  (18%  of  the  administered  dose).  The  mean recovery was 97.9% ± 4.8% after 240 h. Elimination was rather fast, 70% of the dose being excreted within 24 h and the majority (93%) of the dose within 72 h.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

## · Dose proportionality

After  IV  dosing  of  retigabine  (1,  2.5,  5,  10,  25  or  50 mg)  as  a  15 minute  IV  infusion  dose proportionality was demonstrated within the rage of 2.5-50 mg. The single oral dose pharmacokinetics of  retigabine was dose-proportional over the dose range 25 mg to 600 mg.  Retigabine was rapidly absorbed and elimination values were typically with t½ around 10 hours.

Retigabine pharmacokinetics was dose-proportional after both single and repeated doses of 50-200 mg BID  and  over  a  single  oral  dose  range  of  100  to  300  mg  and  a  multiple  twice-daily  dose  range  of 100 to 350 mg BID.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the systemic exposure to retigabine was linear over the therapeutic dose range of 600 to 1200 mg /day.

## · Time dependency

The accumulation of retigabine was shown to be moderately low with the BID regimens and there was no evidence for a time-dependency in retigabine PK indicating that retigabine did not induce or inhibit its own metabolism.

## Pharmacokinetics in target population

Studies evaluating the multiple-dose PK of retigabine in epileptic patients with therapeutically resistant partial-onset seizures showed that retigabine PK were dose-proportional in patients with epilepsy over a  50  mg  BID  to  200  mg  BID  dose  range.  Retigabine  PK  parameters  in  patients  with  epilepsy  were similar to respective values in healthy subjects.

## Special populations

## · Impaired renal function

Thirty-one subjects were enrolled in an open-label single-dose, parallel-group study conducted in order to evaluate the effects of renal insufficiency on the PK of retigabine and NAMR after a single oral 100mg dose of retigabine. The subjects were assigned into the different treatment groups based on their creatinine clearance (CLcr).

Retigabine AUC values in subjects with mild renal dysfunction were approximately 30% higher than respective values in healthy subjects, and retigabine AUC values in subjects with moderate or severe renal  dysfunction  or  ESRD  were  approximately  100%  greater  than  respective  values  in  healthy subjects.  Similar results were observed with NAMR AUC parameters across the groups, although the effects observed with NAMR were more marked than those observed with retigabine.  Both retigabine and NAMR t1/2 values increased with increasing degree of renal dysfunction.   As expected, the renal clearance (CLR) of both retigabine and NAMR decreased with the decreasing renal function.  However, percent of dose excreted as retigabine or as NAMR was not markedly different among the groups, with the exception of a reduced percentage of retigabine excreted unchanged in subjects with severe renal impairment.  The effect of renal function on retigabine and NAMR PK was considered to reflect a direct effect of these analytes on the urinary elimination.

It was concluded that retigabine pharmacokinetics was dependent on renal function.

The  Applicant  maintained  that  the  effect  of  mild  renal  impairment  on  retigabine  AUC  was  not considered clinically significant, and therefore no adjustment of the Trobalt dose was necessary.

To  support  this  opinion,  the  Applicant  performed  a  simulation  to  compare  Cmax  and  AUC(0-24)  at steady-state obtained with:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1) the current dosing recommendation (no dose adjustment in patients with mild renal impairment; a 50%  reduction  in  the  initial  and  maintenance  dose  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal impairment);

- 2) reduced unit dose of retigabine (one-half of the current starting dose for mild impairment);

3)  a  reduced  frequency  in  dosing  (BID  instead  of  TID).  A  BID  dosing  regimen  was  also  applied  to subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment.

In  subjects  with  mild  renal  impairment,  a  BID  dosing  regimen  was  predicted  to  provide  a  systemic exposure  more  consistent  with  that  observed  for  healthy  subjects,  with  respect  to  the  current recommendations.

However, as a BID regimen might cause confusion among the prescribers since the TID regimen is the standard for all other patient groups, it was agreed by the CHMP that the pharmacokinetic advantage was not considered to outweigh this drawback and that the TID regimen for subjects with mild renal impairment  should  be  maintained.  Consequently,  no  adjustment  of  the  dose  was  recommended  in patients with mild renal impairment.

No retigabine dose adjustment was considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment but a 50% decrease in the initial and maintenance doses of retigabine was recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Those recommendations are reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

In  subjects  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment,  the  predicted  exposure  with  the  current recommendations (50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose) was only slightly higher than the predicted exposure in subjects with normal renal function. On the other hand, a reduced frequency resulted  in  a ∼ 50%  increased  exposure,  as  compared  to  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  The recommendation  to  have  a  50%  decrease  in  the  initial  and  maintenance  dose  of  retigabine  was confirmed. The information on the effect of haemodialysis on the clearance of retigabine was very limited as only 6 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requiring haemodialysis were included in the study. The Applicant committed  in the Risk Management  Plan  to further investigate the effect of haemodialysis on the clearance of retigabine. · Impaired hepatic function Twenty-four subjects were enrolled in an open-label, single-dose, and parallel-group study conducted in order to evaluate the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of retigabine and NAMR after a single oral  100-mg  dose  of  retigabine.  The  subjects  were  assigned  into  the  following  treatment  groups: subjects  with  normal  liver  function  (n=6),  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (n=6),  moderate  hepatic impairment (n=6) and severe hepatic impairment (n=6). The PK characteristics of both retigabine and NAMR were dependent on hepatic function. Retigabine AUC parameters in subjects with mild hepatic impairment were similar to respective values in healthy subjects, but retigabine AUC parameters were approximately 50% and 100% greater in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, respectively, than AUC parameters in healthy subjects.  Both retigabine  CL/F  and  retigabine  CLR  were  similar  in  healthy  subjects  and  subjects  with  mild  hepatic dysfunction, but were decreased in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction.  There were no  consistent  trends  in  retigabine  Cmax  values  or  retigabine  t1/2  values  across  the  study  groups. There were no trends in NAMR PK parameters with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction relative to respective parameters in subjects with normal hepatic function.

An open-label, single- and multiple-dose, parallel-group study was conducted to investigate the impact of  frequently  occurring  genetic  polymorphisms  of  UGT1A1  (Gilbert's  Syndrome)  and  NAT2  (slow acetylators) on the PK of retigabine and NAMR, and its main metabolites (glucuronidation products and NAMR), and to investigate the effect of retigabine treatment on serum bilirubin concentrations. This study  showed  that  UGT1A1  or  NAT2  genotype  had  no  effect  on  retigabine  pharmacokinetics.  No retigabine dose adjustments were considered necessary on the basis of UGT1A1 or NAT2 genotype.

## · Gender

The  results  of  a  single  dose  study  showed  that  in  young  adult  volunteers,  retigabine  Cmax  was approximately 65% higher in females than in males, and in elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

retigabine  Cmax  was  approximately  75% higher  in  females  compared  with  males.  When  Cmax  was normalized for weight, the values were approximately 30% higher in young females than in males and 40% higher  in  elderly  females  compared  with  males.  However,  there  was  no  apparent  gender difference  in  weight-normalized  clearance,  and  since  retigabine  is  titrated  according  to  individual patient  response  and  tolerability,  dose-adjustments  were  not  considered  necessary  on  the  basis  of gender.

## · Race

A  meta-analysis  conducted  to  compare  retigabine  CL/F  parameters  between  healthy  Black  and Caucasian  subjects  using  relevant  data  combined  from  6  single-dose  clinical  pharmacology  studies, demonstrated a 20% reduction in retigabine clearance in healthy black volunteers relative to healthy Caucasian volunteers. Given the modest difference in retigabine PK in Black subjects, and considering that  retigabine  is  titrated  in  each  patient  on  the  basis  of  efficacy  and  tolerability,  retigabine  dose adjustments in Black subjects were not considered necessary.

## · Elderly

In  a  single-dose  study,  it  was  shown  that  retigabine  was  eliminated  more  slowly  by  healthy  elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age) than by healthy young adult volunteers, resulting in a higher AUC (approximately 40 to 50%). Half-life was ~30% longer in elderly compared to young subjects across males and females. Elderly subjects were shown to have an approximate 30% lower weight-normalised CL/F than young subjects.

A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of RTG was therefore considered necessary in elderly patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC). It was recommended to have a total daily starting dose at 150 mg/day and to increase the total daily dose by a maximum of 150 mg every week during the titration period, depending on the individual patient response and tolerability.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## · In vitro

In-vitro studies using human liver microsomes revealed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the major CYP isoenzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5 (D-23129/9321030009).  In addition, retigabine and NAMR did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4/5 in human primary hepatocytes. It was considered unlikely for RTG to have P450 mediated drug-drug  interactions.  Interaction  of  RTG  with  the  oral  absorption  of  other  drugs  P-gp  substrates when co-administered was not anticipated

Retigabine binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and plasma proteins was low and did not exceed 80% in in vitro ultracentrifugation studies.

## · In vivo

## Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs):

Lamotrigine/retigabine  interaction  study:  No  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of retigabine was shown. However, the dose of lamotrigine was subtherapeutic. Conversely, there was no clinically significant effect of retigabine on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine, but the retigabine dose was at the lower end of the therapeutic range.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Phenobarbital/retigabine  interaction  study:  No  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of retigabine was shown. However, the dose of phenobarbital was at the low end of the therapeutic range. Conversely,  there  was  no  clinically  significant  effect  of  retigabine  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of phenobarbital, but again the retigabine dose was at the lower end of the therapeutic range.

Based  on  two  phase  II  studies,  an  exploratory  analysis  of  the  impact  of  the  co-administration  of phenytoin,  carbamazepine,  valproic  acid  and  topiramate  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  retigabine  was conducted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  analysis  indicated  that  co-administration  of  valproic  acid  (750-1500  mg/day)  (n=4)  and topiramate (250 - 1200 mg/day) (n=5) had no impact on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine whereas carbamazepine (600 - 2400 mg/day) (n=8) and phenytoin (120 - 600 mg/day) (n=9) increased oral clearance of retigabine by approximately 27% and 36%, respectively. The results from this analysis should be treated with caution since the recommended ANOVA approach was not used and the analysis was based on a limited number of subjects.

A  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  the  effect  of  other  AEDs  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of retigabine  was  performed.  This  analysis  was  based  on  the  pivotal  clinical  trials.  Since  the  point estimate for the fractional change in retigabine clearance for each AED was less than 10% ad the outer end of the 95% confidence intervals was less than 12%, no clinically significant effects of the following AEDs  on  retigabine  pharmacokinetics  were  identified:  carbamazepine,  lamotrigine,  levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate and valproate.

However, even though the analysis failed to identify a clinically significant effect of inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) on retigabine clearance, it should be noted that steady-state data from limited number of patients in smaller phase II studies indicated that:

-phenytoin can reduce retigabine AUC by 35%, ad increase retigabine clearance by 36%; -carbamazepine can reduce retigabine AUC by 33%, and increase retigabine clearance by 27%. An  integrated  analysis  of  the  impact  of  retigabine  on  trough  concentration  of  existing  AEDs  was performed based on the phase III studies 301 and 302. Retigabine did not result in clinically significant effects  on  the  plasma  trough  concentrations  of  the  following  AEDs:  carbamazepine,  clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate and zonisamide. The largest effect was on lamotrigine phamacokinetics  where  retigabine  co-administration  was  associated  with  a  20%  decreased  in lamotrigine concentrations. It was not considered necessary by the CHMP to warrant dose adjustments when of retigabine when co-administered with other AEDs. Oral contraceptive steroid: There was no evidence for induction of oral contraceptive steroid metabolism following a repeat-dose retigabine 250 mg TID regimen.  Therefore, oral contraceptive products can be co-administered with retigabine  250 mg  TID  without  compromising  the  oral  contraceptive  agent  safety  and  efficacy. Conversely,  there  was  no  effect  of  norethindrone/ethinyl  estradiol  (1 mg/0.035 mg)  daily  dosing  on retigabine pharmacokinetics. Ethanol: AUC and Cmax value were 23% and 37% higher, respectively, during coadministration with ethanol relative to administration of retigabine alone.  The AUC and Cmax of ethanol were essentially identical with and without retigabine co-administration. Co-administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) with retigabine (200 mg) resulted in an increase in visual blurring in healthy volunteers. This has been reflected in the SmPC. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Mechanism of action

Retigabine has a novel mechanism of action for a potential antiepileptic drug. The antiepileptic activity is believed to be mediated through retigabine's ability to enhance the K+ current mediated by human KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 K+ channels. A further contribution to retigabine's antiepileptic  activity  may  be through its ability to augment gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated neurotransmission.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Due to the lack of  relevant  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  with  regards  to  epilepsy,  no  pharmacology study addressing efficacy endpoints has been performed in humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis of the relationship between plasma concentrations and efficacy or safety showed that there is poor correlation between exposure and response using the responder/non responder approach. On the other hand, there was a rather good correlation between exposure and occurrence of AEs.

The effect of retigabine on QT was assessed trough a phase I QTc study in healthy subjects (Study VRX-RET-E22-103) and a population PK/PD analysis based on QT data acquired from both the phase I QTc study and the Phase III clinical studies.

Study 103 was a double-blind (except for the use of moxifloxacin), randomized, 3-arm parallel-group study, investigated the effect of retigabine at a maximum tolerated dose on QT interval corrected for heart  rate  (QTc)  in  healthy  men  and  women,  as  compared  with  placebo  and  the  positive  control, moxifloxacin. It was conducted to determine whether retigabine had a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarisation, as detected by QT prolongation. The assessment of the data from the overall retigabine  group  showed  no  apparent  effect;  however,  analysis  of  the  completer  population  (those subjects who achieved the dose of 1200mg/day) indicated a slight and transient QT-prolonging effect (upper 95% CI greater than 10msec, but less than 13msec, and mean values less than 7msec) within 3 hours of dosing in healthy volunteers titrated to 1200mg/day.

According  to  the  Applicant,  the  clinical  trial  IR  tablets  and  the  initial  IR  tablets  can  be  considered bioequivalent since the core tablet composition is the same, and the only difference between the two formulations was a minor change to the tablet coating. However, the Applicant has not convincingly demonstrated that the difference in tablet coating was non-significant with regard to bioavailability. Also, other quality attributes (particle size) may have been different between the two formulations.

A post  hoc evaluation  of  the  95%  CIs  for  the  ORs  and  RRs  for  exceeding  ICH-E14  thresholds  for absolute QT intervals and changes from baseline (Bazett's and Frederica's corrected values) indicated that there were no significant association between QTc and retigabine overall.  However, the post hoc analyses for individual retigabine doses indicated that patients who received a 1200 mg/day dose of retigabine  were  significantly  associated  with  a  Bazett's  QTc  interval  increase  from  baseline  of  &gt;30 msec although the data for the corresponding Frederica's QTc interval increase from baseline of &gt;30 msec did not indicate an association with the 1200mg/day dose of retigabine. A  detailed  ECG  safety  evaluation  was  also  conducted  during  the  retigabine  epilepsy  development programme  to  fully  evaluate  the  effect  of  retigabine  on  the  QT  interval,  and  the  data  did  not demonstrate a substantial effect on cardiac conduction across the 600 mg/day to 1200 mg/day dose range.  In particular, no patients treated with retigabine experienced a QT interval of greater than 480 msec or reported adverse events related to QT prolongation. The  overall  assessment  of  the  data  showed  no  apparent  effect  on  cardiac  repolarisation.  However, analysis of the complete population indicated that a small effect of retigabine on cardiac repolarisation could  not  be  excluded.  Caution  was  therefore  recommended  with  Trobalt  when  prescribed  with medicinal products known to increase QT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years of age and above. In these patients an electrocardiogram (ECG) should  be  recorded  before  initiation  of  treatment  with  Trobalt  and  in  those  with  a  corrected  QT interval &gt;440ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology There was no direct bioequivalence link from the capsules used in the phase II study and the clinical trial IR tablets used in the two phase III trials. The Applicant has shown that the phase II capsule was bioequivalent with the initial IR tablet but this tablet was not used in any efficacy and safety study in epilepsy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Two studies investigating the bioequivalence between the market image tablets and the clinical trial IR tablets have been conducted. Both of them showed bioequivalence with regards to AUC, but only one of these studies demonstrated bioequivalence for Cmax. As the better powered study showed robust equivalence, it was agreed by the Committee that bioequivalence had been established between the clinical trial IR and the market image tablets.

In a food interaction study, food increased the Cmax of the market image tablets by 38%. This is to be compared to only a 14% increase for the clinical tablets. The Applicant has provided a comprehensive overview of the biopharmaceutical properties of retigabine and how these may influence the impact of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

food. The explanation that the higher Cmax and the lower intra-subject variability under fed conditions may be due to delayed gastric emptying was considered to be plausible by the CHMP.

Further,  it  was  agreed  that  in  the  fasted  state  incomplete  dissolution  of  the  market  image  400  mg tablet strength may have resulted in a more pronounced apparent food effect with respect to Cmax compared to the smaller 200 mg initial IR tablet. This hypothesis was supported by the Cmax data of a single-dose  ascending  study  (Study  3065A1-101)  conducted  in  the  fasted  state.  It  was  also  agreed that the study VRX-RET-E22-104 may have overestimated the food effect for the lower strengths of the market image tablet which would be used for 600 and 900 mg/day doses.

Simulations of Cmax under fasted and fed conditions at steady state conditions following a retigabine TID  regimen  with  the  market  image  tablet  formulation  has  been  provided.  It  is  predicted  that  the fed:fasted  ratio  for  Cmax  is  reduced  from  1.38  after  single  dose  to  1.14  (90%  CI  1.03  -  1.26)  at steady state.

Based on the proposed mechanism for the food effect, administration with food could reduce intraindividual variability. However, the potential advantage arising from reducing the variability in Cmax assuming  the  drug  with  a  meal  are  outweighed  by  the  disadvantages  arising  from  uneven  dosing intervals and lower flexibility for individualised dosing.

In  clinical  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies,  retigabine  did  not  result  in  clinically  significant effects  on  the  plasma  trough  concentrations  of  the  following  AEDs:  carbamazepine,  clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate and zonisamide. The largest effect was on lamotrigine phamacokinetics  where  retigabine  co-administration  was  associated  with  a  20%  decreased  in lamotrigine concentrations. Dose adjustments of retigabine were therefore not considered necessary when co-administered with other AEDs.

After  both  single  and  multiple  oral  doses,  retigabine  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  median  tmax  values generally between 0.5 and 2 hours. Absolute oral bioavailability of retigabine relative to an intravenous dose is approximately 60%. Administration of retigabine with a high fat meal resulted in no change in the  overall  extent  of  retigabine  absorption,  but  food  reduced  the  between-subject  variability  in  C max (23%) compared to the fasted state (41%), and led to an increase in Cmax (38%).  The effect of food on Cmax under usual clinical conditions is not expected to be clinically relevant.  Therefore Trobalt may be taken with or without food. Retigabine  was  approximately 80% bound to plasma protein over the concentration range of 0.1 to 2 µg/ml. The steady state volume of distribution of retigabine was 2 to 3 l/kg following intravenous dosing. Retigabine was extensively metabolised in humans. A substantial fraction of the retigabine dose was converted  to  inactive  N-glucuronides.  Retigabine  was  also  metabolised  to  an  N-acetyl  metabolite (NAMR) that is also subsequently glucuronidated. There was no evidence for hepatic oxidative metabolism of retigabine or NAMR by cytochrome P450 enzymes.  Therefore co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes was considered unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of retigabine or NAMR. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1  and  CYP3A4/5).    In  addition,  retigabine  and  NAMR  did  not  induce  CYP1A2  or  CYP3A4/5  in human primary hepatocytes. Therefore retigabine was considered unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics  of  substrates  of  the  major  cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes  through  inhibition  or induction mechanisms.

Elimination of retigabine occurs via a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A total of approximately 84% of the dose was recovered in the urine, including the N-acetyl metabolite (18%), N-glucuronides of the parent active substance and of the N-acetyl metabolite (24%), or parent active substance (36%). Only 14% of retigabine was excreted in the faeces. Retigabine has a plasma half-life of  approximately  6 to 10 hours.  The  total  clearance  of  retigabine  from  plasma  following  intravenous dosing is typically 0.4 to 0.6 l/h/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Retigabine  pharmacokinetics  were  essentially  linear  over  the  single  dose  range  of  25 to 600 mg  in healthy volunteers and  up  to  1,200 mg  daily  in patients with  epilepsy,  with  no  unexpected accumulation following repeated administration.

Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and the Applicant committed to further investigate the effect of haemodialysis on the clearance of retigabine as part of the Risk Management Plan.

Since retigabine is titrated according to individual patient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on the basis of body weight.

A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients.

The pharmacokinetics of retigabine in children and adolescents have not been investigated.

No  clinically  significant  ECG  morphology  changes  were  noted  for  retigabine.  No  gender-related difference in QTc was noted for retigabine. Analysis of the complete population indicated that a small effect of retigabine on cardiac repolarisation could not be excluded. Caution is therefore recommended with Trobalt when prescribed with medicinal products known to increase QT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years of age and above. In these patients  an  electrocardiogram  should  be  recorded  before  initiation  of  treatment  with  Trobalt  and  in those with a corrected QT interval &gt;440ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. As  part  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan,  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  a  programme  of  enhanced pharmacovigilance, as well as its routine proactive pharmacovigilance to allow a more precise definition of the true level of risk of QT prolongation and sequelae and consequently permit the retigabine SmPC to be updated with appropriate guidance, if more information becomes available. 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology Overall, the pharmacology data submitted were considered satisfactory. 2.5. Clinical efficacy The clinical studies supporting efficacy are summarised in the table below. Overall, 1244 patients were randomized to treatment in the primary efficacy studies (Studies 205, 301 and 302). A total of 813 patients received retigabine in doses of 600, 900 or 1200 mg/day in the three randomized, controlled trials for 16 to 18 weeks and 427 patients received placebo.

## 2.5.1. Dose response studies and main clinical studies

Three controlled studies in patients with partial-onset epilepsy, which is the topic of this application, were conducted: A Phase 2b study conducted by Wyeth, Study 205 and two Phase 3 studies conducted by  Valeant,  Study  301  and  Study  302.  All  three  primary  efficacy  studies  were  international,  multicentre, parallel-group randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Study 205 was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 600 mg/day (200 mg TID), 900 mg/day (300 mg TID), and 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) compared with placebo. In addition to assessment of safety/efficacy,  Study  205  provides  the  primary  dose-response  data  in  the  clinical  development program.

Studies 301 and 302 were conducted by Valeant. Study 301 included assessment of retigabine (1200 mg/day;  400 mg TID) compared  with placebo. Study 302 included assessment of retigabine 900 mg/day (300 mg TID) and retigabine 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) compared with placebo.

## Study 205

Three pivotal studies were conducted, as shown in the table below. Outline of Pivotal Efficacy Studies 205, 301 and 302 Methods Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study  205  (3065  A1-205)  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter,  doseranging study of retigabine (600, 900 and 1200 mg/day) in patients (age 16 to 70 years) with partialonset seizures. The study consisted of four phases: an 8-week prospective Baseline Phase during which patients  were  evaluated  for  seizure  frequency,  an  8-week  Titration  Phase  to  the  final  targeted randomized  dose  and  an  8-week  Maintenance  Phase  during  which  patients  received  a  fixed  dose regimen (Figure 1).

Both  studies  included  an  8-week  Baseline  Phase  during  which  patients  were  evaluated  for  seizure frequency,  followed  by  a  Titration  Phase  during  which  the  retigabine  dose  was  increased  by  150 mg/week (50 mg TID) [up to 4 weeks in Study 302 and 6 weeks in Study 301].  At the end of the titration period, patients were maintained on a fixed dose for a 12-week Maintenance Period (Figure 2 and Figure 3).

The actual duration of the maintenance phase depended on the dose: 600 mg/d: 2 weeks titration and 14 weeks maintenance; 900 mg/d: 4 weeks titration and 12 weeks maintenance; 1200 mg/d: 6 weeks titration and 10 weeks maintenance; this latter scheme, thus, did not reach the full length recommended in the CHMP advice. After  completing  the  double-blind  phase,  patients  could  enrol  in  a  long  term,  open-label,  extension study (Study 3065 A1-212), after a 5-week interim phase of dose adjustment. Patients  who  completed  the  double-blind  study  and  who  opted  not  to  continue  into  the  open-label extension study were discontinued from treatment by gradual down titration of study medication, over a 3-week period. Study 301 and 302: Studies 301 and 302 were similarly designed Phase 3 studies for assessing the efficacy and safety of retigabine (tablets) in patients with refractory partial epilepsy.  Both were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel-group studies with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study  301  included  assessment  of  retigabine  (1200  mg/day;  400 mg TID)  compared  with  placebo. Study 302 included assessment of retigabine 900 mg/day (300 mg TID) and retigabine 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) compared with placebo. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  only  exception  was  that  in  Study  301  patients  had  a  single  opportunity  to  down  titrate  to 1050 mg/day  at  the  end  of  Week  7,  if  they  were  unable  to  tolerate  the  targeted  retigabine  dose (1200 mg/day). Patients who down-titrated were then to continue at 1050 mg/day for the remainder of the maintenance period.  Efficacy data were reported based on the assigned randomized dose and not on the actual dose received.

After  completing  the  double-blind  phase,  patients  could  enrol  in  a  long  term,  open-label,  extension study  (Study  303  for  Study  301  and  Study  304  for  Study  302)  after  a  transition  phase  of  dose adjustment.    In  Study  301,  this  was  a  6-week  double-blind  transition  phase  during  which  patients already  randomized  to  retigabine  1200 mg/day  were  maintained  on  this  dose  level  and  patients previously on placebo during the double-blind phase, were dose escalated to retigabine 1200 mg/day in  a  double-blind,  double-dummy manner.  In Study 302, this was a 4-week double-blind transition phase during which patients already randomized to retigabine 900 mg/day  were maintained on this dose level and patients previously on placebo or retigabine 600 mg/day during the double-blind phase, were  dose  escalated  to  retigabine  900 mg/day  in  a  double-blind,  double-dummy  manner.  In  both

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies patients could be down-titrated off blinded treatment over 3 weeks, either if they chose not to continue into the open-label extension study, or if they were unable to complete the transition phase.

## · Study Participants

All three primary efficacy studies recruited patients with partial onset seizures (simple partial seizures and/or  complex  partial  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalization)  in  accordance  with  the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification criteria (Commission, 1981). Patients with simple partial seizures as their only qualifying seizure type were only eligible for study participation if there  was  a  motor  component  to  their  seizures.  The  patient  population  in  the  three  studies  was described according to clearly defined clinical criteria.

In the Phase 2b study (Study 205) patients were eligible if:

- They were receiving up to two pre-specified AEDs at stable doses for at least 1 month prior to screening:  valproic  acid,  carbamazepine,  phenytoin,  topiramate,  lamotrigine,  gabapentin, oxcarbazepine,  benzodiazepines,  or  barbiturates.    Vagal  nerve  stimulation  (VNS),  where applicable,  was  included  as  an  AED  therapy.  Vigabatrin,  felbamate  and  tiagabine  were  not allowed;

· They had at least four seizures per 28 days during the 8-week prospective baseline period; · They were not seizure-free for more than 30 days during the baseline period. In contrast, patients recruited in the Phase 3 studies (Studies 301 and 302) were only eligible if: · They had a diagnosis of epilepsy for ≥ 2 years. · They had previously received treatment with at least two AEDs, concurrently or sequentially, without significant clinical benefit (in the opinion of the investigator): o patients could be receiving up to three AEDs at stable doses (with or without VNS), at least 1 month prior to screening and throughout the study treatment period o vigabatrin and felbamate were not allowed; · They had at least four seizures per 28 days during the 8-week prospective baseline period; · They were not seizure-free for more than 21 days during the baseline period. Supplementary VNS was allowed in all studies if the regimen had been initiated at least 6 months prior to study enrolment and treatment parameters were maintained constant for at least 1 month prior to screening and for the duration of the study. Pre-specified restricted use of benzodiazepines to control flurries was allowed in the Phase 3 studies; use of benzodiazepines as background AEDs was permitted in the Phase 2 study as long as the dose was  kept  constant  for  at  least  1  month  before  screening  and  for  the  duration  of  treatment. Benzodiazepine use as rescue or as last resort to control flurries was also permitted according to predefined criteria in this study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Prohibited medications across all three studies included agents known to lower seizure threshold e.g., neuroleptics.

Study  205  included  subjects  aged  between  16  and  70  years  old,  whereas  studies  301  and  302 recruited subjects aged between 18 and 75.

Enrolment  criteria  excluded  patients  with  significant  medical  conditions  including  those  that  would confound assessment of efficacy.  Patients were excluded from study participation if they had a history of  status  epilepticus,  seizure  clusters  or  flurries  within  the  12  months  prior  to  study  entry,  pseudoseizures,  non-epileptic  events  or  any  type  of  psychogenic  seizures.    Evidence  of  progressive  central nervous  system  (CNS)  disease  (e.g.,  CNS  lupus,  tumors,  multiple  sclerosis,  Alzheimer's)  lesion  or encephalopathy also precluded eligibility for study entry.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Treatments

Study 205 assessed the following dosages of retigabine (capsules): 600 mg/d (200 mg TID), 900 mg (300 mg TID), and 1200 mg/d (400 mg TID).

Study  301 assessed the following dosage of retigabine (tablets): 1200 mg/d (400 mg TID). In this trial patients were allowed to down titrate the daily dosage to 1050 mg/d if unable to tolerate the full 1200 mg/d dose.

Study  302 assessed the following dosages of retigabine (tablets): 600 mg/ (200 mg TID) and 900 mg/d (300 TID).

## · Objectives

Study 205: The objectives of study 205 was  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retigabine capsules 200  mg  TID,  300  mg  TID  and  400  mg  TID  compared  with  placebo,  when  administered  as  add-on therapy in patients with partial epilepsy receiving one or two pre-specified AEDs.

Studies 301 and 302: Studies 301 and 302 aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of retigabine tablets in the doses 1200 mg/d, or 600 mg/d and 900 mg/d, respectively in patients with refractory partial epilepsy.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy measures

## Study 205

In this study, the primary endpoint was the percentage change in total partial seizure frequency per 28 days from baseline to the double-blind phase.

Responder rate (50% reduction from baseline in partial onset seizure frequency) was not defined as a primary variable in the protocol but was identified as an efficacy variable for analysis in the statistical analyses plan (SAP) prior to unblinding of the data.

The term 'total partial seizures' was considered the primary seizure category and was defined as all simple partial and complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization and also included status epilepticus and flurries.

## Studies 301 and 302

In order to support international registration of retigabine, the primary efficacy studies included two primary objectives reflecting regulatory requirements in the US and Europe.

- The primary endpoint required by EMA guidance is based on responder rate i.e. a comparison of  the  percentage of responders (defined as those experiencing a ≥ 50% reduction in 28-day total partial seizure frequency) between baseline and maintenance phase.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

- The primary endpoint required by FDA guidance is based on the percent change in the 28-day total partial seizure frequency occurring between baseline and the double-blind phase (titration and maintenance phases combined).  The data are most appropriately described by the median percent value.

## Secondary Efficacy Measures

For  seizure  categories,  simple  partial  seizures  included  those  with  and  without  motor  signs.  Also flurries were not to be considered a separate type of seizures, but might be a secondary characteristic of other types of seizures.

## Study 205

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary endpoints were the following:

- Median  percent  change  in  the  28-day  total  partial  seizure  frequency  occurring  between baseline and the double-blind (maintenance phase).
- Increase in seizure frequency categories defined as 0% to 25% and &gt;25% to ∞ . A further posthoc  analysis  included  assessment  of  seizure  categories  that  presented  the  proportion  of patients with a worsening of seizures.
- Percent of patients who were seizure free (all seizure types). Post-hoc analysis.
- Percent of seizure-free days (all seizure types). Post-hoc analysis.
- Number  of  seizure-free  days  per  28  days  of  treatment  for  total  partial  seizures  and  total seizures.
- Maximum number of consecutive seizure-free days for total partial seizures and total seizures.

· Incidence of new seizure types not present at baseline. · Change in  Clinical  Global  Impression-Improvement  (CGI-I).  Measures  of  overall  response  to treatment from the clinician were collected on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 indicated very much improved and 7 indicated very much worse. · Rate (number and percent of patients) of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. · Time until discontinuation for patients discontinuing treatment early. · Severity of illness. Studies 301 and 302 The secondary endpoints included the following: · The  median percent  change  in  the  28-day  total  partial  seizure  frequency  occurring  between baseline and the double-blind, here the maintenance phase. · Percent  of  patients  experiencing  a  reduction  from  baseline  in  28-day  total  partial  seizure frequency in categories of &gt;75, 50 -75%, &lt;50%, &lt;25% in addition to a category for those with no change/increase in seizures. A further post-hoc analysis included assessment of seizure categories that presented the proportion of patients with a worsening of seizures. · Incidence of new seizure types not present at baseline. · Percent of patients experiencing exacerbation of seizures with increase from baseline in 28-day total partial seizure frequency categories of  0-25% and &gt;25 %. · Change  in  Clinical  Global  Impression-Improvement  (CGI-I)  and  Patient  Global  ImpressionImprovement (PGIC) [Study 205 did not include PGIC]. Both measures of overall response to treatment from the clinician and patient perspective respectively, were collected on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 indicated very much improved and 7 indicated very much worse. · Quality of Life in Epilepsy Problems (QOLIE-31P).

## · Randomisation

In all three studies a 1:1 randomisation for each of the doses of retigabine and placebo, respectively was issued.

## · Blinding (masking)

The test medication was delivered in blister cards using a double-dummy technique for the placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Statistical methods

## Study 205

Responder  rates  were  analysed  with  logistic  regression  with  centre  and  treatment  as  effects  in  the model. For the primary endpoint percent change in total partial seizures, the same closed procedure was applied. For the other secondary endpoints, pairwise comparisons were done to investigate the dose-response without any adjustments for multiplicity.

Rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and pooled centres as factors in the model, and ranked  baseline  28-day  seizure  rate  as  a  covariate.  Note:    Dose  response  was  studied  by  using contrasts in the rank ANCOVA, according to a closed procedure for monotonic trend. Hodges-Lehmann estimates and two-sided confidence intervals were provided for pairwise comparisons.

The following analyses were done in the integrated analyses to allow comparisons with Studies 301 and 302:

- A non-parametric rank ANCOVA, stratified by baseline seizure rate category (4-8 versus &gt;8), was used to assess the percent change in 28-day total partial seizure rate
- The  response  rate  was  analyzed  using  Fisher's  Exact  test.  Responder  data,  stratified  by baseline seizure rate category (4-8 vs. &gt;8), were also analyzed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test along with the Breslow-Day test of homogeneity.

## 301 and 302

Stratified  non-parametric  rank  analysis  of  covariance  was  applied  to  assess  the  primary  endpoint percent change in monthly seizure rate.

For the primary endpoint, the responder rates for the retigabine groups versus the placebo group were compared using Fisher's Exact test.

Further analysis of responder rates stratified by region and baseline seizure rate category was based on the CMH test along with the Breslow-Day test of homogeneity.

The FDA primary endpoint, the percent change in 28-day total partial seizure frequency, was further analyzed  using  the  methods  specified  above,  first  stratified  by  geographic  region  only,  and  then stratified by baseline seizure rate category only.

Analysis  of  the  continuous  secondary  endpoints  employed  the  same  methods  as  for  the  primary endpoints.

## · Analysis Populations

The ITT patient populations that were used to describe the primary analysis in Studies 301 and 302 differed from the pre-specified population defined in Study 205.

In  Study  205,  the  ITT  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one dose of study drug, had a baseline seizure evaluation, and at least one seizure evaluation on-therapy. This population was used in defining all efficacy endpoints across the double-blind phase.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

A  number  of  post-hoc  analyses  were  conducted  on  unblinded  data  from  Study  205  in  order  to harmonize  the  statistical  methodology  with  those  applied  in  Studies  301  and  302.  The  patient populations characterized for these additional post-hoc analyses were:

- An ITT (EMEA) population that was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and at least one seizure measurement recorded in the maintenance phase.
- An ITT (FDA) population that was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and had at least one seizure measurement recorded in the double-blind phase (titration and maintenance phase combined).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  Studies  301  and  302,  two  different  ITT  populations  were  defined  with  respect  to  the  primary measure of interest for FDA and EMEA review respectively.

- The  ITT  (EMA)  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least one dose of study drug in the maintenance phase and had at least one seizure measurement (whether or not they had a seizure) recorded in the maintenance phase.

This population was used in defining the primary efficacy endpoint for the EMA review. It also defined  efficacy  data  for  the  maintenance  phase  in  Study  301  and  302  and  within  the Summary of Clinical  Efficacy  is  hereafter  referred  to  as  the  ITT  maintenance  population  for describing efficacy data for the maintenance phase.

- The  ITT  (FDA)  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least one dose of study drug.

This population was used in defining the primary efficacy endpoint for the FDA submission. It also defined efficacy data for the titration and maintenance periods in Study 301 and 302 and within  the  Summary  of  Clinical  Efficacy  is  hereafter  referred  to  as  the  ITT  double-blind population for describing efficacy data for the double-blind phase.

In addition to analyses across studies, pooled analyses were conducted for the primary efficacy studies. Pooled analyses were also conducted for the corresponding open-label extension studies of these trials.

For  the  integrated  summaries  of  Studies  205,  301  and  302,  two  efficacy  analysis  populations  were defined. These populations also define the phase of treatment that was assessed and are identical to the patient population definitions and associated phases describing efficacy that were pre-specified and described in Studies 301 and 302.

## Results

## Study 205

## · Participant flow

Of  the  537  patients  who  were  screened,  399  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  randomly  assigned  to treatment. Two of them did not receive any of the test capsules. These 2 patients were excluded from the safety population.

One patient (from the retigabine 200 mg TID group) who had no record of seizures during therapy was additionally  excluded  from  the  ITT  population,  and  396  patients  were  analyzed  for  efficacy.  279 patients completed the 8-week maintenance phase and were considered 'completers.'

In all populations except the modified ITT patients had their data analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned.

## · Recruitment

Medicinal product no longer authorised

A  number  of  73  centres  in  19  countries  participated:  Australia,  Belgium,  Croatia,  Czech  Republic, Finland,  France,  Germany,  Israel,  Italy,  The  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  Norway,  Poland,  Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA.

## · Conduct of the study

A  number  of  protocol  amendments  were  issued.  However,  these  are  not  likely  to  be  of  major importance. More essential are the considerable amount of changes of analyses and conduct of posthoc analyses, mainly to accommodate with the more recent pivotal trials 301 and 302. Per se these analyses therefore should be considered with caution.

## · Baseline data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For age, gender, race, weight, and duration of the disease, no overall differences across the treatment groups were noted. The number of AEDs seemed to be distributed with numerically fewer patients in the placebo group receiving 1 concurrent AED, whereas more patients in the active groups received 2 or  more  AEDS.  However,  it  is  not  considered  likely  that  it  will  result  in  clinically  important consequences for the results.

Note: Summary statistics in the subgroup of patients with a non-zero baseline seizure rate for this seizure type. The primary analysis concerns the change from baseline to the 'double-blind' therapy phase. SD = standard deviation For  the  original  primary  endpoint,  the  difference  between  the  dosages  of  900  mg/d  (p=0.043)  and 1200  mg/d  (p&lt;0.001),  respectively,  versus  placebo  were  statistically  significant.  The  600  mg/d regimen did not reach statistical significance with regard to the primary endpoint. The  apparent  dose  response  relationship  was  reproduced  in  analysis  of  the  50%  responder  rate endpoint (double-blind phase), where the results were consistent. However, sub-analysis restricted to the maintenance phase, showed superiority to placebo for the 1200 mg/d dose regimen, but not for the 600mg/d and 900 mg/d dose regimen. This inconsistency was further supported by an identical number of subjects  discontinuing  treatment  because  of  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  placebo  and  the  900 mg/d groups, as opposed to the two other retigabine dose regimens. Overall the demonstrated efficacy lied within the range of results of studies of efficacy of other new antiepileptic drugs in refractory epilepsy, but was considered as modest from a clinical perspective.

The responder rates (patients whose seizure frequencies were reduced by at least 50%) during the double-blind  phase  were  16%,  23%,  32%,  and  33%  for  the  placebo  group  and  the  retigabine  600 mg/day, 900 mg/day, and 1200 mg/day dose groups, respectively.  The results were consistent with the  primary  analysis  for  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in  seizure  frequency.  The  pair-wise comparisons using the original logistic regression methodology for responder rate indicated significant linear  dose  trend  across  the  tested  doses  that  included  placebo  (p=0.001)  and  900 mg/day  versus placebo (p=0.008), but not 600 mg/day versus placebo (p=0.189).

During the maintenance phase only, the responder rate was 26% in the placebo group, 28% in the retigabine 200 mg TID group, 41% in the retigabine 300 mg TID group, and 41% in the 400 mg TID group. This rate was significantly higher in the retigabine 400 mg TID group than in the placebo group (p=0.010). The comparison between placebo and 300 mg TID retigabine is non-significant (p=0.057). The comparison between placebo and 200 mg TID retigabine is also not significant (p=0.845).

· Recruitment A number of 53 centres in the USA (34), Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil contributed. · Conduct of the study A number of protocol amendments and changes of analyses was issued. The most important was the omission of a planned PQ sub-study, which in agreement with the FDA was substituted by a trial in healthy volunteers. · Baseline data There are no remarkable dissimilarities in the distribution of demographic data. A baseline imbalance was  seen  with  respect  to  the  percentage  of  patients  taking  3  concomitant  AEDs.  However,  this discrepancy did not seem to have a definite impact on the treatment response. The demographics and baseline characteristics in the safety population are described in the table below.

There was a significant difference between treatment groups with respect to the proportion of patients in the ITT (EMEA) population with a reduction in 28-day total partial seizure frequency from baseline to maintenance phase by reduction categories defined by the EMEA guidance, with greater proportions of the  retigabine  group  showing  larger  percentages  of  reduction  in  seizures  (p&lt;0.001).  A  greater proportion  of  patients  receiving  retigabine  37  (31%)  experienced  a  greater  than  75%  reduction  in seizure  frequency  compared  to  13  (10%)  in  the  placebo  group.  In  addition,  when  compared  to  the placebo group, fewer patients in the retigabine group experienced no reduction in seizure frequency. The percent of patients experiencing exacerbation of seizures with increase from baseline in 28-day total partial seizure frequency categories of 0 to 25% increase and &gt;25 % increase was analysed as a post-hoc analyses. A smaller proportion of patients receiving retigabine (4, 3%) experienced a 0-25% increase in seizure frequency compared to 20 (15%) in the placebo group. In addition, when compared to  the  placebo  group,  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the  retigabine  group  experienced  a  &gt;25% increase in seizure frequency (13% for the retigabine group and 15% for the placebo group). Proportion of patients seizure free and percentage of seizure-free days The  proportion  of  patients  who  were  seizure-free  during  the  maintenance  phase  was  7.6  %  in  the retigabine group versus 1.5 % in the placebo group (p=0.027).

Among secondary endpoints the proportion of seizure free subjects, during the maintenance phase, compared to that of placebo did not reach statistical significance. However, the numerical proportion of seizure free subjects on retigabine was higher than the corresponding on placebo.

The  median  percentage  of  seizure-free  days  during  the  maintenance  period  was  86.9  %  for  the retigabine group versus 78.1 % for the placebo group (p&lt;0.01).

a p-value for treatment comparison (versus placebo) using rank analysis of covariance model with baseline seizure category and region as covariates. N = number of patients in the population; RTG = retigabine; SD = standard deviation, TID = three times daily. Note: Only patients with baseline and maintenance phase seizure measures were included in this table. The  median  percent  change  from  baseline  to  maintenance  phase  in  28-day  total  partial  seizure frequency in the ITT (EMEA) population was significantly greater for the 200 mg TID retigabine group (-35.3%,  p=0.002)  and  the  300  mg  TID  retigabine  group  (-44.3%,  p&lt;0.001)  compared  with  the placebo group (-17.4%), with a clear dose response effect.

RTG = retigabine, TID = three times daily.

When compared with placebo patients, a smaller percentage of patients in the retigabine 200 mg TID and 300 mg TID groups experienced a 0-25% increase in seizure frequency (17%, 9% and 7% for placebo, 200 mg TID and 300 mg TID, respectively). In addition, when compared to the placebo group, a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the  retigabine  groups  experienced  a  &gt;25%  increase  seizure frequency (13%, 15% and 13% for placebo, 200 mg TID and 300 mg TID, respectively).

## Proportion of Patients Seizure Free and Percent of Seizure-free Days

The part of patients who is seizure-free is 3.2 %, and 4.7 % in the 600 mg/d and 900 mg/d dosage groups, as compared with 1.2 % in the placebo group. In both cases the difference was not significant.

The dose response was studied by using contrasts in the rank ANCOVA, according to a closed testing procedure for monotonic trend. The pre-specified analyses using the rank ANCOVA methodology for percent reduction in monthly total partial seizures indicated significant linear dose trend across the tested doses that included placebo (p<0.001) and between retigabine 900 mg/day versus placebo (p=0.043) and for 1200 mg versus 600 mg/day (p=0.047). The data at 600 mg compared with placebo were not statistically significant (p=0.199). The primary objective of the original planned analyses was to assess dose response using a closed testing procedure which assumed a monotonic trend. A further post-hoc assessment to assess the relationship between each active dose of retigabine and placebo without the assumption of monotonicity showed for the additional contrast for retigabine 1200 mg/day and placebo, a significant treatment difference in the double-blind phase (p=0.001)- (see Addendum to 205 CSR   | The primary test statistic was rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and pooled centres as factors in the model, and ranked baseline 28-day seizure rate as a covariate.

The primary objective of the original planned analyses was to assess dose response using a closed testing procedure which assumed a monotonic trend. A further post-hoc assessment to assess the relationship between each active dose of retigabine and placebo without the assumption of monotonicity showed for the additional contrast for retigabine 1200 mg/day and placebo, a significant treatment difference in the double-blind phase (p=0.001)- (see Addendum to 205 CSR   | The primary test statistic was rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and pooled centres as factors in the model, and ranked baseline 28-day seizure rate as a covariate. The dose response was studied by using contrasts in the rank ANCOVA, according to a closed testing procedure for monotonic trend.

Use of a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) was also allowed in addition to as many as 3 AEDs. The study consisted of a screening visit, an 8-week baseline phase to evaluate seizure frequency; a 6-week titration phase; a 12-week maintenance phase; and a 6-week transition phase or a 3-week tapering phase. During the titration phase, patients were titrated from 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) on blinded study drug, with weekly increases in doses of 150 mg/day over the course of 6 weeks. Patients who were unable to tolerate dose escalation were discontinued from the study. During the maintenance phase, patients who were unable to tolerate the 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) dose were allowed to reduce their dose to 1050 mg/day at the Week 7 visit only and were to continue on that dose for the remainder of the maintenance phase. The double-blind period consisted of the titration phase plus the maintenance phase for purposes of efficacy assessments. no longer authorised | This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of retigabine (1200 mg/day; 400 mg TID]) compared to placebo (1:1) in patients with epilepsy who were receiving 1, 2, or 3 AEDs.

During the titration phase, patients were titrated from 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) on blinded study drug, with weekly increases in doses of 150 mg/day over the course of 6 weeks. Patients who were unable to tolerate dose escalation were discontinued from the study. During the maintenance phase, patients who were unable to tolerate the 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) dose were allowed to reduce their dose to 1050 mg/day at the Week 7 visit only and were to continue on that dose for the remainder of the maintenance phase. The double-blind period consisted of the titration phase plus the maintenance phase for purposes of efficacy assessments. no longer authorised | This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of retigabine (1200 mg/day; 400 mg TID]) compared to placebo (1:1) in patients with epilepsy who were receiving 1, 2, or 3 AEDs.

It defined efficacy data for the maintenance phase. This population and definition was used in defining the primary efficacy endpoint for the EMA review. A more general term for describing efficacy during the maintenance phase i.e. ITT maintenance population, is utilised below. product no longer | P-value <0.001 using Fisher's Exact test In the pre-specified analysis, the ITT Maintenance Population did not include patients dropped out prior to maintenance. However post-hoc sensitivity analyses (full in study report) that included different imputation paradigms for missing data, a robust treatment effect for retigabine. In the conservative imputation that assumed non-responder status for patients who dropped out during the phase the results remained significant. | P-value <0.001 using Fisher's Exact test In the pre-specified analysis, the ITT Maintenance Population did not include patients dropped out prior to maintenance.

| ITT Maintenance Population                      | The ITT (EMEA) population was defined in the study report as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug in the maintenance phase and had at least one seizure measurement (whether or not they had a seizure) recorded in the maintenance phase. It defined efficacy data for the maintenance phase. This population and definition was used in defining the primary efficacy endpoint for the EMA review.

| Notes                                           | In the pre-specified analysis, the ITT Maintenance Population did not include patients who dropped out prior to maintenance. However post-hoc sensitivity analyses (full details in study report) that included different imputation paradigms for missing data, demonstrated a robust treatment effect for retigabine. In the conservative imputation scheme that assumed non-responder status for patients who dropped out during the titration phase the results remained significant.

## Integrated analyses

The applicant has provided comparisons and analyses of results across the main studies.

The results should be read in the perspective that bioequivalence between the test drugs in study 205 and 301/302 has not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, for the purpose of the integrated analysis across the 3 studies, the primary endpoint, i.e. responder  rate  during  the  maintenance  phase  for  the  study  205  has  been  'harmonised'  with  the results of the two other studies via pot-hoc analysis to satisfy the CHMP requirements.

The  integrated  analysis  did  not  provide  evidence  supporting  an  interpretation  of  the  efficacy  of retigabine  that  differed  from  the  interpretation  of  the  results  of  the  individual  studies.  The  issues described for Study 205 hinder a direct comparison with studies 301 and 302, and integration of the results through post-hoc analysis calls for caution.

Due reluctance for a direct comparison across the results from the 3 trials is necessary here.

## Responder Rate by Seizure Type

Of most interest were the analyses of efficacy by the seizure types, where the main findings for the maintenance phase are shown below:

The  primary  efficacy  data  by  Seizure  Type  demonstrated  that  there  was  no  statistically  significant percent reduction from baseline in 28-day total partial seizure rate at any RTG dose compared with placebo  for  patients  with  secondarily  generalized  seizures  in  the  double-blind  phase  and  in  the maintenance phase. The treatment effect was unexpectedly similar between 1200 mg/day and placebo in the double-blind phase. Conversely, both the Percent Change from Baseline in 28-Day Total Partial Seizure  Frequency  by  Seizure  Type  (in  Double-Blind  Phase  and  in  the  Maintenance  phase)  and Responder Rate by Seizure Type (in the Maintenance Phase and in the double blind phase) showed a significant treatment effect at all doses of RTG in the cohort of patients without secondarily generalized seizures.

## Percent of Patients who were Seizure Free

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analysis showed no significant difference between retigabine 600 mg/d and 900 mg/d and placebo with  regard  to  percentage  of  seizure  free  patients,  whilst  the  result  was  equivocal  regarding  the retigabine  1200  mg/d  regimen,  being  superior  to  placebo  in  the  study  301  but  non  superior  in  the study  205.  As  for  the  percentage  of  seizure-free  days  in  the  maintenance  period  no  statistical difference versus placebo was observed for retigabine in study 205, while in the two other pivotal trials a statistical difference was observed for all dose regimens versus placebo.

In all three studies, the percent of retigabine patients in the ITT maintenance population with ≥ 75% reduction in seizure rate was greater than placebo, and increased with increasing dose. Conversely, the largest proportions of patients with no change or an increase in seizure frequency were larger in the placebo groups than in the retigabine groups, with the exception of the 600 mg/day group in Study 205.

## Percent change in 28-day total partial seizure by quartile categories

<!-- image -->

The integrated analysis of Studies 205, 301 and 302 for percent change in 28-day total partial seizure by quartile categories in the maintenance phase showed a dose-related increase in the proportion of retigabine  patients  with ≥ 75% reduction in seizure rate compared with placebo (conversely, in each study  the  placebo  group  had  the  largest  proportions  of  patients  with  no  change  or  an  increase  in seizure  frequency).    The  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  no  change  or  up  to  25%  increase  in seizure  frequency  was  larger  in  the  placebo  group,  but  there  was  no  difference  from  placebo  with regard to subjects with &gt;25% increase in seizure frequency. Across all studies and all RTG doses very few seizure free patients were observed. In the RTG 600 mg/day group the number of patients seizure free is similar to placebo confirming the apparent lack of efficacy of this low dosage. Having presented and discussed the data for the proportion of subjects with a seizure reduction and seizure worsening in the study populations in the PVTs, the Applicant concluded that the proportion of patients with seizure worsening was similar across all doses of retigabine compared to placebo. This was agreed by the CHMP. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Supportive studies

## Study 200/201

Studies 200 and 201 (3065 A1-200/201; 8001/8005) were exploratory open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre studies in patients aged 18 to 50 years with partial-onset seizures (with or without secondary generalization) who had at least 8 seizures during the preceding 2 months and who were treated with up to three AEDs.

A total of 46 patients were enrolled in these 2 studies.

Given the similarity  of  the  protocols,  the  efficacy  data  were  pooled  and  reported  within  one  clinical study  report.  However,  the  PK  data  derived  from  both  protocols  were  reported  separately  in consideration of the differences in the PK sampling schedule across the study protocols.

The study was divided into five phases; screening/baseline (2-3 weeks), retigabine titration (variable duration, but at least 6 weeks), AED tapering (variable duration dependent upon patient tolerability of established  AED  withdrawal/reduction),  retigabine  maintenance  (2  weeks);  after  completion  of  the maintenance  phase,  patients  either  tapered  off  retigabine  over  a  period  of  3  weeks  (25%  dose reduction every week) and possibly had their established AED re-introduced, or entered into a longterm follow-up study (3065A1-208-US) at the discretion of the investigator.

The  studies  were  divided  into  three  phases:  Baseline  (2  months),  Treatment  (6  months;  3-month dose-titration period followed by a 3-month maintenance period); after completion of the Treatment phase, patients were either tapered off retigabine over a period of 3 weeks (25% dose reduction every week), or entered into a long-term follow-up study (Study 8017) at the discretion of the investigator. During the treatment phases of Studies 200/201, concomitant AEDs were to remain constant. Efficacy criteria were percent reduction from baseline in total partial seizure frequency and responder rate ( ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency) during the 3-month maintenance period (end of Week 24) or last study visit. Descriptive statistics were produced across all analyses and no statistical comparisons were performed. The seizure frequency was reduced by 36% (ITT) or 34% (PP). These first  exploratory  studies  for  retigabine  indicated  that  the  therapeutic  window  for  retigabine  in this patient population was between 400 mg/day and 1200 mg/day, with the maximum responder rate seen with 800 mg/day to 1200 mg/day.  Titration schemes of between 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day weekly increments were sufficient to reach an efficacious dose within an appropriate time frame. Study 202 Study 202 (3065 A1-202) was an open-label, uncontrolled, multi-centre study in which, primarily, the safety, tolerability, drug- interactions, and, secondarily, the efficacy of retigabine, administered first as add-on therapy and then as monotherapy, were evaluated in patients aged 16 to 75 years with partial or generalized epilepsy.  Patients had a documented seizure frequency of at least two seizures/month and were receiving monotherapy with an established AED (valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or topiramate) at stable doses, for at least 5 weeks at the time of enrolment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Efficacy  was  assessed  by  percent  reduction  in  total  seizure  frequency  from  both  historical  and  prestudy  baselines,  and  the  responder  rate  for  total  seizures  only  ( ≥ 50%  reduction  from  pre-study baselines in seizure frequency) during the treatment period.

A number of 60 patients were enrolled. Retigabine titrated up to 1200 mg/day (administered either as a BID or TID regimen) was associated with evidence of efficacy for total seizures.  The efficacy profiles were generally similar across the four AED subgroups.

Based on the efficacy results and adverse event profile, retigabine 1200 mg/day (BID) was deemed the maximum tolerated dose in patients with epilepsy.

The results from this study were deemed relevant in informing the maximum dose selection and dosing regimen  (TID)  to  be  included  in  the  Phase  2b  dose-ranging  study  in  patients  with  refractory  total partial seizures.

Study 214 (3065 A1-214) was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, exploratory study primarily comparing the safety and tolerability, and, secondarily, the efficacy, of three titration rates of retigabine (300 mg/day TID starting dose being increased by 150 mg/day every 2, 4, or 7 days; up to a maximum of 1200 mg/day) in patients aged 16 to 70 years with a diagnosis of partial epilepsy  and  a  documented  seizure  frequency  of ≥ 2  seizures  per  month  during  the  4  weeks  before study evaluation.  Eligible patients could be receiving one or two marketed AEDs (with the exception of vigabatrin and felbamate) at a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to screening.  Patients could also be on VNS therapy and this counted as one AED towards the total of up to two AEDs.

The primary objective was to determine the acceptability of 3 titration rates of retigabine, using the discontinuation rate because of adverse events as the primary method of evaluation. The secondary objective was the efficacy of the 3 titration rates on control of seizures.

The study enrolled a number of 73 patients.

At the end of the maintenance phase of Study 205, all patients had their study drug adjusted to 900 mg/day (300 mg TID) in a double-blind, double-dummy manner. At the end of this interim phase (i.e., when the dose of 900 mg/day was reached), patients could enter the long-term open-label extension study  (Study  212).  Further  dose  adjustments  up  to  1200  mg/day  could  be  made  depending  on achievement  of  adequate  efficacy  and  tolerability.  Patients  who  did  not  tolerate  further  dose adjustments or did not wish to enter Study 212 had their dose progressively tapered to zero before withdrawal from the study.

While  efficacy  was  demonstrated  across  the  three  titration  regimens,  a  titration  scheme  of  150  mg every 7 days to a maximum tolerated dose of retigabine 1200 mg/day i.e., over a 6-week titration period,  was  considered  optimum  with  respect  to  the  lowest  discontinuation  rates  due  to  AEs.    The results of Study 214 indicated that caution should be used if a titration scheme faster than 150 mg every 7 days is used to achieve a total daily dose of 1200 mg/day. Long-Term Studies A  total  of  three  open-label  extension  studies  to  the  Phase  2b  study  (Study  205)  and  the  Phase  3 studies  (Studies  301  and  302)  were  conducted  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  of  retigabine  in  the treatment of patients with partial-onset seizures. However, these studies did allow an assessment of persistence of efficacy. Patients  who  completed  Studies  205,  301  and  302  were  eligible  to  enter  long-term  retigabine treatment protocols, Studies 212, 303 and 304 respectively. Study  212  was  completed  in  February  2002,  but  Studies  303  and  304  were  ongoing  at  time  of submission. A summary of the key efficacy results from these studies are briefly presented below. Study 212 Study 212 was an uncontrolled, open-label extension study to evaluate, primarily, the long-term safety and  tolerability,  and,  secondarily,  the  long-term  efficacy  of  retigabine  in  eligible  patients  who  had successfully completed the titration and maintenance phases of Study 205.

The background AED therapy could be adjusted to achieve the optimal balance for efficacy and safety. The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  percent  change  in  the  monthly  seizure  frequency  from  the baseline  phase  to  open-label  treatment  phase.    Efficacy  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  baseline seizure frequency obtained during the screening period of the parent double-blind study (Study 205) with seizure frequency during retigabine treatment in the open-label phase (Study 212).  Additional efficacy endpoints included assessment of responder rates based on the same criteria used in Study 205 and the number of seizure-free days for each patient assessed as a percentage of each patient's duration in the open-label phase.

A  further  post-hoc  analysis  that  presented  efficacy  data  (responder  rate  and  percent  change  from baseline in 28-day total partial seizure frequency) by specified time points up to 18 months treatment, were derived.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 222 of the 279 patients who completed Study 205 (79.5%) were enrolled into this open-label extension study and received retigabine at doses of up to 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID).

The median treatment duration was 358 days (mean 352.5 days ± 172.1) (CSR 212, Section 5.1.5). The majority of patients (105/222, 47.3%) received retigabine 900 mg/day as their maximum dosage and a further 52 (23.4%) patients received retigabine 1200 mg/day as their maximum dosage. Twelve (5.4%) patients received doses &gt;1200 mg/day.

The overall median percent change in total partial seizure rates was -48.3%.  Efficacy data split by previous  double-blind  assignment  in  Study  205  showed  that  patients  allocated  to  both  placebo  and retigabine 600 mg/day during the double-blind phase, showed improved efficacy during the extension study that was similar to that observed for patients that were allocated to retigabine 900 mg/day and 1200 mg/day during the previous double-blind phase.

The  overall  responder  rate  was  46%  and  similar  conclusions  on  efficacy  by  previous  double-blind treatment were observed in this analysis.

The overall mean rate of seizure-free days (in percentage of all days of observation) increased from 69.7% at baseline taken from Study 205, to 81.2% by the end of the open-label phase.  The rates increased  by  4%  and  5%  for  patients  previously  assigned  to  placebo  and  retigabine  600  mg/day respectively.

In  conclusion,  retigabine  administered  during  the  open-label  phase  showed  that  seizure  rates  in patients  who had previously received placebo or treatment with 600 mg/day during the Study 205, achieved  a  reduction  in  total  and  total  partial  seizure  rates  during  open-label  treatment  of  similar magnitude to that observed in the double-blind phase for retigabine 900 mg/day and 1200 mg/day. The  results  were  supportive  of  the  effectiveness  of  retigabine  doses ≥ 900  mg/day  based  upon  the open-label dosing schedule.

## Studies 303 and 304

Studies  303  and  304  were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  submission.  They  were  uncontrolled,  open-label extension studies to the placebo-controlled, double-blind Studies 301 and 302, respectively.

A total 181 (81%) of the 224 patients who completed Study 301, and 375 (92%) of the 409 patients who completed Study 302 were enrolled into open-label extension studies 303 and 304, respectively.

The interim results seemed to indicate confirmation of the already discussed efficacy and tolerability results.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Of note is that the development of retigabine has a history of frequent change of sponsorship. The efficacy of retigabine was primarily investigated in a phase IIb trial (205) and two phase III trials (301 and 302). These were all multi centre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, parallel  group studies randomizing totally 1244 subjects, whereof 427 to placebo and 813 to three retigabine dose regimens of  respectively 600, 900 and 1200 mg daily.

The major differences among the three pivotal studies were the type of patients recruited, the duration of the maintenance period, the dose titration scheme, and the formulation of test drug.

Study 205 was conducted and the study report prepared under the sponsorship of Wyeth before the current EMA guidance was made available and therefore the prespecified primary efficacy parameters do not adhere to the guidance. In addition, this study was designed with a 8-week maintenance period only.  Subsequently,  Valeant  updated/modified  the  report  in  order  to  comply  with  the  guidelines  for structure and contents of clinical study reports. Moreover, in order to improve the data presentation and harmonise the results with these of the other pivotal studies additional analyses - after unblinding - were conducted. As these analyses were conducted post hoc they are only supportive in nature.

Studies  301  and  302  recruited  patients  with  more  refractory  disease  as  a  result  of  protocol requirements (i.e., higher number and greater range of background AEDs allowed; stipulation of ≥ 2 years diagnosis of epilepsy).  The majority of patients across the primary efficacy studies (76.6 %)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

used at least two concurrent AED's, and the most common stable concomitant AED was carbamazepine (51.5%),  followed  by  lamotrigine  (27%),  valproate  (24%),  topiramate  (17.2%),  levetiracetam (15.1%), phenytoin (12.4%), and oxcarbazepine (12.0%). Concomitant AEDs are quite similar across treatment groups except for phenytoin that was more represented in RTG 1200 mg/day group (and placebo group correlated). This discrepancy could be ascribed to Study 301 mainly enrolled US patients. Consistent  with  the  2000  EU  CHMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Epilepsy Disorders, the Phase III studies were designed with a 12-week maintenance period.  Both studies 301 and 302 had a forced titration scheme but Study 301 allowed a single dose reduction to 1050 mg/day downwards at the start of the maintenance period (end of Week 7) for patients who did not tolerate 1200 mg/day at the end of the forced titration scheme. Study 205 allowed down titration on up to two occasions during the titration period.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The study 205 investigated the efficacy of retigabine 600 mg, 900 mg and 1200 mg daily compared to placebo. Of note the three retigabine treatment arms had titration and maintenance phases of different duration together comprising a double blind phase of equal duration in all three arms of 16 weeks. With regard to the primary efficacy outcome of seizure frequency reduction, the 900 mg/d and the 1200 mg/d regimens showed superiority to placebo, but the 600 mg/d did not. Analysis of the efficacy outcome of at least 50% responder rate showed the same results comparing baseline with the whole double  blind  phase.  However,  the  same  efficacy  outcome  in  analysis  restricted  to  the  maintenance phase showed superiority of the 600 mg/d and the 1200 mg/d regimens compared to placebo, but the 900 mg/d regimen did not. Efficacy of retigabine in the study was within the range defined by similar studies of other new AEDs, but must be considered as modest. The studies 301 and 302 were very similar with regard to design and efficacy outcomes and differed only in that study 301 investigated retigabine 1200 mg/d against placebo and study 302 investigated retigabine 600 mg/d and 900 mg/d against placebo. In both studies and with regard to both primary efficacy outcomes of at least 50% responder rate and median percent reduction in frequency of total partial seizures, superiority of retigabine compared to placebo was statistically significant for all three dose regimens. In  Study  301,  approximately  one-fifth  (34/153)  of  the  patients  randomized  to  the  retigabine 1200 mg/day group had an average weekly dose of ≤ 1050 mg/day for at least 50% of the duration of the  maintenance  phase.    Overall,  it  appeared  that  the  efficacy  of  the  1050  mg/day  dose  was comparable to that of the retigabine 1200 mg/day group and both doses demonstrated trends and/or clinically relevant differentiation from the placebo group across primary and key secondary endpoints except for the median number of seizure free days where retigabine 1050 mg/day appears similar to placebo. A very small number of subjects with age above 65 years was exposed to retigabine in the pivotal clinical studies (N= 8). A very different efficacy in the elderly population is, however, not anticipated. The great majority of subjects exposed were Caucasian. This raised a concern on the generalisation of the  results  of  the  pivotal  trials  for  populations  of  other  racial  background.  However,  as  the  dose  of retigabine  in  clinical  practice  will  be  determined  according  to  the  individual  patient  response  to  the treatment  during  the  titration  phase,  it  was  not  considered  necessary  to  have  any  specific  dose adjustments according to patients' racial background.

The  recommendation  in  the  posology  section  of  the  SmPC  (section  4.2)  'Trobalt  must  be  titrated according  to  individual  patient  response,  in  order  to  optimise  the  balance  between  efficacy  and tolerability' was considered to adequately cover a possible race impact on efficacy.

The Applicant has provided data about efficacy and safety results by use of selected concomitant AEDs, in order to find out any possible positive or detrimental association among RTG and other AEDs. It was concluded that concomitant use of the most common AEDs with retigabine was efficacious with no clear positive or detrimental differences between AEDs except levetiracetam. As part of the Risk Management  Plan,  the  Applicant  committed  to  further  investigate  the  potential  interaction  between retigabine and levetiracetam.

The evaluation of long term efficacy was based on the primary variables that were defined on the basis of EMA and FDA guidance, i.e. responder rate and percent changes in seizure frequency, respectively. Both  end  points  were  analysed  based  upon  a  cumulative  evaluation  across  specified  time  points

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared  to  changes  from  baseline  seizure  frequency,  determined  at  the  start  of  the  double-blind period. Responder rate analysis was calculated based on the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in 28-day total partial seizure frequency up to the time of scheduled evaluation. Data for these endpoints were presented as side-by-side comparisons and as an integrated analysis across the 3 extension studies.

The large number of patients dropping out in open label long-term extension studies raised concerns about the long-term efficacy and the balance efficacy/adverse events over time. The submitted data (cut-off  date  of  30 th June  2008)  were  considered  insufficient  to  assess  long-term  maintenance  of efficacy in responders to assigned treatment.

To address those concerns, the applicant conducted a more comprehensive and extended evaluation of long term efficacy up to the 2nd October 2009 extended cut-off date.  The analyses included:

- I. an assessment of retention rate over time
- II. seizure frequency (responder rate and % change)
- III. the proportion of patients achieving seizure freedom and
- IV. the prescribed dose achieved at the end of the treatment period.

Retention  rates  described  after  12  months  open-label  treatment  with  retigabine  were  similar  across each of the open label studies. In patients exposed for at least 12 months, the probability of retention on open label treatment with retigabine varied between approximately 53% and 62% across each of the three studies; the probability of retention at 24 months was estimated to be approximately 41%. The probability  of  retention  between  the  first  and  second  year  of  open  label  treatment  appeared  to plateau,  such  that  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  remaining  on  treatment  beyond  12  months treatment were retained in the study than during the first 12 months. Efficacy was maintained in those patients who remained in the open label studies, for up to 32 months of  treatment  with  retigabine.  Moreover,  there  were  no  notable  differences  in  the  distribution  of  the proportion  of  patients  across  the  various  doses  over  time  and  by  similar  time  points  reported  for efficacy. These  extension  studies  reflected  clinical  practice  to  the  extent  that  dose  adjustments  were  made according  to  individual  subject  need,  and  the  data  indicated  that,  in  those  patients  retained  in  the study, retigabine was titrated to doses that spanned the entire recommended dose range (600 to 1200 mg/day) that balanced maintaining adequate efficacy with tolerability. Seizure-freedom  rates  for  any  continuous  6  or  12  month  period  compared  favourably  to  similar estimates  calculated  for  a  number  of  cited  AEDs  administered  in  long  term  open-label  extension settings. Those additional analyses were endorsed by the CHMP. It should however be kept in mind that the patients were selected as they were eligible for continuing the therapy and that the study was open and uncontrolled; additionally most patient received 2-3 other AEDs. Retigabine  was  considered  effective  in  the  treatment  of  partial  epilepsy.  The  size  of  the  effect  was similar to other marketed AEDs, in particular for the 900 and 1200 mg/day doses. For the 600 mg/day dose, the efficacy results were less robust and less convincing. 2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

Three  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  in  a  total  of  1239 adult patients have been conducted to assess the efficacy of retigabine as adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation. All patients enrolled were to have had seizures that were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs, and more than 75% of all patients were taking ≥ 2 concurrent antiepileptic drugs. Across all studies, patients had a mean duration of  epilepsy  of  22 years  and  a  median  baseline  seizure  frequency  ranging  from  8 to 12  per  28 days. Patients were randomized to placebo or retigabine at 600, 900 or 1,200 mg/day. During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience ≥ 4 partial onset seizures per 28 days. Patients could not be seizure-free for ≥ 21 days. The duration of the maintenance phase was 8 or 12 weeks.

Retigabine was effective in adjunctive treatment of adults with partial onset seizures in three clinical studies.  Retigabine  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  at  600 mg/day  (one study), 900 mg/day (two studies) and 1,200 mg/day (two studies).

In open-label extensions of the three placebo-controlled studies, persistence of efficacy  was maintained over an evaluation period of at least 12 months (365 patients).

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Safety assessment of retigabine in the original submission (cut-off of 30 th  December 2008) was based on 2.168 exposed subjects, whereof 813 participated in the 3 placebo controlled trials 205, 301 and 302. A total of 2034 subjects were exposed to at least one dose of retigabine in the epilepsy clinical development programme. After exclusion of the transition phase, this subgroup, contributed a total of 211 exposure years, with  a  median  drug  exposure  of  112  days.  The  total  exposure  to  RTG  (in  the initial  submission) in Phase II and phase III trials, was 1.131 patient-years (median 235), with 229 subjects being exposed for &gt; 1 year. During the evaluation procedure, additional safety data from 7 pharmacology trials have been submitted (= 'non-integrated clinical pharmacology'), contributing data from 196 subjects of whom 194 received retigabine. Overall, this added up to 669 subjects for the entire clinical pharmacology program.

An  additional  10  patients  received  retigabine  in  the  completed  bipolar  disorder  study  (Study  D23129/8040), and, further 125 patients have been exposed to retigabine in the post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) study (Study VRX-RET-E22-NP201). The highest single oral dose administered in the clinical pharmacology studies was 900 mg and the highest IV dose was 50 mg. In the repeat dose studies, the highest retigabine daily dose administered was 1200 mg (400 mg TID). In a phase IIa study (200/20) 18 patients were exposed to a dose of up to 2400 mg/d. The longest duration of retigabine treatment was 28 days (200 mg BID). The table below does not include the non-integrated clinical pharmacology studies submitted during the evaluation process.

Only the PCTs within the All Phase II/III Combined studies were placebo-controlled. A number of 8 patients ≥ 65 years received retigabine in the pivotal clinical studies. In addition, 61 elderly patients out of the total population of 187 patients received retigabine in Study VR-RET-E22NP201. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The presented safety results should be interpreted with caution as - most importantly - the doses were generally lower and the treatment period was shorter, respectively, than in the epilepsy studies. PHN trial used 150 mg/d - 900 mg/d as compared to 600 - 1200 mg/d in the epilepsy PVTs. The titration and maintenance phase was 10 weeks as opposed to 16 or 18 weeks in the epilepsy trials.

## CNS related adverse events

Of  particular  interest  was  the  frequency  of  dizziness,  somnolence,  fatigue,  memory  and  attention impairment, convulsion, diplopia, aphasia, dysarthria, speech disorder, gait disturbance and balance disorder. The frequency of CNS related adverse events was high and appeared to be significantly higher than in the placebo group. Apart from non-specific adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence and fatigue, retigabine was associated with high occurrence of more specific adverse events impacting on cognitive function as memory and attention, as well as adverse events of significance for daily activities such as gait disturbance and language. Although in general the frequency of the adverse events appeared to be dose related, there were examples of adverse events such as attention disturbance where no dose relationship was apparent or where the pattern across retigabine dose regimens was inconsistent as with diplopia and dysarthria. Adverse  events  involving  the  CNS  are  commonly  associated  with  AEDs.  The  CNS  adverse  events associated with retigabine are not unique to retigabine, but are to a varying degree observed with all AEDs. The Applicant was requested to provide further analyses and to further discuss the CNS-related symptoms. The overview provided by the Applicant suggested that retigabine belonged to the category with the most frequent CNS adverse events. This may be due to more efficient adverse event recording practises  employed  in  the  retigabine  studies  compared  to  older  studies  with  other  AEDs.  However, without any direct comparisons, it was difficult to conclude that retigabine compared favourably with other AEDs in terms of CNS adverse effects. Renal/Urinary Events Effects  of  retigabine  on  the  renal/urinary  system  were  expected  from  the  pharmacological  mode  of action as well as from non-clinical safety studies. Renal/urinary adverse events are also reported for topimarate (nephrolithiasis, pollakiuria and dysuria listed as common and additional events listed as uncommon or rare) and zonisamide (nephrolithiasis listed as common and additional events listed as uncommon or very rare).

In  the  PCTs,  AEs  related  to  renal  and  urinary  disorders  were  reported  for  greater  proportions  of patients in the Total RTG group than the placebo group (17% versus 13%). The relative risk of any such event was greatest for the retigabine 1200 mg/day dose group (1.9; 95% CI 1.409, 2.695).

Adverse events related to voiding dysfunction and urinary retention (e.g. dysuria, urinary hesitation, urinary retention) were reported for 5% of the Total RTG-treated group compared to 3% on placebo. Urinary hesitation was the most common adverse reported (2% total RTG versus 0.9% placebo) with no clear dose response relationship across retigabine dose groups. Generally, these events occurred during the first 8 weeks of treatment.

The incidence of AEs of Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) and related symptoms and signs were reported in the PCTs by 8% in the placebo group versus 9% in the Total RTG group, but were more common than placebo in the 1200 mg/day group. There were no reports of SAEs due to UTIs in the PCTs. A higher  but  similar  profile  for  UTI-related  AEs  was  reported  for  retigabine  in  the  Phase  II/III  studies (14%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no clear differences between placebo and retigabine groups for any renal function indices (creatinine,  urea  and  uric  acid)  at  baseline  and  there  were  no  meaningful  changes  over  time  for creatinine  and  urea.  There  were  4  cases  of  nephrolithiasis  in  the  total  RTG  group  (all  in  the  1200 mg/day group). More patients reported urinary  crystals  in  the  All  Phase  II/III  Combined  population than in the PCT group (2% versus 1%).

Mean  change  from  baseline  in  post-void  residual  (PVR)  bladder  volume  increased  in  the  total  RTG group compared with a decrease in the placebo group. In most patients, PVR returned to baseline after discontinuation of treatment.

There was no evidence for an increased incidence of values of potential clinical concern (PCC) relating to PVR bladder ultrasound measured at any time post baseline between total RTG and placebo across the PCTs or Phase II/III combined. This suggested a worsening of effect with long term exposure to retigabine. The PVR did not return to normal in all patients.

## Urinary crystals

About  15%  of  patients  receiving  retigabine  had  crystals  with  bilirubin-like  appearance  in  the  urine compared  to  none  in  patients  on  placebo.  This  finding  was  considered  to  be  due  to  photometric properties  of  retigabine  being  similar  to  those  of  bilirubin.  There  were  4  cases  of  nephrolithiasis  in retigabine-treated patients (all on the highest dose) and none on placebo. Renal colic was reported in 0.4% of retigabine-treated patients. Renal dysfunction Renal dysfunction/failure was reported in 4 patients on retigabine (600 and 900 mg/day groups) and in none on placebo. One of the events was reported as an SAE. Urinary retention was the dominating clinical feature. Conclusion on renal/urinary adverse events Although the numbers were small and the dose-response relationship not entirely clear, there were indications that retigabine may cause urinary retention/hesitation in a small proportion of patients. The potential  causal  relationship  was  supported  by  mechanistic  and  non-clinical  findings.  It  cannot  be excluded that the one SAE of renal failure was caused by the potential of retigabine to induce urinary retention. There were also findings indicating that retigabine is associated with events caused by urinary crystals such as nephrolithiasis. Clearly  more  cases  of  UTI  and  dysuria  were  recorded  with  the  1200  mg/day  dose.  High  rates  were reported from 3 Mexican sites. It is acknowledged that a more pronounced awareness at these centres could  be  at  least  part  of  the  explanation  for  the  more  frequent  reports  of  UTI  and  dysuria.  It  is reassuring that no cases were preceded by urinary retention. However, in the original submission, five serious cases of urinary retention required catherisation (4 of which were in patients receiving Trobalt). In one patient intermittent self-catherisation was required and non-reversible bladder dysfunction was developed. Appropriate warnings were therefore stated in section 4.4. of SmPC.

A considerable part of the adverse events must be regarded as persistent. On the other hand, adverse events, which were not ongoing at the end of the pivotal trials constituted the majority. Generally, one quarter of CNS and urinary adverse events had disappeared after one week and about half after one month, be it on retigabine or on placebo. The data included only patients where the CNS and urinary events did not lead to withdrawal.

The 'thorough' QTc study 103 (described in section 3.4.3 of this report) was positive in that the upper limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the mean effect within 3 h of the 1200 mg/day dose on the QTc interval exceeded 10 ms. Following evaluation of the clinical database, it is noteworthy that no  patient  experienced  QTc  intervals  greater  than  480  ms  or  adverse  events  related  to  QTc prolongation.

OR and RR values for QTc interval increased greater than 30 ms relative to placebo using the Bazett and Fridericia correction methods for heart rate have been presented. For both methods, there was a trend  for  an  effect  for  the  overall  retigabine  group  with  the  95%  confidence  intervals  only  just including unity. For the 1200 mg/day dose, OR and RR values are about 1.5-1.7 for both correction methods with the 95% confidence interval excluding unity for the Bazett correction method.

Retigabine caused  a modest  dose-dependent  QTc  prolongation  related to Cmax.  The  clinical significance of such a finding is difficult to determine. It appears that retigabine does not compare well with  established  AEDs  since  an  association  of  QTc  prolongation  to  other  AEDs  has  not  been  firmly established. Warnings have been introduced in section 4.4 of the SmPC, and it is recommended that an ECG is  recorded  in  patients  at  risk  before  initiation  of  treatment  and  in  those  with  a  corrected  QT interval &gt;440 ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. With the modest QTc increase observed, the CHMP considered disproportionate to require recommendations of baseline ECG for all patients.

## Weight gain

Retigabine was associated with a weight increase after 4 months ranging from about 1 kg on the 600 mg/day dose to about 2.5 kg on 1200 mg/day compared to 0.2 kg on placebo. The weight increase appeared to be dose-dependent and to plateau after approximately 20 weeks of treatment.

Weight gain is  a  well-known  side  effect  of  many  (but  not  all)  AEDs.  It  is  particular  prominent  with valproate  (listed  as  a  very  common  effect),  but  also  commonly  observed  with  carbamazepine, gabapentin, levetiracetam, pregabalin and vigabatrin. The weight gain associated with retigabine was considered to be modest and probably in the same range as several other AEDs.

## Suicidality

A  meta-analysis  conducted  by  the  FDA  for  suicidality  in  placebo  controlled  trials  from  11  marketed AEDs demonstrated an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviour in patients taking these drugs for any indication (0.43% risk in patients taking AED versus 0.22% in patients taking placebo). Based on this analysis, class labelling  for  marketed  AEDs  and  suicidality  was  adopted  by  the  EMA's PhVWP and the CHMP in July 2008.

In the submitted trials, there was no evidence of any increase in events of suicide, suicidality or selfinjurious behaviour with retigabine. Nonetheless, class labelling related to suicidality was adopted for retigabine and Pharmacovigilance activities are planned. An appropriate class label warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

## SUDEPS

The risk of sudden unexplained deaths in epilepsy (SUDEP) with RTG treatment was lower than that with placebo and the SUDEP rate reported in the PCTs was within the range of SUDEP rates published in  the  literature.  However,  this  rate  was  higher  than  SUDEP  rates  reported  for  population  based epilepsy cohorts, and also high among comparable populations, i.e. cohorts with refractory epilepsy. Overall, the figures are small and a firm conclusion is difficult to draw.

## Proconvulsive potential

There was no consistent difference across retigabine doses groups and placebo in distribution profile of seizure worsening by partial seizure type. Furthermore, more new seizure types were similar across retigabine treatment group compared to placebo.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

In the entire retigabine epilepsy clinical development program (including deaths up to the submission cut-off and in the compassionate use program), there were 10 treatment emergent deaths in patients treated with retigabine in approximately 1400 patient-years of exposure, i.e. a rate of 7.1 per 1000 patient-years.  Seven of these cases met the conservative criteria for possible, probable, or definite SUDEP. This represents an overall rate for SUDEP of 5.0 per 1000 patient-years on retigabine across the entire retigabine epilepsy program.

In  the  integrated  safety  database,  6%  of  placebo-treated  patients  and  9%  of  retigabine  treated patients reported a TESAE in the PCTs (Studies 205, 301, and 302).  TESAEs were reported for 8%, 7%, and 11% of the 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day groups, respectively.

In the PCT group, the most frequently reported TESAE was convulsions followed by psychotic disorder. The incidence of convulsion was similar between the placebo and total retigabine groups (1.2% and 1.5%, respectively) and there was no clear indication of any retigabine dose relationship.

In the PCTs, 8 (1%) patients on retigabine reported psychosis and hallucinations related SAEs, and 15 (2%) patients, all on retigabine, discontinued treatment due to psychosis and hallucinations. A review of the SAEs identified that 6/ 8 events were reported in the setting of increased seizures and/or were post-ictal psychotic events.  Other events were often reported in the setting of intercurrent illness or in patients with well-documented history of psychiatric illness.

Other TESAEs were reported in a low proportion of patients (&lt;1% of patients in any treatment group), while  nausea,  encephalopathy,  confusional  state  and  suicidal  ideation  were  reported  only  in  the retigabine 1200 mg/day group.

There was no notable difference in the reporting incidence of TESAE by phase (titration or maintenance phase) and despite there being a higher number of events reported in the 1200 mg/day group, an examination  of  the  dose  at  time  of  occurrence  of  the  adverse  event  suggests  that  many  of  these events occurred at lower doses during the course of the first 8 weeks of treatment (titration period).

Serious cases of urinary retention requiring catheterization were reported in 5 patients (1 placebo and 4  on  retigabine)  across  the  Phase  II/III  program.  This  was  reversible  in  all  but  1  patient,  who

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experienced persistent urinary retention, potentially as a result of a delay in reporting symptoms and it required intermittent self-catheterization, which must be considered an important adverse event.

Serious cardiac events were identified in subjects on retigabine. Among others, these events included cardiac arrest/asystole and transient non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, following single doses of 900mg in an abuse liability study conducted in subjects with a history of recreational drug use. This information is described in the SPC in Section 4.9 - Overdose.

In  the  PCT  grouping,  there  were  3  deaths  (including  one  SUDEP)  out  of  427  patients  on  placebo (0.7%)  and  2  deaths  (including  one  SUDEP)  out  of  813  patients  in  the  Total  RTG  group  (0.2%) (1 patient in the 600 mg/day group and 1 patient in the 1200 mg/day group).

## Withdrawal and rebound potential

TEAEs in  patients  with  tapers  of  &gt;7  days  were  reported  for  17%  (6/36)  of  patients  in  the  placebo group and 26% (44/171) of patients in the Total RTG group. Among patients in the retigabine group, the overall TEAE incidence during the tapering phase was 28%, 21%, and 28% for the 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day dose groups. Headache, dizziness, nausea and abdominal pain were the TEAEs reported in more than 2 patients in the Total RTG group (5%, 3%, 2% and 2%, respectively) during tapering. Overall, TESAEs during tapering phase were reported for 1 patient receiving retigabine (convulsion in the 600 mg/day group) and none in the placebo group. In the PCTs abrupt withdrawal of study drug was defined as discontinuation of treatment of ≤ 7 days. In the PCTs, TEAEs reported upon abrupt discontinuation were reported for 42% (19/45) of patients in the  placebo  group  and  34%  (56/163)  of  patients  in  the  Total  RTG  group.  Among  patients  in  the retigabine group, the overall TEAE incidence upon abrupt discontinuation was 39%, 30%, and 36% for the 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day dose groups.  Convulsion (3%), tremor (3%), confusional state (3%), psychotic disorder (3%), dizziness (3%), somnolence (3%), vertigo (2%), coordination abnormal (2%) and aphasia (2%) were the TEAEs in more than 2 (1.2%) patients in the Total RTG group. TESAEs upon abrupt discontinuation of study drug were reported for 7 (16%) patients in the placebo group and 21 (13%) patients in the Total RTG group.  Among patients in the retigabine group, the overall TESAE incidence during tapering phase was 18%, 9%, and 13% for the 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day  dose  groups.  In  the  retigabine  groups,  convulsion,  psychotic  disorder  and  pregnancy  were TESAEs reported in more than one patient. There was no indication of rebound (including increased seizures) or withdrawal syndrome based on adverse events reported to the end of the post-treatment period. Comparison of TEAEs during taper versus abrupt discontinuation support a withdrawal/taper period. Recommendation that retigabine is withdrawn over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns require abrupt withdrawal, has been included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. Abuse Potential Medicinal product no longer authorised

Consistent with investigations conducted with other marketed AEDs retigabine has been investigated in pre-clinical studies and a formal Phase I drug abuse liability study. The results of these formed part of an 8-factor analysis which provided an established and accepted methodological framework in which to assess drug-abuse potential. The methodology also included evaluations of relevant pharmacology and scientific knowledge, any known abuse pattern, psychotropic effects or dependence liability and risk to public.

Retigabine  did  not  demonstrate  affinity  for  any  of  the  receptor  binding  sites  associated  with  the potential for abuse.

The  abuse  liability  study  indicated  that  retigabine  is  poorly  tolerated  in  recreational  drug  users particularly  when  administered  without  dose  titration  at  doses  considered  supra-therapeutic.  In contrast, dose titration in patient studies (Phase II/III) to similar dose levels as achieved in the Phase I study, indicated  a  low  incidence  of  adverse  events  typically  associated  with  evidence  of  drug  abuse potential.

A careful evaluation of all 8 factors and lines of evidence (particularly pre-clinical and clinical studies) indicated that the relative abuse liability of retigabine is similar to levetiracetam, which has not been associated with significant abuse.  Structural similarities of retigabine to flurpitine also suggest a low

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

potential for abuse.  The risk for abuse of retigabine and the potential for public health consequences associated with any potential abuse are considered minimal.

## Overdose

There is limited experience of overdose with retigabine. A dose that would constitute an overdose of study medication was not defined in the retigabine clinical trial program, and therefore, a computerized search strategy was implemented to identify a broad list of AEs potentially indicative of overdose in association with administered retigabine doses &gt;1200 mg. There were no deaths that resulted from an overdose with retigabine. A total of 5/1365 (0.4%) patients were determined to have had an overdose of retigabine; doses in excess of 2500 mg/day were reported. In addition to adverse reactions that are also typically seen at therapeutic doses, events reported with retigabine overdose included agitation, aggressive behaviour, and irritability. There were no reported sequelae.

These  adverse  reactions  have  been  included  in  SmPC  as  specific  to  overdose  with  retigabine.  In addition, coma was reported in a patient who ingested retigabine as part of a multi-drug overdose.

## Elderly population

Pregnancies A total of 11 pregnancies have occurred during the retigabine program to date. Eight pregnancies were reported in female patients exposed to retigabine while 3 pregnancies occurred in the female partners of  male  patients  taking  retigabine.  Of  the  8  female  patients  who  reported  pregnancies,  5  patients electively terminated their pregnancies, and 3 patients who had exposures for the first 9 days, 3 days, and 63 days of gestation, respectively, carried their babies to delivery. Of the 3 patients who delivered, 2 delivered full-term, healthy infants. The remaining patient, who had a 3 day exposure to retigabine, delivered a premature male infant with a patent ductus arteriosus and polydactyly at 27 5/7-weeks gestation. All 3 pregnancies occurring in the female partners of male patients resulted in normal births. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with retigabine in pregnant women and retigabine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. This is reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC that also recommends that Trobalt is not used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using contraception and that specialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. Laboratory findings The risk of haematological complications during retigabine treatment appeared low and comparable to placebo. A clear association between retigabine therapy and liver enzyme increase has been identified already in the clinical development programme. This is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC and addressed in the RMP. Please also refer to previous section on urinary/renal events.

Too few patients aged ≥ 65 years participated in the epilepsy programme. A number of 61 patients with PHN added to some extent experience, but both the daily retigabine dosages and the duration of exposure were clearly below that employed in the epilepsy programme.

The observed CNS adverse events, which are clearly more commonly reported in patients ≥ 65 years, i.e. somnolence 38% vs. 28%), memory impairment (10% vs. 5%), amnesia (7% vs. 5 %), tremor 5%  vs.  0%),  balance  disorder  (7%  vs.  3%),    and  speech  disorder  (3%  vs.  0  %)  are  particularly problematic in an elderly population.

In view of the worse safety and tolerability profile of retigabine in elderly patients compared to young patients, as suggested also by the study in post herpetic neuralgia patients, further specifications and tightening of the recommendations for use of retigabine in the elderly population are introduced in the SmPC. Starting,  maintenance,  and  maximum  doses  are  now  specified  in  Section  4.2,  Posology  and Method of Administration. In particular, the proposal not to recommend doses higher than 900 mg/day is in accordance with the PK data in elderly and is endorsed. Appropriate clarifications and additions of

the  QT  interval  issue  have  been  included,  and  a  paragraph  on  the  possible  increased  risks  in  the elderly population has been introduced in the SmPC Section 4.4, Special Warnings and Precautions for Use.

## Paediatric population

The lower age limit was 16 years and 18 years in the 205 and 301/302 studies, respectively, so no paediatric data are available.

## Gender

No clear difference  in  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  noted  between  genders  in  the  phase  III clinical trials.

## Race

Too few patients of non-Caucasian race were included to allow for conclusions on possible differences. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions Retigabine  had  little  or  no  effects  on  the  trough  concentrations  of  carbamazepine,  clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, pgenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate, and zonisamide. Retigabine co-administration has been associated with a 20% decrease  in  lamotrigine  plasma  levels.  In  the  available  reports,  there  was  no  evidence  that concomitant treatment with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, or valproate have any clinically relevant effect on the clearance of retigabine. No interactions have been detected between retigabine, estrogens, progesterone and alcohol. A higher number of adverse  events  (88%)  was  reported  when  retigabine  was  associated  with  levetiracetam. With few exceptions (carbamazepine and, to a lesser extent, valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine), there  were  no  remarkable  differences  in  specific  adverse  event  reports  across  differing  drug combinations. Discontinuation due to adverse events In the Clinical Pharmacology Studies grouping, there has been a generally low incidence of treatment emergent adverse events leading to withdrawal (32/469, 7% of retigabine-treated subjects). The most frequent  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  was  rash  (5  subjects,  1%).  All  other  specific  AEs  led  to discontinuation in &lt;1% of subjects. AEs leading to discontinuation in more than 1 subject were chills (3  subjects),  extrasystoles,  ventricular  extrasystoles,  feeling  drunk,  headache,  dizziness,  tremor, nausea, and vertigo (each event in 2 subjects). Most of the discontinuations in this grouping were reported in studies that evaluated higher individual doses and titration schedules, which were nearly twice as rapid as that used in patients with epilepsy.

In the pivotal controlled trials, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to discontinuation were reported for greater proportions of retigabine patients than for placebo patients (11% placebo versus 25% Total RTG). The most common (&gt;2% in Total RTG group) TEAEs leading to discontinuation were  dizziness  (6%),  confusional  state  (4%),  fatigue  (3%),  and  somnolence  (3%).  Among  the retigabine dose groups, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported for 17%, 25%, and 31% of the 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day groups, respectively (see Table 7).

There appeared to be a retigabine dose relationship for discontinuations due to dizziness (1%, 3%, 6%, and 8% of the placebo, 600 mg/day, 900 mg/day, and 1200 mg/day groups) and confusional state (&lt;1%, 1%, 3%, and 8%, respectively).

The proportion of patients and preferred term categories of AEs leading to discontinuation were similar in the PCTs and all Phase II/III Combined groupings, indicating that the incidence and type of TEAEs leading to discontinuation remained similar with longer retigabine exposure.

Data Source: m2.7.4, Table 9.05 The rates of withdrawal and predominance of CNS-related events leading to withdrawal are comparable to other AEDs administered in this patient population. For the ongoing open-label Phase III extension studies (Study 303 and 304), an additional 8 TEAEs leading to premature withdrawal were reported in 7 patients between the integrated safety database cut-off  date  (30  June  2008)  and  the  submission  cut-off  date  (31 December  2008).    No  event  was reported in more than one patient.  None was an SAE, and all resolved with the exception of fatigue. The titration  scheme  (150  mg/7  days  titration)  may  be  the  principal  explanation  for  the  number  of premature discontinuations which mostly occurred during the titration period. Post marketing experience N/A 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety Safety assessment of retigabine in the originally submitted application was based on 2.168 exposed subjects, whereof 813 participated in the 3 placebo controlled trials 205, 301 and 302. A total of 2034 subjects were exposed to at least one dose of retigabine in the epilepsy clinical development program. After exclusion of the transition phase, this subgroup, contributed a total of 211 exposure years, with a median drug exposure of 112 days. The total exposure to RTG in Phase II and Phase III trials, was 1.131 years (median 235), with 229 subjects being exposed for &gt; 1 year. During the review process, additional safety data from the 7 clinical pharmacology trials have been submitted, contributing data from 196 subjects of whom 194 received retigabine.

A very limited amount of data has been provided on persons aged 65 years and above, a population subgroup very relevant for the clinical scope of RTG. Additional data for 61 subjects &gt; 65 years were submitted  from  a  study  in  patients  with  post  herpetic  neuralgia.  However,  the  dose  exposure  in particular and the treatment duration was below that for the patients in the epilepsy program. Thus, the value of the contribution was limited. When adverse events in patients ≥ 65 years treated with retigabine were compared to adverse events in patients in the same age group treated with placebo, an  overweight  of  findings  was  evident  in  the  retigabine  group.  Also  in  the  comparisons  between adverse events across the age groups ≥65 and &lt; 65 years of age, there is a distinct preponderance. Of special note is the predominance of nervous system and psychiatric events, which are noteworthy in this age group that is often fragile, especially with regard to CNS adverse effects. Relevant warnings have been included in the SmPC for the elderly patients with partial epilepsy.

In general, severity and frequency of TEAEs appeared to increase in a dose dependent manner. This pattern  was  recognizable  with  regard  to  the  most  frequent  CNS  related  adverse  events,  such  as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. Occurrence of adverse events impacting on cognitive function, like memory and attention impairment was high and adverse events of particular importance for daily life activities  such  as  balance/gait  disturbance  and  language  were  also  frequent.  There  was  agreement between the AEs considered to be treatment related and the overall reported AE incidence.

Hallucinations and psychosis were also dose-related, and visual hallucinations and psychosis were only reported with retigabine and not with placebo.

Although the numbers are small, and the dose-response relationship is not entirely clear, there are indications that retigabine may cause urinary retention/hesitation in a small proportion of patients. The potential  causal  relationship  is  supported  by  mechanistic  and  non-clinical  findings.  It  cannot  be excluded that the one SAE of renal failure was caused by the potential of retigabine to induce urinary retention.

There were also findings indicating that retigabine is associated with events caused by urinary crystals such as nephrolithiasis.

For CNS-related adverse events and renal/urinary tract adverse events, the mean duration for these adverse events was 42 days for retigabine treated patients versus 37 days for placebo treated patients. The  corresponding  figures  for  the  median  duration  were  24  and  16  days,  respectively.  Thus,  a distinction of the overall duration between patients treated with retigabine or placebo is clear.

A considerable part of the adverse events must be regarded as persistent. On the other hand, adverse events, which were not ongoing at the end of the pivotal trials, constituted the majority. Generally, one quarter of CNS and urinary adverse events had disappeared after one week and about half after one month, be it on retigabine or on placebo. It should be emphasised that the data included only patients where the CNS and urinary events did not lead to withdrawal.

RTG treatment was associated with a modest increase of QTc interval in a dose dependent manner. The clinical  significance  of  this  finding  is  uncertain.  However,  in  SmPC  section  4.4,  Special  warnings  and Precautions for use, warnings have been introduced, and it is recommended that an ECG is recorded in patients at risk before initiation of treatment and in those with a corrected QT interval &gt;440 ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. With the modest QTc increase observed, it is considered disproportionate to require recommendations of baseline ECG for all patients.

Serious cardiac events were identified in subjects on retigabine. Among others, these events included cardiac  arrest/asystole  and  transient  non-sustained  ventricular  tachycardia.  However,  in  the  pivotal clinical  trials  there  does  not  appear to be any pattern in cardiac AEs observed with retigabine when compared with placebo.

Dose dependent weight gain was observed during RTG treatment. However, the issue is considered to be modest and probably in the same range as several other AEDs.

Retigabine did not seem to possess a proconvulsive potential.

The risk of sudden unexplained deaths in epilepsy (SUDEP) with RTG treatment was lower than that with placebo and the SUDEP rate reported in the PCTs was within the range of SUDEP rates published in the literature. Overall, the figures are small and a firm conclusion is not easy to draw.

RTG treatment discontinuation related to TEAEs, ranging between 17.4 and 31.3%, was higher than in the placebo group (10.5%), and clearly dose dependent. In addition TEAE related RTG discontinuation rates  are  higher  than  those  reported  in  clinical  trials  with  most  other  AEDs  marketed  during  recent years.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

A  multitude  of  adverse  events  (in  particular  related  to  CNS  and  the  renal/urinary  system)  are associated with retigabine. Some of them show a dose-response relationship; for some the relation to dose is less clear. None of them are unique to retigabine since they are also observed with other AEDs to the same, in a few cases to a higher degree, but in many cases to a lesser degree. Retigabine is associated with weight gain, but this issue is unlikely to be significantly different from the weight gain seen with several other AEDs. Also, a modest QTc prolongation is associated with the 1200 mg/day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose of retigabine. This increase may be unique to retigabine compared to other AEDs. Furthermore, some cases of serious cardiac arrhythmia were seen. In keeping with this wide range of safety issues, discontinuation rate because of TEAEs was high, also in comparison with other recently marketed AEDs.

The main safety results have been addressed in the SmPC. In addition, post-authorisation studies and risk minimisation measures have been proposed by the Applicant and agreed by the CHMP.

Regarding  the  risk  of  voiding  dysfunction  and  urinary  retention  an  epidemiological  study  using  a healthcare  database  in  the  US  (Healthcare  Inc.  Research  Database)  has  been  proposed  in  the  Risk Management Plan. A draft protocol has been submitted and the objective, practical considerations and power calculations are considered sufficient.

Regarding  the  risk  of  neuropsychiatric  disorders  the  Applicant  has  proposed  to  further  characterize these  risks  by  close  monitoring  of  withdrawal  from  future  clinical  studies.  A  potential  relationship between age and the occurrence of neuropsychiatric side effects should be part of the characterization. To reduce the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders and to optimize compliance during dose titration in the first weeks of therapy, a provision of starter packs has been proposed as a risk minimisation activity. This  approach  was  endorsed  by  the  Committee,  but  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  classify  the treatment  initiation  pack  as  a  routine  risk  minimisation  measure,  and  to  describe  it  as  a  routine measure.

The  Pharmacovigilance  actions  aimed  at  characterising  most  of  the  important  potential  risks  were endorsed. Specialist  prescriber  education  about  the  risk  of  urinary  retention/voiding  dysfunction  and  QT prolongation  at  the  time  of  prescription  via  a  one-pager  outlining  the  risks  and  the  need  for appropriate patient information are endorsed for the safe and effective use. The risk of hallucination and psychotic  disorders  and  the  risk  of  accident  or  injury  secondary  to  neuropsychiatric  events  are both  well  managed  by  SmPC/PIL  in  connection  with  the  proposed  treatment  initiation  pack  as additional measure. Regarding  the  lack  of  information  on  treatment  of  elderly  subjects,  the  Applicant  has  proposed  to evaluate safety in elderly patient's in future clinical studies. Data from the proposed epidemiological study will also be used in the characterization of the risk of retigabine use in the elderly. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

Caution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase QT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years of age and above. In these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of treatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. • PIL Section 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Retigabine overdoses in excess of 2500 mg/day were reported during clinical studies. In addition to adverse reactions seen at therapeutic doses, symptoms of retigabine overdose included agitation, aggressive behaviour and irritability. There were no reported sequelae. In a study in volunteers, cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest/asystole or ventricular tachycardia) occurred in two subjects within 3 hours of receiving a single 900 mg retigabine dose. The arrhythmias spontaneously resolved, and both volunteers recovered without sequelae. Treatment In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient is given appropriate supportive therapy as clinically indicated, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Further management should be as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. • PIL Sections 2 and 3 |

These effects generally occurred within the first 8 weeks of treatment, and frequently led to treatment withdrawal in affected patients. It is recommended that patients are advised about the risk of these possible effects. • SmPC Section 4.7: Adverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, diplopia and blurred vision were reported in controlled clinical studies, particularly during titration (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients are advised about the risk of such adverse reactions at treatment initiation and following each titration step, and that they are advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have established how Trobalt affects them. As there is individual variation in response to all AED therapy, it is recommended that prescribers discuss with patients the specific issues of epilepsy and driving. • SmPC Section 4.8: Psychiatric disorders Common : Confusional state, Psychotic disorders, Hallucinations, Disorientation, Anxiety Nervous system disorders Very common : Dizziness, Somnolence Common : Amnesia, Aphasia, Coordination abnormal, Vertigo, Paraesthesia, Tremor, Balance disorder, Memory impairment, Dysphasia, Dysarthria, Disturbance in attention, Gait disturbance, Myoclonus Uncommon : Hypokinesia • PIL Sections 2 and 4 • Optimise compliance with dose titration by provision of treatment initiation no longer authorised |

A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for Trobalt. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice if signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. • PIL Section 2 longer |

| Exposure during pregnancy and lactation         | Routine activities • Routine pharmacovigilance                       | • SmPC Section 4.6: Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity because the plasma levels achieved in these studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses (see section 5.3). In a developmental study in rats whose mothers were treated with retigabine during pregnancy, there was a delay in auditory startle response development of the offspring (see section 5.3). The clinical significance of this finding is not known. Trobalt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using contraception. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether retigabine is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of retigabine and/or its metabolites in breast milk (see section 5.3). A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Trobalt should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Trobalt therapy to the woman. • PIL Section 2 no longer authorised |

| Medicinal                       | • Routine pharmacovigilance. • Active recruitment of patients aged ≥65 years into planned safety and efficacy studies to support a modified release formulation of retigabine for use in epilepsy. • Review of data from post-herpetic neuralgia study which included patients ≥65 years. • In future Phase III studies sparse sampling techniques will be used to monitor retigabine pharmacokinetics. Population PK analyses will be conducted to evaluate the impact of covariates, such as age, on retigabine clearance as part of the analyses and reporting of the Phase III studies. product | • SmPC Section 4.2: Elderly (65 years of age and above) There are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of retigabine in patients aged 65 years and above. A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients. The total daily starting dose is 150 mg/day and during the titration period. Thereafter, the total daily dose should be increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response and tolerability. Doses greater than 900 mg/day are not recommended (see Sections 4.4 and 5.2). • Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use QT interval Caution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase QT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years of age and above. In these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of treatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product (see as detailed in section 2.3):

Prior  to  launch  in  each  Member  State  the  MAH  shall  agree  the  final  educational  material  with  the National Competent Authority. The  MAH  shall  ensure  that,  at  launch,  all  physicians  who  are  expected  to  prescribe  TROBALT  are provided with a physician information pack containing the following elements: · The Summary of Product Characteristics · A physician's guide to prescribing including the following key messages: o The need to inform patients that TROBALT may cause or potentiate symptoms of urinary retention/urinary hesitation o The need to inform patients on adverse events related to QT interval prolongation o Caution when using TROBALT in patients with a cardiac disease or those taking medicines concomitantly known to cause QT prolongation o The  need  to  inform  patients  to  comply  with  dose  titration  to  minimize  the  risk  of hallucination and psychotic disorders User consultation The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 2.8. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Overall  the  epilepsy  development  programme  of  retigabine  provides  evidence  of  efficacy  in  partial onset epilepsy as add-on therapy. This evidence is primarily based on one phase IIB trial (study 205) and two phase III trials (studies 301 and 302), which combined randomized 1244 subjects, 427 to placebo and  813 to three dose regimens of RTG of 600, 900 and 1200 mg daily respectively.

- Beneficial effects

It is acknowledged that there is a high medical need in the partial epilepsy patient population. Based on  the  integrated  analysis  and  concerning  the  primary  endpoint  of  responder  rate  during  the maintenance phase, statistically significant superiority to placebo was demonstrated across all three dose regimens, but this was consistent only for the 1200 mg daily dose regimen, whereas superiority to  placebo was shown for the two other regimens in one of the studies (302), but not in the other (205). There was a dose response effect with responder rates of 28-39%  (600 mg ), 40-47% (900 mg) and 41-55% (1200 mg), compared to 19-26% for placebo. For the original primary endpoint of median percent reduction in seizure frequency in study 205, superiority to placebo was demonstrated for the 900 mg and 1200 mg regimens, but not for the 600 mg. Efficacy of retigabine in the PCTs is within the range defined by similar studies of other new AEDs as add-on therapy in refractory epilepsy.

- Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

The Study 205 differed somewhat from studies 301 and 302 with regard to study design, inclusion criteria  and  the  formulation  of  trial  medication.  Integration  of  efficacy  results  across  studies  was achieved by post-hoc analysis in study 205, in which the per protocol primary endpoint was different from the primary endpoints in studies 301 and 302.

The  unique  pharmacologic  mechanism  of  action  of  retigabine  (first-in-class  M-current  potassium channel opener) does not - in itself - add positively to the benefit-risk balance unless accompanied by clinical data that point to a unique effect not accomplished with other AEDs. However, the Applicant has  provided  data  indicating  that  retigabine  is  efficacious  even  in  patients  with  inadequate  seizure control on two or more AEDs.

## Risks

· Unfavourable effects Several safety issues were identified with a dose dependent pattern as their most common feature. Retigabine  treatment  was  associated  with  an  increase  of  frequent  CNS  related  adverse  events, occurrence of visual hallucinations and psychotic disorder exclusively in the RTG treatment groups, and frequent, and in some cases serious, renal and urinary tract symptoms. There was lack of sufficient data to assess teratogenicity in humans.  Other  safety issues emerging  from the preclinical pharmacology studies, apart from general CNS signs, were a reduction of smooth muscle contractility affecting urinary and gall bladder function, and a probable interaction with thiopental, contrary to other anaesthetic agents. CNS  related  adverse  events,  such  as  dizziness,  somnolence  and  fatigue  were  frequent  and  dose dependent. Occurrence of adverse events impacting on cognitive function, like memory and attention impairment  was  high  and  adverse  events  of  particular  importance  for  daily  life  activities  such  as balance/gait disturbance and language were also frequent. Hallucinations and psychosis were also dose related, and visual hallucinations and psychosis were only reported with retigabine but not with placebo. Renal  and  urinary  tract  related  adverse  events  were  frequent  and  dose  related.  Nephrolithiasis  was reported in 4 cases occurring all in the 1200 mg RTG group. Serious urinary retention was irreversible in one case, requiring intermittent self-catheterization. The  majority  of  CNS  and  urinary  adverse  events  not  leading  to  withdrawal  disappeared  during  the course of the studies. About one quarter disappeared after one week and about half after one month. Retigabine treatment was associated with a modest increase of QTc interval in a dose dependent manner. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. However, in SmPC section 4.4, Special warnings and Precautions for use, warnings have been introduced, and it is recommended that an ECG is recorded in patients at risk before initiation of treatment and in those with a corrected QT interval &gt;440 ms at baseline, an ECG should be recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. With the modest QTc increase observed, it is considered disproportionate to require recommendations of baseline ECG for all patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Serious cardiac events were identified in subjects on retigabine. Among others, these events included cardiac  arrest/asystole  and  transient  non-sustained  ventricular  tachycardia.  However,  in  the  pivotal clinical  trials  there  does  not  appear to be any pattern in cardiac AEs observed with retigabine when compared with placebo.

RTG treatment discontinuation related to TEAEs, ranging between 17.4 and 31.3%, was higher than in the placebo group (10.5%), and clearly dose dependent. In addition TEAE related RTG discontinuation rates  are  higher  than  those  reported  in  clinical  trials  with  most  other  AEDs  marketed  during  recent years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Retigabine and other AEDs share many of the same safety and tolerability problems, especially with respect  to  CNS  effects.  The  Applicant  has  not  provided  additional  documentation  to  counter  the impression from the comparisons made to other AEDs that retigabine belongs to the category of AEDs with the most frequent CNS as well as other adverse events. It is agreed that in many instances the tolerability issues associated with retigabine may be manageable by slowly titrating/adjusting the dose or discontinuing the medication and shifting to another - as is the case with other AEDs.

A limited amount of data is provided on persons aged ≥ 65 years, a population subgroup relevant for the clinical scope of RTG. Additional safety and tolerability data were provided in 89 elderly patients (61 on retigabine) with post herpetic neuralgia (PHN), but with a lower dosage and shorter time of exposure  than  in  the  epilepsy  programme.  A  poorer  tolerability  in  the  elderly  compared  with  the younger  population,  in  particular  with  regard  to  CNS  and  urinary  events  was  suggested.  The predominance of nervous system and psychiatric events, which are noteworthy in this age group that is often fragile, especially with regard to CNS adverse effects. However, appropriate strengthening and additions have been included in the SmPC text to address these concerns.

The risk of SUDEP with RTG treatment was lower than that with placebo and was within the range of SUDEP  rates  published  in  the  literature,  but  it  was  much  higher  than  SUDEP  rates  reported  for population based epilepsy cohorts. Overall, the figures were small and firm conclusions were not easy to draw.

## Benefit-risk balance

- Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

A high medical need in the partial epilepsy patient population is undisputed, and evidence of efficacy of retigabine in patients with partial onset epilepsy as add-on therapy has been provided.

The  forced  titration  regimens  used  in  the  clinical  studies  may  have  resulted  in  more  pronounced tolerability  problems  compared  to  the  individual  titration  based  on  each  patient's  efficacy  and tolerability  used  in  normal  clinical  practice.  This  is  likely  to  result  in  an  overestimation  of  adverse events compared to clinical conditions outside a study protocol where doses are likely to be titrated in a more lenient way. However, this would also be the case for adverse events rates reported from other studies with other AEDs employing forced titration regimens.

- Benefit-risk balance

Overall,  there  is  robust  evidence  for  a  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  of  the  retigabine 1200 mg/day  dose.  There  is  also  evidence  for  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  of  the 900 mg/day  dose,  but  this  is  less  consistent.  The  effect  of  the  600  mg/day  dose  is  less  consistent compared  to  the  two  higher  doses.  The  efficacy  results  are  observed  even  in  patients  with  a background treatment of two or more AEDs, i.e. patients who must be categorised as quite resistant to treatment.

As discussed above, a multitude of adverse events (in particular related to CNS and the renal/urinary system) are associated with retigabine. Some of them show a dose-response relationship; for some the relation to dose is less clear. None of the CNS effects are unique to retigabine since they are also observed with other AEDs to the same, in a few cases to a higher degree, but in many cases to a lesser degree. Retigabine is associated with weight gain, but this issue is unlikely to be significantly different  from  the  weight  gain  seen  with  several  other  AEDs.  Also,  a  modest  QTc  prolongation  is associated with the 1200 mg/day dose of retigabine.

## 2.8.1. Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The efficacy of retigabine has been documented in patients with partial epilepsy in the add-on setting. With the caveat that direct, within-study comparisons have not been conducted, the efficacy at the 900 and 1200 mg/day doses is in the same range as that observed with other AEDs in the add-on setting. Clinically relevant effects were also seen in the subsets of patients who were treated with two or more AEDs, i.e. significantly refractory patients. In line with what is seen with existing AEDs, numerous CNSrelated  as  well  as  other  adverse  events  are  associated  with  retigabine.  Viewed  isolated,  no  single safety and tolerability problem observed with retigabine should in itself preclude marketing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

authorisation. But the combined evidence suggests that retigabine may belong to the worse end of the spectrum of currently marketed AEDs with respect to safety and tolerability.

However, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive despite the shortcomings mentioned above. There  is  a  significant  unmet  medical  need  in  epilepsy  and  treatments  for  patients  not  responding adequately  to  or  not  tolerating  antiepileptic  drugs  are  often  shifted  to  or  supplemented  with  other AEDs based on an individual, patient-by-patient assessment of efficacy, safety and tolerability (as well as  other  factors).  Furthermore,  patients  are  individually  titrated  to  reach  a  satisfactory  balance between  seizure  control  and  adverse  events.  If  unacceptable  side  effects  occur,  the  dose  can  be lowered  or  the  drug  discontinued,  and  since  the  vast  majority  of  adverse  events  will  be  reversible, permanent  harm  is  unlikely.  Thus,  retigabine  with  its  novel  mechanism  of  action  and  documented efficacy in significantly treatment resistant patients could serve as an option - a 'building block' - in the armamentarium of AEDs from which the treating physician can choose in order to tailor the optimal antiepileptic treatment for a specific patient.

Retigabine  is  not  a  first-line  AED,  but  is  considered,  in  the  adjunctive  setting,  capable  of  serving  a useful  purpose  as  one  of  several  AEDs  the  neurologist  can  use  to  supplement  the  antiepileptic treatment and find an appropriate balance between seizure control and adverse events. 2.8.2. Risk management plan A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that: · Pharmacovigilance activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to investigate further some of the safety concerns · The following additional risk minimisation activities were required (see as detailed in section 2.3): Prior to launch in each Member State the MAH shall agree the final educational material with the National Competent Authority. The MAH shall ensure that, at launch, all physicians who are expected to prescribe TROBALT are provided with a physician information pack containing the following elements: · The Summary of Product Characteristics · A physician's guide to prescribing including the following key messages: o The need to inform patients that TROBALT may cause or potentiate symptoms of urinary retention/urinary hesitation o The need to inform patients on adverse events related to QT interval prolongation o Caution when using TROBALT in patients with a cardiac disease or those taking medicines concomitantly known to cause QT prolongation o The need to inform patients to comply with dose titration to minimize the risk of hallucination and psychotic disorders 2.9.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Trobalt  in  the  adjunctive  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or without secondary generalisation in adults aged 18 years and above with epilepsy was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
