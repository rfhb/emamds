## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

VIMKUNYA is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 12 years and older.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

A single dose of 0.8 ml should be administered.

Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of VIMKUNYA in children below 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid muscle.

VIMKUNYA must not be injected intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.

The pre-filled syringe should be vigorously shaken immediately before use to obtain a homogeneous suspension.

For instructions on handling and the disposal of waste material, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of VIMKUNYA.

## Immunocompromised individuals

The safety and efficacy of VIMKUNYA has not been assessed in patients with immunodeficiency and patients using systemic immunosuppressive therapies. It is not known whether individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, will elicit the same response as immunocompetent individuals to the vaccine regimen.

## Anxiety-related reactions

As with all injectable vaccines, anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution to individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular injection in these individuals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, protection may not be elicited after vaccination in all persons. It is recommended to continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination.

## Excipients

## Potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed.

Concomitant administration of VIMKUNYA with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

In animal studies, no vaccine-related adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed in rats and rabbits; some postnatal effects of unknown clinical relevance were seen only in rabbits (see section 5.3).

There is limited amount of data from the use of VIMKUNYA in pregnant women. These data are not sufficient to conclude on the absence of potential effects of VIMKUNYA on pregnancy, embryofoetal development, parturition and post-natal development.

Decisions to administer VIMKUNYA during pregnancy should take into consideration the individual's risk of exposure to wild-type CHIKV, gestational age, and risks to the foetus or neonate.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown if VIMKUNYA is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VIMKUNYA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from VIMKUNYA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No specific studies have been performed on fertility.

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on ability to drive or operate machines have been performed. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common local adverse reaction at the injection site after vaccine administration was injection site pain (24.0%). The most common systemic adverse reactions observed after vaccination were fatigue (17.8%), headache (16.7%) and myalgia (16.5%) (Table 1).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The tabulated summary of the adverse reactions following administration of VIMKUNYA (Table 1) is based on an analysis of the pooled safety data gathered from three completed phase 2 studies and two completed phase 3 studies on 3 522 participants ≥ 12 years old who received VIMKUNYA. Of these, 3 141 individuals received a single 40 micrograms dose of VIMKUNYA. These participants were followed up for serious adverse events over the entire study period of 182 days.

Adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA System Organ Class. The adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency:

## Paediatric population - adolescents

Of the 3 522 clinical study participants administered VIMKUNYA, 6.2% (N=217) were between 12 to &lt; 18 years of age who received one dose of 40 micrograms of VIMKUNYA with a follow up of 182 days. The safety profile in adolescents is similar to the overall safety profile in adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported in clinical trials. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: other viral vaccines, ATC code: not yet assigned

## Mechanism of action

VIMKUNYA is an adjuvanted VLP recombinant protein vaccine. VLPs cannot infect cells, reproduce, or cause disease. The exact mechanism of protection against CHIKV infection and/or disease has not been determined. It is thought that VIMKUNYA can induce protection from CHIKV infection by inducing neutralising antibodies against the CHIKV proteins C, E1, and E2 contained in VIMKUNYA resulting in neutralisation of live virus. An adjuvant is added to increase the magnitude of vaccinemediated immune responses.

## Immunogenicity

No efficacy data are available for VIMKUNYA. The clinical efficacy was inferred from a postvaccination CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody titre threshold.

A threshold of anti-CHIKV serum neutralising antibody (SNA) titre ≥ 100, providing 80% neutralisation of CHIKV, as measured by an in vitro neutralizing assay, was selected as surrogate marker likely to predict protection from disease caused by CHIKV, referred to as seroresponse. This threshold was determined on the basis of a prospective sero-epidemiologic study in individuals with prior exposure to CHIKV and a non-human primate (NHP) passive transfer/challenge study using pooled sera from participants vaccinated with VIMKUNYA vaccine.

The immunogenicity of a single 40 micrograms dose of VIMKUNYA was evaluated in two pivotal studies conducted in the US, one phase 3 clinical study in adolescents and adults 12 to &lt; 65 years of age (Study 1), and one phase 3 clinical study in adults ≥ 65 years of age (Study 2). Participants in both

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

phase 3 studies were followed up for 6 months after vaccination. Difference in anti-CHIKV SNA seroresponse rate (VIMKUNYA vaccine minus placebo) and anti-CHIKV SNA geometric mean titre (GMT) at 21 days post-vaccination (study visit day 22) were both co-primary endpoints. The seroresponse rate (SRR) was defined as the percentage of individuals who achieved an anti-CHIKV SNA NT80 titre ≥ 100. Immunocompromised individuals and individuals with prior receipt of immunosuppressive medications from 6 months prior to screening medications were excluded from study participation.

## Study 1

This study was a phase 3 pivotal, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical study conducted in the US. A total of 3 258 healthy participants aged between 12 and &lt; 65 years of age (mean age 39 years of age [range 12 to 64]) were randomised in a 2:2:2:1 ratio within each age stratum (12 to &lt; 18 (N = 254; 7.8%), 18 to &lt; 46 (N = 1 906; 58.5%), and 46 to &lt; 65 years of age (N = 1 098; 33.7%)) to receive either one of three consecutively manufactured lots of VIMKUNYA as a single intramuscular 40 micrograms dose in a pre-filled syringe, or placebo. In the randomised population, 1 591 (48.8%) were males and 1 667 (51.2%) were females. There were 69 baseline seropositive participants (defined as Day 1 predose anti-CHIKV titre ≥ 15 ( ≥ assay lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ)) whose 63 participants of them in the VIMKUNYA group and 6 in the placebo group.

The immune response of 2 559 participants (immunogenicity evaluable population [IEP]) who received VIMKUNYA and 424 participants who received placebo was analysed. All participants from IEP were seronegative at baseline (pre-vaccination) for CHIKV neutralising antibodies. The comparison of the anti-CHIKV SNA response to VIMKUNYA and placebo at study visit days 8, 15, 22, and 183 as measured by clinically relevant difference in seroresponse rate and GMT is shown in Table 2 and Table 3.

## Study 2

This study was a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study design with two treatment groups (VIMKUNYA or placebo). This was a multicentre study in the US with 413 healthy participants ≥ 65 years of age enrolled. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single 40 micrograms dose of VIMKUNYA or placebo. The target population was adults ≥ 65 years of age (mean age 71 years of age [range 65 to 95]) stratified by age subgroups (65 to &lt; 75 (N = 318; 77%) and ≥ 75 years of age (N = 95; 23%)). In the randomised population, 171 (41%) participants were males and 242 (59%) were females. Participants in this study were followed up for 6 months after immunisation. There were 15 baseline seropositive participants (defined as Day 1 predose anti-CHIKV titre ≥ 15 (≥ lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ]) whose 5 participants of them in the VIMKUNYA group and 10 in the placebo group. The immunogenicity evaluable population included 372 participants, of which 189 participants received VIMKUNYA and 183 participants received placebo. All these participants were negative at baseline (pre-vaccination) for CHIKV neutralising antibodies.

The comparison of the anti-CHIKV SNA response to VIMKUNYA and placebo at study visit days 15, 22, and 183 as measured by clinically relevant difference in seroresponse rate and GMT is shown in Table 4 and Table 5.

b n is the number of participants with a sample result available at the indicated visit.

c Geometric mean titre estimates, together with their 95% CIs, are derived from an ANOVA model that includes site and treatment group as fixed effects, assuming normality of the log titres. Ratio of GMT and 95% CIs are derived from the same model. p-value tests equivalence of group GMT on the log scale (ie, ratio of GMT equal to 1).

d Nominal p-value (formal adjustments for multiple comparisons were not applied).

In the phase 3 studies (Study 1, Study 2), among the different age groups, the seroresponse rate (anti-CHIKV SNA NT8 0 titre ≥ 100) and GMT measured in the VIMKUNYA group at Day 22 (21 days postvaccination) were as follows: 12 to &lt; 18: 97.0%, GMT 2 502; 18 to &lt; 46: 98.3%, GMT 1 878; 46 to &lt; 65: 97.2%, GMT 1 175; ≥ 65 to &lt; 75: 87.9%, GMT 726; and ≥ 75 years of age 85.0%, GMT 716.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with VIMKUNYA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for active immunisation for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity, and local tolerance.

## Reproductive toxicity

Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were performed in female rabbits and rats with administration of multiple doses of VIMKUNYA prior to mating and during gestation. No vaccinerelated adverse effects on female fertility or embryofetal development were observed in any species. A decrease in the postnatal survival index was observed in rabbits but not in rats; the human relevance of this finding is not known.

## 1. What VIMKUNYA is and what it is used for

VIMKUNYA is a vaccine used to prevent disease caused by the chikungunya virus in people 12 years of age and older.

VIMKUNYA is a vaccine that contains part of the 'outer coating' of the chikungunya virus. This 'outer coating' is not infectious and cannot cause chikungunya disease but teaches the immune system (the body's natural defences) how to protect itself against the virus that causes chikungunya disease.

Chikungunya disease is caused by the chikungunya virus, which is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease is found in countries across Asia, Africa and the subtropical regions of the Americas. Most people infected with the virus develop fever, rash, and severe pain in multiple joints that typically resolve between one to two weeks, but symptoms may last for months or years.

## 2. What you need to know before you use VIMKUNYA

You should not receive VIMKUNYA if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given VIMKUNYA if:

- -you have ever had a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) or breathing problems after any other vaccine administration.
- -you have ever fainted following any injection.
- -you have a severe illness or infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). You can still have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- -you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency), or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or cancer medicines).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have a problem with bleeding or bruising (such as thrombocytopenia or haemophilia) or if you are taking an anticoagulant (a medicine to prevent blood clots).
