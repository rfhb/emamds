## 1. Introduction

On 7 and 8 September 2015, the MAH submitted 3 paediatric clinical study reports in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. Each of these represented a follow-up report resulting from assessment of antibody persistence and/or responses to a booster dose several years after the primary vaccination.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided for each of the three submissions.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

In November 2013, a letter was sent to the EMA to inform about a delay in providing the clinical study reports for the MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M56 and EXT081 M68 data and to explain the reason for the delay. These data from EXT081 M56 and M68/69 (pre/post-boost) are submitted in parallel as follows:

MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M56 is a follow-up study at 56 months of the primary study MenACWYTT-081. MenACWY-TT-081 was submitted as part of the initial MAA for Nimenrix.

MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M68 is a follow-up study at 68 months of the primary study MenACWYTT-081. It includes a booster dose at M68 and data on post-boost immune responses at M69.

The third clinical study report submitted concerns a separate study:

MenACWY-TT-043 EXT036 Y5 represents the follow-up to Year 5 of children who were initially enrolled into MenACWY-TT-036 . The primary phase study MenACWY-TT-036, as well as the follow-up study after 2 years (MenACWYTT 043 EXT 036 Y2) were submitted as part of the initial MAA for Nimenrix. The Year 3 and Year 4 follow-up data (MenACWY-TT-043 EXT036 Y3 &amp; MenACWY-TT-043 EXT036 Y4) were submitted and assessed under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 in April 2013 (art 46 reference P46/0034 &amp; P46/0035).

A variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies to update the SmPC with available persistence and booster data) is expected to be submitted by December 2015.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

Nimenrix was developed specifically for use in children and adults. The same formulation and dose is used across the full age range approved.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted three reports as described above.

## 2.3.2. Clinical studies

## Study 081 Children 2-10 years vs. Menjugate

The study was conducted in 2008-9 in France and Germany. In the original study 400 subjects were to be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to ACWY-TT or Menjugate. There was stratified enrolment to provide ~200 subjects aged 2-5 and ~200 aged 6-10 years, which was to provide power to meet the immunogenicity criterion of at least 85.6%. All 414 subjects enrolled and vaccinated completed the initial phase. The mean age was 5.6 years (3.5 and 7.8 years in the two age strata) with a balanced gender distribution. Almost all subjects were of European Caucasian descent.

Only rSBA functional antibody responses (assayed at GSK's laboratories) were reported from the initial study but hSBA data were planned to be generated in follow-up. Based on rSBA, non-inferiority of ACWY-TT vs. Menjugate was demonstrated for responses to MenC based on a lower bound of the 95% CI that was -5.25%, with virtually no difference in response rates between vaccines for each subset according to baseline MenC serostatus. Response rates to ACWY-TT for each meningococcal group were higher in the subsets seronegative at baseline (99-100%) compared to those seropositive at baseline (89-98%). In the Menjugate group some subjects fulfilled the criteria for a vaccine response to MenA, W or Y. This was especially noticeable for rSBA against MenW and MenY among those seronegative to these meningococcal groups at baseline.

The supplementary tables of the response rates by age strata showed that in each case the responses to the MenC conjugates were comparable. In both age strata there were similar responses to MenW and MenY in Menjugate subjects who were seronegative for these groups at baseline. However, responses to MenA, W and Y were all much higher in the ACWY-TT group regardless of baseline serostatus.

## As shown below:

-  Baseline percentages with rSBA titres  1:8 ranged from 43.4% (MenA in the Menjugate group) to 86.3% (MenY in the ACWY-TT group).
-  The  percentages  with  rSBA  titres  1:128  increased  to  at  least  99.3%  after  administration  of ACWY-TT and all the Menjugate subjects had a MenC titre  1:128.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The  rSBA  GMTs  increased  by  54-fold  to  198-fold  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  and  the  MenC  GMT increased 273-fold in the Menjugate group vs. 123-fold in the ACWY-TT group. The rSBA-MenC GMT adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata was statistically significantly lower in the ACWY-TT group.

The post-vaccination percentages with rSBA titres  1:8 and  1:128 were comparable for the two age strata whereas the GMTs tended to be lower in the younger subjects compared to the older subjects. In each age stratum of subjects who received the ACWY-TT vaccine the rSBA GMT for MenC was lower than for the other three meningococcal groups.

Percentages of subjects with anti-PS concentrations  0.3  g/mL before vaccination were low for each meningococcal group (from 3.4% to 23.1%). One month after vaccination anti-PS  2  g/ml was observed in at least 86.8% in the ACWY-TT group and all subjects in the Menjugate group had  2  g/ml against MenC. GMCs increased from 41-fold to 162-fold after ACWY-TT and by 90-fold to MenC in Menjugate recipients compared to 83-fold in ACWY-TT recipients. No statistically significant difference was observed for GMCs adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata between the ACWY-TT group and the Menjugate group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Anti-tetanus antibody was not reported from this study.

For the comparison with Menjugate the most frequently reported solicited local AE in both vaccine groups was redness for subjects 2-5 years of age and pain for subjects 6-10 years of age. There were no significant differences between groups for the AEs reported in the 2-5 and 6-10 years age groups. There were no SAEs reported in the primary vaccination phase of the study.

## Ext 081 Month 56

The analysis of antibody persistence was based on the ATP cohort for antibody persistence at Month 56. Since &gt;5% of those with Month 56 serological results were excluded from the ATP cohort a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort Month 56 was performed. For each treatment group, at the Month 56 blood sampling time-point, and for each antigen assessed:

-  GMTs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were tabulated.
-  Percentages  of  subjects  with  titres  above  the  proposed  cut-offs  with  exact  95%  CIs  were calculated.
-  The distribution of antibody titres was tabulated and presented using reverse cumulative curves.

All reported SAEs considered related to study procedures, or a concomitant GSK drug or vaccine, or fatal SAEs were to be described in detail from the end of the six-month Extended Safety Follow-up period following vaccination until the Month 56 persistence time-point.

Of the 414 subjects enrolled in MENACWY-TT-081 there were 260 enrolled at the Month 56 persistence time-point, including 193 from the ACWY-TT group and 67 from the MenCCRM group.

The rSBA serological testing at pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination in MENACWY-TT-081 were performed at GSK laboratories but rSBA testing at Months 32, 44 and 56 were performed at the Public Health England (PHE) laboratories in the United Kingdom. Therefore rSBA antibody kinetics and decay from one month post-vaccination cannot be directly assessed and the table below shows the serial data from M32 onwards.

At Month 56 based on PHE rSBA data (see table below):

- o Percentages with rSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 were 86.6% in the ACWY-TT group and 29.2% in the MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 57.5% vs. 15.4%.
- o Percentages with rSBA-MenC titres ≥1:8 were 59.1% in the ACWY-TT group and 64.6% in the MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 34.9% vs. 49.2%.
- o Percentages with rSBA-MenW-135 titres ≥1:8 were 78.0% in the ACWY-TT group and 26.2% in the MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 66.1% vs. 15.4%.

- o Percentages with rSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 were 80.1% in the ACWY-TT group and 21.9% in the MenCCRM group with rates at ≥1:128 of 74.7% vs. 15.6%.

At Month 56 based on hSBA data (GSK's assay; see table above):

- o Percentages with hSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 were very similar for the ACWY-TT and MenCCRM groups (59.6%  and  57.6%)  but  in  both  groups  these  rates  were  much  higher  than  at  M32  and  M44 (&lt;30% and &lt; 20% for respective vaccine groups). Considering that the study sites were in France and Germany this finding is rather strange. However, in both groups the GMTs were low and not markedly higher than at the two previous time points, suggesting that in reality the difference over time reflects only a shift in percentages with titres just below and just above the assay LLOQ. No details are provided on the hSBA assay.
- o Percentages with hSBA-MenC titres ≥1:8 were 74.4% in the ACWY-TT group and 67.7% in the MenCCRM group with GMTs of 20.6 and 31.2.
- o Percentages with hSBA-MenW-135 titres ≥1:8 were 83.1% in the ACWY-TT group and 43.3% in the MenCCRM group with GMTs of 59.3 and 9.2.
- o Percentages with hSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 were 88.8% in the ACWY-TT group and 71.0% in the MenCCRM group with GMTs of 117.9 and 35.7.

No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered related to study participation were reported from the end of the 6-month Extended Safety Follow-up period following vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-081 until the Month 56 persistence time-point.

## Ext 081 Month 68

At least one grade 3unsolicited symptom  was  reported  by  1.7%  and  1.6%  and  at  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  with  causal relationship  was  reported  by  3.4%  vs.  1.6%.  One  in  the  ACWY-TT  group  reported  grade  3 vomiting which was assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.
- o No SAEs were reported during the 31-day post-booster vaccination period.

## Study 036/043 Adolescents vs. ACWY

The initial part of the study was conducted in 2007-8 in Asia. The target sample size was 1024 subjects who were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to the quadrivalent conjugate (N=768) and unconjugated (N=256) vaccines. Enrolment was stratified to ensure ~340 subjects in each of the three age strata of 11-13, 14-15 and 16-17 years. Of the 1025 subjects enrolled and vaccinated 1016 completed the study while 1012 were included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The mean age was 14.3 years, 53% were female and the study population was of South, East and Southeast Asian heritage.

The applicant concluded that non-inferiority of ACWY-TT vs. Mencevax was demonstrated for each meningococcal group based on 95% CI around the differences in response rates within -1.8%.

Response rates to each meningococcal group were at or near 100% for both vaccines in subsets seronegative at baseline but were higher (only very slightly for MenC) with the conjugate in the subsets seropositive at baseline. The analyses were not performed separately for the three age strata.

Pre-vaccination percentages of subjects with rSBA titres  1:8 varied from 58.6%-59.4% for rSBA-MenC to 85.4%-90.9% for rSBA-MenY. One month after vaccination almost all subjects had titres  1:128 for the four serogroups. The rSBA GMTs for all serogroups increased in both vaccine groups by 16.4- to 274.3-fold following vaccination, with ranges of 44.5 to 368.2 pre-dose to 2679.3 to 13865.2 at one month post-dose. An exploratory analysis of the differences between the vaccine groups indicated that the rSBA GMTs adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata for all serogroups were significantly higher in the ACWY-TT group vs. the MenPS group.

A subset of samples selected (using Gibb's method) from those of sufficient volume was also tested by rSBA at HPA and reported in the Y2 follow-up study report 043.

-  At M24 the HPA data showed that rSBA titres  1:8 were observed in 74.3% (MenW) to 95.0% (MenC)  from  the  ACWY-TT  group  compared  to  26.1%  (MenW)  to  85.7%  (MenA)  from  the Mencevax group. Percentages with rSBA-MenA titre  1:128, rSBA-MenC titre  1:8, rSBA-MenW135  titre  1:8  and  1:128  and  rSBA-MenY  titre  1:8  and  1:128  were  all  statistically significantly  higher  for  the  ACWY-TT  group.  In  addition,  the  rSBA  GMTs  were  statistically significantly higher in the ACWY-TT for MenA, W and Y.
-  At M24 the GSK rSBA data showed that all subjects had titres  1:8 for the four serogroups in the ACWY-TT group compared to 94-100% in the control  group.  The  percentages  with  rSBA-MenA titre  1:128, rSBA-MenW-135 titre  1:8  and  1:128 and rSBA-MenY titre  1:8 and  1:128 were  all  statistically  significantly  higher  for  the  ACWY-TT  group.  In  addition,  the  GMTs  were statistically significantly higher in the ACWY-TT for MenA, W and Y.

The table below shows the HPA data from M0, M1 and M24. In particular, note that much lower percentages were reported as being seropositive at baseline using the HPA rSBA assay.

The first three figures below show the percentages of subjects with HPA and GSK rSBA titres  8 and GSK rSBA titres  128 at M0, M1 and M24 and the percentages with a vaccine response at M1 using each assay. The GSK rSBA assay resulted in generally higher titres than the HPA assay especially noticeable at M0. The HPA rSBA assay better discriminated between ACWY-TT and Mencevax , especially at the 2-year persistence time point, and gave results in favour of the conjugate vaccine.

The last two figures compare the response rates at M1 using each assay. Whichever assay is applied the results suggest that vaccine response rates were at least as good with the conjugate vaccine vs. the control vaccine.

In both vaccine groups, anti-PS GMCs for all serogroups reached values within the range 14.81 to 86.63  g/mL compared to pre-vaccination values from 0.19 to 1.06  g/mL. Pre-vaccination percentages with anti-PS concentrations  0.3  g/mL varied from 9.8%-12.4% for anti-PSW-135 to 70.1%-74.0% for anti-PSA. One month post-vaccination the percentages with  0.3  g/mL increased to 98.7%-100.0% across the two vaccine groups while  2.0  g/mL was achieved in 97.6%-100.0% for groups A, C and Y and 93.7%-94.8% for group W-135. Exploratory evaluation of the between-group differences indicated statistically significantly higher anti-PSA GMCs and lower anti-PSC GMCs (adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata) in the ACWY-TT group compared to the MenPS group.

The percentages with pre-vaccination anti-TT antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL were 67.4% and 72.2% in the ACWY-TT and the MenPS groups, respectively. One month post-vaccination the anti-TT GMC had increased by 26.2-fold and the percentage with ≥ 0.1 IU/mL had increased to 97.8% in the ACWY-TT group. Both values remained essentially unchanged in the MenPS group. Exploratory evaluation of the between-group differences indicated a statistically significantly higher proportion with anti-TT  0.1 IU/mL and GMC adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata in the ACWYTT group compared to the MenPS group.

## Month 60

The Month 60 (Y5) persistence study was conducted by three principal investigators at three centres in two countries (two in India and one in the Philippines).

The rSBA testing at Months 36, 48 and 60 was done at the PHE (formerly HPA; see primary results above) laboratory in the United Kingdom. The results using the PHE assay have been shown for each time point in the table below. However, it should be noted that only a small subset had sera tested using this assay before M36. No hSBA data are reported from the later follow-up time points.

Of the 790 subjects enrolled in India and the Philippines in the initial study (036) 478 participated in the Month 60 persistence visit but 155/478 (119 ACWY-TT and 36 MenPS) were not compliant with the blood sampling schedule and one other had essential serological data missing. The ATP cohort for persistence at Month 60 comprised 322 subjects.

At M60 the percentages of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 were 97.5%, 88.6%, 86.0% and 96.6% in the ACWY-TT group and 93.0%, 87.1%, 34.9%

and 66.3% in the MenPS group, respectively. The GMTs were higher for ACWY-TT except that the MenC GMTs were comparable between the two vaccine groups.

There were some baseline differences between India and Philippine adolescents with higher baseline seropositivity rates in India for MenA and to a lesser extent for MenC. At M60 the GMTs for Men A, W135 and Y (but not Men C) were significantly higher in both Indian subjects and Philippine subjects who had received the conjugate vaccine vs. the unconjugated vaccine subsets.

The MenA GMTs were significantly higher for Indian vs. Philippine subjects in both vaccine groups. The MenC GMT was significantly higher in Philippine subjects vs. Indian subjects who had each received the conjugate vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated polysaccharide. For MenC the GMT was numerically higher for plain polysaccharide among Indian subjects but there was no difference between vaccine groups among Philippine subjects. The MenY GMT was significantly higher in Indian vs. Philippine subjects who had each received the conjugate vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated polysaccharide.

No SAEs that were related to study procedures or concurrent GSK medication were reported from the last visit of the primary vaccination study (MENACWY-TT-036) up to 60 months after primary vaccination.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Study 081/088 M56, M68 and response to a booster dose in children aged 2-10 years

In the original study rSBA was assayed at GSK's laboratories and non-inferiority of ACWY-TT vs. Menjugate was demonstrated for responses to MenC with numerically comparable findings within subsets according to baseline MenC serostatus. The supplementary tables of the response rates by age strata showed that responses to the MenC conjugates were comparable and responses to MenA, W and Y were all much higher in the ACWY-TT group regardless of baseline serostatus. GMTs tended to be lower in the younger subjects compared to the older subjects. In each age stratum the rSBA GMT for MenC was lower with ACWY-TT than with Menjugate (ratios 0.43 and 0.57).

At Month 56 based on PHE rSBA data there were clear differences between ACWY-TT and Menjugate groups for seropositivity to MenA, W135 and Y reflecting the immune responses to the additional conjugates in Nimenrix. For MenC the percentages with rSBA-MenC titres 1:8 (59.1% vs. 64.6%) and with 1:128 (34.9% vs. 49.2%) as well as the GMT were numerically lower in the ACWY-TT group.

At Month 56 based on GSK's hSBA assay the MenC antibody levels supported a conclusion of broad comparability as deduced from the rSBA data. The MenW135 and MenY data did suggest a benefit for prior vaccination with Nimenrix but the difference was not so marked, especially for MenY. The MenA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data are a surprise not only because the seropositivity rates and GMTs were comparable but also because these rates seemingly increased between M32 and M44 (&lt;30% and &lt; 20% for respective vaccine groups) compared to M56 (near to 60%). However, the GMTs remained low, suggesting that many subjects must have had titres near to 1:4 and 1:8, which is borne out by the RCD shown below.

<!-- image -->

On this basis it remains possible that a small change in assay conditions, including use of a different pool of human complement, may have influenced the results. No assay details are provided to substantiate this hypothesis but these should be provided when the planned variation is filed.

At Month 68 based on PHE rSBA data the pattern was similar to that at M56 except that there seemed to be an advantage for MenC rSBA in the Menjugate group with non-overlapping 95% CI for percentages at ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 as well as the GMTs. Nevertheless, with a much smaller Menjugate group a few outliers could have influenced the overall results, which need to be viewed with some caution.

The PHE rSBA data clearly showed that a dose of Nimenrix was able to boost the MenC responses in subjects primed with the same vaccine and in those primed with the CRM197 conjugate. The data also showed that the GMTs to MenA, W135 and Y were all higher in primed vs. previously unvaccinated subjects, supporting the conclusion that the first dose of Nimenrix successfully primed subjects against the other serogroups.

At Month 68 the hSBA (GSK's assay) data indicated that the titres against MenA had fallen in both vaccine groups since the unexpected findings at M56. This again suggests a problem with the assay rather than a real phenomenon. Apart from the MenC titres in both groups and the MenW135 titres in the ACWY-TT group the other titres also showed a decline from the previous time point.

At one month post booster vaccination the hSBA results supported the ability of Nimenrix to prime subjects against all four serogroups and to boost MenC responses regardless of the type of conjugate used for priming. A single dose of Nimenrix also elicited good primary responses to MenA, W135 and Y in the Menjugate group although the immune response was much weaker against MenA than against MenW135 and MenY.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The follow-up and post-booster safety analyses from this study do not raise any new concerns.

## Study 036/043 Adolescents vs. ACWY up to M60

In Asian adolescents who received either Nimenrix or unconjugated MenACWY, the initial study suggested a small degree of benefit for the conjugate. In addition to this, all other evidence pointed to a benefit for the conjugate in terms of priming, which does not occur with unconjugated polysaccharides. Based on the GSK rSBA assay the GMTs were all much higher with the conjugated vaccine. The HPA/PHE rSBA assay results supported the conclusions from the GSK assay up to M24 even though much lower percentages were reported as being seropositive at baseline using the HPA rSBA assay and the GMTs were lower. Based on a randomly selected subset, the HPA rSBA assay better discriminated between ACWY-TT and Mencevax , especially at the 2-year persistence time point, and gave results in favour of the conjugate vaccine.

The Month 60 (Y5) persistence study must be viewed in light of the fact that it was conducted at only three of the original study centres and only in two countries. Also, only rSBA results using the PHE assay are available from M36 onwards. These data suggest high persistent seropositivity rates at M60 and higher rates with the conjugate for rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY. In addition GMTs were higher for ACWY-TT except that the MenC GMTs were comparable between the two vaccine groups.

There were some baseline differences between India and Philippine adolescents with higher baseline seropositivity rates in India for MenA and to a lesser extent for MenC. At M60 the GMTs for Men A, W135 and Y (but not Men C) were significantly higher in Indian subjects and in Philippine subjects who had received the conjugate vaccine vs. unconjugated vaccine.

The MenA GMTs were significantly higher for Indian vs. Philippine subjects in both vaccine groups. The MenC GMT was significantly higher in Philippine subjects vs. Indian subjects who had each received the conjugate vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated polysaccharide. For MenC the GMT was numerically higher for plain polysaccharide among Indian subjects but there was no difference between vaccine groups among Philippine subjects. The MenY GMT was significantly higher in Indian vs. Philippine subjects who had each received the conjugate vaccine but there was no difference among those who received unconjugated polysaccharide.

## In conclusion

The available follow-up data from both studies raise no new concerns and the pre/post boost data indicate that Nimenrix effectively primes children and is able to boost MenC responses following priming with an alternative conjugate. The rSBA assays and hSBA assay (the latter being GSK's inhouse assay) generally paint a similar picture even though the results are numerically quite different.

There are some issues that do need to be addressed, such as presenting the data from the extension of study 081 by age sub-group and discussing the rather strange pattern of MenA findings over time. However, these issues can be taken up within the forthcoming variation planned to be filed in December 2015. On that basis the assessor proposes not to issue a RSI at this time but to address all issues under that single variation intended to update the information in the current SmPC.
