## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

## About the product

Infliximab  is  a  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF α )  inhibitor.  It  is  a  chimeric  human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF α but not to lymphotoxin α (TNFß). Infliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNF α in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays. Infliximab prevented disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of  constitutive  expression  of  human  TNF α and  when  administered  after  disease  onset,  it  allowed eroded joints to heal. In vivo, infliximab rapidly forms stable complexes with human TNF α , a process that  parallels  the  loss  of  TNF α bioactivity.  Infliximab  is  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of rheumatoid  arthritis  (in  combination  with  methotrexate),  severe  active  and  fistulising  adult  Crohn's disease,  severe  active  paediatric  Crohn's  disease,  ulcerative  colitis,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.

## Scope of the variation

In  this  procedure  the  MAH  revises  the  indication  in  section  4.1  of  the  SmPC  of  infliximab  in  adult patients with Crohn's disease from: 'treatment of severe active disease' to 'treatment of moderately to  severely  active  disease'.  Section  4.2  is  updated  accordingly.  Section  4.8  is  updated  regarding infusion  reactions,  immunogenicity  and  hepatobiliary  events  with  information  from  the  SONIC  study (C0168T67). Section 5.1 is also updated to reflect the result of the SONIC study. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

The submission is based on the results from a recent clinical trial (C0168T67, SONIC) as well as on the results  from  previously  submitted  clinical  trials  in  the  original  dossier  (ACCENT  I,  ACCENT  II), postmarketing registries (TREAT and ENCORE) and literature references.

The following variation application is made in this submission:

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision P/62/2010 for the following conditions:

-  Rheumatoid arthritis
-  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
-  Psoriatic arthritis
-  Ankylosing spondylitis
-  Psoriasis
-  Crohn's disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Ulcerative colitis

on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) with a deferral.

The PIP is not yet completed.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

In adult patients infliximab is currently approved for treatment of severely active Crohn's disease in patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or  an  immunosuppressant;  or  who  are  intolerant  to  or  have  medical  contraindications  for  such therapies.  Remicade  is  further  approved  for  treatment  of  fistulising  active  Crohn's  disease,  in  adult patients  who  have  not  responded  despite  a  full  and  adequate  course  of  therapy  with  conventional treatment (including antibiotics, drainage and immunosuppressive therapy).

The approval was based on 2 pivotal studies, the ACCENT I and ACCENT II studies.

The MAH sought scientific advice from the national competent authorities in Sweden and Germany in October 2009 for the SONIC study. According to the MAH, the clinical severity of Crohn's disease is not only  characterized  by  the  Crohn's  disease  activity  index  (CDAI  scores  &lt;220  mild, ≥ 220-≤ 450 moderate and &gt;450 severe). Factors apart from activity that contribute could be disease phenotype, comorbidities and treatment failures. Patients included in the SONIC study are different from patients included in earlier studies on Crohn's disease. Although the patients had moderate disease as defined by the CDAI score, the SONIC population had a shorter history of disease and the patients were naive to immunomodulators and biologic therapy. Patients in previous studies had a longer disease history and had failed corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive therapy. The MAH further argues that data in the literature support early introduction of therapy to avoid more irreversible damage where surgery remains the only option.

## 1.2.1. Clinical pharmacology SONIC (C0168T67)

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of infliximab were evaluated in the SONIC study (for details of the study please see section Clinical efficacy). In addition, data from ACCENT I and ACCENT II were considered for the discussion (details not presented in this report).

## Pharmacokinetic Analyses (SONIC study)

Prior  to  infusions  at  week  0  and  30  blood  samples  were  collected  for  determination  of  infliximab concentrations. An additional sample was taken week 46 for patients that participated in the extension study.

A total of 315 subjects had 1 or more blood samples obtained after their first dose of study medication and  were  included  in  the  analysis  of  serum  infliximab  concentrations.  Of  these,  226  subjects  were randomized  to  the  infliximab  treatment  groups  (106  to  infliximab  monotherapy  group  and  120  to combination therapy group).

At week 30 the median concentration for patients receiving infliximab plus placebo was 1.55 µg/mL and  for  patients  receiving  infliximab  plus  azathioprine  3.54  µg/mL  ( p &lt;0.001).  The  corresponding figures at week 46 were 0.99 and 3.77 µg/mL ( p &lt;0.001). Trough serum infliximab concentrations were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher (p &lt; 0.001) among subjects in the combination therapy group than for those in the infliximab monotherapy group at Week 30 and Week 46.

## Antibodies to infliximab

Blood  samples  collected  at  week  0,  30  and  46  were  analysed  for  the  presence  of  antibodies  to infliximab (pre-infusion). Patients with antibodies to infliximab were regarded as positive regardless of whether  antibodies  were  observed  before  the  first  infliximab  infusion  (at  baseline)  or  at  any  time during the study. Patients with inconclusive results had detectable infliximab serum levels at the last evaluation. Patients with negative findings had samples that were collected at the last evaluation with no  detectable  concentrations  of  infliximab.  The  infliximab  antibody  status  for  all  treated  patients through Week 46 is summarised in Table 1.

a Patients with appropriate samples had one or more samples obtained after their first study medication administration.

b Denominator is patients with appropriate samples. c Includes all patients who had at least one positive sample at any time.

d Includes all patients who had a negative sample at the last evaluation, excluding patients who were positive. e Includes patients who had an inconclusive sample at the last evaluation, excluding those who were positive.

For all treated patients, antibodies to infliximab were detected at any time through Week 46 for two (2.2%) patients in the azathioprine + placebo group, 20 (18.9%) patients in the infliximab + placebo group,  and  three  (2.5%)  patients  in  the  infliximab  +  azathioprine  group.  Among  the  patients  who tested positive for antibodies to infliximab, antibody titers ranged from 1:10 in nine patients to 1:160 in four patients. All four patients with a titer of 1:160 were in the infliximab + placebo group. Overall, 181 patients had inconclusive antibody results:  67 (63.2%) in the infliximab + PBO group and 114 (95.0%)  in  the  infliximab  +  azathioprine  group.  As  expected,  the  vast  majority  of  patients  in  the azathioprine + placebo group had negative infliximab antibody results (97.8%).

## Discussion

In the SONIC study, subjects with Crohn's disease who received infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks on a background  of  immunomodulator  therapy  had  higher  preinfusion (trough) serum  infliximab concentrations  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  infliximab  5  mg/kg  every  8  weeks  who  did  not receive  concomitant  immunomodulators  (i.e.  infliximab  monotherapy).  Although  serum  infliximab concentrations among subjects treated with infliximab monotherapy were lower than those receiving the combination therapy with infliximab and immunomodulators,  detectable trough infliximab concentrations were generally maintained in the infliximab monotherapy group. Results from ACCENT I also  indicate  that  serum  infliximab  concentrations  in  general  are  higher  in  patients  treated  with infliximab in combination with immunomodulator as compared to infliximab monotherapy.

With  regard  to  antibodies  to  infliximab  in  the  SONIC  study,  concomitant  use  of  immunomodulators decreased the incidence of antibodies to infliximab in subjects with Crohn's disease. The presence of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antibodies to infliximab was associated with lower trough serum concentrations of infliximab observed over time. Summary results from ACCENT I, ACCENT II and SONIC (although not strictly comparable due  to  different  study  designs  and  timing  of  sample  collection)  show  that  the  combined  use  of immunomodulator and infliximab reduced the development of antibodies to infliximab in comparison with monotherapy. Antibodies to infliximab were detected in 3.3 %  of patients' receiving immunomodulators and in 13.3 % of subjects not receiving such therapy.

## Pharmacodynamics

C-reactive  protein  determinations  were  performed,  as  surrogate  marker  for  inflammation,  in  blood samples collected prior to infusions at weeks 0 and 26. See Results of secondary efficacy endpoints in the clinical efficacy section.

## 1.2.2. Clinical efficacy

## 1.2.2.1. Main study

SONIC  (C0168T67) study is a multicenter, randomized,  double-blind, active controlled trial comparing infliximab and infliximab plus azathioprine to azathioprine in the treatment of patients with Crohn's  disease  naive  to  both  immunomodulators  and  biologic  therapy  (study  of  biologic  and immunomodulator naive patients in Crohn's disease).

## Methods

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the three treatment arms; infliximab, azathioprine and a combination of the two drugs, in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

The main part of the study was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase IIIb study that was performed during a 30-weeks treatment period. Patients completing the first part of the study that might  benefit  from  a  continuation  (investigators  opinion)  could  enter  an  extension  period  (through week 50) for the evaluation of long-term efficacy and safety of the three treatments. The blinding was retained during the extension period.

## Study participants

The main inclusion criteria were:

Patients  at  least  21  years  old  with  Crohn's  disease  for ≥ 6  previous  weeks  with  colitis,  ileitis,  or ileocolitis confirmed by radiography or endoscopy and with at least one of the following:

- were corticosteroid-dependent (CDAI ≥ 220 after decrease in corticosteroid dose) (budesonide alone did not qualify as a corticosteroid for this criterion)

or

- were considered for at least their second course of oral systemic corticosteroids within the past 12 months (budesonide alone did not qualify as a corticosteroid for this criterion)

or

-  had  failed  5-aminosalicylic  acid  treatment  (had  not  responded  to  at  least  a  4-week  course  of 5-aminosalicylic acid or sulfasalazine)

or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- had failed budesonides treatment for at least 4 weeks (budesonide failures that were 5-ASA naive were eligible for the study)

Patients with moderately active Crohn's disease, i.e. Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score ≥ 220 and ≤ 450.

Patients with no previous treatment with immunomodulators or biologic agents.

The main exclusion criteria were:

-  Local  manifestations  of  Crohn's  disease  e.g.  strictures,  active  fistula-related  abscesses,  or  other disease complications for which surgery might have been indicated (conditions possibly confounding the  evaluation  of  the  treatment)  or  that  might  have  precluded  utilization  of  the  CDAI  (e.g.  short bowel syndrome)
- Intra-abdominal surgery in the previous 6 months
- Serious infection in the previous 2 months
- History of latent or active granulomatous infection (including tuberculosis)

## Treatments

Patients were randomized to receive one of the following:

-  Infliximab and placebo - infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 plus one or more placebo tablets (equivalent to the number of tablets needed for the dose 2.5 mg /kg/day of azathioprine)
-  Azathioprine  and  placebo  -  placebo  infusions  at  weeks  0,  2,  6,  14  and  22  plus  one  or  more azathioprine tablets (50 mg) daily (2.5 mg/kg/day)
-  Infliximab and azathioprine - infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 plus one or more azathioprine tablets (50 mg) daily (2.5 mg/kg/day)

During  the  extension  period  the  patients  continued  to  receive  the  original  treatment  (active  and placebo) and the infusions were given every 8 weeks, beginning at week 30 and the last infusion at week 46.

Patients were to remain on stable doses of aminosalicylic acids during the first part of the study and after week 30 aminosalicylic acids could be added, tapered or discontinued.

The lowest possible dose of the systemic corticosteroids was to be used and tapering of the dose was mandatory beginning at week 14 (the dose was not to exceed 40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent). The dose was tapered at a rate of ≥ 5mg/week. Budesonide tapering to a dose &lt;6mg/day was optional.

Before the first infusion of study medication, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups: AZA + PBO infusion, IFX + PBO overencapsulated tablets, or IFX + AZA. Table 2 presents the dosing scheme for the three treatment groups.

*Oral study medication was taken daily though Week 30 of the Main Study or Week 50 of the Study Extension.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of infliximab + placebo over-encapsulated tablets and infliximab + azathioprine to that of azathioprine + placebo infusions in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.

The secondary objectives of the Main Study were as follows:

1. To assess the effect of infliximab and/or azathioprine on complete mucosal healing in patients with Crohn's disease.
2.  To  assess  the  corticosteroid-sparing  abilities  of  therapy  with  infliximab  and/or  azathioprine  in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.

The main objective of the extension study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety through week 54.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 defined as patients with a CDAI score &lt;150 who had not taken oral systemic corticosteroids or budesonide at doses &gt;6 mg/day for at least the previous 3 weeks.

Major secondary efficacy endpoints were:

- Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 50
- Clinical response at weeks 26 and 50 ( ≥ 70 or ≥ 100 decrease from baseline of CDAI scores)
- sustained corticosteroid-free remission at both weeks 42 and 50
- Mucosal healing in the week 26 endoscopy in patients who had ulceration at baseline
- Corticosteroid endpoints (e.g. comparisons of usage over time between treatment groups)
- Quality of life (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score)
- C-reactive protein concentration (change from baseline to week 26)

Safety endpoints were:

- Incidence and type of adverse events (AEs)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Changes in routine laboratory parameters
- Formation of antibodies to infliximab (serum samples at baseline and weeks 30 and 46)

## Sample size

It was estimated that a sample size of 167 patients per treatment group was needed in order to detect a 20 % difference between groups with approximately 94 % power at α =0.05.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomly assigned at week 0 (1:1:1 ratio) to one of three treatment groups using an adaptive  randomization  procedure  that  used  the  following  stratification  variables:  1)  study  site,  2) duration  of  Crohn's  disease  (&lt;3  years  or ≥ 3  years),  and  3)  corticosteroid  treatment  ( ≥ 20  mg prednisone or equivalent).

## Blinding

The patient, clinical site monitor and all other study personnel as well as the central endoscopy facility were blinded to treatment group.

## Statistical methods

Baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  were  compared  with  the  use  of  the  Chi-square  or Fisher's  exact  test  for  categorical  variables  and  with  analysis  of  variance  on  the  van  der  Waerden normal  scores  for continuous  variables.  A  two-sided  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  chi-square  test, stratified  by  Crohn's  disease  duration  and  corticosteroid  dose  at  baseline,  was  used  to  compare remission, response, and mucosal healing. Changes in IBDQ scores were compared using analysis of variance  on  the  van  der  Waerden  normal  scores,  adjusting  for  duration  of  Crohn's  disease  and corticosteroid dose at baseline. Descriptive statistics summarize systemic steroid use.

The  primary  end-point  analyses  were  conducted  in  a  prespecified,  sequential  manner,  in  which  the azathioprine  group  was  compared  with  the  combination-therapy  group  first  at  a  0.05  (two-sided) significance level. The azathioprine and infliximab groups were then compared at a 0.05 (two-sided) significance level only if the first comparison was significant.

For subgroup analyses the odds ratios were calculated based on logistic regression. Efficacy analyses used  intention-to-treat  methodology  that  included  all  randomized  patients  analyzed  according  to randomized  treatment  groups,  except  for  mucosal  healing, which  was  analyzed  according  to prespecified per protocol methods. After Week 30, prespecified analyses were based on data only for patients who entered the Study Extension.

All patients receiving at least one dose of study medication (oral or infusion) were analyzed for safety according  to  the  treatment  actually  received.  Safety  comparisons  used  the  Fisher's  exact  test. Infliximab concentrations were compared using analysis of variance on the van der Waerden normal scores adjusting for duration of Crohn's disease and corticosteroid dose at baseline.

## Results

## Participant flow

Randomized  patients  were  evenly  distributed  among  the  treatment  groups  by  the  stratification variables.  A  total  of  508  patients  were  randomized.  The  disposition  of  these  patients,  including  the cumulative  number  of  patients  who  terminated  from  Main  Study  participation,  is  shown  by  visit  in Figure 1. Five patients were randomized but not treated (one in the AZA + PBO group, three in the IFX + PBO group, and one in the IFX + AZA group), resulting in 503 treated patients.

Reasons  for  patients  not  being  randomized  were  withdrawal  of  consent  (9%),  not  meeting  the inclusion/exclusion criteria (86%), AEs (1%), lost to follow-up (3%) and other reasons (1%, including one patient that died). Of the 503 patients treated, 308 completed the main study period. Reasons for discontinuation are shown in Table 3.

Of the 503 treated patients, 318 patients completed the Main Study. The majority of these patients, ie, 280/318 (88.1%), elected to enroll in the Study Extension (75 in the AZA + PBO group, 97 in the IFX +  PBO  group,  and  108  in  the  IFX  +  AZA  group).  A  summary  of  patient  disposition  for  the  Study Extension, including the cumulative number of patients who terminated from the Study Extension, is shown by visit in Figure 2.

Twenty  patients  had  their  treatment  unblinded  during  the  main  study  period  and  7  patients  were unblinded during participating in the study extension. Reasons for unblinding were mainly related to safety (AEs and disease management).

During the main study period approximately 2% of the patients in each group missed one scheduled infusion. During the extension period one patient (in the azathioprine group) missed one infusion.

Compliance  with  the  oral  medication  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  and  study  periods, ranging between 83 and 89%.

## Baseline data

There were no statistically significant differences between the groups concerning demographic baseline data.  Baseline  data  for  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  extension  were  similar  to  those  for  the  main study.

Baseline disease characteristics are shown in Table 5.

a P-values are from chi-square tests for categorical data and analysis of variance on van der Waerden scores for continuous data.

Disease characteristics for patients who enrolled in the study extension were comparable to those for patients in the main study.

The  treatment  groups  were  consistent  concerning  the  disease-related  medical  history  of  Crohn's disease in the main study and were similar also among the patients in the study extension.

At  baseline,  41  %  of  the  patients  received  a  corticosteroid  or  budesonide  for  Crohn's  disease.  The proportion of patients receiving the medication was similar in the treatment groups.

At baseline, 54 % of the patients received 5-ASA compounds. There were some discrepancies between the groups, 61 % in the azathioprine group, 52 % in infliximab group and 50 % in the group with both azathioprine and infliximab ( P= 0.087).

## Outcomes

## Primary efficacy endpoint

The result concerning the primary efficacy endpoint, proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 (CDAI &lt;150 with no systemic corticosteroid or budesonide &gt;6 mg/day for the previous 3 weeks) is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Comparison of proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free remission at week 26 by treatment group

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Prespecified sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the result. Consistent results were  obtained  for  all  analyses  (LOCF  methodology  for  missing  data,  per-protocol  analysis,  analysis with stratification variables included).

Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the consistency of efficacy. The treatment group differences for the primary efficacy endpoint were statistically significant only for subgroups of patients with increased baseline CRP levels ( ≥ 0.8 mg/dL), see Figure 4.

To define a subgroup of patients that would more likely benefit from the treatment the MAH performed additional post-hoc subgroup analyses regarding the primary efficacy endpoint and baseline CRP levels and mucosal lesions, see Figure 5.

Major secondary efficacy endpoints

Mucosal healing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mucosal healing (absence of mucosal ulceration) at week 26 was observed in a larger proportion of patients  receiving  infliximab  and  azathioprine  compared  to  patients  in  the  single  treatments,  see Table 8.

The p-value for the comparison of the infliximab + placebo group to the azathioprine + placebo group is presented in the infliximab + placebo column. The p-value is from a CMH test stratified by duration of Crohn's disease and corticosteroid treatment at Baseline.

c The p-value for tests comparing the two infliximab groups. The p-value is from a CMH test stratified by duration of Crohn's disease and corticosteroid treatment at Baseline.

Note: If an endoscopy was performed after Baseline, but less than Study Day 154, the endoscopy was considered not evaluable.

Patients with no ileocolonoscopy results were classified as unable to determine (UTD).

## Corticosteroid endpoints

In all groups the daily dose of systemic corticosteroids, proportion of patients receiving corticosteroids and the total number of days of corticosteroid administration decreased from baseline to week 26. The magnitude of changes was similar in the three groups.

During the extension study the total numbers of patients taking corticosteroids were 9 at week 34, 5 at week 42 and 8 at week 50.

## Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 50

The result concerning the proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 50 is shown in Figure 6.

## Figure 6 Comparison of proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free remission at week 50 by treatment group (all randomized patients)

Post-hoc analyses were conducted to further evaluate the corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 50. In consistence with the results from week 26 there were higher proportion of patients in remission in the group with the combined therapy.

## Clinical remission

Clinical remission (CDAI score &lt;150) was determined at weeks 2, 6, 10, 18 and 26 in the main study and at weeks 34, 42 and 50 in the extension study. In general, the study result was supporting the result of the primary efficacy variable, but statistical significance was not reached at all time points, see Tables 10 &amp; 11.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical response

Clinical response defined as ≥ 100 scores decrease or ≥ 70 scores decrease in CDAI:

In  comparison  with  patients  treated  with  azathioprine  only  during  the  main  study  period  a  higher percentage  of  patients  in  the  other  two  groups  had  a  clinical  response ≥ 100  scores.  During  the extension  period  statistical  significant  difference  between  the  combination  therapy  and  azathioprine was observed at week 50. A similar tendency was observed for the result of response ≥ 70 scores.

## Sustained corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 42 and 50

A larger proportion of patients treated with the combination therapy achieved a sustained corticosteroid-free clinical remission (61%) compared to infliximab (52%) and azathioprine (44%).

## Quality of life assessments

According  to  the  Applicant,  a  clinically  relevant  change  in  IBDQ  scores  was  reached  or  exceeded through week 26 when comparing the combination therapy with azathioprine plus placebo.

## C-reactive protein

Changes  from  baseline  to  week  26  in  CRP  were  analysed.  The  numerically  greatest  reduction  was observed in the combination group. There were no statistically significant changes between the groups.

## Ancillary analyses

A tendency for larger proportion of patients with corticosteroid-free-remission, clinical remission and clinical response with increased infliximab serum concentration was shown.

## 1.2.2.2. Analysis performed across trials

## ACCENT I (C0168T21)

ACCENT  I  (submitted  within  the  procedure  EMEA/H/C/240/II/25)  was  a  multicenter,  randomized, double-blind,  clinical  trial  of  maintenance  infliximab  treatment  compared  with  a  single  dose  of infliximab in patients with moderately to severely active CD (moderate Crohn's disease as defined by CDAI scores ≥ 220 to ≤ 450). All patients received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg of infliximab at week 0. At week 2, all patients  were  randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Patients in Group I received placebo at weeks 2 and 6, and then every 8 weeks thereafter; patients in Group II received infliximab  5  mg/kg  at  weeks  2  and  6,  and  then  every  8  weeks  thereafter  through  week  46;  and patients in Group III received infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 2 and 6 and then 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter  through  week  46.  Patients  who  did  not  respond  to  the  initial  infusion  were  randomized separately from those who responded to the initial infusion. Only the responders were analyzed for the primary  endpoint.  Patients  who  responded  to  treatment  and  subsequently  lost  their  clinical  benefit were  eligible  to  cross  over  to  active  episodic  retreatment.  Patients  who  crossed  over  to  episodic retreatment  had  an  additional  5  mg/kg  of  infliximab  added  to  their  maintenance  dose  of  study medication.

To be included, patients must have been at least 18 years of age with a CDAI of between 220 and 400. Patients  must  also  have  had  CD  for  at  least  3  months  duration,  with  colitis,  ileitis,  or  ileocolitis, confirmed by radiography or endoscopy. Patients were excluded from this study for local manifestations of CD (eg, strictures, abscesses, or other disease complications at screening) for which surgery  might  have  been  indicated  and  would  confound  interpretation  of  response  to  treatment. Patients  with  draining  enterocutaneous  fistulas  or  any  internal  fistulas  were  not  eligible  for  this protocol. Patients with previously draining fistulas, which had not drained for at least 8 weeks prior to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pre-screening, were permitted to enrol in the study. Also excluded were patients who, within 3 months prior to pre-screening, had surgery for bowel diversion with placement of a stoma.

## ACCENT II (C0168T26)

ACCENT II (submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/240/II/32) was a multicentre, randomised, doubleblind  placebo  controlled  clinical  study  enrolling  patients  with  fistulising  Crohn's  disease.  Initially,  all patients  received  5  mg/kg  of  infliximab  at  weeks  0,  2,  and  6.  At  week  10  and  14,  after  assessing whether  the  remaining  282  patients  (24  patients  had  already  discontinued  study  treatment)  had responded to the 3-dose induction regimen of infliximab or not, responders and non-responders were randomised  separately  to  placebo  (n=143)  or  5  mg/kg  infliximab  (n=139).  The  first  blinded maintenance infusion was given at week 14 the following infusions were administered every 8 weeks thereafter through week 46.

## Study populations

Patients  enrolled  in  the  two  studies  ACCENT  I  and  SONIC  had  moderate  active  Crohn's  disease  as defined by CDAI scores between 220 and 400 and between 220 and 450, respectively. Patients in the ACCENT I study could be enrolled while receiving concomitant immunomodulators and corticosteroids, i.e. they had moderate active disease despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or corticosteroids.  Patients  in  the  SONIC  study  had  no  previous  treatment  with  immunomodulators  or biologic  agents,  were  corticosteroid  dependent  or  considered  for  their  second  or  more  course  of systemic corticosteroids.

## Discussion

The main differences between the populations seem to be the duration of the disease, previous and baseline treatments and that there were more patients in the ACCENT I population that had previous resections. Thus, the average patients included in the SONIC study were earlier in their disease course than patients in the ACCENT I study.

## Efficacy

An overall efficacy evaluation has been performed by the MAH. Comparisons are made of the most similar  major  efficacy  endpoints  (ACCENT  I  clinical  remission  and  SONIC  corticosteroid-free  clinical remission), see Table 14.

Data from all subjects randomized as responders at Week 2.

In SONIC, corticosteroid-fee clinical remission at Week 26. In ACCENT I, clinical remission at Week 30.

In SoNIC, comparison with subjects receiving AZA monotherapy. In ACCENT I, comparison with subjects receiving placebo maintenance therapy.

In SONIC,corticosteroid-firee clinical remission at Week 50 for all randomized subjects; subjects who did not enter the study extension were considered to not be in steroid-free clinical remission at Week 50. In ACCENT I, clinical remission at Week 54.

Mucosal  healing  in  ACCENT  I  (through  week  54)  and  SONIC  (through  week  26)  was  achieved  to  a greater extent in both studies with infliximab as compared to control therapy and azathioprine therapy, respectively.

The results from the ACCENT I and SONIC studies suggest that infliximab therapy had a corticosteroid sparing  effect.  In  the  ACCENT  I  study,  approximately  twice  the  proportion  of  patients  receiving corticosteroids at baseline  in  the  combined  infliximab  treatment  group  received ≤ 10  mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) for ≥ 3 months, as compared with placebo treated patients. In the SONIC study the numbers of days of corticosteroid administration decreased from baseline to week 26 in all

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups.  However,  there  were  differences  concerning  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  proportion  of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical remission, in favour of infliximab monotherapy  and  in combination with azathioprine, compared to placebo.

The validated QoL measurement, the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire, IBDQ, was used in both the ACCENT I and SONIC study. A consistency in benefit of treatment was demonstrated in the two studies.

## 1.2.2.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The SONIC study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab as monotherapy and in  combination  with  azathioprine  in  comparison  with  azathioprine  monotherapy  in  the  treatment  of moderate active Crohn's disease defined as CDAI score ≥ 220 and ≤ 450. The CHMP acknowledged that the  design  of  the  study  and  the  objectives  were  relevant.  The  endpoints  were  also  adequate  and according  to  the  guideline  on  development  of  new  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Crohn's disease.

The primary efficacy endpoint, proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 (CDAI &lt;150 with no systemic corticosteroid or budesonide &gt;6 mg/day for the previous 3 weeks) was  met.  The  largest  proportion  of  patients  in  corticosteroid-free  remission  was  observed  in  the combination  therapy  arm  followed  by  infliximab  monotherapy  and  azathioprine  monotherapy  (57%, 44% and 30%, respectively). Results of  the  secondary  endpoints,  in  general  supported  the  results. Thus,  based  on  the  analyses  presented  by  the  MAH,  treatment  with  infliximab  was  shown  to  be effective  in  patients  at  early  stages  of  moderately  active  Crohn's  disease.  The  effect  was  similar  to what has previously been shown for patients with more long-standing disease.

Concerning the primary efficacy endpoint the MAH clarified the term steroid-free remission in section 5.1 of the SmPC. This was clarified as follows: The primary endpoint of the study was corticosteroidfree clinical remission at Week 26, defined as patients in clinical remission (CDAI of &lt;150) who, for at least 3 weeks, had not taken oral systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) or budesonide at a dose &gt;6 mg/day.

The  CHMP  noted  that  a  majority  of  included  subjects  were  not  on  corticosteroids  at  baseline. Nevertheless  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  group  of  patients  not  being  on  corticosteroids  at baseline  included  subjects  that  had  actually  failed  corticosteroids  within  the  previous  year  so  were within the proposed indication. The MAH provided revised analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint for the subpopulation of patients on corticosteroids including budesonide &gt;6mg/d,  and for the subpopulation of patients that mirrors the intended patient population (i.e. the group of patients who entered the  trial  using  a  criterion  other  than  5-ASA  failure  which  includes  patients  who  were  either dependent on corticosteroids at baseline or those who had failed corticosteroids). In addition, analyses were provided where subjects at week 26 on any budesonide dose (including &lt;6mg/d) for the previous 3 weeks were regarded as non-responders (complete corticosteroid-free clinical remission).

The treatment response in these patient subgroups is of the same magnitude as in other subgroups and  of  clinical  relevance.  The  presented  data  show  that  irrespective  of  inclusion  criteria  used  the outcome (primary efficacy endpoint) is similar in comparable treatment groups.

The  analysis  showed  that  there  were  a  total  of  5  patients  that  achieved  corticosteroid-free  clinical remission at week 26 that were receiving budesonide ≤ 6 mg/day. Exclusion of these patients from the presentation of the primary efficacy endpoint does not alter the positive benefit-risk balance.

In summary, the results of the additional analyses for complete corticosteroid-free clinical remission are consistent with the results of primary endpoint analysis as defined in the protocol. This is true for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  entire  study  population,  the  group  of  subjects  mirroring  the  intended  patient  population  (ie, subjects who entered the trial using a criterion other than 5-ASA failure), as well as for the population of subjects receiving corticosteroids or any dose of budesonide at baseline. Overall, in both the original and the additional analyses, the combination therapy group consistently had the greatest proportion of subjects in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 26. In addition, the proportion of subjects in corticosteroid-free clinical remission in the infliximab monotherapy group was consistently greater than the azathioprine monotherapy group.

The  efficacy  of  infliximab  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  two  studies  ACCENT  I  and  SONIC.  It  is acknowledged that the baseline characteristics, duration of the disease, previous resections and use of corticosteroids differ between the populations. Thus, the results indicate that infliximab is effective in a patient  population  earlier  in  their  disease  course  as  well  as  in  patients  with  longer  duration  of  the disease.

Infliximab 8-week maintenance treatment was used for both populations in the ACCENT I and SONIC trials and should, therefore, be recommended for both populations. Episodic treatment, which has not been studied in the SONIC population, may potentially increase the risk of infusion reactions or have a diminished  response,  but  should  remain  a  treatment  option.  Therefore,  the  posology  statement recommends maintenance treatment with additional infusions or retreatment if signs and symptoms of the disease recur in both patients with moderate and severe disease initially responding to 2 infusions.

Another  indirect  indication  of  the  benefits  with  infliximab  is  that  there  was  a  larger  proportion  of patients who discontinued from the azathioprine treatment arm. The main cause for discontinuations was adverse events.

The MAH performed post-hoc analysis on the primary endpoint in subgroups with increased CRP levels and with mucosal lesions at baseline. The result of the post-hoc subgroup analysis indicates that the beneficial effect is improved in patients with these characteristics.

To  conclude,  infliximab  both  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with  azathioprine  improved  efficacy compared  to  azathioprine  monotherapy.  These  effects  are  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant  in  a population with moderately active Crohn's disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately 57% of the patients had at least one TEAE that was regarded as reasonably related to the study drugs. Reasonably related AEs were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, general disorders and administration site conditions.

During the main study period there were 90 (18%) of the patients that discontinued the study due to adverse events. The corresponding figure for the study extension is 18 (6.4%) of patients. The most common reason for the discontinuations was gastrointestinal disorders.

## 1.2.3.3. Serious adverse events and deaths

Patients with TEAEs with severe intensity were evenly distributed among the treatment groups. Ninety patients (18%) experienced one or more serious TEAEs up to week 30 of the main study. During the extension period the proportion of patients with one or more severe events were comparable in the azathioprine plus placebo and infliximab plus placebo groups (8 and 5.6% respectively) and higher in the combination therapy group (16.5%).

There were 10 patients with acute pancreatitis or pancreatitis during the study, 8 of which received the azathioprine monotherapy.

One  case  of  tuberculosis  in  the  combination  therapy  group  was  reported  week  30.  The  patient recovered after treatment.

Patient  with  serious  treatment-emergent  infections  were  evenly  distributed  between  the  three treatment groups (9 patients treated with azathioprine, 8 with infliximab and 7 with the combination therapy).

Two patients  in  the  azathioprine  placebo  group  were  diagnosed  with  malignancies  during  the  study (adenocarcinomas of the colon in both cases).

One patient died during the study period. The patient was randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg/kg of daily  oral  azathioprine  through  Week  30  and  placebo  infusion  on  Weeks  0,  2,  6,  14,  and  22.  The patient suffered from COPD  and  ileus. The patient underwent  total colectomy, had several complications that led to multisystem organ failure and septicaemia. The investigator determined the Crohn's  disease,  sepsis,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  and  intestinal  perforation  were  not related to the placebo infusion and not related to the oral azathioprine.

## Infusion reactions, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions

When the data from the Main Study and Study Extension were combined, a total of 2949 infusions were administered: 862 in the AZA + PBO group, 990 in the IFX + PBO group, and 1097 in the IFX + AZA group. Compared with patients in the AZA + PBO and IFX + AZA treatment groups, more patients in the IFX + PBO treatment group had infusions with an infusion reaction (16.6% versus 5.6% for AZA + PBO and 5.0% for IFX + AZA).The combined result from the main and extension study revealed that 4.5 % of infusions had caused reactions in the infliximab plus placebo group, 1.2 % of the infusions in the azathioprine plus placebo group and 1.0 % of infusion in the combined therapy group. The most common reactions were infusion related, pyrexia, dizziness and paresthesia.

Seven patients experienced a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction (event of serum sickness or symptom  complex  occurring  1  to  14  days  after  the  day  of  infusion)  (3  patients  treated  with azathioprine, 3 with infliximab and 1 with the combination therapy).

There was one report on an anaphylactoid reaction (flushing, hypotension and dyspnoea) that occurred in  one  patient  in  the  infliximab  plus  placebo  group.  The  patient  was  medically  recovered  within 15 minutes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.2.3.4. Laboratory findings

There were only minor fluctuations in the three treatment groups in median change from baseline to week  50  in  haematology  or  blood  chemistry  variables  in  the  majority  of  patients.  During  the  main study period, post-baseline abnormal haematology values occurred in 3.2% of the patients and the corresponding figure during the extension period was 2.1%. Decreased lymphocytes were observed for 29% and 21.4% respectively of patients in the main and the extension study periods.

## 1.2.3.5. Safety Analysis performed across trials

Data  from  the  three  clinical  trials  (ACCENT  I,  ACCENT  II  and  SONIC)  and  data  from  two  safety registries  (TREAT  and  ENCORE)  have  been  used  in  the  risk  assessment  of  long-term  safety  of infliximab.

Data  from  patients  exposed  to  infliximab  up  to  one  year  is  available  from  the  clinical  studies.  The TREAT registry contains data from Crohn's patients both with and without infliximab treatment. The 2009 report contains data from 6273 patients, who have participated with an average follow-up of 4.3 years. The ENCORE registry contained 1544 infliximab treated patients with a total follow-up of 2684 patient-years in the 2009 report.

Patients in the clinical studies had moderate to severe Crohn's disease with a median duration of 2.3 years, 7.5 and 11.2 years in SONIC, ACCENT I and ACCENT II study, respectively. Concerning patients in  the  TREAT  and  ENCORE  registries,  more  severely  ill  CD  patients  are  included  in  the  infliximabtreatment groups compared to the other-treatments groups.

The overall most common AEs and serious AEs in clinical studies and registries, in all treatment groups were gastrointestinal in nature. There were a small number of deaths reported in the clinical studies. Long-term data from the registries did not show increased mortality in infliximab treated patients.

Serious infections have not been increased in the clinical studies. An increased risk has been reported in the registries with the strongest predictor being disease severity.

There were few malignancies in the clinical trials. In the TREAT registry the rate of malignancies were similar in infliximab treated patients and in patients on other therapies. In the ENCORE registry, there were more lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies reported for patients treated with infliximab than  in  the  other  groups.  After  exposure-adjusted  incidence  and  time-to-first  event  analyses  no differences between the treatment groups was revealed.

Infusion reactions in the SONIC study were less often reported in patients receiving the combination therapy  compared  to  infliximab  monotherapy.  In  ACCENT  I  and  ACCENT  II  the  rate  of  infusion reactions were 2 to 3 times higher than those for placebo treated patients. Similar rates of infusion reactions have also been reported in the registries in patients receiving infliximab therapy. Few events were serious and anaphylactic reactions were low.

An integrated safety analysis including data from patients in the three clinical studies was performed to calculate the incidence of ALT elevations. Elevated ALT concentrations in placebo-treated and infliximab treated patients (with or without concomitant immunomodulators) were found in 24 % and 36 % of the patients, respectively.

## 1.2.3.6. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of  infliximab in  the  SONIC study is similar  to  what  has  earlier  been  observed  for infliximab in both Crohn's disease patients and in patients with other indications. No new safety signals were  identified  in  this  population  with  moderate  (according  to  CDAI  scores)  Crohn's  disease.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

numbers  of  patients  with  TEAEs  were  evenly  distributed  between  the  treatment  arms.  In  all,  90 patients experienced one or more serious TEAE through week 30 of the main study. It is noticed that there were more serious TEAEs in the azathioprine group than in the other two treatment arms and 8 of those were pancreatitis and pancreatitis acute.

Taking together the data from the clinical studies SONIC and ACCENT, the safety profile of infliximab appears comparable in the slightly different populations included in these studies, i.e. with shorter and longer disease duration.

Currently, there is an extensive postmarketing experience from several follow up activities, including two registries in Crohn's disease, one in the US (TREAT), and one in Europe (ENCORE). Both of these registries  contain  an  infliximab  treated  group,  and  a  non-biologic  treated  group.  As  expected,  more severely ill Crohn's disease patients are included in the infliximab-treatment group compared to the other-treatments group. In the latest assessment of these data sources, the following was concluded:

ENCORE registry (2009 report, Jan 2010): This report confirms the known safety profile of infliximab. Infections  (including  serious)  are  more  frequently  occurring  with  infliximab,  as  well  as  infusion reactions. The MAH presents a time- to - first event analysis, showing a significant association with infliximab treatment and haematologic events. Such events of different types are stated in the product information, ongoing monitoring is nevertheless necessary. With respect to malignancy/ lymphoproliferative  event,  there  remains  a  higher  number  of  cases  in  the  infliximab  group.  The incidence  rates  of  per  1000  person  years  of  exposure  (95%  CI)  were  5.8  (3.2,  9.8)  for  standard therapy and 7.0 (4.8, 9.9) for infliximab total [6.9 (4.5, 10.0) infliximab only and 7.9 (2.2, 20.3) for switch to infliximab]. The non-adjusted incidences were 17 (1.5%) for standard therapy and 39 (2.2%) for total infliximab [33 (2.1%) for infliximab only and 6 (2.5%) for switch to infliximab]. These figures continue  to  raise  some  concern,  although  it  is  acknowledged  that  these  are  unadjusted  data.  The product information contains relevant information also regarding malignancy. With respect to fatalities, there  was  no  difference  in  the  incidence  between  groups  (1.1%  for  standard  treatment,  infliximab only, and infliximab total), or for the incidence rates of per 1000 person years of exposure (5.0 (2.6, 8.7) - standard; 4.3 (2.5, 6.9) - infliximab only; 5.9 (1.2, 17.4) - switch to infliximab; 4.5 (2.8, 7.0) infliximab total), which provides reassurance.

Overall, this update confirms the known safety profile of infliximab, and no new risks are identified. Continued monitoring in the registry is of importance.

TREAT registry (2010 report, Oct 2010): The two groups 'Infliximab-treated' and 'Other Treatments' contain patients who also have been treated with other anti-TNF agents. For a correct evaluation of the safety  profile  of  infliximab  compared  to  standard  treatment  (non-biologic  treatment),  it  is  of importance  that  the  groups  compared  do  not  contain  patients  treated  with  another  anti-TNF  agent. Thus,  the  MAH  will  be  asked  to  do  a  re-analysis  of  data  from  the  TREAT  registry  within  variation EMEA/H/C/00240/II/142, where only patients belonging to a 'pure' infliximab group and a 'pure' nonbiologic group are compared. In this procedure the MAH presented data from the re-analysis of the TREAT registry as requested. Result from the sensitivity analysis concerning key AEs and SAEs were discussed. In addition, similar analyses were performed for the European Crohn's Registry (ENCORE), containing  safety  data  on  patients  with  active  or  fistulising  Crohn's  disease.  Overall,  no  obvious differences  can  be  observed  at  the  present  time  between  the  data  submitted  originally  for  the  2 registers and the new data comparing 'pure' infliximab and 'pure' non-biologic group.

The MAH presented a detailed review of the safety profile of 6-MP/azathioprine and a comparison with that of infliximab. Based on data from the clinical studies and the registries, it appears that there is a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

general pattern with increased incidence of AEs in patients receiving immunomodulators only (lowest incidence),  followed  by  infliximab  only,  to  patients  receiving  a  combination  of  the  two  drugs.  This pattern is likely due to the greater severity of the underlying Crohn's disease in subjects as they move through the treatment of immunomodulators, infliximab, and combination therapy for treatment of the most active disease. Like thiopurines, infliximab is an immunosuppressive drug with important risks including  serious  infections,  malignancy,  and  demyelinating  disorders.  Based  on  the  known  safety profiles  of  both  infliximab  and  AZA/6-MP,  the  associated  risks  appear  to  be  similar  in  nature  and magnitude. Each drug, however, has its own suite of AEs not common to the other. For infliximab, the clearest  examples  are  infusion  reactions  and  tuberculosis.  For  AZA,  they  are  pancreatitis  and  bone marrow suppression. In the SONIC trial, where the AEs associated with these drugs were prospectively compared, the data suggest that the safety profile of infliximab is not worse than 6-MP/AZA.

Overall, the safety profile of infliximab has been established in clinical trials and in ongoing registries in Crohn's disease, as well as from experience in other indications. Following more than 10 years on the market, with a number of structured follow up activities, such as the TREAT and ENCORE registries, the safety profile is considered well characterised. Data from the two registries give reassurance regarding the  long-term  safety  profile  of  infliximab  in  CD.  Serious  infections  and  risk  for  malignancy  are  well identified risks with infliximab that will continue to be closely monitored as detailed in the approved RMP.

## 1.2.4. Risk Management Plan

The MAH submitted a new version of the RMP: Version 5.0 to reflect the new indication and the result of the SONIC trial. The product details section was updated to add the indication of moderate Crohn's disease. The clinical trial exposure section was updated to add patient exposure from the SONIC trial.

The frequency section of the identified risk was updated with clinical trial information through the most recent  database  integration  and  from  SONIC  trial  concerning  serious  infection,  tuberculosis  and hepatobiliary events.

These changes and updates are endorsed by the CHMP.

## 1.2.5. User consultation

A justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: no significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made.

## 1.2.6. Change to the Product information

Further to the assessment of the proposals of the Marketing Authorisation Holder to amend the Product Information and in the light  of  the  assessment  of  the  submitted  data,  the  following  sections  of  the SmPC were amended (deletion; addition): 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1.

In  a  clinical  study  of  patients  with  Crohn's  disease  (SONIC),  infusion-related  reactions  occurred  in 16.6%  (27/163)  of  patients  receiving  infliximab  monotherapy,  5%  (9/179)  of  patients  receiving infliximab  in  combination  with  AZA,  and  5.6%  (9/161)  of  patients  receiving  AZA  monotherapy.  One serious infusion reaction (&lt;1%) occurred in a patient on infliximab monotherapy.

Immunogenicity: Patients who developed antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately 2-3 fold) to develop  infusion-related reactions. […] Of In Crohn's disease patients  who  received maintenance treatment, approximately 6-13% developed antibodies to infliximab occurred overall in 3.3% of patients receiving immunosuppressants and in 13.3% of patients not receiving immunosuppressants.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

## […] Adult Crohn's disease

## Induction treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease

The efficacy of a single dose treatment with infliximab was assessed in 108 patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  220  400) in a randomised, double-blinded, placebocontrolled, dose-response study.

[…]

## Maintenance treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease

The efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab was studied in a 1-year clinical study (ACCENT I).

[…]

Infliximab with or without AZA was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active comparator study (SONIC) of 508 adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CDAI  220  450) who were naive  to  biologics  and  immunosuppressants  and  had  a  median  disease  duration  of  2.3  years.  At baseline 27.4% of patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids, 14.2% of patients were receiving budesonide,  and  54.3%  of  patients  were  receiving  5-ASA  compounds.  Patients  were  randomized  to receive  AZA  monotherapy,  infliximab  monotherapy,  or  infliximab  plus  AZA  combination  therapy. Infliximab was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks. AZA was given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg daily.

The primary endpoint of the study was corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 26, defined as patients in clinical remission (CDAI of &lt;150) who, for at least 3 weeks, had not taken oral systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) or budesonide at a dose &gt; 6 mg/day. For results see Table 6.

The proportions of patients with mucosal healing at Week 26 were significantly greater in the infliximab plus  AZA  combination  (43.9%,  p&lt;0.001)  and  infliximab  monotherapy  groups  (30.1%,  p=0.023) compared to the AZA monotherapy group (16.5%).

## Crohn's disease

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these, you will be given Remicade to:

-  Treat serious active Crohn's disease,
-  Reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that have not been controlled by other medicines or surgery.

## 2. Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The SONIC study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab as monotherapy and in  combination  with  azathioprine  in  comparison  with  azathioprine  monotherapy  in  the  treatment  of moderate active Crohn's disease defined as CDAI score ≥ 220 and ≤ 450. The study population (SONIC) was patients with a median duration of Crohn's disease of 2.3 years, with no previous resections and that were naive to both immunomodulators and biologic agents and had failed the first line therapy.

Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (patient with a CDAI score of &lt;150 points; who had not taken oral systemic corticosteroids or budesonide &gt;6 mg/day for at least the previous 3 weeks) was induced by infliximab  treatment  in  Crohn's  patients  with  active  moderate  disease  in  44%  of  patients  receiving monotherapy  and  in  57%  of  patients  on  combination  therapy  (infliximab  plus  azathioprine).  The corresponding figure for patients receiving azathioprine monotherapy was 30%. The primary endpoint was evaluated at week 26 of treatment and secondary efficacy variables supported the results. This time point is considered relevant, since it can take up to 3 months before full effect of azathioprine is gained. Similar results have also been demonstrated in subpopulations with different baseline status of corticosteroid (including budesonide &gt;6 mg/day) and 5-ASA treatment response.

All patients included were naive to treatment with biologic agents and immunomodulators. Approximately 30-40% had received previous corticosteroid treatment, while the majority had been on 5-ASA. It was raised that since 5-ASA is not an effective treatment for moderate to severe CD, the full study population does not reflect completely the population in the proposed indication. Nevertheless additional  analyses  for  complete  corticosteroid-free  clinical  remission  showed  that  the  treatment response  in  the  patient  subgroups  that  mirrors  the  intended  patient  population  (i.e.  the  group  of patients who entered the trial using a criterion other than 5-ASA failure which includes patients who were either dependent on corticosteroids at baseline or those who had failed corticosteroids) is of the same magnitude as in other subgroups and of clinical relevance. The data show that irrespective of inclusion criteria used the outcome (primary efficacy endpoint) is similar in the treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with a longer median duration (7.5 years) in the ACCENT I study, clinical remission was likewise induced by infliximab. The efficacy was evaluated with two co-primary endpoints, proportion of patients at clinical remission at week 30 and time to loss of response through week 54.

Patients  in  the  ACCENT  I  study  were  classified  as  having  moderate  active  disease  according  to  the CDAI  scores  (between  220  and  400)  despite  current  or  prior  treatments  with  corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and/or immunomodulators.

Thus, overall beneficial effects have been shown for Crohn's patients at different stages of the disease; and in  the  different  subgroups  defined  by  the  inclusion  criteria.  Furthermore,  data  from  the  SONIC study  indicate  that  in  patients  with  objective  signs  of  active  disease  i.e.  increased  CRP  (predefined analysis)  and  with  endoscopic  signs  of  mucosal  lesions  at  baseline  (post-hoc  analyses)  achieve  a greater  benefit  of  the  treatment  compared  to  patients  with  normal  CRP  levels  and  no  lesions  at baseline.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The potential long-term beneficial effects of using infliximab in earlier stages of Crohn's disease have not been evaluated. It is not known whether early introduction of the treatment may induce a more sustained long-term effect (e.g. reduced need for surgery) and if the treatment may affect the natural course of the disease i.e. in preventing the changes of phenotype of the disease from predominantly inflammatory to stricturing disease. Follow-up on disease outcome is undertaken in ongoing registry activities (TREAT, ENCORE). Nevertheless, the currently available efficacy data are sufficient to support a change of the indication to include also treatment of moderately active Crohn's disease.

Apart from the activity of the disease, the localisation and behaviour of the disease are also important factors  in  the  management  of  patients  with  Crohn's  disease.  The  general  knowledge  of  how  these factors interact with both the course of the disease and the response to therapy remains limited. Such knowledge is beyond what is required in order to obtain an approval in use in Crohn's disease.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Known unfavourable effects of infliximab are the increased risk of infections, including serious, and a potential risk of lymphoproliferative disorders or malignancies. Risk for demyelination is among more uncommon additional types of events of concern. Furthermore, some patients will develop antibodies to  infliximab,  which  might  limit  the  future  use  of  the  compound,  and  is  associated  with  increased frequency of injection reactions. These events are described and addressed in the approved product information.  They  are  also  addressed  in  the  approved  RMP  and  closely  monitored  through  routine pharmacovigilance  activities  as  well  as  additional  surveillance  through  registries  and  studies  as necessary.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

It cannot be evaluated yet if earlier treatment would imply any long-term disadvantages for patients with Crohn's disease. Nevertheless the long term safety of infliximab is continuously followed on an ongoing basis through routine pharmacovigilance activities as well as additional surveillance through registries and long term safety follow-up studies as detailed in the RMP.

The safety of infliximab in comparison with the safety of alternatives in the long term is of importance. The  MAH  reviewed  and  discussed  about  the  safety  profile  for  AZA/6-MP  and  infliximab.  Based  on results from clinical studies and registries, when comparisons are made of groups of patients receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AZA/6-MP only, infliximab only, and a combination of the two, a general pattern of increasing incidence of  AEs  is  successively  observed.  This  pattern  is  considered  to  partly  mirror  the  severity  of  the underlying disease in the different treatment groups. This is also confirmed by the increasing numbers of AEs in the system organ class 'Gastrointestinal disorders' in these treatment groups. To what extent it explains the differences in overall number of AEs observed is not possible to elucidate fully.

From the TREAT registry, with its features of an observational study in mind, it is reported that  there was  increased  incidences  of  leucopenia,  aplasia  pure  red  cell,  and  transaminase  increased  for immunomodulator only group, while the incidences were generally comparable in subjects receiving infliximab  and  neither  infliximab  nor  immunomodulators.  Also  the  incidences  of  GI  serious  SAEs  of obstruction  and  stenosis  were  generally  higher  in  the  immunomodulator  only  group,  compared  with infliximab  groups,  as  well  as  hepatic  events.  In  contrast,  infections  (including  serious),  and  infusion reactions, as well as demyelinating events (a total of 3 patients in the 2010 report) were more often observed with infliximab.

With  respect  to  malignancy/lymphoproliferative  diseases,  there  are  several  reports  in  the  literature concerning  an  increased  risk  for  such  conditions  with  the  use  of  the  thiopurine  immunomodulators. This risk is also known with use of infliximab as detailed in the product information and monitored in the RMP. In the TREAT registry, there were no clear differences between the use of immunomodulators and infliximab (events per hundred patient years). It is interesting to note the publication summarising hepatosplenic  T-cell  lymphoma  in  IBD  patients  treated  with  infliximab  and  thiopurine  analogues (Kotlyar  et  al., Clin.  Gastroenterol.  Hepatol. 2010).  Among  36  cases  analysed,  all  had  received thiopurine analogues, either as monotherapy or combination therapy with anti-TNF agent, while none had received anti-TNF as monotherapy. Overall, there is no indication that infliximab carries a higher risk for malignancy/lymphoproliferative events than 6-MP /AZA.

The presented data show that treatments with both 6MP/AZA therapy and infliximab are connected with a number of potential serious adverse events and risks that are specific for each therapy. It is not possible  to  predict  from  the  presented  data  on  a  group  level  which  treatment  is  the  safest  for  the individual.  Nevertheless,  it  can  be  concluded  that  infliximab  overall  does  not  have  a  worse  safety profile than AZA/6-MP.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Infliximab treatment has been shown to be effective in Crohn's disease patients with both moderately and severely active disease. Although the majority of included patients did not fully correspond to the proposed indication, the presented revised analyses show a similar response also in the subgroup that mirrors the intended patient population. Corticosteroid-free remission has been demonstrated for up to one year in patients responding to the treatment. Thus, the treatment has a steroid-sparing effect. The SONIC study showed that infliximab, as monotherapy and in combination with AZA, had better efficacy results  than  AZA  monotherapy.  Although  long-term  benefits  of  treatment  of  moderate  CD  are  not known, the potential effect of delaying stricturing and penetrating disease would imply an additional benefit for the patients.

The  treatment  is  considered  to  be  an  alternative  for  patients  who  have  previously  been  steroidrefractory, -dependent, or intolerant. For active colonic Crohn's disease for patients that have relapsed (corticosteroids) infliximab is also regarded as an appropriate option with or without immunomodulator for patients with objective evidence of moderate or severe disease.

The new data from SONIC did not reveal any new safety signals with infliximab. The experience from two registries  is  reassuring  with  respect  to  long-term  safety.  In  these  registries,  there  are  no  clear

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

differences compared with patients treated with other conventional therapies, despite that patients on infliximab have more severe disease than comparators. The known potential risks (e.g. malignancy) and  identified  risks  (e.g.  serious  infections,  lymphoma,  including  the  risk  for  hepatosplenic  T-cell lymphoma)  will  continue  to  be  closely  followed  through  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  and additional surveillance through registries and studies as detailed in the RMP.

## Benefit-risk balance

Clinically relevant efficacy, in both patients with earlier and later stages of Crohn's disease, has been demonstrated. The SONIC study shows improved effect compared with AZA as monotherapy. There were no new safety signals identified during the study period. There is also now relatively extensive experience from two registries (TREAT and ENCORE), which supports an acceptable safety profile. A comparison of the safety profiles of infliximab and 6-MP/AZA reveals that these two treatments have different  main  safety  risks,  and  it  can  be  concluded  that  infliximab  does  not  have  an  overall  worse safety profile than 6-MP/AZA.

To conclude, infliximab treatment has been shown to be effective in Crohn's disease patients with both moderately and severely active disease and presented data further support that the long-term safety of  infliximab  is  not  worse  than  other  treatment  options.  The  benefit-risk  balance  is  therefore considered positive.

## 3. Conclusion
