## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AstraZeneca AB submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 24 August 2023 an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to include paediatric information based on final results from study D419EC00001 'Phase I/II, Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of Durvalumab Monotherapy or Durvalumab in Combination with Tremelimumab in Pediatric Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignancies'. In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to introduce editorial changes.

The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Information on paediatric requirements

The application included EMA Decisions P/0301/2023 and P/0302/2023  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIPs P/0301/2023 and P/0302/2023 were completed .

The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIPs P/0301/2023 and P/0302/2023.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

This variation concerns an update of the Imfinzi and Imjudo Products information (PI) based on the results from study D419EC00001, to include pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety paediatric data.

Study D419EC00001 was a phase I/II, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of durvalumab monotherapy or durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in paediatric patients with advanced solid tumours and haematological malignancies'.

## Pharmacokinetic

The paediatric PK studies were based on fully validated methods. The trial design, dose selection and reported data corresponds to the ICH guidelines on PK studies in paediatric population, paediatric extrapolation.

Overall, in the study D419EC00001, the paediatric durvalumab systemic exposures, in combination with tremelimumab for paediatric patients &lt; 35 kg were lower relative to adult systemic exposures at a durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks but were generally similar to adult systemic exposures at a dose of 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks.

Population PK modelling and simulation data showed that systemic exposures in paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg were generally similar to adult systemic exposures at a durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, but higher compared to adult systemic exposures (approximately 1.5-fold) at a durvalumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose of 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Tremelimumab systemic exposures, in combination with durvalumab, were generally similar to adult systemic exposures at a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks for paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg but were lower relative to adult systemic exposures for paediatric patients &lt; 35 kg.

There is no indication for durvalumab or tremelimumab, and the combination of both in paediatric population. Therefore, no posology recommendation can be made. The Applicant´s summary of available information in section 4.2 reflects the data available.

## Pharmacology

The combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab results in enhanced circulating quantities of proliferating CD4 T cells, as evident by an increase in CD4+Ki67+ T -cells, is consistent with the proposed mechanisms of action of both immune checkpoint inhibitors. This result is comparable to that observed for adult NSCLC patients also receiving this combination.

## Efficacy

No formal efficacy analysis was performed for patients in the dose-finding phase; however, based on Investigator assessment of overall RECIST responses, 2 patients in the dose-finding phase, one at each dose level, with osteosarcoma and papillary type renal carcinoma, respectively, had a PR for over one year.

In the dose-expansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set, and 4.8% (1/21 patients) in the FAS. No response was observed in the 11 patients initially enrolled in the SARCOMA cohort in the first stage of the Simon 2-stage design, leading to cohort discontinuation. In the STO cohort, an ORR of 11.1% (1/9 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set, and 10.0% (1/10 patients) in the FAS, as one patient with chordoma had a confirmed response of PR 1.8 months after the first dose of study treatment, with a DoR of 10.8 months.

In the evaluable for response analysis set, DCR was 9.1% (1/11 patients) in the SARCOMA cohort and 11.1% (1/9 patients) in the STO cohort at both Week 16 and Week 24. Similar results were observed for sensitivity analyses performed on the FAS. The median PFS in the SARCOMA and STO cohorts was 1.7 months (90% CI: 1.58, 1.91) and 1.7 months (90% CI: 0.89, 2.76), respectively, and all patients in the dose-expansion phase of the study had progression events (PD or death). In the SARCOMA cohort, the median OS was 6.6 months (90% CI: 1.87, 15.77), with a survival rate of 25.6% at 12 months. In the STO cohort, the median OS was 6.9 months (90% CI: 1.61, NR), with a survival rate of 40.0% at 12 months and 30.0% at 24 months.

Overall, the study is negative efficacy-wise, and no paediatric indication is sought. The SmPC reflects the data available.

## Safety

Assessment of safety was a primary objective for the dose-finding phase of this study. The safety profile was as expected for this patient population and consistent with the known safety profile of durvalumab administered as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab in adults.

No new safety concerns were identified.

No treatment-emergent ADA against durvalumab or tremelimumab were detected, thus no assessment of the potential impact of ADA on safety could be made.

The safety data collected in Study D419EC00001 belongs to a paediatric development for an indication neither approved in children nor in adults. Thus, the safety data are presented together with the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results of the paediatric clinical study in section 5.1 instead of section 4.8, in order to avoid confusions or off-label use in the paediatric population.

The full PIP compliance check opinions for the durvalumab PIP (EMEA-002028-PIP01-16-M04) and the tremelimumab PIP (EMEA-002029-PIP01-16-M04) has been submitted with the response to the RSI. PDCO adopted a positive opinion for both procedures on 13 October 2023.

The benefit-risk balance of Imfinzi and Imjudo, remains positive.

## 5. Introduction

Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD L1 protein and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 proteins, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

Tremelimumab is a human mAb that targets the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T-cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death.

Durvalumab is being developed as monotherapy, and in combination with tremelimumab and other anticancer agents, as a potential immunotherapy treatment across various tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of treatment. Durvalumab is approved:

- As a monotherapy treatment for adults with unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose disease has not progressed after chemoradiation therapy based on the PACIFIC Phase III study.
- In combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin as first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in the US, European Union (EU), Japan, China, and many other countries around the world based on the CASPIAN Phase III study.
- In combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase genomic tumour aberrations (based on the pivotal Phase III POSEIDON study [D419MC00004]).
- In combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (based on the pivotal Phase III TOPAZ-1 study [D933AC00001]).
- In combination with tremelimumab for adult patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (based on the pivotal Phase III HIMALAYA study [D419CC00002]).

Imjudo (tremelimumab) is currently only approved for use in combination with durvalumab as stated above.

With this submission the MAH is proposing an update to the paediatric information included in the product labelling for Imjudo and Imfinzi.

The MAH has included the final Clinical Study Report for Study D419EC00001, titled 'Phase I/II, OpenLabel, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of Durvalumab Monotherapy or Durvalumab in Combination with Tremelimumab in Pediatric Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignancies.'

Study D419EC00001 is listed in the EU PIPs (EMEA-002028-PIP01-16-M04 and EMEA-002029-PIP0116-M04) as Study 2. The study evaluated the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab in 50 paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory malignant solid tumours (except primary central nervous system tumours). This submission of paediatric study results is performed in compliance with these paediatric investigation plans (PIP) which do not support a paediatric indication.

Please note that the same Type II update to the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca MAA has been submitted separately as this license is to withdraw as per notification to EMA 29 September 2023. In spite of this a separate report is circulated (Tremelimumab AstraZeneca II/002).

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 6.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Population PK models

To evaluate if the pharmacokinetic behaviour of durvalumab and tremelimumab is similar between adults and paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab and tremelimumab after IV administration in paediatric population with advanced solid malignancies were assessed in a phase I/II study (D419EC00001 2023). In the current analysis, previously developed population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models for durvalumab and tremelimumab were updated by integrating the paediatric sparse PK data to describe the serum concentration-time profile of durvalumab and tremelimumab in paediatric and adult patients with various tumour types. Typical population mean parameters and associated inter- and intra-individual variability, as well as the influence of covariates on the PopPK parameters of durvalumab and tremelimumab were assessed.

Several PopPK models have been developed for durvalumab and the most recent one (D419CC00002 2021) was developed using 7 phase I/II/III clinical studies (1108, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, CASPIAN, POSEIDON, Study 22, and HIMALAYA). Durvalumab PK was characterized using a 2-compartment model with a time dependent clearance. Albumin levels (ALB), creatinine CL, ECOG status, LDH, sex, body weight (WT), tumour types and combination therapy were statistically significant covariates on clearance. WT and sex had a statistically significant impact on central volume of distribution. However, none of the covariates were considered as clinically relevant (impact on CL and V1 were less than or about 30%).

Two PopPK models have been developed for tremelimumab and the most recent one (D419CC00002 2021) was developed using 8 phase I/II/III clinical studies (D4190C00002, D4190C00006, D4190C00010, D4880C00003 (DETERMINE), D4884C00001, POSEIDON, Study 22 and HIMALAYA). The model was described by a 2-compartmental distribution model with both linear and timedependent elimination (for monotherapy, elimination was linear only). WT, ALB, sex, combination therapy and primary indication had a statistically significant impact on clearance. WT and sex had a statistically significant impact on central volume of distribution. However, none of the covariates were considered as clinically relevant (impact on CL and V1 were less than or about 30%).

A summary of the applied approach used to evaluate if the pharmacokinetic behaviour of durvalumab and tremelimumab is similar between adults and paediatrics can be seen in Figure 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 Overview of Pharmacometrics Analysis

<!-- image -->

Firstly, Durvalumab and tremelimumab concentrations versus time profiles were explored graphically to isolate patterns and features in the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the different subjects and/or populations included in this PopPK analysis. Due to the different study designs of the studies included in this analysis, the graphical evaluation was performed using time after last dose instead of chronological time and also normalizing drug levels by dose level when appropriate.

Secondly, an external evaluation by means of VPC methodology was used to evaluate if the pharmacokinetic behaviour of durvalumab and tremelimumab is similar between adults and paediatrics. A graphical way of evaluating the performance of the established adult PopPK model was to simulate the same design properties of the external dataset (data from paediatrics) using the final parameter estimates of the established population PK model (adult PopPK model), and then, compare the distributions between simulations and observations. A plot of the time course of the paediatric durvalumab and tremelimumab observations along with the 90% prediction intervals for the simulated values from the PopPK model in adults provided a VPC. Similar PK behaviour between populations (adults and paediatrics) was concluded if the observations from paediatric mostly laid within the 90% prediction intervals and they are randomly distributed throughout the simulated typical PK profile derived from the adult PopPK model.

Results of this external evaluation determined the population approach that was implemented to adequately estimate pharmacokinetics of durvalumab and tremelimumab in paediatrics:

- Updating adult PopPK model: if adult PopPK model adequately described paediatric PK data
- To develop a new PopPK model: if adult PopPK model poorly described paediatric PK data

If similar PK behaviour of durvalumab or tremelimumab was concluded between both populations (adults and paediatrics) during the external evaluation, the adult PopPK model was updated including the paediatric PK data. Thus, the adult PopPK model was rerun adding the PK samples from paediatric study, and the new parameter estimates were considered as the final PopPK parameters for both populations (adults + paediatrics). This new PopPK model (adults + paediatrics) has the same

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

structure than that of adults. If deemed necessary, some arrangements in this new PopPK model (adult + paediatrics) were allowed to improve model fit.

## Durvalumab Population PK model

Table 1 provides a stratification of the data used in the population PK analysis per study. There were 50 paediatric patients and 4050 patients from previous dataset, resulting a total 4100 patients in the dataset. A total of 221 below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) samples (1.46%) were excluded from current analysis and 5 of them were from paediatric study. In addition, 13 samples from paediatric study were also excluded from the analysis due to incorrect PK sample time. Eventually, 15166 serum PK samples from 4100 patients treated with durvalumab were available in the final dataset for analysis.

A correlation plot illustrating correlations between continuous covariates indicated that CrCL was correlated with age and WT. Otherwise, no relevant correlations were observed. No important dependencies between categorical-continuous covariate pairs were observed.

Figure 2 shows concentrations vs time since last dose (TSLD) by study and dose. There were no signs of evident differences in the systemic exposure of durvalumab between the paediatric group and adults.

An external evaluation by means of pc-VPC methodology was used to evaluate if the previous adult PopPK model was able to predict the new paediatric PK data (see Figure 3). Due to most of the paediatric observations are within the prediction intervals of adult PopPK model, a similar PK behaviour between the two populations (adults and paediatrics) could be concluded.

Based on these results, the full covariate model was re-evaluated based on the current data (paediatric + adult) and previous developed model structure (adult PopPK model). The covariate analysis was then conducted in three steps:

- Covariates included in the full covariate model were removed one by one to assess their impact to obtain a starting model for the following step.
- Graphical inspected all covariate effects and covariates of interest were tested to assess their impact on the full covariate model.
- In addition, the relevance of inter-individual variability and residual variability was also evaluated.

Additionally, the few covariates of interest (paediatric vs. adult population, and age) were tested on CL and V1. These analyses confirmed that age was a significant covariate for durvalumab on CL and V1.

The following durvalumab model was chosen as final model:

- Two-compartmental distribution model with time-dependent clearance.
- Inter-subject variability (IIV) was characterised on clearance (CL), central volume (V1), peripheral volume (V2) and the maximum change for time-dependent clearance
- A combination of proportional and additive residual error model
- Albumin levels (ALB), creatinine CL, ECOG status, LDH, sex, body weight (WT), combination therapy, tumour type and age as statistically significant covariates on CL

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- WT, sex and age had a statistically significant impact on V1.

The relationships between the covariates and the model parameters are described in the following equations:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where CLcat.cov, CLcont.cov and CLT,i represent the impact of categorical and continuous covariates and the individual total CL including the time-dependent decrease of CL, respectively.

The parameter estimates for the final updated model are reported in Table 3. Parameters were well estimated and the typical parameter estimates CL, V1 and V2 are 0.286 L/day, 3.45 L and 2.08 L, which are close to what have been reported previously, 0.277 L/day, 3.45 L and 2.13 L respectively (D419CC00002 2021). All parameter estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals, as a measure of estimation uncertainty, estimated using the standard error of the estimates obtained from the minimization routine. The paediatric population presents a reduction of the mean age and mean total body weight (11.5 years and 43.9 kg) compared with mean adult population (62.3 years and 71.0 kg) of -81% and -38%, respectively. Thus, as expected from the covariate effect of age and weight on PK parameters, the mean individual post-hoc parameters CL, V1 and V2 for paediatric population (0.171 L/day, 2.04 L and 1.71 L, respectively) were -39%, -39% and -19 % lower than the mean individual post-hoc PK parameters in adults (0.280 L/day, 3.35 L and 2.11 L, respectively).

The large degree of overlap between the observed and model derived concentrations in subjects with age lower than 18 years and in subjects with weight lower than 35 kg indicated that the current model could adequately describe durvalumab pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects.

The impact of the selected covariates on clearance at steady-state (CL,ss) and V1 based on a univariate assessment are presented as tornado plots in Figure 4 and Figure 5, using paediatric covariate range relative to adult reference after administration of 20 mg/kg (that corresponds to a total dose of 780 mg for a paediatric subject of 39 kg (median of paediatric population)).

Only bodyweight showed a significant impact on model parameters CLss and V1, with a maximum change of -46.9% on CLss and -56.9% on V1 for the 5th percentile of observed paediatric WT values, predicting a significant increase of AUCss +88.2% (see Figure 6) in paediatric patients with lower bodyweight. For all other tested covariates, no covariate showed a significant impact on model parameters CLss and V1. AGE had the most pronounced impact on CLss and V1, with a maximum change of -31% in CLss and -22% [V1] for the 5th percentile of observed AGE in the paediatric population.

In this case, the same paediatric population with WT &lt; 35 kg and with WT ≥ 35 kg were modelled to receive a dose normalized by weight of 30 mg/kg, that corresponds to a total dose of 615 mg and 1695 mg, respectively. On the other hand, the adult reference patient of 69 kg, was modelled to receive a durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg (total dose of 1380 mg). The predicted drug exposure at 28 days (AUC0-28) in paediatric patients with WT &lt; 35 kg at 30 mg/kg (3191 day* μ g/mL) is similar to that in adults at 20 mg/kg (3888 day* μ g/mL) with a reduction of -18%, being both higher than the reference (2105 day* μ g/mL). Additionally, a higher drug exposure at Day 28 (increase of +53%) is predicted for paediatric patients with WT ≥ 35 kg at 30 mg/kg (5957 day*µg/mL) compared with drug exposure predicted in adults at the dose of 20 mg/kg (3888 day*µg/mL).

## Tremelimumab population PK model

Table 4 provides a stratification of the data used in the population PK analysis per study. Eight out of 50 paediatric patients included in paediatric study D419EC00001 2023 were not included in this analysis due to the lack of tremelimumab PK data in these subjects. Thus, the tremelimumab dataset consisted of 42 paediatric patients and 2406 patients from previous dataset, resulting a total 2448 patients in the dataset. A total of 286 below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) samples (3.76%) were excluded from current analysis and 6 of them were from paediatric study. In addition, 2 samples from paediatric study were also excluded from the analysis due to incorrect PK sample time. Eventually, 7611 serum PK samples from 2448 patients treated with tremelimumab were available in the final dataset for analysis.

Figure 8 shows concentrations vs time since last dose (TSLD) by study and dose. There were no signs of evident differences in the systemic exposure of tremelimumab between the paediatric group and adults. None of the evaluated paediatric patients for tremelimumab were found ADA positive therefore, the influence of ADA on paediatric tremelimumab pharmacokinetics could not be evaluated.

The first step of model development consists of evaluating the feasibility to reproduce the same PopPK results than that obtained in the previous well-established adult PopPK (D419CC00002 2021). Thus, an external evaluation by means of pc-VPC methodology was used to evaluate if the previous adult PopPK model was able to predict the new paediatric PK data (see Figure 9). Due to most of the paediatric observations were within the prediction intervals of adult PopPK model, a similar PK behaviour between the two populations (adults and paediatrics) could be concluded.

CI = confidence interval; pcVPC = prediction-corrected visual predictive check

Based on these results, the full covariate model was re-evaluated based on the current data (paediatric + adult) and previous developed model structure (adult PopPK model). The covariate analysis was then conducted in three steps:

- Covariates included in the full covariate model were removed one by one to assess their impact to obtain a starting model for the following step.
- Graphical inspected all covariate effects and covariates of interest were tested to assess their impact on the full covariate model.
- In addition, the relevance of inter-individual variability and residual variability was also evaluated.

Additionally, a few covariates of interest (paediatric vs. adult population, and age) were tested on CL and V1. The paediatric or adult effect on V1 and CL was barely made significant (14.2 and 15.6&gt;10.83), but both models failed. In addition, these analyses confirmed that age was a not a significant covariate for tremelimumab on V1 and CL, and therefore, the following was considered as the final model:

- Two-compartmental distribution model with both linear and time-dependent elimination (for monotherapy, elimination was linear only).
- Inter-subject variability (IIV) was characterized on clearance (CL), central volume (V1), peripheral volume (V2) and the maximum change for time-dependent clearance. Correlations between CL, V1, and V2 were estimated via and omega block.
- A combination of proportional and additive residual error model

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Weight (WT), Albumin levels (ALB), sex, combination therapy and primary indication had a statistically significant impact on CL
- Weight (WT) and sex had a statistically significant impact on V1

The relationships between the covariates and the model parameters are described in the following equations:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where CLcat.cov, CLcont.cov and CLT,i represent the impact of categorical and continuous covariates and the individual total CL including the time-dependent decrease of CL (for durvalumab + tremelimumab combinations), and CLi shows the respective CL term without time-dependency (for tremelimumab monotherapy).

The parameter estimates for the final updated model are reported in Table 5. Parameters were well estimated and the typical parameter estimates CL, V1 and V2 are 0.288 L/day, 3.57 L and 2.51 L, which are close to what have been reported previously, 0.295 L/day, 3.59 L and 2.69 L respectively (D419CC00002 2021). All parameter estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals, as a measure of estimation uncertainty, estimated using the standard error of the estimates obtained from the minimization routine. The paediatric population presents a reduction of the mean total body weight compared with mean adult population (44.3 and 71.4 kg, respectively) of -38%. Thus, as expected from the covariate effect of weight on PK parameters, the mean individual post-hoc parameters CL, V1 and V2 for paediatric population (0.193 L/day, 2.03 L and 1.70 L, respectively) were -28%, -43% and -35% lower than the mean individual post-hoc PK parameters in adults (0.269 L/day, 3.54 L and 2.60 L, respectively).

In order to explore the influence of weight on paediatric population, it was decided to perform a new model simulation, where the dose was normalized by weight (D= 1 mg/kg) and subjects were grouped 3 different populations: paediatric patients with WT &lt; 35 kg (median of 7 years and 22 kg), paediatric patients with WT ≥ 35kg (median of 15 years and 55.5 kg), and adults (median of 63 years and 69.8 kg). Each group were modelled to receive a dose normalized by weight of 1 mg/kg, that corresponds to a total dose of 22, 55.5, and 69.8 mg, respectively (Figure 13). A similar drug exposure (AUC0-INF) was predicted between paediatrics of WT ≥ 35kg and adults, observing a very slight decrease of drug exposure in paediatrics with WT ≥ 35kg (-11%). On the other hand, a greater reduction of AUC0-INF (-45%) was observed in paediatric subjects with WT &lt; 35 kg. Considering that the minimum acceptable AUC0-28 for this paediatric population was established to be 119.5 day* μ g/mL for tremelimumab, the simulated values of AUC0-28 were lower than 119.5 day* μ g/mL for paediatric patients with WT &lt; 35 kg (88 day* μ g/mL) and higher for patients with WT ≥ 35 kg (155 day*µg/mL), that corresponds to a reduction of -26% and increase of +30% with respect to reference, respectively.

## 6.2. Results

## Pharmacodynamics

In study D419EC00001, no patient received a routine vaccination during the study; therefore, no data were available for reporting the impact of treatment on vaccine antibody titer measurements before and after planned routine immunization administered during the study.

The effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab on circulating quantities of T, B, and NK cells (TBNK) as well as effects on CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation were evaluated in patients enrolled in the initial dosefinding phase and the subsequent dose-expansion phase. Treatment in the dose-finding phase consisted of a single durvalumab cycle followed by 4 cycles of the combination regimen; regimens consisting of durvalumab 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg - both combined with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg, were evaluated. Results from this study are analysed and compared with flow cytometry data reported in adults from a chosen comparator study, Study D4190C00006.

An increase in CD4+Ki67+ T-cells was observed in all evaluable patients within the dose-finding phase, specifically at day 8 following the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab (Cycle 2 Day 8) but only demonstrated significance in the patients receiving the 20 mg/kg durvalumab and 1 mg/kg tremelimumab regimen (p &lt; 0.05 by Wilcoxon method). Of significance, results in this study indicated that CD4+ Ki67+ T-cell quantities were elevated on day 8 (Cycle 1 Day 8) in 100% of patients in the dose-expansion phase receiving the durvalumab 30 mg/kg and tremelimumab 1 mg/kg regimen (p &lt; 0.01) (Figure 14). These data are similar to findings from the adult NSCLC population in Study D4190C00006, specifically reported for the cohorts of patients receiving durvalumab as 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg in combination with a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg. In the adult study, the magnitude of the increase in CD4+Ki67+ T-cells was correlated with the tremelimumab dose; however, only a single dose level of tremelimumab (1 mg/kg) was evaluated in this study.

## Immunogenicity

Assessment of immunogenicity was a secondary objective for the dose-finding and dose-expansion phases of this study. Of patients who were evaluable for ADA, 2 patients had detectable ADA against durvalumab at baseline, one each in the dose-finding and dose-expansion phases, and no postbaseline ADA against durvalumab was observed. For tremelimumab, no ADA response was observed at either baseline or post baseline in patients who were evaluable for ADA. Since there was no treatmentemergent ADA against durvalumab or tremelimumab, an assessment of the potential impact of ADA on PK or safety could not be performed.

## 6.3. Discussion

In the population PK analyses, pooled data of durvalumab or tremelimumab concentrations versus time profiles were explored graphically stratified by study to isolate patterns and features in the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the adult vs. paediatric populations. Thereafter, an external evaluation by means of pcVPCs was used to evaluate if the pharmacokinetic behaviour of durvalumab or tremelimumab was similar between adults and paediatrics. It is agreed that the pcVPCs (stratified by study, age and weight groups) indicates that the existing durvalumab and tremelimumab population PK models are sufficient to describe PK characteristics in the paediatric population of Study D419EC00001. The full covariate model was re-evaluated based on the pooled data (paediatric + adult) and previous developed model structure (adult population PK model structure). Additionally, the paediatric/adult population effect was tested as a categorical covariate and age was tested as a continuous covariate on clearance and central volume of distribution. Age was found to be statistically significant on CL and V1 in the durvalumab model and included in the final model. The paediatric/adult effect was found to be marginally statistically significant on CL and V1 in the tremelimumab model but both models failed. Therefore, the paediatric/adult effect on CL and V1 was not included in the final tremelimumab model and the model fails to capture any tremelimumab age-related effect on CL and V1 that may have been present in Study D419EC00001. Using the univariate approach, WT was the only covariate in the durvalumab model that had a clinically meaningful impact on CL and V1, with a maximum change -46.9% on CL and -56.9% change on V1 for the 5 th  percentile of the paediatric WT distribution. Simulations indicated that exposure in paediatric patients ≥ 35kg were generally similar to adult exposures at durvalumab doses of 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, but higher compared to adult systemic exposures at durvalumab doses of 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks. For the tremelimumab model, WT was also highly influential on CL and V1 when testing the impact of covariates using the univariate approach. WT exerted a maximum change of -51% and -54.1% on CL and V1, respectively, at the 5 th percentile of the paediatric WT distribution. Tremelimumab model simulations, showed that systemic exposures in paediatric patients ≥ 35kg receiving tremelimumab 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks were similar to exposures in adults receiving 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks, whereas in paediatric patients &lt; 35kg,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure was lower relative to adults. The additional text in section 5.2 of the SmPC is considered appropriate.

The combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab results in enhanced circulating quantities of proliferating CD4 T cells, as evident by an increase in CD4+Ki67+ T -cells, is consistent with the proposed mechanisms of action of both immune checkpoint inhibitors. This result is comparable to that observed for adult NSCLC patients also receiving this combination. However, no similar increases were seen for the CD8 Ki67+ CD8+ T-cells, which were increased in selected cohorts within Study D4190C00006 but were not observed in this study, suggesting a difference in activation patterns for this subset of immune cells. This could reflect a biologic difference between the adult and paediatric populations or could be a result of the small sample size within the current study.

## 6.4. Pharmacokinetics

The Applicant submitted updated clinical pharmacology data supporting the intended label updates for IMFINZI® (durvalumab) and IMJUDO® (tremelimumab). Data included PK, and immunogenicity data from study D419EC00001, an open-label, non-randomized, international, multicentre study investigating durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab (every 4 weeks for 4 cycles) followed by durvalumab monotherapy (every 4 weeks) in paediatric patients from birth to &lt; 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory malignant solid tumours. The study was conducted in 2 sequential phases: a dose-finding phase (Phase I), followed by a dose-expansion phase (Phase II).

The clinical pharmacological data are derived from one main study (D419EC00001) and 12 supportive studies, of which 10 provide supportive data for durvalumab and 8 provide supportive data for tremelimumab. These supportive studies were described in a previous submission to the agency.

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

The primary objective was to identify the adult equivalent dose to be taken forward and to determine the safety profile and preliminary antitumor activity of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in solid malignant tumours, using disease specific response criteria.

Cut point was established in each validation study by statistical aualysis of SN atios of RLU responses of the individial maive samples from patients with cancer without dng nomalized relative to the pooled senum matix blank RLU sigal.

- The overall precision of the mw response for each positive contol level (high positive contol, low positive contol). andre-adjusted low positive conhol was ≤ 23.0%6 and met the target criterion of ≤ 25.0%6. The overall precision of the raw response for negative contol was 27.0%6, which was greater than the target criterion of  25.0%6. High Degative contol response Was observed in 2 nms. The nms were perfonmed on the same day and met the final acceptance citeria of cut point factor (l.59 sigual to badkgroumd ratio) &lt; low positive contol sigal to noise. All oher nms demonstated comparable negative conhol response; therefore,overallprecision of the raw response for megative control was foumd to be acceptable.
- Confimatory cut point was established for each disease state matix by statistical analysis of the percent inhibition levels ofthe responses of individual naive samples fom patients with.cancer tested, both with and without dhug. A 0.196 false-positive mate was used for mesothelioma and other cancer indications.
- Represents sueening assay sensitivity.
- 山 Additional drug tolerance evahation was perfommed at the AshaZeneca South San Francisco bioanalytical laboratory. According to the report G-DM-0143, the assay can detect 2100 ng/mL positive coutrol in the presence of ≤ 16l pgmL of duvalmab (≤ 182 pg/mL in the screening tier).

| Selectivity & matrix effect                                        | Human serum from patients with solid thumors Selectivity im disease state mahix was evaluated using 18 senum samples firom human individuals with solid tumors:Three different lots of breast, hng, bladder, ovarian, head/'neck, and gashic cancer sera were used. The individual serum samples were tested both uwspiked and spiked with tremelimumab at a concenhation (200 ng/mL) between LLOQ and the LQC levels. For controls, pooled normal human serm was tested both mspiked (3 duplicate determinations) and spiked (3 separate aliquots each tested in duplicate), using the same spike sohution used for the samples. Specificity (umspiked samples) and selectivity (spiked samples) of temelimumab measwement in samples from patients with solid hmors met the acceptamce cniteria in 100% of the lots tested. |                   | See Table 6 of Report VR47 85 Amendment 4       |

| Selectivity & matrix effect | Selectivity in Sernum fiom Patients with Vanious Types of Cancer: Selectivity m disease state mahix Was evaluated using 24 serum samples from patients diagnosed with various types of cancer. The imdividual sawples Were analysed in an assay together with 3 replicate spikes of a normal huwan senum mahix pool. The imdividual samples and the 3 pool samples were tested both umsplked and spilked with 250 ng/mL MEDI1123. Each sawple was tested in duplicate. The method was considered to be Selective formeaswing MEDll123 in humansenum from patients with solid tumors if 100% of the mspiked samples measued below the expected LLOQ (156.25 ng/mL) of the assay and if at least 80% of the spiked samples measwed within 25% of the mean value of the 3 spiked samples of pooled normal human senm.

| Cross-Talidation                                            | Evaluation of inter-laboratory aceuacy was performed sing samples prepared and measured by Intertek Pharmaceutical Services and analysed as umknowms by MedImmme. Intertek provided MedImmume with 30 serum samples containing MEDI1123 at various concenhations. These sawples were shipped on diry ice and were stored at -80°C f 10°C umtil thawed prior to analysis for MEDll123 using Medlmmume using the standard operating procedure CT-051173. Results generated by Medlmmme were compared to the Medlmmume and Intertek measwed sample values were expected to agree within 30% relative difference. Out of 30 samples, 26 were evaluable for this comparison. Four amples prepared at Intertek could not tested without an additional dilution due to the narrower dymamic range of the Medlmmume assay (156.25 ng/mL to 2621.44 ng/mL at Medlmmume vs. 156.25 ng/mL to 5000.00ng/mL at Intertek).

## Pharmacokinetic results

## Dose-finding phase:

Pharmacokinetic results were grouped by treatment and body weight ( ≥ 35 kg [Arm A] versus &lt; 35 kg [Arm B]) for the dose-finding phase in the study D419EC00001. Arm A and Arm B, each contained a dosing group with durvalumab 20 mg/kg + tremelimumab 1 mg/kg (D20+T1) and durvalumab 30 mg/kg + tremelimumab 1 mg/kg (D30+T1).

Geometric mean serum durvalumab concentrations are summarized for C1 in Figure 15, with tremelimumab concentrations from C2 (the first administration) summarized in Figure 16. Pharmacokinetic results are summarized in Table 20 and Table 21 for durvalumab and tremelimumab, respectively.

Geometric mean durvalumab AUC0-28 was approximately 25% lower for patients &lt; 35 kg compared to patients ≥ 35 kg at both DLs. Where comparisons could be made (noting that, AUC0-28 was not calculable for Arm B/D20+T1 cohort), geometric mean tremelimumab AUC0-28 was nearly the same between these groups.

Systemic exposure targets were established for the paediatric population that represented 50% of the adult AUC0-28 (study D4190C00006). For patients with calculable AUC0-28, 5 of 6 patients in the Arm A/D20+T1 cohort, and 2 of 3 patients in the Arm B/D20+T1 cohort achieved target durvalumab systemic exposure. All patients with calculable AUC0-28 receiving 30 mg/kg durvalumab achieved or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exceeded the target durvalumab systemic exposure. Target tremelimumab systemic exposures were achieved for all patients with reportable AUC0-28, regardless of body weight. On the basis of these results, the RP2D was determined to be 30 mg/kg durvalumab and 1 mg/kg tremelimumab.

Between the 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dosages, durvalumab systemic exposure appeared to increase slightly more than proportionally, as AUC0-28 and Cmax increased by 2- to 3- fold and Cmin increased by 3- to 5- fold.

Geometric mean estimates of t½ λ z (terminal half-life, time required to divide the plasma concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium) ranged from 14.2 to 25.4 days for durvalumab (where n ≥ 2, geometric mean not discussed where n = 1) and from 15.6 to 31.6 days for tremelimumab; t½ λ z values were derived from a limited number of samples and should be interpreted cautiously. For both analytes, there was no evidence of any notable changes in PK following repeat administration; trough and end of infusion sampling demonstrated relatively stable serum concentrations, albeit from a small sampling of patients.

Systemic exposure for durvalumab at 20 mg/kg was found to not meet the criteria of adult equivalent exposure defined in the CSP for both weight groups. Systemic exposure was found to be generally similar to adult target systemic exposure with a dose of 30 mg/kg for participants &lt; 35kg. Systemic exposure in participants receiving durvalumab at 30 mg/kg and that were ≥ 35 kg was found to be approximately 2-fold higher than the adult target systemic exposure. Tremelimumab systemic exposure was found to be generally similar to adult systemic exposure in all weight groups at 1 mg/kg.

## Dose-finding phase:

Pharmacokinetic results were summarized by tumour type in the dose-expansion phase (SARCOMA [bone sarcomas: osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma; soft-tissue sarcomas: rhabdomyosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma, other sarcomas] versus STO [other solid tumours]), where all patients received the same planned treatment of 30 mg/kg durvalumab and 1 mg/kg tremelimumab from the first cycle onward. Geometric mean serum durvalumab concentrations are summarized for C1 of the dose-expansion phase in Figure 17, with tremelimumab concentrations summarized in Figure 18. Pharmacokinetic results are summarized for durvalumab and tremelimumab in Table 22 and Table 23, respectively.

Data represent single dose of tremelimumab administered with duvalumab at Cycle 1.

Prior to C1 dosing, durvalumab concentrations were quantified at low concentrations (&lt; 1% Cmax) for 7 patients (2 in SARCOMA cohort, 5 in STO cohort). No pre-dose concentration of durvalumab was detected for the remaining patients (9 in SARCOMA cohort, 5 in STO cohort). There was no impact on single dose PK results and no data handling was deemed necessary. Following the first dose, serum durvalumab peaked at the end of the infusion for all patients, declining thereafter through 28 days post-dose, where levels were quantifiable for all patients evaluated; geometric Cmin was 108 and 78.3 μ g/mL for SARCOMA and STO cohorts, respectively. Geometric mean concentration-time profiles were very similar for SARCOMA and STO cohorts, with no notable difference in PK results. Geometric mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

values for t½ λ z were 17.4 and 14.2 days for the SARCOMA and STO cohorts, respectively. Interpatient variability was generally in the range of 20% to 30%, with values ranging from 14.2% to 94.1%, in terms of geometric CV% for durvalumab AUC, Cmax, and Cmin parameters. The relatively high variability for Cmin (94.1%) appeared largely attributable to a low value for a single patient (19.2 μ g/mL). Overall, durvalumab PK results in the dose-expansion phase were similar to the dose-finding phase, most closely matching the Arm B/D30+T1 cohort (&lt; 35 kg).

Target durvalumab systemic exposures (i.e., AUC0-28 ≥ 2105 day* μ g/mL) were achieved for all patients with an evaluable AUC in the dose-expansion phase. AUC0-28 was reported for 14 patients, with all results &gt; 2105 day* μ g/mL. Of 7 patients with no reported AUC0-28, the AUC0-14 was reportable and &gt; 2105 day* μ g/mL for 5 patients and was not calculable for 2 patients. Subsequent sampling at trough and end of infusion (EOI) was available for a limited number of patients; these results suggested durvalumab systemic exposure was relatively stable following repeat administration (28 day cycle).

Tremelimumab was BLQ prior to the first dose in all patients in C1. Following dosing, serum concentrations peaked at the end of the 1 hour-infusion before declining through the last sample at 28 days post-dose, where levels were quantifiable for all patients evaluated at a geometric Cmin of 3.91 or 3.40 μ g/mL for SARCOMA and STO cohorts, respectively. Overall, tremelimumab concentrations were similar between cohorts in the dose-expansion phase; mean concentration-time profiles overlaid very well, with no notable differences in PK. Tremelimumab PK was similar between the dose-finding (D30+T1) and expansion phases

Estimates of t½ λ z were reported for 13 patients in the dose-expansion phase, with geometric means of approximately 16 days for both cohorts. Tremelimumab variability appeared higher in the SARCOMA cohort, where geometric CV% for AUC, Cmax, or Cmin ranged from 42% to 86%, compared to the STO cohort where variability ranged from 12% to 19% except for Cmin (66%).

Target tremelimumab exposures (i.e., AUC0-28 ≥ 119.5 day* μ g/mL) were achieved for all 15 patients with calculable AUC0-28. Of 5 patients with no reportable AUC0-28 in the dose-expansion phase, 2 patients had no calculable AUC (&lt; 3 samples), and the remaining 3 patients had AUC0-14 ranging from 113 to 127 day* μ g/mL, with 2 of 3 values achieving the target exposure.

Subsequent sampling at trough and EOI was available for a limited number of patients and these results suggested tremelimumab exposure was also relatively stable following repeat administration (28-day cycle).

## Immunogenicity results

Assessment of immunogenicity was a secondary objective for the dose-finding and dose-expansion phases of the study D419EC00001. Immunogenicity results were summarized for the ADA analysis set.

Anti-drug antibody evaluable patients were patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and who had a baseline ADA result and at least one post baseline result.

Dose-finding phase: Durvalumab: In the ADA analysis set, in Arm A of the D20+T1 group, of 4 patients who were ADA evaluable, ADA against durvalumab was detected for 1 patient, but only at baseline (median [range] of maximum titer: 1.0 [1, 1]). No other ADA evaluable patient in the dosefinding phase was ADA positive to durvalumab at any time during the study, D419EC00001. Tremelimumab: There were no ADA evaluable patients for tremelimumab in the dose-finding phase in the study D419EC00001.

Dose-expansion phase: Durvalumab: In the ADA analysis set, in the STO cohort, of 5 patients who were ADA evaluable, ADA against durvalumab was detected for 1 patient, but only at baseline (median

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[range] of maximum titer: 1.0 [1, 1]). No other ADA evaluable patient in the dose-expansion phase was ADA positive to durvalumab at any time during the study, D419EC00001. Tremelimumab: No ADA evaluable patient was ADA positive to tremelimumab at any time during the study D419EC00001 in the dose-expansion phase.

Of patients who were evaluable for ADA, there were 2 baseline-positive patients, and no patients had treatment-emergent ADA response against durvalumab or tremelimumab; therefore, it is not feasible to analyse the potential impact of ADA on the PK of durvalumab.

## Discussion

The durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy doses and regimen selected for the study, D419EC00001, was based on the goal of selecting an optimal combination dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab in paediatrics that would yield similar systemic exposures to adults, have an acceptable safety profile, and demonstrate promising efficacy.

Durvalumab has been approved as monotherapy in Stage III NSCLC at 10 mg/kg Q2W. Dose regimens with less frequent Q4W dosing periods and fixed 1500 mg dosing approaches were proposed and subsequently approved. The fixed dose of durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W for an average body weight of 75 kg) is predicted to result in similar AUC and only a modest difference in median peak and trough levels at steady state compared to 10 mg/kg Q2W, based on PopPK simulations. Therefore, it is expected to demonstrate a similar efficacy and safety profile as the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen. This dose regimen has also been approved for durvalumab in ES-SCLC (1500 mg Q3W in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin for 4 cycles followed by 1500 mg Q4W monotherapy), advanced biliary tract cancer (1500 mg Q3W in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy for up to 8 cycles followed by 1500 mg Q4W monotherapy), and metastatic NSCLC (1500 mg in combination with tremelimumab 75 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 1500 mg Q4W as monotherapy and pemetrexed maintenance therapy Q4W).

In paediatric patients &lt; 35 kg, durvalumab systemic exposures, in combination with tremelimumab, were lower relative to adult systemic exposures at a durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks but were generally similar to adult systemic exposures at a dose of 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks. However, population PK modelling and simulation data showed that systemic exposures in paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg were generally similar to adult systemic exposures at a durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, but higher compared to adult systemic exposures (approximately 1.5-fold) at a durvalumab dose of 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Furthermore, the tremelimumab exposures, in combination with durvalumab, were generally similar to adult exposures at a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks for paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg but were lower relative to adult systemic exposures for paediatric patients &lt; 35 kg. No clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions between durvalumab and tremelimumab are anticipated when given as combination.

Pharmacokinetic data from the 20 mg/kg Q4W dose-finding cohort in Study D419EC00001 revealed the geometric mean systemic exposure, regardless of weight, failed to achieve the equivalent adult exposure for durvalumab. Based on modelling, a regimen consisting of 30 mg/kg Q4W of durvalumab was predicted to achieve the equivalent target exposure and was initiated for the second cohort as the dose-level 2 regimen. This durvalumab regimen was confirmed to have met the criteria for adult systemic exposure and therefore, was declared as the RP2D to be evaluated in the dose-expansion phase. Population PK modelling and simulation of paediatric patients in both the dose-finding and dose-expansion cohorts showed that durvalumab drug systemic exposure was similar in adults receiving a dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W, paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg receiving a dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paediatric patients &lt; 35 kg receiving a dose of 30 mg/kg Q4W. Similar to what was seen in the dosefinding phase, PopPK modelling also indicated that paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg have a higher systemic exposure than adults when given a dose of 30 mg/kg Q4W, approximately 1.5-fold higher.

Similarly, tremelimumab has been approved in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer at a dose of 75 mg Q3W for 4 cycles and a 5th dose is given on Week 16. This fixed dose is equivalent to the weight adjusted dose of 1 mg/kg.

Pharmacokinetic data from the 1 mg/kg Q4W cohort in the dose-finding phase of Study D419EC00001 revealed that the tremelimumab systemic exposure was similar to that of adults in both weight groups (&lt;35 kg and ≥ 35 kg). Therefore, this regimen was confirmed to have met the criteria for adult systemic exposure and therefore, was declared as the RP2D of tremelimumab to be evaluated in the dose-expansion phase. Population PK modelling and simulation of paediatric patients in both the dosefinding and dose-expansion cohorts showed that tremelimumab systemic exposure at a dose of 1 mg/kg was similar between adults and paediatric patients ≥ 35 kg, but lower than adults for paediatric patients &lt; 35 kg.

When the paediatric extrapolation strategy relies on matching adult exposures, the target exposure metric(s), range, and acceptance criteria should be prospectively specified and should be defined in the context of the disease, treatment regimen, route of administration, and formulation. The target exposure metric should be based on the exposure range associated with treatment response (efficacy and/or safety) and can be derived from established exposure-response relationships or observed data in the reference population. The selected target exposure metric(s) should be associated with the treatment response, and an adequate discussion and justification should be provided based on, but not limited to, the mechanism of action and the metrics previously established in the exposure-response relationships in the reference population. When exposure matching alone is insufficient to establish efficacy, biomarkers can be used as part of the extrapolation plan.

The sample size for a paediatric PK study should be sufficient to meet the objectives of the study and be based on quantitative methods (modelling and simulation and/or statistical approaches). Adequate representation of subgroups (e.g., body weight ranges, age ranges) should be considered and justified. The sample size justification and its feasibility in the targeted indication should include the following: the availability of patients in a specific body weight/age range, the adequacy of the sample size to demonstrate precision in key PK parameters in the 631 paediatric population such as clearance and volume of distribution, the adequacy of the sample size to match the pre-specified target exposure range (e.g., the interquartile range for the PK metric(s) in the reference population), and the methodology(ies) used to determine the sample size.

According to the Applicant, the overall immunogenicity results are consistent with the known immunogenicity profile of durvalumab and tremelimumab. Due to the limited number of patients and the low incidence of anti-drug antibodies, it was not feasible to analyse the impact of anti-drug antibodies on PK, efficacy and safety of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab. Ligand-binding immunoassays were employed to determine ADA levels at screening and confirmatory thresholds, and titer. Drug tolerance levels were given related to ADA levels, i.e. high concentrations of drug did not interfere with the assay, if ADA levels were high, too. The loss of assay sensitivity at mean Ctrough concentrations due to drug interference needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating samples that are ADA-positive at baseline.

The NAb bioanalysis reports for durvalumab and tremelimumab in study D419EC00001 outline samples that were confirmed as ADA positive. No further information was provided. In contrast, the summary of clinical pharmacology states, that no treatment-emergent ADAs against durvalumab were reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in patients who were evaluable for ADA in the study. The Applicant is asked to 1) justify the lack of Nab testing after confirmation of ADA-positives ( OC ).

As for the proposed update to the SmPC the Applicant´s summary of available information in section 4.2, according to the SmPC guideline, the paediatric population is not part of the Special populations and, therefore, it should be at the same level as Special populations (i.e., underlined and with no Italic font).

Regarding the standard statement currently included in the 'Paediatric population' sub-section, the proposed update is not considered completely acceptable. The appropriate standard statement(s) should be chosen according to the reason for the lack of indication in the corresponding subsets of the paediatric population and, also, in compliance with the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) or Class Waiver (as appropriate). The proposed standard statements should be chosen based on the authorised indications [please refer to the Frequently asked questions on SmPC paediatric information (EMA/551202/2010 Rev 1)].

The proposed paediatric standard statement 'The safety and efficacy of IMJUDO in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established. Currently available data for IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.' does not reflect the reasons for the lack of paediatric indication for the already authorised indications (in adults). In this respect, we consider that the most appropriate standard statement should be the following:

'The safety and efficacy of tremelimumab in the paediatric population have not been established with regard to HCC and NSCLC. No data are available.'

This is also applicable for Imfinzi in its currently approved indications.

Additionally, the paediatric standard statement in section 4.2 has been updated in this case, as a consequence of the inclusion of the final results from the paediatric study D419EC00001. Although these results do not support granting a paediatric indication, a description of this study should be included in section 5.1. Moreover, when results of study(ies) in the paediatric population in an indication not authorised in any population (i.e. neither in children nor in adults) are presented e.g. in section 5.1, the information relating to an indication not authorised in any population could be summarised in section 4.2. Consequently, the following standard statement can be considered:

'Outside its authorised indications, (Product X) has been studied in children aged x to y years with (disease y), however the results of study(ies) did not allow to conclude that the benefits of such use outweigh the risks. Currently available data are described in section &lt;4.8&gt;&lt;5.1&gt;&lt;5.2&gt;.'

Efficacy analyses were performed for patients in the dose-expansion phase only. Tumour assessment details are listed by patient for the dose-expansion phase in Appendix 16.2.6.1.1.1. No formal efficacy analysis was performed for patients in the dose-finding phase; however, based on Investigator assessment of overall RECIST responses, 2 patients in the dose-finding phase, one at each dose level, with osteosarcoma and papillary type renal carcinoma, respectively, had a PR for over one year. One of these patients, in the D30+T1 group, continued to receive treatment as part of the post-trial access program.

## 7.2. Results

In the dose-expansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set, and 4.8% (1/21 patients) in the FAS.

- No response was observed in the 11 patients initially enrolled in the SARCOMA cohort; therefore, the cohort was not expanded further as per the Simon 2-stage design.
- In the STO cohort, an ORR of 11.1% (1/9 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set, and 10.0% (1/10 patients) in the FAS, as one patient with chordoma had a confirmed response of PR. No other patient reported additional confirmed or unconfirmed responses during the study.

In the SARCOMA cohort, all 11/11 (100%) patients in the FAS had no response (Table 25).

The BOR was SD ≥ 7 weeks in 1/11 (9.1%) patient, PD in 9/11 (81.8%) patients, including RECIST progression in 6/11 (54.5%) patients and death in 3/11 (27.3%) patients, and NE due to incomplete post-baseline assessments in 1/11 (9.1%) patient. In the STO cohort, 1/10 (10.0%) patient in the FAS had a response, with a BOR of PR. For patients in the FAS with no objective response, the BOR was SD ≥ 7 weeks in 1/10 (10.0%) patient, PD in 7/10 (70.0%) patients, including RECIST progression in 6/10 (60.0%) patients and death in 1/10 (10.0%) patient, and NE due to incomplete post-baseline assessments in 1/10 (10.0%) patient.

In the evaluable for response analysis set, DCR was 9.1% (1/11 patients) in the SARCOMA cohort and 11.1% (1/9 patients) in the STO cohort at both Week 16 and Week 24 (Table 26). Similar results were observed for sensitivity analyses performed on the FAS, with a DCR of 9.1% (1/11 patients) in the SARCOMA cohort and 10.0% (1/10 patients) in the STO cohort at both Week 16 and Week 24.

Disease control rate was determined from the overall visit response using all data up until the first progression event.

## RECIST veision 1.1.

CI = confidence interval; N = number of patients in evaluable for response analysis set within each cohort; RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours; SARCOMA = osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma, or other sarcomas; STO = other solid tumors.

In the SARCOMA cohort, the median PFS was 1.7 months (90% CI: 1.58, 1.91) (Table 27 and Figure 19). All 11/11 (100%) patients had progression events during the study, including RECIST progression in 8/11 (72.7%) patients and death in the absence of progression in 3/11 (27.3%) patients. In total, 7/11 (63.6%) patients were on treatment at the time of progression and 4/11 (36.4%) patients had discontinued treatment prior to progression (Table 28).

In the STO cohort, the median PFS was 1.7 months (90% CI: 0.89, 2.76) (Table 27 and Figure 19). All 10/10 (100%) patients had progression events during the study, including RECIST progression in 9/10 (90.0%) patients and death in the absence of progression in 1/10 (10.0%) patient. In total, 7/10 (70.0%) patients were on treatment at the time of progression and 3/10 (30.0%) patients had discontinued treatment prior to progression (Table 28).

In the SARCOMA cohort, the median OS was 6.6 months (90% CI: 1.87, 15.77), with a survival rate of 25.6% at 12 months (Table 29 and Figure 20). In total, 8/11 (72.7%) patients died during the study, including survival follow-up beyond 90 days post the last dose of study treatment, and 3/11 (27.3%) patients were censored and terminated prior to death. Median (range) duration of follow-up in censored patients was 5.75 (1.9, 23.1) months.

In the STO cohort, the median OS was 6.9 months (90% CI: 1.61, NR), with a survival rate of 40.0% at 12 months and 30.0% at 24 months (Table 29 and Figure 20). In total, 7/10 (70.0%) patients died during the study, including survival follow-up beyond 90 days post the last dose of study treatment, and 3/10 (30.0%) patients were censored and terminated prior to death. Median (range) duration of follow-up in censored patients was 21.42 (13.4, 24.3) months.

The best change in target lesion size was the maximum reduction from baseline or the minimum increase from baseline in the absence of a reduction. In the dose expansion phase the median (range) best percentage change from baseline in target lesion size in the evaluable for response analysis set was 55.70% (-25.6% to 123.3%) in the SARCOMA cohort and 29.45% (-31.4% to 181.0%) in the STO cohort (Table 30 and Figure 21).

## 7.3. Discussion

No formal efficacy analysis was performed for patients in the dose-finding phase; however, based on Investigator assessment of overall RECIST responses, 2 patients in the dose-finding phase, one at each dose level, with osteosarcoma and papillary type renal carcinoma, respectively, had a PR for over one year.

Week

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the dose-expansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set, and 4.8% (1/21 patients) in the FAS. No response was observed in the 11 patients initially enrolled in the SARCOMA cohort in the first stage of the Simon 2-stage design, for which that cohort was stopped. In the STO cohort, an ORR of 11.1% (1/9 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set, and 10.0% (1/10 patients) in the FAS, as one patient with chordoma had a confirmed response of PR 1.8 months after the first dose of study treatment, with a DoR of 10.8 months.

In the evaluable for response analysis set, DCR was 9.1% (1/11 patients) in the SARCOMA cohort and 11.1% (1/9 patients) in the STO cohort at both Week 16 and Week 24. Similar results were observed for sensitivity analyses performed on the FAS. The median PFS in the SARCOMA and STO cohorts was 1.7 months (90% CI: 1.58, 1.91) and 1.7 months (90% CI: 0.89, 2.76), respectively, and all patients in the dose-expansion phase of the study had progression events (PD or death). In the SARCOMA cohort, the median OS was 6.6 months (90% CI: 1.87, 15.77), with a survival rate of 25.6% at 12 months. In the STO cohort, the median OS was 6.9 months (90% CI: 1.61, NR), with a survival rate of 40.0% at 12 months and 30.0% at 24 months.

Overall efficacy-wise a negative study, for which consequently no paediatric indication is sought.

Regarding the paragraph added in section 5.1, the description of the trial is outlined, but the preliminary results of efficacy in the expansion phase, already available, are omitted. In order to minimise the risk of off-label use of the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab in the paediatric population, the MAH is requested to add a statement that summarises such efficacy results, e.g. 'In the dose-expansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set' in section 5.1 of both products. As outlined in section 4.8, safety results should be summarised in section 5.1 as well. The preliminary efficacy and safety results on paediatric use of tremelimumab plus durvalumab preclude any potential encouragement to its off-label use. The reference to section 4.2 can be maintained: when there are data available but there is no authorised paediatric indication, data should be presented and a cross-reference should always be made to section 4.2, which summaries available information and recommendations in the paediatric population through the use of the standard statements.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

## 8.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Safety analyses were performed on the SAS unless otherwise specified. Assessment of safety was a primary objective for the dose-finding phase of this study.

## 8.2. Results

## Duration of exposure

Patients in the dose-finding phase were to receive durvalumab as monotherapy at Cycle 1 and from Cycle 6 onwards, and durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy from Cycle 2 through Cycle 5. Total treatment duration and actual treatment duration, i.e., total duration excluding duration of dose delays, for durvalumab administered as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab were comparable within each dose-level group, indicative of minimal dose delays (Table 31).

In the D20+T1 group, for the 10 patients who received durvalumab as monotherapy, the median (range) total treatment duration was 0.92 (0.9 to 25.1) months and actual treatment duration was 0.92 (0.9 to 24.6) months. For the 9 patients who also received durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy, the median (range) total treatment duration was 0.92 (0.9 to 3.7) months and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

actual treatment duration was 0.92 (0.9 to 3.7) months. In the D30+T1 group, for the 19 patients who received durvalumab as monotherapy, the median (range) total treatment duration was 0.92 (0.9 to 31.3) months and actual treatment duration was 0.92 (0.9 to 30.1) months. For the 12 patients who also received durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy, the median (range) total treatment duration was 1.38 (0.9 to 3.8) months and actual treatment duration was 1.38 (0.9 to 3.6) months.

Patients in the dose-expansion phase were to receive durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy from Cycle 1 through Cycle 4, and durvalumab as monotherapy from Cycle 5 onwards. Total treatment duration and actual treatment duration, i.e., total duration excluding duration of dose delays, for durvalumab administered in combination with tremelimumab were comparable within each cohort, indicative of minimal dose delays (Table 32).

- Total treatment duration = (min (date of last dose &gt; 0 mg + 27 days. date of death, date of DCO) - first dose + 1)/(365.25/12). First dose refers to first dose of tremelimumab and last dose refers to latest last dose of either duvalumab or tremelimumab.
- b Actual treatment duration = total treatment duration, excluding the duration of dose delays.
- Total treatment duration = (min (date of last dose &gt; 0 mg + 27 days, date of death, date of DCO) - first dose + 1)/(365.25/12). First and last dose refers to first or last dose of duvalumab monotherapy.

From Cycle 1 to Cycle 4: combination of duvalumab + tremelimumab was given; from Cycle 5 onwards: only dhuvalumab monotherapy was given.

Plammed number of dosing days were collected in the CRF.

CRF = Case Report Fom; DCO = data cutoff; Max = maximum; Min = minimum; N = number of patients in safety analysis set within each cohoit; n = number of patients included in analysis; NC = not calculable; SARCOMA = osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma, or other sarcomas; StD = standard deviation; STO = other solid tumors.

In the SARCOMA cohort, the median (range) durvalumab + tremelimumab total treatment duration was 1.84 (0.9 to 3.8) months and actual treatment duration was 1.84 (0.9 to 3.6) months. One patient received durvalumab as monotherapy for a total duration of 15.7 months, and an actual duration of 14.7 months. In the STO cohort, the median (range) durvalumab + tremelimumab total treatment duration was 1.72 (0.9 to 3.7) months and actual treatment duration was 1.72 (0.9 to 3.7) months. One patient received durvalumab as monotherapy for a total duration of 8.3 months, and an actual duration of 8.2 months.

## Adverse events

## Dose-finding phase

Adverse events of Grade 3 or Grade 4 were reported in the minority of patients in any dose-level group (Table 37).

In the D20+T1 group, 4/10 (40.0%) patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs, with AEs in the SOCs of blood and lymphatic system disorders and investigations reported in 2/10 (20.0%) patients each. All Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE PTs were reported in a maximum of 1/10 (10.0%) patient each.

In the D30+T1 group, 6/19 (31.6%) patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs, with AEs in the SOCs of investigations (3/19 [15.8%] patients) and nervous system disorders (2/19 [10.5%] patients) reported in ≥ 2 patients each. With the exception of neutrophil count decreased, reported in 2/19

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(10.5%) patients, all other Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE PTs were reported in a maximum of 1/19 (5.3%) patient each.

Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs of dehydration, transverse sinus thrombosis, nausea, amylase increased, lipase increased, and neutrophil count decreased were considered possibly related to durvalumab and tremelimumab by the Investigator and were all reported in 1/19 (5.3%) patient each in the D30+T1 group. No Grade 3 or Grade 4AE in the dose-finding phase was considered possibly related to durvalumab only or tremelimumab only by the Investigator.

Includes AEs with an onset date on or after the date of first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab (or date before first treatment, but worsening following first dose), up to and including 90 days following the last dose of duvalumab or tremelimumab, or initiation of first subsequent anti-cancer therapy following discontinuationof study treatment (whicheveroccurredfirst).

Number (%) ofpatients with AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4, sorted by intemational SOC order and alphabetical PT. Patients with multiple AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 were couuted once for each PT. Patients with events in more than one PT were coumted once in each of those PTs.

Percentageswere calculated from number of patients in the safety analysisset in each dose level/cohort.

Adverse events of Grade 3 or Grade 4 were reported in 45.5% to 50.0% of patients in any cohort (Table 38).

In the SARCOMA cohort, 5/11 (45.5%) patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs, with AEs in the SOC of blood and lymphatic system disorders reported in 2/11 (18.2%) patients. With the exception of anaemia, reported in 2/11 (18.2%) patients, all other Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE PTs were reported in a maximum of 1/11 (9.1%) patient each.

In the STO cohort, 5/10 (50.0%) patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs. All Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs by SOC and PT were reported in a maximum of 1/10 (10.0%) patient each. Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs of anaemia and ascites in the SARCOMA cohort (1/11 [9.1%] patient each) and decreased appetite in the STO cohort (1/10 [10.0%] patient) were considered possibly related to durvalumab and tremelimumab by the Investigator. The Grade 3 AE of platelet count decreased was considered possibly related to durvalumab only by the Investigator and was reported in 1/10 (10.0%) patient in the STO cohort. No Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE in the dose-expansion phase was considered possibly related to tremelimumab only by the Investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Includes AEs with an onset date on or after the date of first dose of duuvalumab or tremelimumab （or date before first treatment, but worsening following first dose), up to and including 90 days following the last dose of duvalumab or tremelimumab, or initiation of first subsequent anti-cancer therapy following discontinuation of shudy treatment (whichever occunred first).

Percentages were calculated from number of patients in the safety analysis set in each cohort.

CTCAE version 5.0. MedDRA version 25.1.

AE = adverse event; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N = number of patients in safety analysis set within each cohort; PT = Preferred Tenm; SARCOMA = osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma, or other sarcomas; SOC = System Organ Class; STO = other solid tumors.

Adverse events leading to dose modifications and Dose-limiting toxicity events

## Dose-finding phase

In the D20+T1 group, no patient had AEs leading to dose modifications.

In the D30+T1 group, AEs that led to dose modification were reported in 2/19 (10.5%) patients: 2/19 (10.5%) patients had COVID-19 that led to dose interruption and 1/19 (5.3%) patient had colitis that led to the permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

## Dose-expansion phase

In the SARCOMA cohort, no patient had AEs leading to dose modifications.

In the STO cohort, AEs that led to dose modification were reported in 3/10 (30.0%) patients: 1/10 (10.0%) patient each had pneumonia that led to dose interruption, and pulmonary thrombosis and platelet count decreased that led to the permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

In the dose-finding phase, 8 DLT-evaluable patients received DL 1 and 12 DLT-evaluable patients received DL 2. No DLTs were reported in any DLT-evaluable patient.

## 8.3. Discussion

Assessment of safety was a primary objective for the dose-finding phase of this study. The safety profile was as expected for this patient population and consistent with the known safety profile of durvalumab administered as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab in adults.

No new safety concerns were identified.

No treatment-emergent ADA against durvalumab or tremelimumab were detected, thus no assessment of the potential impact of ADA on safety could be made.

Regarding the proposed amendment to section 4.8, due to the fact that safety data collected in Study D419EC00001 belongs to a paediatric development for an indication neither approved in children nor in adults, it is considered more appropriate to present the safety data together with the results of the paediatric clinical study in section 5.1 instead of section 4.8, in order to include both efficacy and safety data in one place and avoid confusions or off-label use in the paediatric population.

## Summary of the WSA's response

In the D419EC00001 study, a 3-tiered testing approach, which consisted of validated assays for detection (screening assay), specificity (confirmation assay) and characterization (titre assay), was used for the assessment of ADA responses to durvalumab and tremelimumab in clinical studies. Confirmed ADA-positive samples were subsequently tested for in vitro neutralizing activity as assessed by nAb assays (This approach is described in 2.7.2 HIMALAYA which is referenced in the submission).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Per the 3-tier testing and reporting strategy, ADA positive samples were indeed tested for neutralizing activity in study D419EC00001.

For durvalumab ADA evaluable patients, 2 patients each had 1 sample with confirmed ADA positive results. These two positive samples were further tested with nAb assay (Validation Report RJRG2, Method Number ICDIM 324, included in Module 5.3.1.4) and the nAb results were negative for both samples, these results were included in the summary tables of ADA responses to durvalumab in the CSR. The detailed nAb sample results are described in the D419EC00001 nAb Sample Analysis Report for durvalumab included in Module 5.3.1.4. It is of note that the two ADA-positive subjects were ADApositive at baseline only, therefore, the ADA were characterized as non-treatment emergent (addressing reviewer comment at Assessment Report Page 64).

For tremelimumab ADA evaluable patients, the 3-tier testing and reporting strategy described above was followed. There was no ADA-positive subject, either at baseline or post-baseline, thus no nAb results were reported for tremelimumab (See Summary tables of tremelimumab ADA responses to tremelimumab in the CSR/CSR erratum.

*Please note the D419EC0001 clinical study report (CSR) provided in the submission included the statement that there were no tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients in the dose finding phase of the study. With this submission, a CSR erratum is provided correcting this data point to 6 tremelimumab ADA evaluable patients, none of whom were ADA-positive. Updated tremelimumab immunogenicity summary tables for the dose finding phase of the study are provided with the enclosed CSR errata.

## Assessment of the WSA's response

The Applicant was asked to justify the lack of Nab testing after confirmation of ADA-positive samples in study D419EC00001.

The Applicant clarified, that for durvalumab ADA evaluable patients, 2 patients each had 1 sample with confirmed ADA positive results, and that these two positive samples were further tested with nAb

assay - both with negative outcome. The detailed nAb sample results were described in the D419EC00001 nAb Sample Analysis Report for durvalumab included in Module 5.3.1.4.

For tremelimumab ADA evaluable patients, the Applicant referred to a CSR Erratum provided with the response and further clarified, that there was no ADA-positive subject, either at baseline or postbaseline, thus no nAb results were reported for tremelimumab.
