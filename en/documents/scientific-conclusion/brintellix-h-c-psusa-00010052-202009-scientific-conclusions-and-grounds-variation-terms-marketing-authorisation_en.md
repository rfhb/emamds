## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vortioxetine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on headache, hyperhidrosis and hyperprolactinaemia from clinical trials and/or spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action for hyperhidrosis, the PRAC considers a causal relationship  between  vortioxetine  and  headache,  hyperhidrosis  and  hyperprolactinaemia  is  at  least  a reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing vortioxetine should be amended accordingly.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reactions headache and hyperprolactinaemia with a frequency not known, and hyperhidrosis with a frequency common. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vortioxetine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vortioxetine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
