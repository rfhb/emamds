1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0032   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet      | 22/01/2009   | 02/03/2009 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | This type II variation concerns the addition of new contraindications in section 4.3 of the SPC and new information in sections 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.3 of the SPC in relation to a dose-related risk of QTc prolongation following exposure to Fareston. Further, section 4.5 of the SPC has been amended to highlight that Fareston should not be used concurrently with other substances that prolong the QT interval. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the annexes in line with the latest QRD template. Both in preclinical investigations and in humans, changes in cardiac electrophysiology have been observed following exposure to Fareston (toremifene), in the form of QT prolongation. For reasons of drug safety, toremifene is therefore contraindicated in patients with: - Congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation - Electrolyte disturbances, particularly in uncorrected hypokalaemia - Clinically relevant bradycardia - Clinically relevant heart failure with reduced left- ventricular ejection fraction - Previous history of symptomatic arrhythmias Toremifene should also not be used concurrently with other |

This might lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. Therefore co-administration of Fareston with any of the following medicinal products is contraindicated: - antiarrhythmics class IA (e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide) or - antiarrhythmics class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide), - neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, pimozide, sertindole, haloperidol, sultopride), - certain antimicrobials agents (moxifloxacin, erythromycin IV, pentamidine, antimalarials particularly halofantrine), - certain antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizol   |
