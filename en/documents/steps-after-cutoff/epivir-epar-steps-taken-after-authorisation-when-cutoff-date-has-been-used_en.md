## STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

For procedures finalised after 1 July 2005 please refer to module 8B .

- On  8  October  1996,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  holder  (MAH)  submitted  two  different applications for a Type  I variation in accordance with Commission  Regulation (EC) No. 542/95:
1. The scope of the first variation related to the introduction of a new manufacturing site as an alternative manufacturer of the active substance.
2. The scope of the second variation related to the change of the batch size of the active substance.

On 30 October 1996, the EMEA considered both variations to be acceptable. These variations did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision.

- On 19 November 1996, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95,  related  to  a  change  of  the  name  of  the manufacturer  of  the  finished  medicinal  product  and  responsible  for  the  batch  release  in  the European Economic Area for Epivir oral solution. On 2 December 1996, the EMEA approved the  variation,  which  required  amendments  to  be  incorporated  in  the  relevant  sections  of  the Commission Decision. The European Commission amended the Decision on 14 February 1997.
- On  28  November  1996,  the  MAH  submitted  two  applications  for  a  Type  II  variation  in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95:
1. The scope of the first variation concerned the introduction of a 10 ml device syringe and a polyethylene adapter in each oral solution pack to facilitate its use. The CPMP considered the variation acceptable and adopted the Opinion on the Type II variation on 22 January 1997. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 15 April 1997.
2. The scope of second variation concerned the update of the statement into the Summary of Product Characteristics related to the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity potential following  the  finalisation  of  the  studies.  The  CPMP  agreed  on  the  wording  to  be implemented into the Summary of Product Characteristics and adopted the Opinion on the  Type  II  variation  on  19  February  1997.  The  respective  Commission  Decision  was issued on 22 May 1997.
- On 23 January 1997, the MAH submitted two applications for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to a change in the manufacturer(s) of the active  substance.  On  28  February  1997,  the  EMEA  approved  both  variations,  which  did  not require any amendments to the Commission Decision.
- On 1 April 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to a change in the manufacturer of the active substance.  On  15  May  1997,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation,  which  did  not  require  any amendments to the Commission Decision.
- On 23 June 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to a minor modification to the synthesis of the active substance. On 11 July 1997, the EMEA approved the variation, which did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision.
- Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 and Part 4G of Annex to Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  MAH  provided  throughout  1997  additional  efficacy  and safety data as stated in the Annex IIC to the Commission Decision, which formed the basis of the annual re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Epivir (e.g. final results from the clinical endpoint study). On 14 July 1997 the MAH provided an updated expert report summarising the different specific obligations already submitted within the period August 1996-June 1997. The procedure started  on  25  July  1997.  During  its  September  plenary  CPMP  meeting,  the  CPMP agreed  with  the  Rapporteur's  assessment  report  that  the  risk/benefit  profile  of  lamivudine remained  favourable  and  that  there  was  no  remaining  grounds  to  keep  the  MA  under

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exceptional circumstances since all the specific obligations were fulfilled. The CPMP adopted on 24 September 1997, an Opinion on the annual re-assessment of the specific obligations and the  benefit/risk  ratio,  stating  that  amendments  of  Annexes  I,  II  and  III  to  the  Community Marketing Authorisation were necessary. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 7 January  1998.  Subsequent  applications  for  a  Type  II  variation  (update  of  the  Summary  of Product Characteristics and change in the formulation of the oral solution) were submitted by the  MAH  and  Opinions  were  adopted  by  the  CPMP  on  24  September  1997.  The  respective Commission Decisions were issued on 16 December 1997.

- On 12 January 1998, the MAH submitted two applications for a Type II variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95:

2. The  scope  of  second  variation  concerned  the  update  of  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics to reflect the current clinical practice.

The CPMP considered the changes related to both variation acceptable and issued on 25 March 1998 the Opinion on the two Type II variations. The respective Commission Decisions were issued on 7 July 1998.

- On 3 March 1998, the MAH submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95, related to an extension of the shelf-life of Epivir oral solution to 24 months.
