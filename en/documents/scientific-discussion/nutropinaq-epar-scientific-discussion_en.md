## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  NutropinAq.  For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## 1. Introduction

Growth hormone (GH) is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 191 amino acids, and is secreted by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Secretion is under hypothalamic control via growth hormonereleasing  hormone  (GHRH)  (stimulating  secretion  of  GH)  and  somatostatin  (inhibiting  secretion  of GH). Circulating levels of GH varies greatly through the day with very low levels through most of the day and short spikes of high concentration occurring primarily during sleep or after exercise or meals.

GH secretion varies greatly through life, with secretion being low during infancy, increasing during childhood  and  peaking  during  puberty.  In  adults  above  30,  secretion  gradually  decreases.  GH  is necessary for normal longitudinal growth. Thus, GH deficiency in childhood leads to short stature.

The effect  of  GH  is  primarily  mediated  by  the  GH  induced  secretion  of  other  hormones  known  as somatomedins or insulin-like growth factors (IGF) (of which IGF-1 is considered the most important) which  then  directly  stimulates  growth  of  both  bone  and  several  organs.  In  contrast  to  GH  levels, circulating  levels  of  IGF-1  remains  relative  stable  throughout  the  day.  In  addition  to  its  effect  on growth, GH has pronounced effect on lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism. GH causes lipolysis and stimulates amino acid incorporation into muscle protein. The action of carbohydrate metabolism is complex. GH has an agonistic effect on insulin secretion but and antagonistic effect on the peripheral action of insulin.

As mentioned above GH deficiency (either ideopathic or secondary to tumours, irradiation, trauma or infection  in  the  pituitary  gland/hypothalamic  area)  in  children  leads  to  impairment  of  growth  and eventually to short stature. In adults, GH deficiency contributes to decrease in muscle strength as well as  change  in  body  composition,  especially  increased  fat  mass  and  decreased  lean  body  mass.  GH deficiency in adults has also been reported to be associated with reduced psychological well-being and reduced quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of exogenous human growth  hormone  can  partially restore  normal growth  in growth hormone  deficient children. Furthermore, administration of exogenous human growth hormone may lead to reduction in fat mass, increase in muscle mass and may counteract lack of energy.

Children with renal insufficiency or Turner's syndrome generally have impaired growth. Although this growth  impairment  is  not  due  to  an  absolute  GH  deficiency,  previous  studies  have  shown  that treatment with exogenous GH can partially restore normal growth in these patients.

NutropinAq  is  a  product  containing  recombinant  human  growth  hormone  (rhGH).  produced  by recombinant DNA technology in a genetically modified E.coli. The recombinant hormone is secreted as a fusion protein containing a 23 amino acid signal peptide in front of the somatropin. This signal peptide causes the protein to be secreted into the periplasm of the E.coli where the signal peptide is cleaved from the growth hormone (somatropin). The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of the natural human growth hormone.

NutropinAq is a sterile ready-to-use aqueous solution containing 5.0 mg somatropin per ml. Each vial contains 2 ml of solution for subcutaneous administration.

NutropinAq is indicated for:

- -Long-term treatment of children with growth failure due to inadequate endogenous growth hormone secretion,
- -Long-term treatment of growth failure associated with Turner syndrome,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Treatment of prepubertal children with growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency up to the time of renal transplantation,
- -Replacement  of  endogenous  growth  hormone  in  adults  with  growth  hormone  deficiency  of either  childhood  or  adult-onset  etiology.  Growth  hormone  deficiency  should  be  confirmed appropriately prior to treatment

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

The finished product contains the following excipients: somatropin, sodium chloride, liquefied phenol, polysorbate, sodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid, water for injection.

NutropinAq is presented in glass vials closed with a  rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. Each vial contains an overage of 0.2 ml of product to ensure delivery of 2.0 ml of solution.

## Active substance

## Development Genetics

The host  cell  is  an E.coli derivative.  The  host  cell  mutations  have  been  introduced  to  improve  the production process. The recombinant hormone is secreted as a fusion protein containing a 23 amino acid signal peptide in front of the somatropin. This signal peptide causes the protein to be secreted into the periplasm of the E.coli where the signal peptide is cleaved from the growth hormone (somatropin). The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of the natural human growth hormone.

Host strain and production strain have been stability tested to verify absence of mutations.

Somatropin bulk solution appears as monograph No. 950 in the European Pharmacopoeia, an updated version  of  which  came  into  force  on  1 st January  2000.  The  finished  product  specification  complies with the requirements of the Ph.Eur.

## Cell bank system

Up to 1998, stock culture vials were used to manufacture somatropin. In 1998 a switch was made and one batch of such stock culture was taken and designated master cell bank (MCB). A new working cell bank (WCB) was created from liquid nitrogen stored MCB. Either the MCB or WCB may be used for production.

The MCB has been fully characterised using adequate tests. Testing of the WCB is somewhat less than that  for  the  MCB.    Regular  testing  of  both  banks  consists  of  viability  monitoring.  The  cell  bank  is considered to have shown no change in viability upon storage at -60 ° C or below. Stability testing of the WCB will occur regularly. MCB testing occurs when a new WCB is prepared. Stability protocols for both the MCB and the WCB have been provided.

## Fermentation and harvesting

An  updated  process  description  has  been  provided.  Agitation  rate,  temperature,  vessel  pressure, aeration  rate  and  pH  are  strictly  controlled  throughout  the  process.  In-process  samples  are  taken  to ensure culture purity and a satisfactory cell density.

## Purification

The  production  of  the  active  substance  has  been  adequately  described.  It  involves  the  following process steps: propagation, fermentation, harvesting and purification. Somatropin is secreted into the periplasm from which release is achieved through a series of steps involving freezing, thawing and suspension.  The  somatropin is isolated and purified by standard chromatographic separation techniques  through  a  series  of  steps.  Typical  elution  profiles  for  each  of  the  purification  steps  are provided.

## Impurities

Potential process related impurities which may occur are E-coli proteins, endotoxins, host cell DNA, bacteriophage and non-host cell contamination (bioburden). Bacteriophage has not been found to date.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on DNA clearance studies, the amount of DNA in the finished product is calculated and found to be substantially below the WHO acceptance limit.

## Characterisation

Somatropin is a single chain protein of 191 amino acids including 4 cysteine residues present as two intrachain disulphides.  The observed mass is 22,125 daltons.

Primary structure has been elucidated using sequence analyses techniques. Results confirm agreement with  the  predicted  cDNA  sequence  and  identicality  with  natural  human  pituitary  growth  hormone. Secondary  and  tertiary  structure  have  been  confirmed.    Physico-chemical  characteristics  have  been investigated.

The  results  presented  show  no  detectable  structural  differences  between  the  batches  studied.  The results also confirm that there are no differences in impurity pattern between the batches tested.

## Post-translational modifications

Potential  impurities  arising  at  the  transcription  or  translation  phases  are  derivatives  with  modified secondary and/or tertiary structure, those with modified amino acid sequence, Nor-leucine variant and high molecular weight species. Of this group of impurities, only the Nor-leucine and higher molecular weight species have been found to date.

## Analytical development and process validation

The stability of the used reference standard has been monitored and recently confirmed.

The requirements of the Note for Guidance on Validation of Analytical Procedures (CPMP/ICH/281/95)  are  met.    As  raw  material  somatropin  is  basically  a  bulk  solution  of  finished product, the methods used for testing of drug substance are equally valid for finished product.

Validation  data  of  all  relevant  methods  used  during  development  and  characterisation  of  the  MCB have been presented.

Data  have  been  provided  for  validation  of  the  harvesting/isolation,  initial  and  final  purification processes,  through  formulation  and  dilution  steps  to  final  vial  lots.    Critical  operational  parameters have  been  identified  and  reviewed  at  all  relevant  steps.  Results  show  that  parameters  were  within established  ranges  and  in-process  tests  conform  to  the  test  parameters.  NutropinAq  batches  for  the European market will meet the required Ph.Eur. specification.

Validation  of  the  fermentation  process  has  been  demonstrated.  Data  are  provided  showing  that  the operating  parameters  in  the  fermentation  process  are  controlled  and  reproducible  resulting  in consistency in growth profile and somatropin production.

Clearance of E.coli protein  (ECP)  contaminants  has  been  examined  at  each  step  in  the  purification process. On the basis of the data presented, there is good justification for annual testing.

## Batch analysis

Lists  have  been  provided  of  batches  used  in  preclinical  and  clinical  trial.  Results  are  provided  for diffent lots of filtered formulated bulk solution manufactured at full scale. (These lots have been used in process validation studies). The batches comply with the proposed specifications.

## Other ingredients

Sodium chloride is used to improve the solubility of somatropin and also to prevent development of globules  and  enable  adjustment  tonicity  of  the  product.  Polysorbate  20  is  present  to  reduce  the aggregation tendency of somatropin in solution.  Citrate buffer was selected to maintain a pH of 6, thereby reducing the formation of deamidated protein whilst maintaining an adequate solubility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Citrate buffer was chosen based on longer term visual clarity results. Peroxide levels in polysorbate 20 is controlled and the peroxide determination method presented. Phenol was chosen as a preservative as it  proved  to  be  compatible  with  both  somatropin  and  the  other  excipients.  The  applicant  provides antimicrobial preservative efficacy data for product preserved with phenol. All excipients comply with Ph.Eur. and USP specifications apart from liquefied phenol which is USP standard.  The specification for liquefied phenol has been provided together with test methodologies.

## Product development and finished product

## · Method of preparation

As  somatropin  is  not  isolated  during  production,  the  active  drug  substance  consists  of  a  bulk formulated solution. Bulk formulated somatropin solution is weighed, filtered and stored for up to 21 days  at  2-8°C  prior  to  filling.    When  the  total  amount  of  bulk  solution  required  for  filling  is determined, filtered bulks are pooled as necessary, and the solution sterilised by filtration. Different filter sizes are used to match flexibility in size of filling vessels and bulk material to be processed.

Solution is then filled aseptically into sterile vials, the vials sealed and stored inverted at 2-8°C.  After labelling and packaging, vials are again stored at 2-8°C.

## In-process controls

Suitable in-process controls are described.  Environmental monitoring of operational areas is performed  and  media  fills  are  performed  routinely.  Filling  machines  are  cleaned  in  place/steam sterilised prior to use. Sterile filter integrity is confirmed.

## Validation of analytical methods

The  validation  package  described  includes  details  of  assessment  of  sterile  filtration,  product/filter compatibility,  holding  times  for  the  bulk  solution,  and  sterilisation/depyrogenation  of  containers, closures,  equipment  and  components.  In  addition,  environmental  monitoring  and  media  fill  studies have been described.

Product/filter compatibility has been examined. No degradation or aggregation was observed, phenol content was in order and particulates were within specification limits.

The validation studies confirming the above for somatropin stored in the pressure vessel have been performed. Studies have investigated the protection from microbial contamination. Bioburden samples were all within the acceptance limit.  All media fills gave acceptable results.

Validation of sterilisation/depyrogenation of containers, closures, equipment and components has been performed  using  actual  and  simulated  production  conditions  including  worst  case  challenges. Acceptance criteria have been defined and satisfactory results of such studies have been provided.

## · Control tests on the finished product

The company complies with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. monograph.

Somatropin for injection appears as monograph No. 952 in the European Pharmacopoeia, an updated version of which came into force on 1 st January 2000.  As Nutropin is a liquid preparation, the test for water cannot be applied to this product.  In all other respects however, the monograph is applicable.

## Control methods and validation of analytical methods

Full  methodologies  have  been  provided  for  all  test  methods.  A  complete  justification  of  the  tests employed, together with limits, has been provided. Aggregation, proteolysis, deamidation, oxidation, post-translational  modification  and  lot-to-lot  consistency  are  suitably  analysed  by  the  chosen  test methods.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Full  validation  reports  have  been  provided  for  all  methodologies.  Use  of  the  various  methods  for stability testing has also been addressed.  The requirements of the Note for Guidance on Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (CPMP/ICH/281/95) are fully met.

The  applicant  has  standardised  the  potency  assay  to  WHO  pituitary-derived  (WHO  80/505)  and recombinant (WHO 88/624), the current international standards.

Ph.Eur. methods will be used for degree of coloration of liquids, clarity and degree of opalescence of liquids, particulate contamination: sub-visible particles and volume in container (extractable volume).

## Batch analysis:

The test results have been generated by Schwarz Pharma, all results were within specification.

## · Viral safety

The risk  of  transmission  of  viruses  is  negligible  as  no  primary  animal  or  human  sourced  materials have been used in the preparation of either drug substance or drug product.

## · Animal-derived materials

A number of animal derived raw materials are used in the manufacture of NutropinAq. The origin of the raw material is well documented.  Polysorbate 20 is of vegetable origin thereby posing no risk of transmission of TSE.

Information  has  been  provided  in  the  dossier  demonstrating  that  the  medicinal  product  is  made  in compliance  with  the  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via medicinal products. The requirements of CPMP/BWP/1230/98 are considered to be fully met.

## Stability of the Product

## · Formulated bulk

Stability data have been provided for batches of different sizes.  The data justify the proposed expiry date of 21 days stored at 2-8°C for formulated bulk drug substance.

## · Finished product

Stability  reports  have  been  provided  for  different  batches  of  product.  The  proposed  shelf-life  of  18 months at 2-8 ° C is considered to be acceptable. Storage results for up to 1 month at 25°C justify an inuse shelf-life of 28 days.

Stability studies have been performed using test conditions likely to be experienced under patient use. The product was exposed to normal or intense sunlight during a daily 2 hour excursion from 2-8°C to 25°C  for  18  days.  The  results  support  the  contention  that  daily  short  term  exposure  to  ambient temperatures and light does not significantly affect product quality. Repeated or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight is not recommended.

Physical  stability  of  the  product  has  been  investigated.  Results  confirm  the  robust  nature  of  the product as no changes in visual clarity or monomer content were observed.  Somatropin is normally susceptible to surface-induced denaturation and aggregation effects.  In conclusion, the results of the study demonstrate that the product should be physically stable over intended product distribution and use.

A clear study protocol for the finished product showing the test conducted and the times when testing is performed has been provided for on-going studies and for the additional batches being added to the programme annually.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  applicant  relies  heavily  on  experience  gained  with  Protropin  and  Nutropin,  which  have  been marketed in the USA since 1985 and 1994 respectively.  Protropin is a lyophilised product containing somatrem and Nutropin, a lyophilised product containing somatropin.  Many of the studies to assess the  overall  quality  of  NutropinAq  have  therefore  been  carried  out  by  direct  comparison  with  these products.

Satisfactory  evidence  is  provided  that  product  manufacture  is  well  controlled,  that  consistency  of production is achieved and that a stable product results. The requirements of the relevant directives and guidelines are met.  The pharmaceutical parts of the SPC, package insert and product label are supported by the information provided in the dossier. A few follow-up measures have been identified, and the company commits to fulfil the requirements after the granting of the Marketing Authorisation.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic studies was carried out in order to study the following characteristics:

- Direct  and  indirect  effects  of  rhGH  on  growth  parameters  (body  weight  gain,  growth,  bone lengthening)

## Studies in hypophysectomised animals

Several studies were performed in hypophysectomised rats. In the vast majority of studies an injection period of 7 days [ one day before the onset of hGH-neutralising antibodies ] has been applied. The lack of endogenous GH secretion was compensated by the administration of somatrem and somatropin at graduated  dose  levels  alone  or  combined  with  IGF-1  or  a  truncated  form  of  the  latter  (des-IGF-1). Whereas somatrem and somatropin were given as sc. injections, the IGF-forms were infused by means of implanted osmotic pumps.

Various  growth  (body  weight  gain,  tibia  and  femur  length,  epiphyseal  width  of  tibia,  absolute  and relative  weights  of  spleen,  thymus,  liver,  heart  and  kidney)  and  blood  chemistry  parameters  (serum IGF-1,  blood  glucose,  total  protein,  urea  nitrogen,  Ca 2+ ,  Mg 2+ , 3PO4)  were  measured  in  order  to characterise the effects and efficacy of the administered compounds and combinations thereof.

Somatropin administration led consistently to an almost dose dependent increase of body weight gain, femur and tibia length, spleen and thymus weight and broadening of epiphyseal width. There were no significant differences in the effects of somatrem (rhGH-met) and somatropin (rhGH). The delivery of rhGH by osmotic minipumps produced greater effects than the sc. bolus injection. The combination of rhGH and rhIGF-1 or des-rhIGF-1 yielded greater additive effects than either hormone alone, which was not clearly reflected by serum IGF-1 levels.

The same result was obtained when rhGH (2 mg/kg/day; sc. injection) and rhIGF-1 (2 mg/kg/day sc. infusion by osmotic minipumps) were given alone or in combination for 28 days. Weight gain induced by IGF-1 progressively declined after 4 days, compared with a more maintained effect of rhGH (20). Decrease of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen as well as an increase of phosphate is primarily due to IGF-1  and  point  to  an  anabolic  status  and/or  changes  in  kidney  function.  However,  no  clear  cut pathological values were obtained.

## Studies in genetically fixed hypopituitarism

Two studies were performed in genetically fixed hypopituitaric dwarf rats (dw/dw) treated for seven days.

The effect  of  the  hormones  or  hormone  combinations  in  the  first  study  was  measured  by  the  same parameters as in hypophysectomised rats (see above). In the second study only body weight gain, liver heart, spleen, thymus, kidney weights and serum IGF-1 levels were measured.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As in hypophysectomised animals, a dose dependent increase in body weight gain, tibial length and epiphyseal  width  was  observed  in  the  first  study,  the  combination  being  more  effective  than  either hormone  alone.  Organ  weight  changes  (increase  of  liver,  kidney,  spleen  and  thymus  weight)  are mainly due to rhIGF-1.

For IGF-1 a decrease of serum concentration after rhGH and an increase after the combination were observed.  While the  increase  appears  to  be  a  logical  consequence  of  compound  administration,  the decrease can not be reasonably explained. It can only be speculated that the selected sampling point (24 hours after last administration) does not reflect the true situation representatively.

In the second study the body weight changes were similar in nature to those in the first. rhGH and the combination produced dose dependent increase of spleen weight, the combination having the greater effect. Serum IGF-1 levels increased significantly only after the high rhGH dose.

- Effects on sexual maturation and growth in neonatal and immature (starting at 1 year of age) monkeys

## Study in aged rats

Males, approximately 18 months old rats, were treated with 2200 µg/kg/day rhGH by sc. injection or 2400 µg/kg/day rhIGF-1 by sc. infusion (osmotic minipumps) or combinations thereof for 14 days. Similar studies with rhIGF-1, des-rhIGF-1 and recombinant bovine GH (rbGH) were performed for comparative purposes (Rep. 90-151-0320 A,B,C).

In addition to body weight gain and serum chemistry, histology of spleen and thymus, the proliferation and ripening of explanted and cultivated thymocytes and lymphocytes (spleen) were studied in vitro.

As in hypophysectomised and dwarf rats, the hormones produced an increase of body weight gain, rbGH that is less immunogenic in the rat (25) being more potent than rhGH. Larger responses were obtained to combinations than to either hormone alone.

Changes in serum chemistry parameters (decrease of blood urea nitrogen, total protein and increase of phosphate) as well as organ weights (kidney, spleen, and thymus) were generally due to both forms of IGF-1.  The  same  holds  true  for  the  increased  cellularity  of  thymus  with  restoration  of  thymus architecture and enhancement of in vitro response to mitogens.

## Effects on sexual maturation (and growth)

In order to determine whether developmental increase in basal serum LH would occur at an earlier age and  menarche  and  first  ovulation  would  be  advanced,  groups  of  4-6  female  rhesus  monkeys,  20 months old (approximately 10 months before the expected menarche) were treated with rhGH sc. three times per week for 50 months. To provide a stepwise increase in serum GH levels as occurs during normal development (52; 51) rhGH was administered at a dose of 125 µg/kg from age 20 through 23 months and of 250 µg/kg thereafter.

Body weight, crown rump length, skeletal maturation (scoring hand and wrist radiographs), serum E2, GH,  GH-antibody  and  LH  levels  were  measured  at  regular  intervals,  serum  insulin  and  serum biochemistry (e.g. electrolytes, proteins, glucose, creatinine, cholesterol) at the completion of rhGH treatment (70 months of age). Reproductive performance for each animal per year was assessed.

The mean age at the time of initial rise in serum LH was slightly advanced (26.6 ± 0.4 vs.  31.3 ± 0.3 months) by GH treatment. After this elevation of basal LH secretion, rhGH treatment resulted in a significant increase in serum E2 levels within 12 hours of injection, which remained elevated through 24 hours. The first ovulation occurred earlier in three of five animals while the other two ovulated at an  age  similar  to  that  of  controls  (42 ± 0.4  months).  These  slight  changes  do  not  point  to  a  risk  of significant acceleration of sexual maturation, especially LH release.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long term treatment with rhGH accelerated bone maturation and velocity of increase in crown-rump as well as tibia length and body weight. However, finally only adult crown-rump length was enhanced by about 3% whereas there was only a slight increase in tibia length and body weight. Thus, adult skeletal maturity was reached at an earlier chronological age in treated (68 ± 0.4 months) than in control females (73.4 ± 2.4 months). With regard to serum chemistry, treated animals had significantly lower glucose, creatinine and cholesterol and higher LDH concentrations.

The treatment of 12-14 months old male prepuberal rhesus monkeys (Rep. 91-008-0301-561) with 50 or  350  µg/kg/day  rhGH  sc.  for  6  months  resulted  in  an  increase  of  body  weight  gain  (dose dependently),  crown-rump  length  (high  dose),  resting  insulin  (high  dose)  and  IGF-1  levels  (both doses).

## · Effects on kidney growth and function

In rodents rhGH and rhIGF-1 are able to increase renal mass. Whereas rhGH produces an effect in proportion to body weight, rhIGF-1 increases renal mass unproportionally to body mass. Both peptides increase glomerular and tubular cell proliferation and renal DNA/protein ratio. Even after 60 days of treatment no glomerulosclerosis was to be observed, although extremely high doses were administered. Thus, these results do not point to a particular risk to be expected in children treated with therapeutic dosage.

With regard to renal function, it  was  shown  in  studies  with  isolated  perfused  kidneys  of  intact  and hypophysectomised rats that rhGH accelerated acid secretion and coupled volume absorption in the range of GH concentrations achieved during episodic GH surges. Furthermore, rhGH administration in vivo to hypophysectomised rats enhanced net acid secretion and urinary acidification, consistent with accelerated tubular H+ secretion as a physiological expression of GH action.

## · Effects on liver enzyme induction.

The  action  and  interaction  of  somatrem  (rhGH-met),  prednisone  and  thyroxine  on  liver  enzyme induction were studied in hamsters and rats (University of Utah 1986).

Significant  changes  were  confined  to  phase  I  parameters  (P450-concentration,  p-nitroanisole  and ethylmorphine demethylation) which were slightly depressed by somatrem. The somatrem response was not significantly altered by co-administration of thyroxine, prednisolone or both. These changes point to the possibility of mild depression of drug metabolising enzymes under rhGH therapy.

## · Summary of salient findings

The mostly dose dependent increase of body weight gain, epiphyseal width, long bone length, spleen and thymus weight in rats confirms the already well known effects of rhGH in rats, with rhGH and rhIGF-1 demonstrating additive effects. No differences in the effects and efficacy of somatrem and somatropin were observed.

Delivery by implanted osmotic pumps resulted in greater effects than  bolus  injection at equal  dose levels. This points to an improvement of efficacy by continuous delivery of small amounts per time unit of rhGH in contrast to bolus administration.

Serum chemistry reflects the anabolic status under rhGH treatment.

Although long term treated animals reached adult skeletal maturity at an earlier chronological age, no disturbance of endocrine regulation significantly affecting growth, fertility, well-being or survival rate could be detected.

The  studies  on  function  and  morphology  of  kidneys  confirm  the  physiological  expression  of  GH action.

The possibility of mild depression of P450-dependent drug metabolising enzymes in the liver points to a possible slowing of metabolic drug clearance which has to be considered in case of co-administration of other drugs in therapy. This aspect is already part of therapeutic knowledge.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  documentation  of  dose  dependent  increase  of  body  weight  gain,  epiphyseal  width,  long  bone length,  spleen  and  thymus  weight  relies  mostly  on  published  literature,  which  is  to  be  considered acceptable.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Intact animals

Studies in healthy, normal, adult mice, rats and monkeys indicated that serum clearance was rapid by all species following i.v. administration. Average serum clearance was species-specific and decreased as species size increased. Following i.v. bolus administration, serum concentration versus time curves were  bi-exponential.  The  terminal  half-lives  increased  with  species  size  corresponding  to  clearance rates.

After sc. administration of somatropin the following results were obtained in healthy, normal, adult rats and monkeys. The data suggest, in addition to species differences in the metabolic clearance rate, further  differences  in  an  absorption  rate-limited  kinetics,  whereby  the  slow  absorption  from  the injection site in monkeys is similar to that in humans.

## · Conditioned animals

In bilaterally nephrectomized rats a significantly (3-fold) reduced clearance of somatropin was found following  i.v.  injection  when  compared  to  the  results  of  sham-operated  controls.  Both  initial  and terminal half-lives were longer. No effect was seen on the initial or steady-state distribution volume. These  results  agree  with  literature  reports  and  suggest  that  the  kidney  plays  a  major  role  in  the systemic clearance of GH.

Hypophysectomy  in  rats,  the  most  commonly  used  model  for  GH  efficacy  studies,  led  to  reduced clearance (48%) and volumes of distribution (34-37%) following i.v. bolus injection while the halflives remained unaffected. In hypophysectomised rats the maximum serum concentrations following sc. administration of somatropin were approximately 2-fold higher and occurred later (80 vs. 35 min.) than in control animals. These findings are consistent with the reduced clearance (48%) and volumes of distribution (34-37%) observed following i.v. injection in these conditioned animals.

## Tissue distribution and metabolism

Tissue distribution  studies  were  conducted  in  sham  operated  and  hypophysectomised  rats  with 125 Isomatrem and 3 H-  or 125 I-somatropin.  They  demonstrated  that  the  liver  and  kidney  are  the  primary sites  of  localisation  following  sc.  and  i.v.  administration  and  that  both  compounds  have  identical distribution  profiles.  This  is  in  agreement  with  common  knowledge  on  the  distribution  and  major organs of metabolism of GH in the literature.

The passage across the placenta was studied in rats on the 15 th day of pregnancy. Two hours after the administration of 2.5 µCi 125 I-hGH the rats were sacrificed, the placentas removed and weighed. The consistent finding of protein-bound radioactivity in placentas and fetuses indicates that rhGH will to some extent pass the placenta in pregnant rats.

Studies with 3 H-somatropin  provided evidence that rhGH was broken down to 3 H-monoamino acids that were reincorporated into newly synthesised plasma proteins.

## · Age dependency

The pharmacokinetic profile of somatropin following i.v. administration was compared in adult and juvenile rhesus monkeys to determine the effects of age on rhGH disposition. Statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters did not reveal significant differences between the two age groups.

## · Comparison of somatrem and somatropin and the influence of different formulations

The pharmacokinetic profile of somatrem (rhGH-met) and somatropin (rhGH) following i.v. and sc. administration was compared in male cynomolgus monkeys in a four-period crossover study (Rep. 86030-0301). Mean serum clearance, initial and terminal half-life, Cmax, Tmax and absolute bioavailability were determined.

Statistical  comparison  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  both  routes  of  administration  indicated bioequivalence of both products.

In order to examine the possible influence of different somatropin formulations on pharmacokinetics, a  series  of  comparative  studies  with  various  research  formulations,  Nutropin  and  NutropinAq  were performed  in  rats  and  monkeys  by  sc.  administration.The  somatropin  body  burden  (AUC  sc.) produced by the research  formulations  in  rats  was  substantially  (35-49%)  lower  than  that  observed after Nutropin administration (Rep. 90-283-0301).

An additional pharmacokinetic study in monkeys comparing Nutropin (lyophilised and reconstituted material)  and  NutropinAq  (liquid  material)  was  performed  by  sc.  administration  in  a  randomised crossover design. The statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, Tmax) did not reveal significant differences between the two formulations. Thus, the change from a lyophilised, reconstituted to a liquid formulation did not modify the disposition of somatropin in rhesus monkeys.

## · Summary of salient findings

The measured pharmacokinetic parameters (mainly Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, V, AU, Cl) were species specific in mice and rats. Thus, they can only be used for the interpretation of results of pharmacodynamic and toxicity studies in the respective species and does not allow interspecies extrapolations. Even in this restricted  consideration  particularly  those  results  have  to  be  interpreted  with  great  care  which  have been obtained with 125 I-labelled rhGH.

As 125 I-labelled rhGH undergoes in vivo deiodination as well as hydrolytic cleavage of the peptide, neither  the  total  nor  the  TCA-precipitable  radioactivity  represents  the  correct  amount  of  parent compound (30).

Only in monkeys do some parameters appear to be similar to those in humans, although, in contrast to humans, no specific GH binding protein could be identified.

With regard to the administration of NutropinAq to humans it can be concluded from the pre-clinical pharmacokinetic data that no significant differences should be expected:

- -in somatropin kinetics following Protropin, Nutropin or NutropinAq,
- -in different age groups of patients

Mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys were mostly used for the testing of NutropinAq. With the exception of guinea pigs, in which specific GH-binding proteins (GHBP's) in serum were undetectable, all other species and humans were found to have specific serum GHBP's, however of different specificity and affinity.

The  actions  of  GH  in  tissues  and  organ  systems  are  mediated  by  specifically  binding  proteins,  the receptors, which are heterogeneous in structure and intracellular distribution in the various species.Specifically binding proteins in plasma and receptors are both part of an integrated biological system.  Therefore,  from  the  observed  species  differences  it  has  to  be  concluded  that  quantitative extrapolation from animal experiments to humans is not possible with regard to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicodynamics of NutropinAq. Only qualitative extrapolations with regard to the effect-profiles are justified.

It  is  supported  that  interspecies  extrapolation  of  effects  generally  constitutes  a  complex  issue. Nevertheless, valid in-vitro or animal models have been established and are indispensible for research. This applies also to the biological effects of growth hormones.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity:

No studies were conducted. The source of this information about acute toxicity is invalid regarding information about the purity of the substances and relies on several sources of documentation.

## · Repeat dose toxicity:

A  survey  on  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  by  sc.  administration  has  been  submitted.  Complete hematology,  serum  chemistry,  gross  and  histopathological  evaluations  were  performed  in  most  of these studies. The formation of antibodies to rhGH was monitored in the 2-week rat and 2-, 13-week and 12-month monkey studies.

## Rats

Rats injected subcutaneously with up to 3125 µg/kg/day of somatropin for 14 days did not exhibit any significant signs of toxicity. The mean body weight of the high-dose females was higher than that of the concurrent controls.

Hematology and serum chemistry parameters were unremarkable. Antibodies to rhGH were detected in  rat  serum  samples  at  study  termination.  However,  no  histological  evidence  of  immune  complex formation was observed.

At terminal necropsy, male rats in the 625 and 3125 µg/kg/day groups had elevated adrenal weights that correlated with microscopic evidence of minimal hypertrophy of the adrenocortical cells in most animals.  The  dose  of  125 µg/kg  had  no  effect.  The  treatment  responses  noted  in  this  study  were considered to be the reflection of an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect and/or of no toxicological significance.

In the 2-week study positive antibody titers were noted in at least 50% of the monkeys from all dose groups by the end of the observation period, with the exception of one high-dose animal in the 13week  study  (transient  low  titers)  no  other  animals  were  affected.  Serum  concentration  of  the  test article was determined in samples collected four hours after the final injection indicated an essentially dose-dependent increase in systemic absorption.

While the animals in the 2-week study were not sacrificed, no treatment-related gross or microscopic lesions were observed in the 13-week study.

## Monkeys

Two  separate  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rhesus  monkeys,  in  which  somatropin  was administered 3 times a week at doses from 125 to 625 µg/kg for 2 to 13 weeks. Following completion of dosing in the 2-week study, animals were observed for an additional eight weeks for the assessment of potential antibody responses to rhGH. The dosing regimen was well tolerated in both studies. There was  no  evidence  of  overt  toxicity  and  no  significant  changes  in  hematology  or  serum  chemistry parameters were observed.

The sc.  treatment  of  cynomolgus  monkeys  (about  24 kg  body  weight)  over  52 weeks  was  tolerated without compound-related mortality and did not reveal any significant compound-related alterations with regard to clinical observations, laboratory investigations, organ weights, gross and microscopic post-mortem  examinations.  Also  at  the  injection  site  nothing  other  than  needle  traumas  could  be identified. No evidence of antibody formation was found (33).

In  the  50-month  treatment  study  in  monkeys  which  was  initiated  at  20 months  of  age,  somatropin accelerated bone maturation, growth velocity of crown-rump and tibia length and body weight. The period of acceleration occurred coincidentally with the occurrence of spontaneous puberty. The final adult  crown  rump  length  was  increased  by  about  3%.  One  animal  exhibited  higher  estimates  of antibodies  to  rhGH  throughout  the  study  period  and  also  had  a  smaller  increment  in  crown-rump length. No other deviations or adverse effects were observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Genotoxicity:

Reports or publications on the testing of rhGH in well established genotoxicity study models were not available. However a survey of the data available has been presented.

## Mice

The treatment of Snell dwarf mice with cadaver-derived and recombinant hGH (rhGH-met) at dosages of  150 mU/animal/day  sc.  (=  about  2.5 mg/kg/day  based  on  assumptions:  3  IU  =  1 mg;  20 g  body weight) for 4 weeks produced significantly increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells as measured by the micronucleus test. The effect is obviously dose dependent.

## In vitro studies

In  vitro  treatment  of  CHO  cells  with  the  two  types  of  hormones;  cadaver-derived  and  recombinant hGH (rhGH-met)  (36  or  360 mU/ml  =  12  or  120 µg/ml)  likewise  induced  structural  chromosomal aberrations.

The monitoring of chromosomal abnormalities in peripheral blood lymphocytes in twelve idiopathic GHD patients over 12 months of GH therapy did not reveal an increase  when compared with agematched healthy control.

This finding is not necessarily in contrast to studies on chromosome fragility in lymphocytes of GH treated children (Tedeschi et al. 1993), in which an increased fragility induced by bleomycin in vitro was  found  after  6 months  of  GH  treatment,  as  the  meaning  of  this  finding  for  safety  assessment remains debatable.

The CPMP/ICH/302/95: Note for guidance on preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals  states  that  the  range  and  type  of  genotoxicity  studies  routinely  conducted  for pharmaceuticals  are  not  applicable  to  biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals  and  therefore  are  not needed. This is relevant for rhGH, which however is a growth promoter, giving rise to promoter effect in studies in combination with bleomycin. The lack of traditional genotoxicity studies is justified and the  promoter  effect  indicating  increased  cancer  risk  upon  long  term  treatment  should  be  taken  into consideration in indications for long term use of rhGH therapy.

## · Carcinogenicity:

No  regular  tumorigenicity  studies  fulfilling  current  requirements  with  regard  to  starting  age  of animals, group size and duration of treatment were performed either in rodents or in any other species. However a survey of the data available has been presented.

In  order  to  study  the  influence  of  rhGH  on  virus  induced  leukaemia,  a  high  leukaemic  retrovirusinfected  mouse strain (AKR/O-mice) was treated sc. with 200 µg/kg/day (day 5-50 or 40-140). The authors came to the conclusion that rhGH did not influence the development of malignancy in this model.

No tumorigenic potential with regard to tumour initiation for humans can be derived from knowledge gained  in  preclinical  studies.  However,  as  anabolic  and  mitogenic  effects  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  at supraphysiological  concentrations  or  dose  levels  respectively  have  been  described,  a  promotional effect on tumour growth in tumour bearing patients might be considered.

No  new  regular carcinogenicity studies were  performed. The  promoter  effects of  GH  are demonstrated and suspected from the biological nature of GH and have been be included in the SmPC.

## · Reproduction Toxicity:

No  common  reproduction  studies  (studies  on  fertility,  embryotoxicity,  pre-  and  postnatal  toxicity) were conducted. However a survey of the data available has been presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rats

Female  rats  were  treated  with  rhGH  at  dose  levels  of  0.3,  1.0  and  3.3  IU/kg  (=300;  1 000; 3 300 µg/kg) daily for two weeks before mating, throughout mating and during the first seven days of pregnancy. The two higher dose levels produced a significant prolongation of the estrous cycle. The prolongation (studied after highest dose) appears to be associated with increased plasma progesterone levels. The number of early resorptions was increased after the highest dose level and the number of viable  offspring  after  normal  delivery  after  the  mid  dose.  Fetal  body  weights  were  increased  at  all rhGH dosages

Studies in rats, in which daily sc. injections of natural GH during pregnancy of rats (total dose 1.42 mg/animal = about 8 mg/kg) yielded no other effects in the offspring than a significant increase of the mean birth weight.

## Monkeys

Somatropin (250 µg/kg) was given sc. three times weekly to immature female rhesus monkeys (n=5) to determine whether developmental increases in basal serum LH would occur at an earlier age and if menarche and first ovulation also would be advanced. The females where studied from 20 months of age until occurrence of first ovulation.

The mean age at the time of the initial rise in serum LH was advanced by rhGH treatment (29.6 + 0.4 versus 31.3 + 0.3 months) as was the time of first ovulation (31.5 + 0.7 versus 43.5 + 0.3 months).

However, these changes obviously did not disturb the general reproductive performance. The same treatment was continued over 50 months (4.2 years). Reproductive performance for each animal for each reproductive year was assessed on the number of confirmed pregnancies (based on twice weekly progesterone  analyses),  spontaneous  abortions  or  stillbirths,  or  live  births  with  infants  living  for  at least a month. All females had at least 3 successful pregnancies. The proportion of years in which they had a live birth was not different from control animals (0.73 + 0.08 versus 0.79 + 0.07).

No increased risks of disturbances of fertility, delivery, nursing and development of the pregnancy can be derived from these animal experiments. The experiments are however sparse.

## Dogs

Male dogs were exposed to 3, 10 or 25 IU/kg/day (= 1, 3.3 or 8.3 µg/kg/day) of pituitary derived hGH or rhGH-met given sc. for 20-28 days. The highest dose caused marked reduction of plasma prolactin, LH and testosterone levels associated with reduction of testes and prostate weights, degeneration of germ cells and epithelial atrophy in testes, degenerative changes in epididymis and reduced height of the prostatic epithelium. Similar, although less severe morphological changes were observed after the medium dose.

The  results  indicate  that  repeated  administration  of  very  high  doses  of  hGH  interferes  with  the hormonal regulation of the testis in the dog.

Thus, the possible interference of rhGH administration at high dose levels to male human beings with pituitary function, especially gonadotropin secretion needs to be considered.

Experimental animal  studies,  although  only  of  limited  value  for  the  safety  assessment  of  rhGH  for humans, did not indicate  that  this  hormone  could  lead  to  disturbances  of  male  and  female  fertility, pregnancy,  delivery,  nursing  and  development  of  the  progeny  when  administered  at  therapeutic dosages.

It  is  supported  that  no  further  reproductive  toxicity  testing  within  a  regulatory  context  is  justified. Moreover, no explicit warning about inadvertent consequences of accidental somatropin administration during pregnancy is necessary and no related warning is actually incorporated within the SPC or PL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It  is  argued, however, that the role of GH in (early) human pregnancy is far from being sufficiently understood and that the single reported case of GH substitution during early pregnancy (Müller et al. 1995)  is  largely  insufficient  to  justify  more  broadly  the  GH  substitution  in  GH-deficient  pregnant women. The company apparently follows this argumentation since a precautionary statement has been included in the SPC that NutropinAq should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. This should apply until valid and formal clinical data are available which document the favourable risk-benefit ratio of GH substitution during early pregnancy in GH-deficient women.

## · Local Tolerance:

## Rabbits

In  order  to  assess  the  safety  of  somatropin  at  the  application  site,  local  tolerance  studies  were performed in rabbits by single administration.

Sc. and i.m. administration of somatropin to rabbits was well tolerated locally. Gross and microscopic findings  were  limited  to  those  related  to  the  mechanical  trauma  of  injection  and  unrelated  to  the formulation  components.  This  holds  particularly  true  for  those  formulations  containing  phenol (2.5 mg/ml)  and  polysorbate  20  (2 mg/ml)  (Rep.  93-005-0301)  and  is  in  good  agreement  with  the results of clinical studies with NutropinAq in which even after 3 years of sc. treatment no increase of allergies and local adverse reactions was observed (see Clinical Documentation).

Additionally, prior to sacrifice (1, 3 or 7 days after sc. dosing), three rabbits/group received a single i.v . injection  at  a  dose  volume  of  0.5 ml  (2.5 mg/animal)  of  the  test  or  control  formulation  into  a marginal ear  vein  to  evaluate  pain  response  (Rep.  91-025-0301).  All  of  the  formulations  were  well tolerated locally, no significant lesions were evident at the sites of injection and test material-related responses to pain were not apparent.

This is in good agreement with the results of repeated dose studies (see above) in which even after sc. daily long-term administration over 52 weeks no local adverse effects other than needle traumas were diagnosed.

Thus, no substantial adverse local reactions at the application site should be expected in humans. This reasoning is acceptable in light of the extensive human experience.

## · Other toxicity

## Antibody formation:

Routine  sensitisation  studies  in  guinea  pigs  were  not  performed.  However  a  survey  of  the  data available has been presented.

The monitoring of antibody formation in the 2-week rat study (daily administration) revealed rhGHantibodies at termination. However, neither clinically nor histopathologically could signs of antigenantibody reactions be observed.

After  daily  sc.  administration  of  rhGH  and  rhIGF-1  (2 mg/kg/day)  to  rats  antibodies  against  rhGH were present at day 26, with titre being negatively related to weight gain, serum IGF-1 and acid labile subunit binding protein.

In the 2-week study in monkeys positive antibody titers were noted in a dose dependently increasing incidence (33; 50; 83%) and in a total of about 50% of all dosed animals by the end of the 8-week post-treatment  observation  period.  Only  one  high  dose  (625 µg/kg)  animal  of  the  13-week  study showed transient (week 6-10) low antibody titers.

Moreover, no antibodies to somatropin were found in rhesus monkeys treated daily with 350 µg/kg sc. over half a year or in cynomolgus monkeys which received daily sc. administration of 60-600 µg/kg for 1 year.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The antigenicity of somatropin for human beings is considered to be very low.

Of particular value for the prediction of the immunogenic potential of rhGH in human beings appears to be a transgenic-mouse-model (43; 44).Transgenic mice express hGH ectopically, predominantly in the  salivary  gland,  thus  representing  an  animal  model  producing  hGH  as  a  'self-protein'.  This transgenic mouse model of antibody formation was used as a tool for screening of rhGH preparations for  immunogenic potential. A pool of three samples of thermally stressed NutropinAq to produce a degradation  profile  the  same  or  worse  than  that  predicted  for  a  sample  stored  at  28°C  was  used. Following 12 weeks of twice weekly sc. injections no detectable antibodies were found.

Thus  the  conclusion  that  18  month  storage  at  2-8  C,  has  a  low  antibody  forming  potential,  is considered to be acceptable.

## Impurities, aggregation and degradation products:

Aggregates and clipped forms of somatropin do not constitute a relative part of NutropinAq. Oxidised and deamidated somatropin can form a relatively large part (up to 23 %) of the somatropin content of aged or thermally stressed NutropinAq. Oxidised and deamidated somatropin retained full GH bioactivity and the potential to induce adverse reactions or antibodies in humans was considered identical to native somatropin.

An evaluation of the excipients polysorbate and phenol used in NutropinAq, was presented and did not reveal any health risk.

## · Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment:

Somatropin is identical with the naturally occurring human growth hormone. This peptide hormone is rapidly  and  completely  degraded  by  enzymatic  hydrolysis  in  the  human  organism.  Thus,  the therapeutically administered compound is not released into the environment.

Inadvertent release of wasted material would also not cause any problems in the environment due to its  peptide  structure  which  will  be  rapidly  destroyed  and  mineralised  by  microbial  hydrolytic processes. Therefore, no environmental risk can be expected from the introduction of NutropinAq into therapy.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

The pharmaco-toxicological dossier was considered an adequate documentation for NutropinAq. No major preclinical objections existed against granting a marketing authorisation for NutropinAq and the points for clarification were resolved satisfactorily.

In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical testing have demonstrated that NutropinAq  is therapeutically equivalent to pituitary derived human GH (hGH). Treatment of paediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous GH secretion, patients with chronic renal insufficiency and patients with Turner syndrome results in increased growth rate and an increase in insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) levels.

Effects  on pituitary functions were seen in reproductive testing and promoter effects were found in genotoxicity and tumorgenicity studies. These observations indicating increased cancer risk upon long term treatment should be taken into consideration in indications for use of rhGH therapy.

The response to the CPMP Consolidated List of Questions satisfactorily answered the raised issues regarding protein binding of rhGH in animals, the lack of reproductive toxicity studies, as well as the evaluation of impurities, excipients, aggregation and degradation products.

No  local  reactions  and  immunogenicity  is  expected  in  humans,  due  to  the  identity  of  rhGH  with somatropin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three  single  dose  kinetic  studies,  three  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  (2-week  rat;  2  and  13-week monkey)  and  two  local  tolerance  studies  have  been  conducted  according  to  GLP.  The  other  study reports and published papers originated from universities or were from dates  before  GLPrequirements.  References  cited  in  the  expert  report  follow  the  list  of  references  provided  by  the applicant.

No environmental risk is expected from the introduction of NutropinAq into therapy and no studies were conducted.

The recommendations for SPC modification given from the pharmaco-toxicological perspective have been implemented.

In  conclusion,  the  pharmacological-toxicological  assessment  is  in  favour  of  granting  a  marketing authorisation for NutropinAq.

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

No pure pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in humans with Nutropin or NutropinAq.

## Protocol 85-031. Study of Nutropin short-term in normal adult males

Initial  examinations of Nutropin was carried out in 10 healthy young adults. Subjects received four days of treatment with  0.125 mg/kg/day given as subcutaneous injection. There were no clinically important  changes  in  vital  signs.  However,  eight  of  the  ten  subjects  reported  subjective  symptoms reflecting fluid retention. Body weight of subjects had returned to baseline four days after last dosage.

Serum  GH  concentration  peaked  after  4-5  hours,  but  returned  to  baseline  before  next  injection. However, a marked increase in somatomedin-C (now better known as Insulin-like Growth Hormone I (IGF-1))  was  observed,  which  peaked  on  the  last  day  of  evaluation.  Thus,  it  was  not  possible  to conclude at what concentration this pharmacodynamic action would reach plateau. Plasma concentrations of IGF-1 were determined by a radioimmunoassay validated at Genentech. The intraassay and inter-assay variations of the assay were &lt; 20% with largest variations at low concentrations. Plasma samples were  taken  with  EDTA,  and  heparin  was  avoided  to  exclude  possible  interference from IGF-1 binding proteins.

Metabolic changes included as expected an increase in fasting blood glucose and in blood glucose following glucose challenge. The changes were, however, small.

## Pharmacokinetics

## (see ICH/CPMP Note for guidance: E5, interaction, bio-equivalence)

No  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  with  patients  in  the  proposed  categories  of indications, where patients with growth hormone deficiency due to their altered metabolism and body composition might have a different absorption following s.c. injection as well as an altered half-life elimination.  Pharmacokinetics  were  also  not  studied in  children  or  elderly  or  patients  with  renal  or hepatic impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of Nutropin was studied in healthy male volunteers in 5 studies involving a total of 119 subjects. No multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed

## · General:

## Absorption

A pharmacokinetic study (M0019g) was performed in 21 healthy young adults as a cross-over study with  single  dose  Nutropin  0.1  mg/kg  administered  s.c.  or  single  dose  Nutropin  0.02  mg/kg administered i.v. with a seven-day washout period. Following the s.c administration of, Nutropin was absorbed slowly with Tmax of 6.0 ± 0.37 hr and a Cmax of 75.2 ng/ml.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The fraction absorbed after s.c. injection (bioavailability) was 81 ± 5 % (study M0019g)

## Distribution

Following i.v. administration of 0.02 mg/kg (study (M0019g) the initial volume of distribution was 30 ± 10 ml/kg. The steady state volume of distribution was 51 ± 8 ml/kg.

## Metabolism

The metabolism was not studied

## Excretion

Following i.v. administration (study M0019g) of 0.02 mg/kg, the half-life was 22 min. The half-life following  s.c  administration  was  considerably  longer  (2.5  hr)  indicating  absorption-rate  limited pharmacokinetics after s.c. injection.

## · Interaction studies:

No interaction studies were performed.

## · Bioequivalence studies:

Initial  pharmacological  assessment  of  Nutropin  (somatropin)  was  performed  with  the  formulation G042A.  In  the  further  development  of  Nutropin  a  new  formulation  (G072A)  was  produced.  A bioequivalence study was performed in 24 healthy young adults as a cross-over randomised study of Nutropin formulations G042A and G072A following single dose 0.1 mg/kg as subcutaneous injection. Each  subject  was  examined  with  at  least  a  six-day  washout  period  between  injections.  Serum concentrations were assessed with the assay previously described.

The  two  formulations  were  considered  bioequivalent  based  on  standard  criteria.  The  ratios  of  the means  for  the  AUC  parameter  have  90%  confidence  intervals  well  within  the  20%  criterion  for bioequivalence

A bioequivalence study was performed in 38 healthy young adults as a cross-over randomised study of Nutropin formulations G114AB (Liquid) and G072A (lyophilized) following single dose 0.1 mg/kg as subcutaneous injection. Each subject was examined with at least a six-day washout period between injections.

The two formulations of Nutropin were considered bioequivalent since the ratio of geometric means of AUC and 90% confidence intervals are well within the 20% criterion for bioequivalence.

A  confirmation  of  the  study  above  was  performed  with  another  product  code  of  Nutropin  Liquid (product  code  G108AB),  but  with  identical  design.  In  36  healthy  young  adults  a  cross-over randomised  study  of  Nutropin  formulations  G108AB  (Liquid)  and    G072A  (lyophilized)  following single dose 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection was performed. Each subject was randomised to one of the  two  treatment  sequence  groups  with  a  seven-day  washout  period  between  injections.  Serum concentrations were assessed with the assay previously described.

The two formulations of Nutropin are bioequivalent since the ratio of geometric means of AUC and 90% confidence intervals are well within the 20% criterion for bioequivalence.

All individual bioequivalence studies documented have demonstrated equivalence satisfactorily. It is noted that bioequivalence between the very first lyophilised formulation (G042A) used in the clinical development  program  and  the  marketed  NutropinAq  has  not  been  investigated  directly.  However, based on indirect comparison of the bioavailabilities, the NutropinAq and G042A formulations can be considered bioequivalent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Summary of salient findings

The pharmacokinetic data are not complete. However, the available data on the pharmacokinetics of Nutropin  are  in  agreement  with  published  reports  on  other  recombinant  human  growth  hormone products. Considering the fact that growth hormones have been used extensively in the proposed target population, the pharmacokinetic documentation is considered acceptable.

## Clinical efficacy

## Main studies

The clinical efficacy and safety of Nutropin have been evaluated in each of the four indications, where somatropin therapy has evolved as part of clinical practice over the last decade. All four indications are approved for other brands of recombinant human growth hormone.

- Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) in Childhood No placebo-controlled studies have been performed.

## Protocol 86-061

For patients completing 12 months treatment with Nutropin in studies 85-041 (previously untreated patients)  or  85-042  (previously  treated  patients)  an  extension  of  open-labelled  Nutropin  treatment were performed with the intention to follow up until adult height had been reached. Treatment was discontinued when the growth rate declined to &lt; 2 cm/year or when the bone age had reached &gt; 15 years (boys) or &gt;14 years (girls).  Ninety-two patients were enrolled in  21 centres in the USA. The dosage was 0.3 mg/kg/week given subcutaneously three times per week.  For patients with suboptimal growth  response  (defined  as  &lt;  8  cm/year)  it  was  decided  to  gradually  (every  6  months)  increase Nutropin dose by 0.15 mg/kg/week up to a maximum of 0.6 mg/kg/week. The dose was adjusted for weight  annually.  After  the  second  year  of  study  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  the  weekly dosage either as three injections per week or daily injections. After the third year of study all patients were  assigned  to  receive  daily  injections.  Patients  were  initially  treated  with  Nutropin  formulation G042A; Nutropin formulation G072A was phased into the study. Previous bioequivalence assessments had confirmed the equivalence between the two formulation codes.

Efficacy  results  from  study  86-061  have  been  submitted  as  height  SDS  data.  For  patients  with childhood  GHD,  it  is  confirmed  that  prolonged  therapy  with  NutropinAq  (60  months,  n=60)  is followed  by  improvement  in  height  SDS.  Baseline  values  for  patients  were  -3.4  ±  1.3,  which improved to -0.9 ± 1.4 after 5 years of therapy.

## Protocol  87-070; Daily injections in naive and previously treated patients.

An open-labelled, uncontrolled study of Nutropin was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of Nutropin administered as daily subcutaneous injections to children with GHD.  Patients were enrolled in two cohorts. Cohort 1 (n=63) included patients not previously treated, whereas cohort 2 (n=9) had received prior treatment with either pituitary-derived GH or Protropin for varying periods of time. All children were prepubertal and bone age was &lt; 10 years for girls and &lt; 11 years for boys (for baseline characteristics, see table 7). GHD  was documented by a maximum GH response of &lt; 10 ng/ml on two standard tests of GH secretory capacity together with a growth rate &lt; 5 cm/year. The dosage was 0.3 mg/kg/week given as daily injections (0.043 mg/kg/day). The dose was adjusted for change in weight annually.  Treatment  was  discontinued  at  a  growth  rate  &lt;  2  cm/year  or  when  the  bone  age  had advanced to &gt; 15 years (boys) or &gt; 14 years (girls).

Efficacy  was  confirmed  with  a  significant  improvement  in  growth  rate  on  initiation  of  Nutropin therapy. On continued treatment the growth improvement waned as has been seen with other brands of human GH. Nevertheless, up to 4 years of therapy annual growth rate remained higher than at baseline (table 8). To what degree the emergence of pubertal spurt influences this is not discussed in the report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy  results  from  study  87-070  have  been  supplied  as  height  SDS  data.  For  patients  with childhood  GHD,  it  is  confirmed  that  prolonged  therapy  with  NutropinAq  (48  months,  n=47)  is followed  by  improvement  in  height  SDS.  Baseline  values  for  patients  were  -3.0  ±  1.3,  which improved to -0.8 ± 1.2 after 4 years of therapy.

## Phase III study L0368g: Untreated patients with GHD treated with Nutropin Liquid.

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the safety of NutropinAq, secondary objectives were to measure growth rate and change in height standardized for age and sex as well as height age and bone age.

This  is  a  multi-centre  (17  North  American  pediatricians)  open-label,  non-randomised,  single  arm safety and efficacy study of Aq. No control groups were used.

A total of  67  (planned 60) children with  previously  untreated GHD were enrolled and treated with 0.043 mg/kg of body weight of NutropinAq, given by daily s.c. injections. Adjustments in the dose were made at 6-month intervals.

Inclusion criteria for naive or previously treated children with growtrh failure were the following: GH  deficiency  was  to  be  documented  by  a  maximum  GH  response  of  less  than  10  ng/ml  in  two standard pharmacological tests of GH secretory capacity; prepubertal, bone age of 10 years or less for girls and 11 years or less for boys; children with other hormone deficiencies were to be stabilised on levothyroxin or/and hydrocortison prior to enrolment.

Baseline data for patients in study L0368g have been submitted recently. Mean height SDS was -2.7 for this group of 67 children. The inclusion of subject 49807 AYV with baseline height SDS + 0.6 probably relates to a delayed bone age and a low prestudy growth rate. All other children had height SDS below zero at baseline.

Appropriate  historical  control  comparisons  were  made  with  results  from  Study  87-070  (lyophilised Nutropin) with respect to the incidence of antibodies to GH, laboratory safety data, adverse events. The paired t-test is used to evaluate the change in growth rate and in standardised height. The t-test was also used to compare the change in bone age with the change in height age.

The mean growth rate increased from 4.7 cm/year to 12cm /year after 6 months of treatment and to 11 cm/year after one year. For patients followed for a longer period the growth rate was 8.8 cm in the second year. Height SDS increased from a mean of -2.7 before treatment to - 1.6 and -1.1 after one and  two  years  of  treatment,  resp.  The  improvements  in  growth  were  not  accompanied  by  undue advancement of bone age. There was a highly significant rise in IGF-I plasma levels at therapy. Mean IGF-I score increased from -2.6 at baseline to 0.0 at month 12.

The final reports of studies 85-041, 87-070 and L0368g have recently been submitted. Included are data  on  near  final  height  for  the  children  followed  in  these  studies.  In  children  with  GHD,  delayed puberty and late epiphysial fusion is common. A conservative estimate is produced for the end-point final height, since last measurement is generally obtained at bone age &gt;= 14 years for girls and &gt;= 16 years for boys. A further growth into final adult height is still possible after this point in time although typically by only a few centimeters. A combined calculation for 30 boys in the three studies give final height 171.7 cm with height SDS -0.7, which reflects satisfactorily growth improvement. For girls, the same figures are 154.5 cm final height with height SDS - 1.2. These end-points compare favorably with results obtained for the same indication with other brands of rhGH.

- Growth Retardation in Children with Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI)

Protocol 87-069; Children with chronic renal insufficiency.

A  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  was  performed  in  prepubertal  children  with chronic  renal  insufficiency  (GFR  &lt;  75  mL/min/1.73  m2)  with  growth  retardation  despite  optimal conservative management. The study period was 2 year, and after this open Nutropin treatment was offered to all patients. The study is strengthened by the long double-blind, placebo-controlled period. 125 children were enrolled; 43 placebo and 82 Nutropin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nutropin  dosage  was  0.05  mg/kg/day  s.c.  A  special  condition  in  the  trial  was  a  temporary discontinuation of Nutropin if the child reached his/her mid-parental Tanner target height percentile. In such cases  Nutropin therapy was later reinstated without further pause if the child had a growth rate &lt; 3.5 cm/year.

Changes  in  height  SDS  values  during  the  2-year  double-blind  period  documented  a  marked improvement in growth on Nutropin therapy in contrast to no improvement in children on placebo. The differences are statistically highly significant.

On continued treatment further improvement was obtained although the number of patients is smaller. On initiation of Nutropin patients in the placebo group demonstrated a catch-up growth comparable to the Nutropin group.

## Protocol M0079g. Children with chronic renal insufficiency

A  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  similar  to  study  87-069  was  performed  in  70 patients  (for  baseline  characteristics,  see  table  22).  Patients  were  prepubertal  children  with  chronic renal  insufficiency  (GFR  &lt;  40  mL/min/m2)    with  growth  retardation  (&lt;  fifth  percentile  for chronological age) despite conservative management. The study period was planed as 2 years doubleblind, placebo-controlled after which open Nutropin treatment could be offered to all participants.

During the first year of treatment with Nutropin the mean increase in bone age was 1.0 year, so no undue  advancement  of  bone  maturation  was  observed.  The  calculations  for  predicted  adult  height consequently showed improvement after 1 year therapy.

Long-term data for studies 87-069 and M0617n have now submitted. For 33 children followed for 60 months a growth improvement is maintained on prolonged Nutropin therapy. Height SDS at baseline of -2.8 ± 0.8 changed to-1.1 ± 1.0 after 3 years and -0.9 ± 1.2 after 5 years of therapy. The final study reports  for  studies  87-069  and  MM0079g  are supplied.  After  approval  by  the  FDA  in  1993  for  the indication  chronic  renal  insufficiency  in  children  the  remaining  patients  in  the  two  studies  were enrolled in phase IV studies M0617n and M0618n to continue monitoring.

Combined  data  for  41  patients  followed  for  60  months  on  Nutropin  confirms  continued  growth improvement for each 12 months interval. Baseline height SDS of -2.9 ± 0.9 improved to -1.9 ± 1.0 after 1 year, to -1.1 ± 1.1 after 4 years and for -0.9 ± 1.2 after 5 years.

It  is  acknowledged that for the  group  of children  with CRI several factors make it very difficult to follow until final adult height. This has also been the experience with other products of rhGH. The long-term  data  provided,  confirms  the  positive  impact  on  growth  rates  in  this  indication.  From  the literature is reported that following renal transplantation the height SDS is maintained and catch-down is not occuring.

Regarding the dosage used in clinical trials of CRI children, it is acknowledged that in the field of GH therapy  in  CRI  no  classical  dose-response  pharmacology  has  been  established,  and  international experience has generated a 'standard' dosage for this indication as reflected in the SPC for somatropin products.

## · Growth Retardation in Children with Turners Syndrome

## Protocol 85-044 . Two dosage schedule in Turner syndrome

A randomised trial was performed in girls with Turner syndrome and growth retardation to compare two dosage schedules of Nutropin with a cumulative weekly dose of 0.375 mg/kg subcutaneously. A total of 117 patients were enrolled and randomised to no treatment (n=9), Nutropin three times weekly (n=36) or Nutropin daily (n=72).  The primary study period was 1 year.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study design is complex since later amendments included initiation of daily Nutropin to patients in  the  untreated  control  group  after  1  year,  and  to  treat  all  patients  on  a  daily  schedule  (0.054 mg/kg/day), and to randomise patients to early versus late addition of estrogen therapy, and finally to follow the patients until adult height is achieved.

A total  of  63  patients  are  available  for  assessment  of  efficacy  in  the  trial.  Historical  controls  were included  in  the  assessments  since  no  group  in  the  trial  continued  beyond  1  year  without  active treatment. Since final  adult  height  was  the  primary end-point  is  was  necessary  to  include  historical controls.

The short-term results observed demonstrated an improvement in growth rate in patients treated with Nutropin. The mean growth rate for 1 year was 6.7 cm in the three time weekly group and 8.1 cm in the  daily  group.  The  difference  between  the  two  Nutropin  schedules  is  statistically  significant  (P  &lt; 0.0001). Both growth rates were significantly greater than in the control group (4.0 cm), P &lt; 0.0001.

Due to the complexity of the protocol long-term efficacy is expressed for different groups of patients depending on Nutropin and estrogen treatments given in relation to the age of the patient at inclusion. The results obtained are compared with historical controls for reasons described above.

The growth improvement is demonstrated in all groups receiving Nutropin with the most pronounced increases in patients treated early with Nutropin and later with estrogen. Furthermore, from individual data presentations it is shown that a considerable numbers of Turner girls have changed position on the growth curves approaching normal controls

The differences in final height related to start of estrogen therapy is mainly explained by the influence on  bone  maturation  with  fusion  of  epiphysis  at  a  younger  age  if  estrogen  is  started  early  in adolescence.

## · Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) in Adults

## Protocol M0431g: Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) in Adults

A pivotal trial was performed in 171 patients with GHD acquired in adulthood (age &gt; 18 years). The design  was  randomised,  double  blind  and  placebo-controlled  for  1  year.  Subjects  received  daily injections of either Nutropin or placebo. The dosage of Nutropin was 0.0125 mg/kg/day for the first month. A later amendment described a dose reduction to 0.00625 mg/kg/day if side effects reflecting fluid  retention  occurred.  However,  79%  of  subjects  remained  on  a  dosage  of  0.0125  mg/kg/day throughout  the  12-month  treatment  period.  The  initial  design  of  dose  intensification  after  the  first month was cancelled. The primary end-points for efficacy were 1) changes in body composition of percentage  body  fat  and  lean  body  mass,  2)  strength  and  endurance  during  dynamometry,  and  3) quality of life.

A total of 171 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients had acquired GHD during adulthood as a result  of  hypothalamic-pituitary disease. Deficient  GH secretion (&lt; 5 ng/ml) was confirmed by two stimulation  tests.  No  patients  had  a  previous  history  of  GH  therapy,  but  they  received  hormonal treatment as appropriate for other endocrine systems. Patients with malignant diseases were excluded. A total of 125 patients were assessable for the primary efficacy analysis.

Subjects  receiving  Nutropin  had  no  significant  change  in  mean  body  weight,  i.e.  the  unfavourable increase in BMI was not influenced. After 1 year of therapy, however, changes in the composition of the  body  were  observed.  Total  body  percent  fat  decreased  whereas  total  body  percent  lean  mass increased. Nutropin therapy is associated with fluid retention, which could influence the assessment of lean body mass.

Besides these small, although statistically significant, changes in body composition no improvements were obtained in strength and endurance or quality of life.  The potential for further improvements during long-term therapy beyond 1 year is not known from this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Likewise, it is unknown if a waning efficacy on prolonged therapy, described for other indications, emerges.  Bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  as  assessed  by  DEXA  showed  no  statistically  significant changes.

## Protocol M0381g: Previously treated adults with GHD

This trial enrolled young adults (ages 18-35 years old) with documented GHD acquired in childhood. The study was randomised, placebo-controlled for two years. The patients had received GH therapy in the past (mean 14 years), but not for at least 1 year prior to study screening. Patients were randomised to daily subcutaneous injections of Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg (n=20), Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg (n=23) or a similar volume of placebo (n=21). During the initial 3 months of therapy patients received one-half the indicated dose (to reduce side effects of fluid retention). After 3 months patients had to receive the original dose or to discontinue from the study. Concomitant therapy for other hormonal deficiencies was given as appropriate. Efficacy end-points were changes in percent lean body mass and total body fat, strength and endurance, bone mineral density (BMD), and quality of life.

Primary efficacy results showed a statistically significant decrease in percent body fat with a parallel increase in lean body mass. The changes were similar in the two dose groups of Nutropin, whereas placebo did not influence these end-points.

Kinetics of the measurements showed the change in percent fat to occur during the initial 6 months of therapy (of which the first 3 months prescribed one-half dosage) with no further alterations at month 12. It is unclear if efficacy measurements remain unchanged beyond 1 year.

Physical performance as expressed by maximum rate of oxygen consumption increased slightly in the Nutropin  groups  after  12  months  of  treatment,  but  no  statistically  significant  difference  from  the placebo group was found. Assessment of quality of life did not improve from baseline to month 12 evaluation in either of the Nutropin groups. Bone mineral density in spine did not change at any group at  month 6, whereas in Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day a small increase was observed at month 12 (P = 0.03  compared  with  placebo).  Nevertheless,  there  were  no  statistically  significant  between-group differences  in  percent  change  in  spine  BMD  from  baseline  to  month  12.  Quality  of  life  and echocardiography were not influenced by NutropinAq therapy.

At  the  completion  of  the  24-month  treatment  significant  increase  in  spine  BMD  was  found  in  the Nutropin groups, whereas patients treated with placebo as expected showed no difference.

Lipid  metabolism  shows  abnormalities  in  adults  with  GHD.  Results  for  the  initial  1-year  treatment period reveal only small and unclear changes in lipid variables. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in the high dose Nutropin group, whereas triglycerides remained unchanged. However, the standard variations were often large and low dose Nutropin had no effect at all and even tended to increase triglycerides and cholesterol levels.

## Adverse events

No overall  resume  of  adverse  events  was  presented.  The  vast  majority  of  the  adverse  events  were considered  unlikely  to  be  related  to  Nutropin  treatment.  In  study  86-061  none  of  the  non-serious adverse events were considered to be related to Nutropin treatment.  In studies L0386g and 87-070, 15 patients reported at least one AE which was considered possibly/probably related to treatment (table 16).  The  difference  in  frequency  of  possibly/probably  related  AE's  between  the  two  studies  is explained  by  more  complete  and  comprehensive  reporting  of  AE's  during  the  more  recent  L0386g study.

## Serious Adverse events

9 SAE's were reported. Out of these only 2 were considered to be related to Nutropin treatment (two cases of recurrence of intra-cranial medulloblastoma).

## Withdrawals due to AE

A total of 12 patients were withdrawn from study medication due to adverse events (5 patients in study 86-061, 2 patients in study 87-070 and 5 patients in study L0386g). The causes for withdrawal were primarily  recurrence  of  intra-cranial  tumour  (5  cases).  The  rest  of  the  withdrawals  were  due  to precocious puberty (2 cases), seizures (2 cases), depression (1 case), rash (1 case) and recurrence of lymphoblastic leukaemia (1 case).

## Deaths

No deaths were reported

## Antibodies against GH

Prevalence of antibodies against growth hormone increased during the first 12 months of treatment. No  additional  increase  in  the  prevalence  was  observed  after  12  months.  The  antibody  titers  were generally low and efficacy of Nutropin did not seem to be influenced by the presence of antibodies.

## Laboratory parameters

Except  for  well-known  effects  of  growth  hormone  on  thyroid  parameters,  protein  and  glucose metabolism, Nutropin did not cause any clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters.

## Adverse events

Adverse events possibly or probably related to Nutropin treatment were reported in four patients. In two cases hyperglycemia was found (whereas fasting glucose in a group of 50 patients on Nutropin did not change during 2 years). One case of pseudotumor cerebri with clear clinical symptoms was observed in which MRI scan was normal. However, other treatments for chronic renal insufficiency were possibly related to this event, and Nutropin therapy was continued in the patient. The last case was the patient with slipped femoral epiphysis described above. No cases of leukaemia, carpal tunnel syndrome, thyreoid dysfunction, or allergic reactions were reported.

## Serious Adverse events

There were no reports of serious adverse events related to treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Withdrawals

A  total  of  8  patients  were  withdrawn  from  treatment  due  to  AEs.  In  study  87-069  7  patients discontinued treatment. Two patients on placebo stopped blinded treatment (precocious puberty and rapidly  progression  of  renal  failure).  Five  patients  on  Nutropin  stopped  blinded  treatment  (slipped femoral epiphysis, hip pain and incipient slipped femoral epiphysis, pulmonary oedema in congenital aortic  stenosis,  pancreatitis  with  insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  and  elevated  SGOT/SGPT levels).  In  study  M0079g one patient in the Nutropin treated group discontinued treatment due to a rash at the injection site. Relationship to treatment was judged as unclear.

## Deaths

In  study  87-069,  two  patients  died  due  to  complications  related  to  renal  transplantation.  In  study M079g, one patient in the control group died. The death was considered unrelated to treatment.

## Antibodies against GH

In study 87-069, the incidence of patients with positive GH-antibodies was approximately 15%, and growth rates were unrelated to the presence of antibodies.

## Laboratory parameters

There were no laboratory measurement abnormalities of clinical concern attributable to Nutropin treatment.

## Renal function

Renal function as judged by serum creatinine and creatinine clearance decreased in both Nutropin and placebo treated children. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments.

- Summary of safety concerning the indication of growth retardation associated with Turner syndrome

## Exposure

Safety was evaluated in 117 patients receiving Nutropin for an average of 4.6 years.

## Adverse events

Adverse events were either common disorders of childhood or abnormalities known to be present in patients  with  Turner  syndrome  with  increased  incidence.  No  cases  of  leukaemia,  slipped  femoral epiphysis, pseudotumor cerebri, carpal tunnel syndrome, or diabetes were reported.

## Serious Adverse events/Withdrawals

Three  cases  of  serious  adverse  events/discontinuations  occurred.  One  patient  with  a  pre-existing seizure disorder developed hypoplastic anaemia. Her anticonvulsive therapy was considered responsible for the bone marrow suppression and was discontinued, while Nutropin continued without further  events.  One  patient  developed  progressive  right-side  weakness  and  slurred  speech  after  44 months on Nutropin. She also received hormonal therapy in a cyclical regimen. All medication was discontinued,  although  the  incident  was  not  considered  to  be  related  to  Nutropin.  One  patient discontinued due to an injection site reaction, which was later demonstrated to be related to allergy to the excipient.

## Antibodies against GH

Antibodies  to  growth  hormone  was  measured  regularly  during  the  study.  The  incidence  of  patients with  positive  GH-antibodies  was  ca  15%,  and  growth  rates  were  unrelated  to  the  presence  of antibodies.

Baseline  examinations  in  clinical  trials  of  Turner  syndrome  and  renal  insufficiency  have  not demonstrated antibodies to GH prior to treatment in any subject. The applicant is unable to explain the mechanism of immunological reaction responsible for anti-GH antibody production other than  'some antibody  response  is  common  to  most  recombinant  human  protein  therapeutics.'  For  children  with congenital growth hormone deficiency this disorder is primarily a quantitative decrease in circulating GH (to concentrations below the diagnostic levels  by  stimulation  tests),  but  very  small  amounts  of hormone may be present.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Apparently, this fact is in many cases sufficient to induce such a tolerance in the immune system that exogenous administration of recombinant protein may not necessarily give rise to antibody formation.

## Adverse events

Compared  to  placebo,  Nutropin  treatment  was  associated  with  increased  incidences  of  oedema, arthralgia/arthritis/arthrosis/joint disorder and tenosynovitis. These adverse events were mild-moderate and  could  be  alleviated  by  dose  reduction  and  continued  treatment.  No  cases  of  leukaemia  or pseudotumor cerebri were observed in the study.

## Serious Adverse events

Serious adverse events were reported in 7 patients in the Nutropin group (3 recurrent CNS neoplasms, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 myocardial infarction, 1 paravertebral cystic mass, and 1 breast mass with spontaneous remission) and in 3 patients in the placebo group (3 skin carcinomas). In all cases, the AE was considered to be remotely related to study medication.

## Withdrawals

A total of 16 patients treated with Nutropin and 6 treated with placebo discontinued treatment as a result  of  adverse events. For the Nutropin treated subjects the reasons were carpal tunnel syndrome (4), arthritis like symptoms (4), weight gain/oedema (3),  increasing supracellular mass (2), abnormal glucose  tolerance  test  (1),  Graves  disease  (1)  and  arthritis  (1).  For  the  placebo  treated  patients  the reasons  were  recurrent  brain  lesion  (2),  arthritis  (1),  abnormal  glucose  tolerance  test  (1),  traumatic injury (1), dyspnea (1)

## Deaths

No deaths were reported during the study.

## Antibodies against GH

One subject treated with Nutropin had a transient increase in antibody titer (from &lt;1.0 to 1.2). After 12 months treatment, titers had reverted back to &lt;1.0.

## Laboratory parameters

I Apart from the well-known diabetogenic effect and mild increases of alkaline phosphatase, there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory test results.

## Supporting studies

The potential influence on growth has been analysed in post-marketing protocols (NCGS). A major finding is that growth rates were not significantly different in patients treated with NutropinAq and Nutropin, indicating preserved biological activity. The company stresses that 'Antibodies to growth hormone  were  not  associated  with  growth  attenuation  in  any  patient',  which  may  be  a  difficult conclusion  to  prove.  Nevertheless,  what  has  clearly  been  demonstrated  is  that  the  range  of  growth rates  for  antibody  positive  subjects  did  not  differ  from  those  for  antibody  negative  subjects.  It  is considered that this result is the most important in the assessment of antibody impact.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the NCGS data base 9,829 subjects are available for analysis as of 30 June 1999. 6,712 patients were exposed to Nutropion and 3,117 patients were exposed to NutropinAq. The total patient years contributed in the data base on NutropinAq were 3,161 years. In addition, the company has submitted a periodic safety update report on NutropinAq for the period 11 September 1999 to 5 July 2000. The five most frequently reported adverse events were:

- Injection site pain (0.50%)
- Scoliosis (0.16%)
- Headache (0.16%)
- Intracranial hypertension (0.08%)
- Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (0.07%)

Other adverse events were observed very rarely, and the association with Nutropin therapy is difficult to assess (e.g. an incidence of diabetes mellitus of 0.05% in this childhood cohort of patients with an endocrine disorder probably is not significantly different from the background population).

From the NCGS database it is considered acceptable that no new and unexpected safety issues have been  identified  during  the  mentioned  period,  which  would  require  an  amendment  of  the  SPC  for NutropinAq.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Viral  Safety  and  Batch  to  batch  consistency  has  been  documented  and  the  relevant  test  will  be performed according to the agreed specifications.

The currently available information demonstrates a sufficiently consistent production of NutropinAq and a well-defined quality, suitable for human use. The company has undertaken to provide the all outstanding data which remain as follow-up measures, listed in Chapter II.3, within the agreed time frame.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

The pharmaco-toxicological dossier was considered an adequate documentation for NutropinAq.

The recommendations for SPC modification given from the pharmaco-toxicological perspective have been implemented.

In  conclusion,  the  pharmacological-toxicological  assessment  is  in  favour  of  granting  a  marketing authorisation for NutropinAq.

## Efficacy

## Dose-response studies and main clinical studies

No formal dose-response studies were performed. Dosages used in the clinical trials as well as dosage recommendations in the SPC are based previous published studies of growth replacement. The clinical documentation  is  primarily  based  on  trials  with  lyophilized  Nutropin.  Only  one  clinical  trial  with NutropinAq  has  been  performed  (study  L0368g).  However  as  NutropinAq  can  be  considered bioequivalent with the lyophilized Nutropin formulations used in previous trials, the results obtained with lyophilized Nutropin can be extrapolated to NutropinAq.

Concerning the indication growth hormone deficiency in children, efficacy was not studied in placebo controlled experiments. Considering that growth hormone replacement therapy was a well established treatment in growth hormone deficient (GHD) children when the clinical development program was launched it would be unethical to perform placebo controlled trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thus  the  lack  of  placebo-controlled  studies  is  acceptable.  In  uncontrolled  trials  or  in  trials  using Protropin  (methionyl-growth  hormone),  Nutropin  was  shown  to  cause  an  improvement  of  growth, compared  to  baseline  values.  The  magnitude  was  similar  to  the  one  observed  for  Protropin. Improvement  of  growth  was  maintained  throughout  treatment  although,  as  with  other  recombinant growth  hormones,  the  effect  waned  on  prolonged  treatment.  Nevertheless,  annual  growth  rates remained  higher  than  baseline  for  at  least  4  years.  The  improved  growth  was  not  accompanied  by undue advancement of bone age. Predicted final adult height increased between 8 to 10 cm and the predicted final height standard deviation score (SDS) was between -0.4 and -0.9 indicating an average final height close to the mean of a healthy population. Actual final height data were not supplied but a conservative estimate for the end-point final height obtained at bone age &gt;= 14 years for girls and &gt;= 16  years  for  boys  indicated  that  final  height  in  boys  was  171.7  cm  with  height  SDS  -0.7,  which reflects satisfactorily growth improvement. For girls, the same figures are 154.5 cm final height with height SDS - 1.2. These end-points compare favorably with results obtained for the same indication with other brands of rhGH.

As  regards  the  indication  growth  failure  in  children  with  CRI,  two  randomised,  placebo-controlled studies  have  demonstrated  that  Nutropin  (lyophilized)  in  addition  to  standard  treatment  of  renal insufficiency  significantly  improves  growth.  After  24  months  of  treatment,  height  SDS  improved between 0.8 and 1.3 in Nutropin treated patients whereas no change or slight deterioration in height SDS was  observed  in  the  placebo  treated  group.  Correspondingly,  predicted  final  height  SD  score improved in Nutropin treated children (from -1.6 at baseline to -1.0 and -0.8 after 12 and 24 months of treatment, respectively) whereas predicted final height remained unchanged in the placebo treated patients. Actual final height data were not supplied but this is acceptable as the majority of children with CRI undergo renal transplant before they reach final height.

Concerning  the  indication  growth  failure  associated  with  Turners  syndrome,  a  short  term  (1  year) placebo-controlled  study  have  demonstrated  that  Nutropin  improves  growth  rates  compared  to placebo. For once daily Nutropin, 3 times weekly Nutropin and placebo the growth rates were 8.1 , 6.7 and 4.0 cm/year respectively. After completion of the first year all subjects continued on Nutropin. Thus, only historical controls were available for the remainder of the study. Patients were followed until very close to final height. Improvement of final height compared to pre-treatment predicted final height  was  between  4.7  cm  and  8.4  cm  depending  on  age  at  initiation  of  treatment  and  time  of initiation of oestrogen replacements (best results for early initiation of growth hormone therapy and late initiation of oestrogen therapy). For the historical controls actual final height was very close to the 'pre-treatment' predicted final height (predicted final height at an age corresponding to the age of the actively treated patients at initiation of treatment).

In  adults  with  GHD  (both  previously  treated  patients  and  naïve  patients),  placebo-controlled  trials have demonstrated that Nutropin increases lean body mass and decreases total body fat. Compared to placebo, 12 months of Nutropin treatment increased total body % lean by 2.8 to 6.4 percentage points. Efficacy beyond 12 to 18 months was not investigated. Data on the effect of Nutropin on bone mineral density (BMD) were conflicting, with some studies showing an improvement of BMD while others showed no effect. As regards muscle strength, endurance, lipid profile and quality of life, Nutropin tended to improve some of the parameters but none of the differences attained statistical significance.

## Safety

In children, Nutropin (lyophilized) was generally well tolerated with few adverse events. These were primarily of the type well known from other growth hormone products. No unexpected adverse events were encountered. As regards laboratory test results, no unexpected clinically significant abnormalities were encountered. As for other rhGH preparations, increased titres of antibodies were noted during the early  phases  of  therapy.  However,  the  frequency  of  antibodies  to  hGH  was  higher  following NutropinAq  compared  to  other  hGH  preparations  on  the  market  (after  24  months  still  7%  of  the children  with  GHD).  Therefor  the  frequency  of  antibodies  to  NutropinAq  and  possible  effects  on growth should be thoroughly investigated in post marketing studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In adults, Nutropin (lyophilized) was associated with the well-known side effects observed in previous trials  with growth hormone replacement therapy in adults, primarily fluid accumulation and adverse events  related  to  joints  and  bones.  Apart  from  the  well-known  diabetogenic  effect  and  an  expected effect  on  alkaline  phosphatase  and  thyroid  parameters  no  clinically  relevant  abnormalities  in  the laboratory test results were encountered.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Efficacy data indicate that NutropinAq improves growth in children with growth hormone deficiency or  growth retardation due to chronic renal insufficiency or Turners syndrome. The safety profile of NutropinAq in children is generally comparable to what has been observed for previously approved recombinant human growth hormone products. However, limited data indicate that NutropinAq may be associated with a higher risk of development of antibodies against growth hormone. Provided that company commits to investigate the frequency of antibodies to NutropinAq and possible effects on efficacy  (in  a  post-marketing  study),  the  benefit-risk  relation  for  NutropinAq  in  children  can  be considered  positive.  As  regards  the  indication  'replacement  in  adults  with  GHD'  the  efficacy  and safety  of  NutropinAq  is  similar  to  what  has  been  reported  for  other  recombinant  human  growth hormones. Thus, the benefit-risk balance for this indication must be considered acceptable.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered  that the benefit/risk profile of NutropinAq in the treatment of:

- long term treatment of children with growth failure due to a lack of adequate endogenous growth hormone secretion
- long-term treatment of growth failure associated with Turner syndrome
- treatment of children with growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency up to the time of renal transplantation
- replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency of either childhood or adult-onset etiology. Growth hormone deficiency should be confirmed appropriately prior to treatment.

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation
