## 1. Rapporteur recommendation

Based on the review of the data on quality and PK the generic/hybrid application for Epixram (levetiracetam):

as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

as adjunctive therapy:

- in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with epilepsy.

- in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.

- in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.

is not approvable since \"major objections\" have been identified, which preclude a recommendation for marketing authorisation at the present time. The details of these major objections are provided in the List of Questions.

The major objections precluding a recommendation of marketing authorisation, pertain to the following principal deficiencies:

## Quality:

Limited data on discriminatory power of dissolution method.

## Clinical

## 2. Executive summary

## 2.1. Problem statement

Epilepsy is a chronic neurologic condition characterised by recurrent episodes of seizures (Thijs et al., 2019). Epileptic seizures consist of hyper synchronous, paroxysmal discharges of a group of hyper excitable neurons which arise as a result of a sudden imbalance between neuronal excitation and and then spreads to other cortical areas and subcortical structures (Carcak and Ozkara, 2017). Epilepsy is defined as two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 h apart; a single unprovoked seizure if recurrence risk is high (i.e., &gt;60% over the next 10 years); or a diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome (Fisher et al., 2017).

inhibition. This abnormal burst of action potentials starts in a discrete region of cortex or hippocampus The principal mechanisms assumed to lead to seizure activity include increased excitation by hyperactivity of glutamatergic transmission and functional disturbances of the ligand or voltage-gated sodium and Ca2+ channels or decreased inhibition which is linked mainly with loss of GABA mediated neurotransmission and extracellular potassium currents (Carcak and Ozkara, 2017). The causes of epilepsy can be structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune and unknown. Although many underlying disease mechanisms can lead to epilepsy, the underlying cause remains unknown in about 50% of cases globally (Thijs et al., 2019). Epidemiological data have shown that epilepsy affects around 50 million people worldwide. Globally, an estimated 5 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy annually (WHO Epilepsy, 2019). There is significant discrepancy in the prevalence and incidence of epilepsy in high- versus low-income countries, with approximately 80% of the epileptic patients worldwide living in low- and middle-income countries (Singh and Sander, 2020). Epilepsy does not affect all ages equally but has a bimodal distribution, with one peak at 5-9 years (due to genetic or developmental causes) and a second at approximately 80 years of age (due to accumulated injury to the brain) (Falco-Walter, 2020). In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated the classification and terminology of seizures and epilepsy. According to ILAE, classification is made at 3 levels: seizure onset, epilepsy type and syndrome (Fisher et al., 2017; Scheffer et al., 2017). Onset of a seizure is defined first, as focal, generalised, unknown or unclassifiable. After determining onset type, it is necessary to distinguish whether consciousness is impaired. The options for this designation include aware or impaired awareness. The final designation determines whether a focal or generalised seizure has a motor component (Fisher et al., 2017). Once a seizure has been classified, if an individual has been determined to have epilepsy (as defined above), epilepsy should be classified as focal, generalised, combination of focal and generalised, or unknown. In the third level, a specific syndrome diagnosis can be made. Underlying aetiology should be investigated along each step (Scheffer et al., 2017).

Pharmacological therapy is the most common approach to control seizures. It is indicated to be initiated after the occurrence of two unprovoked seizures or following the first seizure if there is a risk of recurrence. Beyond pharmacological therapy, surgical treatment (resection, destruction or disconnection of epileptic focus) and neurostimulation techniques can be used for severe cases of drugresistant focal epilepsy. The goal of treatment is complete abolition of seizures without side effects, a goal presently achieved in approximately 50% of patients with the current range of antiepileptic drugs available. Many factors influence the choice of an antiepileptic drug for the individual patient. These include epilepsy characteristics, namely focal or generalised, and patient characteristics, such as gender, childbearing potential, age of onset, comorbid conditions and other medications. Drug characteristics such as spectrum of activity, efficacy, need for titration and side effects, including teratogenic potential in women, are equally important. Globally, cost is an important determining factor, as often treatment may be needed for several years, if not indefinitely (Ali, 2018) .

## 2.2. About the product

The  medicinal  product  object  of  this  application  is  levetiracetam  (Epixram)  a  modified-release formulation of levetiracetam as prolonged-release granules for once daily dosing at the strengths of 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg. The new formulation has been developed with the aim to be equivalent to the same daily doses of marketed levetiracetam immediate release (IR) tablets (Keppra) administered twice daily (reference product; Marketing Authorisation Holder [MAH]: UCB Pharma SA, Belgium).

Levetiracetam  belongs  to  the  pharmacotherapeutic  group  of  antiepileptics,  other  antiepileptics,  ATC code: N03AX14.

Levetiracetam is a pyrrolidone derivative, particularly, the S -enantiomer of α -ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide, chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic active substances. Its main mechanism of action is through binding to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) (Lynch et al., 2004) . It also reverses the inhibition of neuronal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and glycine-gated currents induced by zinc and beta-carbolines (Rigo et al., 2002) and affects intraneuronal calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) levels by inhibiting N -type Ca 2+  channels (Niespodziany et al., 2001; Lukyanetz et al., 2002) .

However, the mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal neurotransmission.

Keppra (levetiracetam) is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without  secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Keppra (levetiracetam) is indicated as adjunctive therapy:

- in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.
- in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with  Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.
- in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from  12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.

Levetiracetam 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg prolonged release (PR) granules is a new formulation developed by Neuraxpharm Pharmaceuticals S.L. In the US, levetiracetam was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 as an immediate-release (IR) tablet (Keppra IR). An extended-release (XR) tablet, Keppra XR, was approved by the FDA later in 2008. Currently, a prolonged release oral formulation of levetiracetam is not approved for the EU innovator product.

Levetiracetam 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg PR granules will follow the approved Keppra indications, with a differentiation in the targeted age groups:

- (i) as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents aged ≥16 years with newly diagnosed epilepsy
- (ii) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of
- o a) POS with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents aged ≥12 years with epilepsy
- o b) myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents aged ≥12 years with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy

c) primary generalised tonicclonic seizures in adults and adolescents ≥12 years with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.

## 2.3. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

Relevant for the assessment are the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1) and Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified-release dosage forms (EMA/CHMP/EWP/280/96 Rev.1.

The applicant had initially discussed the clinical development strategy in the following occasions with the Swedish agency and the European Medicines Agency (EMA):

- -Scientific  advice  (SA)  to  Läkemedelsverket  (Swedish  Medical  Products  Agency),  receiving meeting minutes after the meeting on 21 April 2021.
- -EMA  Initial  Qualification  Procedure  (EMA/SA/0000079358),  receiving  a  qualification  method letter in the above from the CHMP in 15 December 2022.
- -EMA Initial SA Procedure (EMA/SA/0000109253), receiving an SA letter on the above from the CHMP on 15 December 2022.

The scientific advice pertained to the following clinical aspects:

- the proposed overall clinical (PK) study programme; adequacy of a Real-World Evidence study to support comparative PK and non-inferiority of effectiveness between Keppra twice daily and Keppra XR once daily to support the future marketing authorization application

It was stated in the FAL that since in the pivotal study comparative bioavailability has not been shown for peak plasma concentration at steady state  (Cmax.ss), with lower and upper boundary of 90% CI crossing outside of the 80-125% interval, and exposure response relationship is not well characterised for levetiracetam, a therapeutic equivalence study comparing the efficacy and safety of the test and reference products will be needed to establish a bridge between the EU reference product and the test product to allow reference to the reference product's pre-clinical and clinical data. However, a therapeutic equivalence study was not submitted by the applicant.

Moreover, as per EMA/SA/0000079358, based on the current state of literature, PBPK models currently cannot be considered reliable for the prediction of CSF drug concentration specifically for transporter substrates, when no in vivo CSF data is available for parameter optimization/model verification.

Furthermore, it was agreed that the model cannot be considered to support safety claims and that other sources of data would be required for the evaluation of safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Active substance

## 3.1.2.1. General information

The active substance levetiracetam is described in the Ph. Eur. The manufacturer of levetiracetam used in this application has been granted an EDQM Certificate of Suitability

## 3.1.2.2. Manufacture, process controls and characterisation

One site is involved in the manufacture of the active substance.

The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the certificate of suitability.

## 3.1.2.3. Specification

The active substance specification is in accordance with the current Ph. Eur. monograph no. 2535 and the CEP requirements.

The analytical procedures adopted by the finished product manufacturer are those described in the European Pharmacopoeia monograph of levetiracetam, with the exception of the method for the determination of ethyl carbamate and residual solvent content (acetone), where in-house analytical methods are used.

The in-house analytical methods used have been adequately described and sufficiently validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

Batch analysis data of three batches of the active substance has been provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## 3.1.2.4. Stability

The stability results assessed during CEP procedure indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period.

## 3.1.3. Finished medicinal product

## 3.1.3.1. Description of the product and pharmaceutical development

The finished product levetiracetam prolonged-release granules was developed in four strengths of 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 2000 mg and 3000 mg.

The active substance levetiracetam is a white or almost white powder and belongs to BCS Class 1. It is very soluble in water, soluble in acetonitrile and practically insoluble in heptane. Levetiracetam does not exhibit polymorphism.

The finished product has been developed as extended-release product with similar characteristics to Keppra XR tablets.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except for Surelease. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation, however Surelease is considered a co-processed excipient. The choice of excipients has been based on binary compatibility studies. Excipients used have been characterised and their grade has been defined however, the characterisation of Surelease still needs to be updated. (OC) he applied product can be used in children over 12 years however, compliance of the formulation with requirements for a paediatric and elderly population is still not sufficient (OC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A clear summary of the manufacturing process development has been presented.

Information on dissolution development is still not fully sufficient. The discriminatory power of dissolution method cannot be considered as documented. (MO) Also, information on an influence of alcohol on dissolution is not fully clear - clarification is needed why tests with 5% ethanol were performed for 2 hours, and tests with 10% or 20% ethanol were performed for 1 hour. (OC)

The microbiological attributes proposed for the final product comply with Ph. Eur. 5.1.4: Non aqueous preparations for oral use.

## 3.1.3.2. Manufacture of the product and process controls

The manufacturing process consists of steps: weighing, blending, granulation solution preparation, granulation, drying, screening, blending, lubrication, compression, coating, and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process.

The batch formula for the intended commercial batch size is stated. A detailed narrative description of the full manufacturing process is provided, accompanied by a flow chart including in-process controls. Critical steps of the manufacturing process are adequately described.

The finished product manufacturing process has been satisfactorily validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.

A validation report for the sachet-filling and packaging step for three production scale batches has also been presented. However, since there are two manufacturing sites responsible for primary and secondary packaging, the validation protocol for the filling and packaging step should be presented from the second declared manufacturing site or it should be confirmed that the presented packaging validation is also obligatory at the second manufacturing site (OC).

The transport arrangements of bulk product have been sufficiently described. The potential impact of short or longer excursions outside of the original storage conditions has been discussed and supported by accelerated and long-term stability data.

## 3.1.3.3. Product specifications

The updated specifications are acceptable. The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach. Batch analysis data on three batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification.

An updated risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been submitted considering suspected and actual root causes in line with the 'Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products' (EMA/409815/2020) and the 'European Medicines Regulatory Network approach for the implementation of the CHMP Opinion pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) Nº 726/2004 for nitrosamine impurities in human medicines (EMA/425645/2020). A justification for testing two specified nitrosamines is expected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for three batches of stick packs for strength 1000 mg, one batch of stick packs for strength 1500 mg, one batch of stick packs for strength 2000 mg, one batch of stick packs for strength 3000mg, and two batches of stick packs for strength 3000 mg for a different batch size. They indicate that the process is under control.

## 3.1.3.4. Stability of the product

Stability data from three batches of size 100 000 stick packs for strength 1000 mg, two batches of size 100 000 stick packs for strength 3000 mg and one batch of size 33 333 stick packs for strength 3000 mg, stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC±2ºC / 60%RH±5%RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC±2°C / 75%RH±5%RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing, i.e. PET / ALU / PE sachets.

Levetiracetam prolonged release granules 1500 mg and 2000 mg strengths packed in PET / ALU / PE sachets were not included in the stability studies, as according to the Note for Guidance on Bracketing and Matrixing designs for Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Drug Products (CPMP/ICH/4104/00) a reduced design (bracketing design) can be applied for the finished product.

Additionally, stability studies data covering 3 months at long term and accelerated conditions have been presented for three finished product batches of strengths 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 2000 mg, 3000 mg packed in PATZ 47435 / PET / ALU / PE sachets.

Samples are tested for appearance, colour, water, assay, dissolution, related substances and microbial contamination tests. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

Stability studies results presented comply with specifications. No significant changes have been observed.

Photostability studies performed in line with ICH Q1B demonstrated that finished product is photostable.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions: 'This medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions', as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable.

## 3.1.3.5. Post approval change management protocol(s)

Not applicable

## 3.1.3.6. Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## 3.1.4. Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality dossier for medicinal product Epixram cannot be recommended for approval at this stage of the procedure since 1 Major Objection remain unresolved. In addition, 12 other concerns identified in relation to the active substance and the finished product should be adequately resolved before a MA is granted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The provided Module 3 dossier is well-structured and divided into active substance and finished product parts, followed by Appendixes and Regional Information.

The active substance dossier is based on a CEP and complete assessment was performed by EDQM. Module 3.2.S is clearly written, however, still requires further amendments / explanations.

The finished product dossier cannot be considered approvable, as many issues have been raised in relation to development, manufacturing and quality control of the finished product. A MO has been raised in relation to discriminatory power of dissolution method.

## 3.1.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product is not acceptable at this stage, as one Major Objection and 12 of Other Concerns have been identified. From the quality point of view the dossier cannot be recommended for approval.

## 3.1.6. Recommendations for future quality development

Not applicable.

## 3.2. Non clinical aspects

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of levetiracetam are well known. As Levetiracetam is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional studies and further studies are not required. Overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate.

## 3.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant submitted Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted.

PEC has been estimated considering the default values stated by the EMA guideline.

The PECSURFACEWATER obtained is above the threshold stated by the EMA guideline (0.01 µg/L) suggesting that levetiracetam should enter in the Phase IIa to complete its Environmental Risk Assessment.

## Assessment on Levetiracetam increase in environmental exposure and consumption data

Regardless of the levetiracetam PECSURFACEWATER results in Phase I above the threshold of 0.01 µg/l and although no information of public domain from Phase IIA studies is available, an evaluation of the increase in levetiracetam environmental exposure has been performed.

According to EMA guideline, if the product application refers to Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC and the absence of increased environmental exposure can be justified, the ERA risk assessment should be stopped in Phase I. An increase in environmental exposure is generally expected when the patient population is increased as a consequence of 1) the addition of a new indication, 2) the inclusion of a new patient population or 3) an increase of the maximum recommended therapeutic dose; none of these assumptions are applicable in the case of Levetiracetam 1000 mg/ 1500 mg/ 2000 mg/ 3000 mg prolonged release granules as it is intended to be a hybrid medicinal product with the same dose,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapeutic indication and treatment duration as a number of medicinal products already marketed in the Member States included in this procedure, being the maximum daily dose in most cases 3000 mg. Therefore, although strengths of Neuraxpharm Levetiracetam 1000 mg/ 1500 mg/2000 mg/ 3000 mg prolonged release granules are higher than those approved for the reference product, the maximum recommended daily dose is the same.

Another difference between Levetiracetam prolonged release granules and the reference product is in the target population for the indication 'Partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy'. Whereas Levetiracetam prolonged release granules is indicated in adults and adolescents aged ≥12 years, the reference product is indicated in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age.

Therefore, Levetiracetam 1000 mg/ 1500 mg/ 2000 mg/ 3000 mg prolonged release granules is intended for substitution, in a mode similar to generic, of the already marketed medicinal products with the same pharmaceutical indication within a specific age range (adults and adolescents aged ≥12 years), and then no increase in environmental exposure is expected.

Levetiracetam is marketed in the Member States included in this procedure in several pharmaceutical forms mainly oral (tablets and oral solution) and solution for perfussion, which means that granules are only one source of the total levetiracetam environmental exposure.

Literature supports the absence of increase in environmental exposure after the marketing of compounds intended to partly substitute those already marketed. The penetration of a hybrid medicinal product onto a specific market may vary depending on several factors such as price, number and years in market of other generic/hybrid competitors and it is case-by-case specific. However, it is well accepted that generic medicinal products partly replace the active ingredient consumption for a specific therapeutic indication (Kaplan et al, 2013; Geitona et al, 2006; Dylst et al 2013, Dylst and Simoens, 2011). Then, a generic medicinal product does not generally lead to an increase of the treated population by itself and competes for the same market, which is consistent with the EMA Q&amp;A document. The more generic compounds are available in a local market the less sales rate correspond to each generic or for the innovator (Ventimiglia and Kalali, 2010; Puig-Junoy, 2010).

The same criteria applicable to generic drugs can be applied to the hybrid medicinal product Levetiracetam (1000 mg/ 1500 mg/ 2000 mg/ 3000 mg prolonged release granules) in terms of ERA as the therapeutic indication and MRDD are the same as those for the products already marketed and intends to partly substitute the consumption in adults and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years, excluding children and infants from 1 month of age.

## 3.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Epixram is considered approvable from a non-clinical point of view.

The non-clinical sections of the SmPC are acceptable.

## 3.2.3. Conclusion on non-clinical aspects

Epixram is approvable for a non-clinical point of view.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.3. Clinical aspects

## 3.3.1. Exemption

Dissolution studies for the Levetiracetam prolonged-release granules were performed in four different pHs (1.2, 4.5, 6.0 and 6.8) for the four strengths 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg (rotational speed conditions: 100 rpm). Such tests were also performed for the reference product Keppra® tablets.

Comparative dissolution studies have been further performed between the different strengths of Levetiracetam 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg prolonged-release granules to support the strength biowaiver proposal, whereas the respective dissolution profiles of the reference product Keppra IR® 500 mg film-coated tablet were also determined.

The in vitro dissolution tests in support of biowaiver of strengths further demonstrated similarity at different pH values (pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.0 and 6.8) between the additional strengths and the strength used for bioequivalence testing.

The dissolution profiles of the reference product Keppra® IR 500 mg film coated tablet were also determined in 900 ml of pH 1.2 (HCl 0.1 N), pH 4.5, pH 6.0 and pH 6.8, using basket at 100 rpm.

The Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr**) gives specific indications to evaluate the similarity of dissolution profiles. Following these indications, the dissolution similarity between levetiracetam prolonged-release granules 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg 3000 mg were assessed for the dissolution media HCl 0.1 N, acetate buffer pH 4.5 and phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and pH 6.8. In all media, the similarity was evaluated mathematically by calculating the similarity factor.

According to the results, it can be concluded that the dissolution profiles of the developed Levetiracetam prolonged-release granules' additional strengths of 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg are similar to the 1000 mg strength used in the bioequivalence study in all media tested, since the f2 statistic obtained is between 50 and 100 in pH 1.2 (HCl 0.1 N), acetate buffer pH 4.5, phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and phosphate buffer pH 6.8 media.

Taking all the above into consideration and based on the recommendations of the current EMA Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr**, EMA 2010), all respective strength biowaiver criteria are fulfilled and bioequivalence testing using the 1000 mg strength of Levetiracetam prolonged-release granules at a dose of 3000 mg is considered acceptable. Then, the results of the BE assessment can be extrapolated to the additional strengths. The dissolution of Keppra® IR 500 mg film coated tablet, in all the evaluated pH was greater than 85 % in 15 min, hence f2 values were not calculated.

## Assessor's comment

The applicant applies for the 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 2000mg and 3000mg strength of the prolongedrelease granules. In support the applicant performed a dissolution study (pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.0 and 6.8 using a basket apparatus with 100 rpm to compare the 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 2000mg and 3000mg strengths.

Based on the study results it could be concluded that additional bioequivalence testing in vivo can be waived since levetiracetam prolonged-release granules' additional strengths of 1500, 2000 and 3000 mg can be considered  similar to the 1000 mg strength used in the bioequivalence study in all media tested, as the calculated f2 was between 50 and 100 in pH 1.2 (HCl 0.1 N), acetate buffer pH 4.5, phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and phosphate buffer pH 6.8 media.

## 3.3.2. Clinical pharmacology

## 3.3.2.1. Pharmacokinetics

Study LVM-BEMD-09-LLV/20: Open label, two-period, two-way crossover, block-randomized, multiple dose bioequivalence study of Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolonged release granules in sachetes, 3000mg or 2000mg once per day (test formulation) vs. equal daily dose of the reference product (Keppra 500mg immediate release film-coated tablets) twice per day in healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions.

## · Study design

Open label, two-period, two-way crossover, block randomized, multiple dose bioequivalence pivotal study on healthy volunteers with administration under fasting conditions.

Hospitalization of subjects from the evening of Day -1 until 36 hours after the 5th morning dose (until the evening of Day 6) on each study period.

## Blinding

This was an open labeled but laboratory-blinded study. The randomization table was not made available to the personnel in charge of the determination of levetiracetam plasma levels until samples analyses was finalized.

The study medication, 5 consecutive once daily doses of TEST formulation, Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolonged-release granules in sachets, taken as 3000 mg dose in the morning (T) or 5 consecutive treatment days with REFERENCE formulation, Keppra 500 mg immediate release film-coated tablets, administered twice daily as 1500 mg (3 tablets) on each treatment day, in fasting conditions: the first dose in the morning and the second one in the evening (12 hours after the morning dose) (R) was administered in Days 1 to 5, under fasting conditions  by the Clinical Investigator.

The study products were administered orally a total volume of 240 mL of still bottled water at room temperature. The subjects kept a standing position during treatment intake.

After each administration, the Investigator or her designee performed a mouth and hands check in order to ensure that each dose has been taken entirely.

Selection of doses in the study: The selection of the study dosage (3000 mg/day levetiracetam) was done according to the recommended doses normally administered to patients (relating to the therapeutic range) stated in the SmPC. The strength tested in the bioequivalence study was in agreement to the regulatory authority requirements and allows obtaining measurable plasma concentrations after administration through the bioanalytical method.

The subjects were separated in dosing groups:

Dosing group 1 (sentinel group): was comprised of 4 subjects and was treated with daily doses of 3000 mg levetiracetam, for 5 consecutive days in each study period.

Dosing group 2: as the initial 4 subjects from the sentinel group have tolerated well the daily treatment with 3000 mg levetiracetam for 5 consecutive days, dosing group 2 was comprised of 8 subjects and the daily dose remained unchanged (3000 mg/day). There were 5 consecutive dosing days per study period.

Dosing groups 3 and 4: an additional number of 18 subjects were included in dosing group 3 and 12 subjects in dosing group 4 and the daily dose remained 3000 mg/day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also, an additional reserve blank sample of 20 mL was drawn pre-dose only on Period I.

Wash-out period

: 10 days.

Analytical method

: HPLC validated method, with MS/MS detection technique for levetiracetam.

Safety : Adverse events, clinical and laboratory screening and follow up examinations, vital signs, ECG, physical examination, drugs of abuse and breath alcohol test.

Duration of treatment: Five consecutive administration days per study period, with one daily dosing for the Test product and two daily dosing when the Reference product is administered: the first dose in the morning and the second one in the evening (12 hours after the morning dose).

## · Analytical methods

Development of an HPLC-MS/MS method to determine levetiracetam in plasma samples was performed and the report submitted as LVA-BE-LCMSMS-01/09.

The analytical method was used in the following studies: LVM-BEMD-09-LLV/20; LVM-BESD-10-LLV/21; LVM-BESD-12-LLV/22.

## Assessor's comments

The objective  of  the  analysis  presented  in  report  LVA-BE-LCMSMS-01/09  was  to  validate  the  HPLCMS/MS  method  for  determining  levetiracetam  levels  in  plasma  samples  using  heparin  as  an anticoagulant.

The LLOQ for levetiracetam was established at 200 ng/mL with a mean accuracy of 108.280%. The precision and accuracy across all QC concentrations were acceptable (between-run accuracy: 99.362102.619%; between-run precision: 2.629-5.243%; within-run accuracy: 97.582-100.616%; within-run precision:  1.687-5.374%). The method's selectivity, extraction recovery, and dilution integrity (1/4) were all assessed and found acceptable.

Stability conditions for levetiracetam storage were approved up to 6 hours at room temperature, up to 1 week at - 5 ºC, up to 7 weeks below - 20 ºC and up to 1 week at - 70 ºC, in plasma extracts up to 24 hours when kept at 10 ºC. Further, internal standard was found to be stable up to 16 hours when kept at room temperature and stock solutions of the analyte and internal standard were found to be stable for 6 hours at room temperature and up to one month. Levetiracetam was found to be stable after 3 freeze-thaw cycles.

Partial validation has been performed to 1) show levetiracetam stability in spiked plasma samples over an  extended  period  (up  to  4  months)  and  to  evaluate  the  levetiracetam  bio-conversion,  2)  express selectivity in presence of possible co-medication, (acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol and caffeine), and exclude  carryover  effect,  3)  express  selectivity  in  presence  of  possible  co-medication  (metamizole, ibuprofen,  salicylic  acid)  and  exclude  matrix  effect,  4)  to  show  the  effect  of  plasma  hemolysis  on levetiracetam detection, 5) to approve long-term stability of levetiracetam at -20 o C after 12 months.

bioequivalence.

The 90% confidence intervals of the ratio T/R for (AUC0-tau)ss and Cmin,ss were inside the accepted bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00% and for Cmax.ss was not inside the accepted bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00% thus permitting to conclude bioequivalence with respect to extent of absorption but not with respect to the rate of absorption.

Out of the 42 subjects completing the study and considered evaluable according to the provisions of the Study Protocol, there were 2 subjects (subjects no. 07 and 28) for which steady state could not be statistically confirmed. They were included in the data set for statistical analysis with their evaluable PK profiles for both study treatments. An analysis, with this subjects excluded, has been conducted and the 90 % confidence intervals for levetiracetam can be found in the table above. Full analysis is available as supportive information.

Study LVM-BESD-10-LLV/21 : Open label, two-period, two-way crossover, block-randomized single dose, dose proportionality study of Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolonged release granules in sachets, as 3000mg (3x1000 mg sachets) once per day (TEST 1 Formulation) vs. 10000mg (1x 1000mg sachet) once per day (TEST 2 Formulation) in healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions.

## Objectives:

The aim of the study was to demonstrate the dose proportionality between TEST1 formulation (3 x 1000 mg sachets, 3000 mg daily dose) and TEST2 formulation (1 x 1000 mg sachet, 1000 mg daily dose), both administered under fasting conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dose proportionality assessment was based on plasma drug levels of levetiracetam. As a secondary objective, the safety and tolerability of the formulations were assessed.

## Methods

## · Study design

An open label, two-period, two-way crossover, block randomized, single dose pivotal bioequivalence study on healthy adults male and female volunteers with administration under fasting conditions. Hospitalization of subjects from the evening of Day -1 (day before the dosing day) until 36 hours post administration on each study period.

## Blinding

This was an open labelled but laboratory-blinded study. The randomization table was not made available to the personnel in charge of the determination of levetiracetam plasma levels.

## Products administered:

On each study period the subjects received, as foreseen by the randomized table, either one dose of TEST1 formulation (Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolonged-release granules in sachets, 3 sachets taken simultaneously as 3000 mg overall dose in the morning, in fasting conditions) OR one dose of TEST2 formulation (Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolonged-release granules in sachets, 1 sachet taken as 1000 mg overall dose in the morning, in fasting conditions). The study products were administered orally with 240 ml of still bottled water at room temperature.

Blood samples were collected : before dose (0.0h) and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.50, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0, 24.0, 36.0 and 48.0 post dose after each administration (19 samples/ study period).

## Wash-out period: 7 days.

Analytical method: HPLC validated method, with MS/MS detection technique for levetiracetam Relevant pharmacokinetic parameters: dose-adjusted AUC0-t, Cmax and AUC0∞, Tmax, dose -adjusted AUC%extra (residual area), t1/2, MRT, Kel

Safety: Adverse events, clinical and laboratory screening and follow up examinations, vital signs, ECG, physical examination, pregnancy test, drugs of abuse, breath alcohol test and COVID-19 test.

## Determination of Sample Size

A total number of 32 healthy male and female volunteers were planned to be enrolled in the study.

The number of subjects enrolled has been considered adequate for the purposes of a comparative bioavailability study. In order to assure the dosing of 32 volunteers, 2 alternate volunteers had to remain at the study Center in the first period until the IMPs administration was finished. No alternate had to be enrolled and they left the study center after completion of dosing of Period I for both groups.

One subject was considered a drop-out in the present study: Subject No. 12 was a drop-out since 12 March 2022 due to personal reason and was lost to follow-up.

## Data Sets Analyzed

For the bioequivalence assessment, Levetiracetam pharmacokinetic data coming from 31 subjects out of 32 subjects enrolled in the study (subject study numbers 01-11 and 13-32) were statistically analysed (only 31 subjects completed the clinical part of the study). The descriptive statistics of demographic characteristics for the 32 subjects that were enrolled in Period I of the study has been performed. Screening and follow-up safety data were analyzed on 31 complete datasets.

## Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics

All volunteers were Caucasians. From the 32 subjects who were dosed in Period I, 15 were males and 17 were females (all included in the safety evaluation). From the 31 subjects that completed all study periods and were included in the statistical analysis for bioequivalence comparison, 14 were males and 17 were females.

## · Analytical methods

Please see description of the Study LVM-BESD-10-LLV/20.

## · Pharmacokinetic variables

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for levetiracetam based on dose adjusted plasma concentrations:

AUC0-t - area under the plasma concentration time curve from administration to last observed concentration over LLOQ, calculated by linear trapezoidal rule

Cmax - peak drug concentration, obtained directly from the data - without interpolation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tmax - time of the peak drug concentration, obtained directly from the data, without interpolation

AUC0-∞ (AUC from time 0 to infinite) -  area under the curve integrated from the plasma concentrations extrapolating the terminal elimination period

AUC%extra (residual area) - the ratio (AUC0-∞ - AUC0-t)/ AUC0∞ * 100 will be calculated using the previous data t1/2 - plasma half-life, calculated as 0.693/kel, where kel = elimination rate constant

MRT (mean residence time) -  calculated as AUMC0∞/ AUC0 -∞ where AUMC0 -∞ = area under the 1st moment curve

## Kel - elimination rate constant

## · Statistical methods

## Pharmacokinetic data:

-for dose-adjusted Cmax and AUC0-t: dose proportionality assessment will be done by means of an ANOVA (model: treatments, sequence, subject within sequence and periods of administration) and calculating the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio TEST1/TEST2 (equivalent to two one-sided t-test procedure) for lntransformed data. The same procedure was applied also for the additional (not considered for dose proportionality assessment) parameter dose-adjusted AUC0∞. The acceptance criteria for the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios TEST1/TEST2 were set to 80.00%-125.00% for dose-adjusted AUC0-t and Cmax for levetiracetam.

- for Tmax, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.

- Descriptive statistics were also done for all pharmacokinetic parameters: arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, SEM, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures.

- for clinical laboratory parameters at screening and follow-up: descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

- for the vital signs measured at screening, in the admission days, in the dosing days before administration and at follow-up: descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

All statistical calculations were performed using SAS version 9.4 software.

## Evaluation of additional pharmacokinetic parameters :

Tmax data for Levetiracetam T1 vs. T2 have been compared using a non-parametric statistical method: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. The limit of statistical significance was set at 0.05. The test was applied to untransformed data.

Descriptive statistic was also done (arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, standard error, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

For the remaining additional parameters AUC%extra (residual area), t1/2, MRT and Kel a simple descriptive statistic was performed (arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, standard error, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

Descriptive statistics was done for all pharmacokinetic parameters (arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, SEM, standard deviation, median, range).

## · Protocol Deviations

Some minor protocol deviations occurred in this study:

· Subject with study number 16 (screening number 28) had lower value than the lower limit for hemoglobin at screening examination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subject No. 12, who was a drop-out from 12 March 2022 due to personal reason and received study treatment only in period I, was lost to follow-up.
- Deviation from the theoretical sampling times outside the tolerance interval foreseen in the protocol

|   Subj. No. | Study period   | Blood sampling time   | Deviation outside tolerance window*   |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
|          27 | I              | 8h                    | + 3 minutes                           |
|          28 | I              | 8h                    | + 3 minutes                           |

Since the actual sampling times were used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters, this deviation from theoretical sampling time is irrelevant from a PK perspective. Protocol deviations did not affect the Study results.

# Median value: 8.000 h

The intra-subject variability coefficients registered for Levetiracetam, were 13.429% for AUC0-t and 8.205% for Cmax.

## Statistical analysis

## Evaluation of the period, sequence, subject within sequence and treatment influence on primary pharmacokinetics parameters

The ANOVA model implemented by GLM procedure in SAS for checking the sequence, period or treatment effects, showed no statistically significant influence on the primary pharmacokinetic parameters. Statistically significant subject within sequence effects were identified for both AUC0-t and Cmax. It is noteworthy to mention that subject effects are frequently observed due to inter-individual variations, without affecting the validity of the study.

IfthelowerandupperCL(ConfidenceIntervallimits）liewithinacceptedregulatorycriteriathenwemayconcludefor bioequivalence.

The 90% confidence intervals of the ratio T1/T2 for Cmax and for AUC0-t were completely inside the accepted bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%, thus permitting to conclude bioequivalence with respect to both extent of absorption and rate of absorption thus meeting the dose proportionality criteria.

## Evaluations of additional pharmacokinetic parameters

Tmax values have been compared separately for TEST1 vs. TEST2 using a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). The statistical test used identified no statistically significant difference between the formulations mentioned in regard to Tmax.

The statistical analysis did not show statistically significant differences between both treatment administered. It can be agreed that the dose proportionality criteria were met.

The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios T1/T2, for AUC0-t and Cmax were inside the accepted bioequivalence criteria of 80.00-125.00%, therefore it can be agreed that equivalence with respect to extent of absorption between the Test2 and the Test1 formulation was shown.

## Data Sets Analyzed

For the bioequivalence assessment, Levetiracetam pharmacokinetic data coming from 33 subjects out of 36 subjects enrolled in the study were statistically analysed (only 33 subjects completed the clinical part of the study). The descriptive statistics of demographic characteristics for the 36 subjects that were enrolled in the study has been performed. Screening and follow-up safety data were analyzed on 36 complete datasets.

## Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics

All volunteers were Caucasians. From the 36 subjects who were dosed in Period I, 18 were males and 18 were females (all included in the safety evaluation). From the 33 subjects that completed all study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

periods and were included in the statistical analysis for bioequivalence comparison, 17 were males and 16 were females.

## · Analytical methods

Please see description in Study LVM-BESD-10-LLV/20.

## · Pharmacokinetic variables

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for levetiracetam based on dose adjusted plasma concentrations:

AUC0-t - area under the plasma concentration time curve from administration to last observed concentration over LLOQ, calculated by linear trapezoidal rule

Cmax - peak drug concentration, obtained directly from the data - without interpolation

Tmax - time of the peak drug concentration, obtained directly from the data, without interpolation

AUC0-∞ (AUC from time 0 to infinite) -  area under the curve integrated from the plasma concentrations extrapolating the terminal elimination period

AUC%extra (residual area) - the ratio (AUC0-∞ - AUC0-t)/ AUC0∞ * 100 will be calculated using the previous data t1/2 - plasma half-life, calculated as 0.693/kel, where kel = elimination rate constant

MRT (mean residence time) -  calculated as AUMC0∞/ AUC0 -∞ where AUMC0 -∞ = area under the 1st moment curve

Kel - elimination rate constant

## · Statistical methods

Pharmacokinetic data:

- for AUC0-t: bioequivalence assessment was done by means of an ANOVA (model: treatments, sequence, subject within sequence and periods of administration) and calculating the 96.7% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio TFAST / RFAST and TFED / TFAST (equivalent to two one-sided t-test procedure) for ln-transformed data. The same procedure was applied also for the additional (not considered for bioequivalence assessment) parameters Cmax and AUC0∞. The acceptance criteria for the 96.7% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios TFAST / RFAST and TFED / TFAST were set to 80.00%-125.00% for AUC0-t for levetiracetam.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- for Tmax: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.
- Descriptive statistics were also done for all pharmacokinetic parameters: arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, SEM, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures.
- for clinical laboratory parameters at screening and follow-up: descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).
- for the vital signs measured at screening, in the admission days, in the dosing days before administration and at follow-up: descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

## Determination of Sample Size

A total number of 36 healthy male and female volunteers were planned to be enrolled in the study. The following were taken into consideration:

- a) the significance level (alpha) of 0.01667 (Bonferroni corrected for multiplicity)
- b) an a priori test power of 80 %
- c) intra-subject coefficients of variation of 15% for the primary pharmacokinetic metric AUC0-t
- d) expected geometric mean TEST/REFERENCE ratios of the primary pharmacokinetic metric of 90%
- e) the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for the 96.7% confidence interval of the geometric least square means ratios TEST/REFERENCE for the primary pharmacokinetic metrics
- f) a potential dropout/withdrawal rate of 10%.

In order to assure the dosing of 36 volunteers, 2 alternate volunteers had to remain at the study Center in the first period until the IMPs administration was finished. No alternate had to be enrolled and they left the study center after completion of dosing of Period I for both group.

## Protocol Deviations

Some minor protocol deviations occurred in this study:

- Subject No. 02, received the study treatment in period II and period III with the second group and had a longer wash-out period between period I and period II of 12 days instead of 10 days.
- Deviations from the theoretical sampling times outside the tolerance interval foreseen in the protocol:
- Since the actual sampling times were used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters, this deviation from theoretical sampling time is irrelevant from a PK perspective. The deviations were caused by the volunteers late arrival due to personal reasonsResults

The aim of the study was to evaluate the bioequivalence and to determine the food effect between a TEST formulation of levetiracetam 3x1000 mg prolonged-release granules in sachets administered under fasting conditions (TFAST) and under fed conditions (TFED) and the levetiracetam IR REFERENCE formulation 500 mg oral tablet administered as three tablets at once in the morning and three tablets at once in the evening under fasting conditions (RFAST). Only AUC0-t was considered a primary PK parameter. However, Cmax should also be considered a primary PK parameter. The 96.7% confidence intervals of the ratios TFAST/R, for AUC0-t were inside the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%. However, for Cmax the bioequivalence criteria were not met (The 96.7% confidence intervals 57.55 and 64.62). Therefore, the BE between the Tfast and the Reference product cannot be concluded.

The 96.7% confidence intervals of the ratios TFAST/TFED, for AUC0-t, Cmax and AUC 0-inf were inside the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%.

33 subjects received one dose of Levetiracetam 3x1000 mg prolonged-release granules in sachets TESTFAST formulation under fasting conditions, one dose of Levetiracetam 3x1000 mg prolongedrelease granules in sachets - TESTFED formulation and one dose of Keppra 3x500 mg IR film-coated tablets taken at once in the morning under fasting conditions and one dose of Keppra 3x500 mg IR film-coated tablets taken at once in the evening (12 hours after the morning dose) in three different occasions separated by washout periods of 10 days between two consecutive treatments. Subject no. 01 who was drop-out took only REFERENCE and TESTFED formulations.

Subject no. 09 who was drop-out took only TESTFAST formulation. Subject no. 15 who was drop-out took only TESTFED formulation.

## Adverse Events

In total 42 adverse events in 24 subjects were reported during the study. All AE were considered related to study treatment. There were no severe AE observed. The incidence of the AEs was comparable after administration of the Reference and the Test product under fasting conditions (38.09% vs 35.71%). The incidence of AE was lower after administration of the Test product under fed conditions (26.19%). No deaths occurred in the present study.

There were no new safety signals identified in the Study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

- Study design

Open label, two-period, two-way crossover, block randomized, multiple dose bioequivalence study on healthy volunteers with administration under fasting conditions. Hospitalization of subjects from the evening of Day -1 until 36 hours after the 5th dose (until the evening of Day 6) on each study period.

Products administered (T and R): On each study period the subjects received, as foreseen by the randomized table, either 5 consecutive once daily doses of TEST formulation (Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolonged-release granules in sachets, taken as 3000 mg dose in the morning, in fasting conditions) or 5 consecutive treatment days with REFERENCE formulation (Keppra 750 mg extended-release tablets, taken as 3000 mg dose in the morning, in fasting conditions).

Blood samples: Blood samples were collected at the following times (the theoretical collection times expressed in hours are relative to first dose administration on Day 1): 0 (pre-dose for the 1st daily dose), 47.917 (47h 55min, pre-dose for the 3rd daily dose), 71.917 (71h 55min, pre-dose for the 4th daily dose), 95.917 (95h 55min, pre-dose for the 5th daily dose) and at 96.5 (96h 30min), 97.0, 98.0, 99.0, 100.0, 101.0, 102.0, 103.0, 104.0, 105.0, 106.0, 107.0, 108.0, 109.0, 110.0, 111.0, 112.0, 116.0, 120.0, 132.0 and 144.0 hours after the 1st dose (25 samples of 5 mL/ study period). Also, an additional reserve blank sample of 20 mL was drawn pre-dose only on Period I.

Wash-out period: 11 days.

Safety: Adverse events, clinical and laboratory screening and follow up examinations, vital signs, ECG, physical examination, drugs of abuse and breath alcohol test.

## Reference product: KEPPRA XR 750 mg film-coated extended-release tablets

of UCB, Inc. Smyrna, GA 30080,

United States, Batch No. 916155, Expiry date: 05/2025, Country of purchase: United States. Administered orally, four tablets taken simultaneously once daily (for a 3000 mg daily dose), for five consecutive days with 240 ml of still bottled water at room temperature, under fasting conditions.

Duration of treatment: Five consecutive administration days per study period, with one daily dosing for the Test and Reference product.

- Population(s) studied

Healthy Caucasian male and female volunteers, aged at least 18 years but not older than 55 years, body mass index within 20.0-29.0 kg/m2

- Analytical methods

Development of an HPLC-MS/MS method to determine levetiracetam in plasma samples was performed and the report submitted as LVM-BE-LCMSMS-01/23 as a support of LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23 study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The LLOQ for levetiracetam was established at 200 ng/mL with a mean precision 4.340 and accuracy 100.777%.  The precision and accuracy across CAL concentrations were: between-run accuracy: 99.059-108.155%; between-run precision: 2.629- 3.798, (besides CAL3 with precision 28.182%); within-run accuracy: 97.814-101.295%; within-run precision: 0.871-1.359%). The method's selectivity, extraction recovery, and dilution integrity (1/4) were all assessed and found acceptable. Hemolysis of the plasma did not influenced levetiracetam analysis. No matrix and carryover effects were identified. Partial validation has been performed to show that levetiracetam is stable after storing for 2.5 months below -20 °C. All parameters recommended for analytical method validation were addressed (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) and met the acceptance criteria. Validation seems to be acceptable.

Analytical report for LEV determination in plasma samples supporting clinical study No. LVM-BEMD-14LLV/23 (LESVILEVE/23/BQ-2).

In total, 1476 human plasma samples with heparin as an anticoagulant were analyzed for levetiracetam using HPLC with MS/MS detection. Samples were collected from 11.05.2023 01.06.2023 and analyzed from 09.06.2023 - 20.06.2023. Thus, it can be concluded, that storage conditions are within the validated parameters. Total 29 runs were analyzed levetiracetam in human plasma. Incurred sample reproducibility was performed for 145 samples. The result were found to be repeatable for 98.621% of samples as repeated samples had relative differences not exceeding 20% compared to the first evaluation. ISR was acceptable. The accuracy and precisions for calibration standards and QC samples were acceptable. The levetiracetam concentration were within calibration range of the curve. Bioanalysis is acceptable.

## · Pharmacokinetic Variables

Pharmacokinetics: AUC(0-tau).ss, Cmax.ss, Ctau.ss, Cmin.ss (primary) and Tmax.ss and PTF (additional). The primary analysis was performed on all evaluable subjects that were dosed in both administration periods and completed the study, irrespective the steady-state evaluation criteria.

## · Statistical methods

For levetiracetam pharmacokinetic data the following procedures were used:

- for AUC(0-tau).ss, Cmax.ss, Ctau.ss, Cmin.ss: the analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used having sequence, period, subject within sequence and treatment as fixed effects for ln transformed data. The model was applied in order to build the classic (shortest) 90% confidence intervals for the least square geometric mean ratios. The acceptance criteria for the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios TEST/REFERENCE were set to 80.00%-125.00% for AUC(0-tau).ss, Cmax.ss, Ctau.ss, Cmin.ss for levetiracetam.

- for Tmax.ss, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.

- for PTF only descriptive statistic by treatment

- Descriptive statistics were also done for all pharmacokinetic parameters: arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, SEM, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures.

- for clinical laboratory parameters at screening and follow-up: descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

- for the vital signs measured at screening, in the admission days, in the dosing days before administration and at follow-up: descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, range and number of measures).

## Determination of Sample Size

A total number of 30 healthy male and female volunteers were enrolled in the study. The number of 30 subjects has been estimated considering the following:

a) the significance level (alpha) of 0.05

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- b) an a priori test power of 80%
- c) an intra-individual coefficient of variation for the primary PK metrics of up to 24%;
- d) the expected geometric mean ratio TEST/REFERENCE for the primary PK metrics between 0.95 - 1.05;
- e) the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80.00 - 125.00% for the 90% CIs of the of the geometric mean ratio TEST/REFERENCE for the primary PK metrics;
- f) a potential drop-out/ withdrawal rate of up to 15%.

## Results

## Disposition of Subjects

Out of the 44 volunteers screened, a total number of 30 were enrolled. Out of the 30 dosed volunteers, 29 volunteers completed the study but all 30 enrolled subjects underwent the follow-up examination. 25 subjects (for whom steady-state status was confirmed) were included in a statistical analysis. A separate analysis was performed for subjects that could be considered evaluable according to the provisions of the Study Protocol (the entire population, N=29) as supportive information. One subject was drop-out since 27 April 2023 due to personal reason and was excluded from statistical analysis.

The ANOVA model implemented by GLM procedure in SAS for checking the sequence and period effect, showed no statistically significant influence on the primary pharmacokinetic parameters. Statistically significant treatment effect was identified for Cmax.ss and for Ctau.ss.

Statistically significant subject within sequence fixed effects were identified for all primary parameters. It is noteworthy to mention that subject effects are frequently observed due to interindividual variations, without affecting the validity of the study. The treatment effects are further evaluated by the size of the confidence intervals.

The 90% confidence intervals of the ratio T/R for (AUC0-tau)ss, Cmax.ss and Cmin,ss were within the accepted bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%. However, the confidence interval for Ctau,ss was not within the accepted bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00% therefore bioequivalence cannot be concluded with respect to concentration at the end of dosing interval.

One possible reason for the Ctau,ss exceeding the limits may be explained by the shift in the reported time Tmax,ss which was higher for the TEST product with about 5 hours (median). This may be noticed on the plateau region of the TEST mean curve where relatively steady mean concentrations were reported between 4-12 hours (around Cmax at steady state) whereas the mean concentrations in the REFERENCE have started to decrease significantly following 5 hours since the last dose administration. In such a case, even though the elimination half-life were similar, the concentrations at the end of dosage interval will remain higher for the TEST product affecting the size of the Ctau,ss ratios.

Out of the 29 subjects completing the study and considered evaluable according to the provisions of the Study Protocol, there were 4 subjects (subjects no. 06, 08, 13 and 14) for which steady state could not be statistically confirmed.

They were included in the data set for statistical analysis with their evaluable PK profiles for both study treatments. An analysis, with these subjects excluded, has been conducted and the 90 % confidence intervals for levetiracetam can be found in the table above. Full analysis (N=29) is available as supportive information.

These were not serious adverse events. One adverse event reported was related to a clinical laboratory parameter found outside normal range at the follow-up examination in one subject who declined to return for additional measurements of this parameter. Lacking further information, the clinical significance of this value could not be assessed and also, the outcome and the duration were classified as 'Unknown'.

## Population PK

To assess the interchangeability between the reference IR and test PR formulation, PK parameters of levetiracetam as PR granules versus equal daily dose of the reference product (Keppra ®  IR film-coated tablets) were estimated based on data from the LVM-BEMD-09-LLV/20 study and using the industry standard (FDA Guidance for Industry, Population Pharmacokinetics, 1999) and validated Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modeling software package NONMEM ®  (version 7.3, Icon Plc, Dublin, Ireland). Data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exploration, statistical testing external to NONMEM ®  and graphics were performed using S-Plus ® (TIBCO Spotfile S+ v.8.2, MA, USA). An iterative process of model and data selection was used involving:

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Fit the data to different compartmental models
3. Select the model that best describes the observations
4. Goodness of fit diagnostics

Immediate release levetiracetam tablets (Keppra ® ) fit to a one compartment model with a single firstorder constant of absorption. The multiphasic absorption process for the PR formulation was described by two sequential absorption processes, i.e., a zero-order input followed by a first-order input. The final selection between alternative models was based on the inspection of residual plots and goodness of fit plots and a visual predictive check to ensure adequate model performance to predict the data.

Simulations of switching patients from the IR to the PR formulation (N=200) at low and high daily dose scenarios were performed using the population PK model in humans (Figure 1 and Figure 2 below).

Mean estimated PK parameters Cmin,ss and AUCtau at steady state were comparable after switching patients from the IR to PR both at the low (500 mg bid of Levetiracetam IR vs. 1000 mg Levetiracetam PR) and high doses assessed (1500 mg bid of Levetiracetam IR vs. 3000 mg Levetiracetam PR).

In contrast, Cmax,ss was lower after switching patients from the IR to PR both at the low (500 mg bid of Levetiracetam IR vs. 1000 mg Levetiracetam PR) and high doses evaluated (1500 mg bid of Levetiracetam IR vs. 3000 mg Levetiracetam PR). However, peak plasma concentration, Cmax, is not considered to be the main driver for the antiepileptic efficacy of levetiracetam and is more likely related to the appearance of adverse effects. On the contrary, a relatively controlled Cmin under therapeutic ranges should ensure non-inferiority in seizure control.

## PBPK analysis to estimate concentrations at site of action

The objective of the PBPK model developed was to predict levetiracetam concentrations at the site of action (CNS) after administration of Levetiracetam PR granules in comparison to different doses of the IR formulation (Keppra ® ). The methodology used in the analysis followed the guidelines recommended by the FDA and EMA for the format and content for a sponsor or applicant to submit PBPK analyses and exposure-response relationships (EMA 2018 (EMA/CHMP/458101/2016; FDA 2003; FDA, 2018) .

The compared formulations and dosing scenarios within this PBPK study were as follows:

- Levetiracetam 1000 mg PR granules (Test PR) once daily versus the reference product Keppra ® 500 mg twice daily.
- Levetiracetam 3000 mg PR granules (Test PR) once daily versus Keppra ®  1500 mg twice daily.

The development of the PBPK model for levetiracetam was based on the PBPK model published by Verscheijden et al. (2019) , as this latter model allows predicting the passage of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in humans as well as the CNS concentrations. The model from Verscheijden and colleagues has been validated for a variety of drugs, including paracetamol, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, naproxen and meropenem, and its code is readily available in the public domain.

The availability of levetiracetam concentration data in the CNS from brain microdialysis studies in rats facilitated the application of the PBPK model to the specific case of predicting CNS levetiracetam concentrations in humans. To that purpose, the first step was to translate the model to the rat species with the aim of predicting the BBB permeability and to then scale up this value to humans. The model capacity to predict the BBB permeability from rats to humans was verified via qualification of a platform model before the specific application to levetiracetam, using acetaminophen, oxycodone, lacosamide and diazepam as model drugs for passive transportation through the BBB. After that, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

model for levetiracetam was developed and applied according to the three stages briefly described below.

## Stage 1

This stage consisted in the application of the PBPK platform model to the rat species using data from a microdialysis study in this species from Tong and Patsalos (2001) in order to obtain a value for the permeability surface area product and for BBB permeability. In this study, plasma and extracellular fluid (ECF) data are available after the administration of levetiracetam at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg. The dose of 40 mg/kg was used initially to optimise the value of the permeability. For that, after developing the model for the plasma data, the value of the BBB permeability obtained for the 40 mg/kg was input into the model and used to predict the ECF or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations.

PK data obtained following the 80 mg/kg dose from the study of Tong and Patsalos (2001) was used for model verification together with CSF and serum concentration data in rats after administration of three different levetiracetam dose levels (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) from another published report (Doheny et al., 1999) .

## Stage 2

In this stage, the PBPK platform model was applied to the human data. The passage of the BBB was scaled using the surface area of the human BBB. Plasma concentrations from the multiple dose bioequivalence study LVM-BEMD-09-LLV/20 were used to develop the model. The ratios plasma:brain ECF (P:ECF) and plasma:CSF (P:CSF) of levetiracetam concentrations in humans were then verified using a paper from the literature (Rambeck et al., 2006) , which collected CNS samples in human patients with intractable epilepsy. The model was then applied to predict the CNS concentrations after levetiracetam IR and PR administration following the doing scenarios described below.

The PBPK model was used to investigate the parameters sensitivity and identify those parameters that could have a higher impact on levetiracetam CNS exposure. For Keppra ®  IR, the permeability surface area product was the driver for the passage to the BBB as it was the rate limiting process. While, in the case of the prolonged release granules formulation (Test PR), the passage to the BBB is highly dependent on the release rate from the formulation and thus, on the absorption rate, as it was the slower process.

## Stage 3

In this stage, the model was applied to evaluate potential formulation differences by comparing the percentage of virtual subjects maintaining steady state levels below the minimum ECF concentrations (Cmin,ss) of the reference product (Keppra ® ) at different dose levels. ECF concentrations of 1.7 µg/ml were defined as the Cmin,ss for the lower posology (i.e., 500 mg twice daily IR versus 1000 mg once daily for the PR) at steady state and 5.2 µg/ml as the Cmin,ss for the higher posology (i.e., 1500 mg twice daily IR vs. 3000 mg once daily for the PR) according to steady state PK data from the proprietary multiple-dose BE study.

Simulations were performed using the PBPK model in 200 virtual patients at the equivalent dosing regimens of 500 mg twice daily for the reference IR versus 1000 mg once daily for the test PR formulation as well as 1500 mg twice daily for the IR vs 3000 once daily for the PR formulation. The proportion of patients below the reference ECF concentrations Cmin,ss were then calculated at steady state for the three formulations after the two proposed equivalent dosing regimens.

## Results of the application of the PBPK model

For the rat model, all predicted AUC and Cmax values lied within the 1.25-fold range of their respective observed counterparts. Therefore, the rat model provides a consistent representation of levetiracetam systemic and CNS exposure following administration in rats and thus can be applied to properly predict brain ECF and CSF concentrations over time.

In humans, the PBPK model appropriately predicted the mean plasma concentrations for Keppra ®  IR (reference formulation) and also captured the variability in the data very well as can be seen in Table 7. Across the population being investigated, the simulations represented the data adequately with prediction errors in the PK metrics (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) of 1%, 18.5% and 4%, respectively, for the reference product.

Table 7: Plasma exposure metrics for reference product (Keppra ®  IR)

| PK Parameters          | Mean Predicted (n=200)   | Mean Observed (n=40)   | Ratio (Pred/Obs)       |
|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| IR - Reference Product | IR - Reference Product   | IR - Reference Product | IR - Reference Product |

In addition, the model appropriately predicted the mean plasma concentrations for the PR formulation (Test formulation) and captures the variability in the data very well. Across the population being investigated, the simulations represented the data adequately with prediction errors in the PK metrics (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) of 4%, 6% and 0.25%, respectively, for the test product.

| C avg,ss (mg/L)            | 31.84                      | 29.89                      | 1.07                       |

The developed PBPK model predicted comparable daily CSF and ECF levels from the steady state plasma concentration profiles for the two products supporting exposure similarity at the site of action (CNS) between the two formulations despite of a different release rate. Furthermore, the PBPK modelbased approach reveals that the differences in daily plasma profile shapes associated to the PR formulation do not translate to lower concentrations at the site of action at the end of the dosing interval. Therefore, a higher risk of breakthrough seizures associated with transitional periods of low concentrations can be excluded.

All the simulated exposure metrics at steady state in the ECF showed a relative difference (%diff) lower than 5.6%.

The prediction of ECF and CSF concentrations were verified with data from patients with either complex partial seizures or secondarily generalized seizures published by Rambeck et al. (2006) . During the neurosurgical intervention, a microdialysis study was performed and samples were taken from serum,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CSF and ECF. Due to limited information related with the dosing regimen of these subjects only the reported values of the plasma:brain extracellular fluid (P:ECF) and plasma cerebrospinal fluid (P:CSF) were considered for the verification of the PBPK model predictions in the CNS. Considering that levetiracetam crosses the BBB via passive transport, no non-linearity issues are expected due to differences in the drug posology between studies. The mean reported values of P:CSF and P:ECF ratios were 1.14 and 4.37, respectively (Rambeck et al., 2006) . The model predicted values are reported in the table below.

Table 10: Model Predicted Ratio of Plasma, CSF and ECF

|              |   Plasma |    CSF |    ECF |   Ratio Plasma:CSF |   Ratio Plasma:ECF |
|--------------|----------|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| AUC (mg×h/L) |    796.6 | 760.75 | 192.43 |               1.05 |               4.14 |

The percentage of subjects falling below the reference concentration of Cminss = 1.7 mg/L after administration of 500 mg b.i.d of Keppra ®  IR and 1000 mg o.d. of test PR in a 24-h interval at steady state was 60% for Keppra ®  IR and 48% for the Test PR. The same proportion of subjects falling below the reference concentration of Cmin,ss = 5.2 mg/L is observed after administration of 1500 mg b.i.d of Keppra ®  IR and 3000 mg o.d. of test PR in line with the linear pharmacokinetic of levetiracetam in the CNS due to the lack of active processes involved in the transport of levetiracetam through the BBB.

Based on the simulations, similar efficacy profile is expected between the reference (Keppra ®  IR) and the test PR. The results of the PBPK model show that differences in plasma concentration profile shape do not impact the effectiveness of levetiracetam. The predictions of brain concentrations provide further evidence on the exposure resemblance at the CNS level between the test and reference formulations. Therefore, as the profile shapes and concentrations at the site of action are similar, equivalence in terms of efficacy is supported between levetiracetam IR (Keppra ® ) to Levetiracetam PR.

## Study LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4

The RWE LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4 study was designed as a non-interventional, retrospective, cohort study in new users of Levetiracetam IR or XR using a large national private claim registry linked to EMR information from the US. The overall research question of this study was whether effectiveness and safety outcomes associated with the use of oral prolonged release formulations of levetiracetam were not inferior compared to oral levetiracetam IR among epileptic subjects with POS, with or without secondary generalisation, using real-world data from claims and EMR in the US.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication between new users of oral levetiracetam XR and new users of oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice.

The secondary objectives were:

- To  compare  the  subject  retention,  calculated  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  without  treatment discontinuation after 48 weeks (key secondary objective).
- To compare the percentage of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 16 and 48 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication.
- To compare the time to first seizure, defined as first seizure occurring after treatment initiation within 48 weeks.
- To compare the time to treatment failure, calculated as the number of days on treatment until switch to/or addition of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
- To compare the incidence of major epilepsy-related events, defined as the utilisation of ambulance, emergency department or inpatient hospital routes of care with a primary diagnosis of epilepsy for the recorded event.
- To describe the incidence of AEs of special interest (AESIs).
- To compare all-cause healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) during the follow-up period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These objectives were investigated by comparing subjects initiating treatment with oral levetiracetam XR to subjects initiating treatment with oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice.

## Study population

The study population included subjects from 12 years of age with at least one diagnosis code for epilepsy who initiated oral Levetiracetam XR or oral Levetiracetam IR during the study period between September 2015 and April 2022. Main exclusion criteria were missing or ambiguous data on age or gender or having at least one diagnosis code for a generalised seizure type and no codes for a partial (focal) seizure type during the entire study period for the subject (i.e., from 1 year before the index date until last data available in the data source).

## Effectiveness outcomes

The primary effectiveness outcome of the study was the proportion of subjects free from seizures for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication. It was assessed within the first 24 weeks of continuous treatment at a stable dose (i.e., initial weeks of potential dose tapering/adaptation were not taken into account).

The study secondary effectiveness outcomes were:

- Proportion of subjects without treatment discontinuation after 48 weeks (key secondary outcome).
- Proportion of subjects free from seizures for at least 16 and 48 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication.
- Time to first  seizure,  calculated  as  days  from  the  index  date  to  the  first  seizure  occurring  after treatment initiation within 48 weeks.
- Time to treatment failure (i.e., number of days on treatment until switch to/or addition of other AEDs).
- Reasons for treatment discontinuation, in subjects where this information was directly available or could be reasonably inferred (e.g., using medical notes or coincidence between major events and treatment end date), were also described as percentage of subjects who dropped off treatment for safety/tolerance  reasons,  lack  of  efficacy,  need  for  another  AED,  change  in  the  formulation  of levetiracetam (i.e., switch from IR to XR or vice versa ), change in titration or other/unknown reasons.
- Incidence rate of major epilepsy-related events, defined as the utilisation of ambulance, emergency department or inpatient hospital routes of care with a primary diagnosis of epilepsy for the recorded event.
- Secondary  safety  outcomes  included  incidence  rate  of  AESIs  (allergic  reaction,  hyponatraemia, psychiatric  AEs,  including  suicidality,  cognition-related  AEs,  hepatic  toxicity,  cardiac  rhythm  and conduction disorders, hypertension).

A total of 20,000 subjects from the reviewed databases were diagnosed with epilepsy and had at least one filled prescription of oral levetiracetam XR or oral levetiracetam IR between the 1 st  of September 2015 and the 30 th  of April 2022 and were assessed for eligibility. After applying selection criteria and performing the propensity score matching, the groups for the comparison of levetiracetam XR with levetiracetam IR were reduced to 1,172 subjects in each cohort. From them, 6 subjects did not contribute to the outcome analysis due to not having follow-up time. Thus, the final number of subjects evaluable for outcomes analyses were 1,171 and 1,167 for the levetiracetam IR and levetiracetam XR cohorts, respectively. Switchers from Levetiracetam IR to Levetiracetam XR were considered in sensitivity analyses as expected to be one representative population according to clinical practice.

For the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint, a total of 428 and 442 subjects in the Levetiracetam XR and Levetiracetam IR cohorts, respectively, were evaluable (i.e., they had at least 24 weeks of follow-up while receiving a stable dose of medication or they had less than 24 weeks of follow-up but at least one seizure occurring while receiving a stable dose of medication). The proportion of subjects free from seizures for at least 24 weeks while receiving stable dose of medication was higher for subjects who received Levetiracetam XR (49.8%) than levetiracetam IR (34.6%) (adjusted odds ratio: 1.84; 95%CI: 1.36, 2.52). The non-inferiority margin was set to -6.9%, corresponding to the 20% of the rate in the control group (i.e., rate of the levetiracetam IR cohort,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

34.6%). The lower bound of the 95%CI of the adj. percentage difference in the proportion of subjects free from seizures for at least 24 week was above this non-inferiority margin (i.e., 7.2% was above 6.9%), meeting the criterion for non-inferiority of levetiracetam XR compared with levetiracetam IR (Figure 3).

Consequently, the results of this main analysis confirmed the non-inferiority of Levetiracetam XR in comparison to Levetiracetam IR with regards to seizure freedom for 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication.

Figure 3. Adjusted difference between Levetiracetam XR and Levetiracetam IR in the Proportion of Subjects Free from Seizures for at Least 24 Weeks

The assessment of the other outcomes of this study showed the non-inferiority of Levetiracetam XR once daily in comparison to Levetiracetam IR twice daily with regards to seizure freedom after 16, 24 and 48 weeks of receiving stable dose of medication, as well as with regards to treatment maintenance. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in time to treatment failure (defined as addition or dose increase in other AEDs) between subjects treated with levetiracetam XR and levetiracetam IR (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.80, 1.23). However, when focusing on exposure to levetiracetam and subject retention at 48 weeks, results confirm that subjects on levetiracetam XR remained under treatment for a longer time than those with levetiracetam IR. On the other hand, Levetiracetam XR showed a safety profile in line with Levetiracetam IR. The incidence rate and the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one psychiatric AE (including suicidality), cognition related-AE, cardiac rhythm/conduction disorder and hypertension were statistically significant lower in subjects being treated with Levetiracetam XR than in subjects receiving Levetiracetam IR. Incidence rates for allergic reactions, hyponatremia and hepatic toxicity were similar between Levetiracetam XR and Levetiracetam IR cohorts, with no statistically significant differences in the risk of experiencing at least one event.

The results obtained in the comparison of levetiracetam XR versus levetiracetam IR use for the primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes confirmed the non-inferiority of levetiracetam XR compared with levetiracetam IR and are in line with data from literature where levetiracetam XR has been shown to provide, at equal daily doses, very similar safety and tolerability profiles as adjunctive treatment in patients with partial epilepsy and comparable efficacy in reducing the frequency of POS when used as add-on therapy in adult patients with uncontrolled epilepsy in a 12-week treatment, double-blind, double-dummy randomised, paralleled, multicentre trial (Wu et al., 2018) . In this study, the median POS frequency per week was 0.3 (95% CI: 1.3-4.8) in the levetiracetam XR and 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-4.3) in the levetiracetam IR group, with both groups having the same responder rate (58.6%), and a higher rate of seizure freedom over the treatment period noted in the XR group (27.6% versus 13.8%, respectively). Similar efficacy and safety conclusions had been observed in conversion studies to XR formulations of AEDs with similar mechanism of action (Ramey et al., 2014) , as well as highlighted in recently published guidelines to clinicians (Gidal et al., 2021) .

In the present study, levetiracetam XR use was associated with a statistically significant higher proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks than levetiracetam IR (49.8% versus 34.6%; adjusted odds ratio: 1.84; 95%CI: 1.36, 2.52). At weeks 16 and 48, statistically significant results regarding seizure freedom were also observed in favour or levetiracetam XR. Moreover, levetiracetam XR was associated with a statistically significant delay in the occurrence of the first seizure after treatment initiation. An improvement in seizure control has already been observed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with the use of other XR medications compared with their respective IR formulations, such as lamotrigine ( Ramey et al., 2014 ) and topiramate ( Chung 2015; O'Neal et al., 2018 ). The use of modified release formulations with a longer half-life that allow a once-daily regimen has several advantages over IR formulations with shorter half-life that require multiple dosing. The XR formulations present a simplified dosing regimen, a reduced medication burden and a decreased peakseizure control with an improved overall safety profile ( Gidal et al., 2021 ).

to-trough fluctuation in serum drug concentration, thereby increasing adherence and enhancing overall Regarding safety results, the four most frequent AESIs in our study population, including psychiatric AEs, cognition-related AEs, cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders and hypertension had a statistically significant lower incidence in the Levetiracetam XR cohort than in the levetiracetam IR cohort. Incidence rates for allergic reactions, hyponatremia and hepatic toxicity were similar between Levetiracetam XR and Levetiracetam IR cohorts, with no statistically significant differences in the risk of experiencing at least one event. These results are in line with better tolerability profiles observed with other long-acting AED (Leppik and Hoving, 2013; Miller et al., 2004; Uthman 2014) . However, the results of the conducted analysis are not considered relevant for demonstration of the bridge between the test product and the reference product, since no results of studies conducted with the test product were included in the analysis. Moreover, in the light of the results of Study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23,  the results of the real-word evidence study LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4, aimed to compare the proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication between new users of oral levetiracetam XR and new users of oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice in the US appear not relevant for the current MAA. Since the Test product was not shown to be bioequivalent to the US comparator, extrapolation of the efficacy and safety data from the US comparator is not possible.

## 3.3.2.2. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

## 3.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

To support this MAA, the applicant initially submitted results of three PK studies, PBPK model and noninterventional RWE study. In addition, to address the MO raised at Day 120, the applicant provided results of the study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23.

Two PK studies (Study LVM-BEMD-09-LLV20 and Study LVM-BESD-12-LLV/22) were aimed to assess bioequivalence  of  the  test  prolonged-release  granules  in  sachets  formulation  versus  the  reference product Keppra immediate release film-coated tablets.

Study LESVILEVE/21/BQ-1 (LVM-BEMD-09-LLV/20) was an open-label, two-period, two-way crossover, multiple-dose BE study of levetiracetam 1000 mg XR granules in sachets, administered at the dose of 3000 mg once per day (test formulation) versus equal daily dose of the reference product (Keppra 500 mg IR film-coated tablets) administered twice daily in healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions. The overall design of the study is supported.

The wash out period of 10 days appears acceptable, taking into account that the Test product T1/2 is 7±1 hours. The selection of the primary PK parameters (AUC(0τ), Cmax.ss, Cmin.ss, and secondary PK parameters (Cav.ss, Tmax.ss and PTF) is supported.

The 90% CI of the relative mean plasma levetiracetam AUCt and Cmin ss of test to reference products were between 80.00 and 125.00%.

However, the 90% CI of plasma Levetiracetam Cmax of test to reference products were outside 80.00 and 125.00% (65.32%  - 73.43%) (part of the MO).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study LESVILEVE/22/BQ-1 (LVM-BESD-12-LLV/22) was an open-label, three-period, crossover, randomised, single-dose study to assess bioequivalence and food effect of Levetiracetam 3×1000 mg XR granules in sachets once daily administered in fasting and fed conditions versus equal dose of the Reference  product  (Keppra  500  mg  ×  3  IR  film-coated  tablets)  twice  daily  administered  in  fasting conditions to healthy male and female volunteers. In line with the Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms EMA/CHMP/EWP/280/96 Rev1, if there is no clinically relevant food effect on the immediate-release formulation, a 2-way cross-over study comparing the modified release formulation in fasted and fed states could be sufficient (given that other studies compare the modified release and the immediate release formulations under fasting conditions).

Only AUC0-t was considered a primary PK parameter, which is not considered appropriate. In line with Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms EMA/CHMP/EWP/280/96 Rev1, Cmax should be included for the assessment of food effects . However, the confidence interval is presented for Cmax and the results are within the conventional acceptance range.

The 96.7% confidence intervals of the ratios TFAST/R, for AUC0-t were inside the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%. However, for Cmax the bioequivalence criteria were not met (The 96.7% confidence intervals 57.55 and 64.62). Therefore, the BE between the Tfast and the Reference product cannot be concluded (part of the MO). The 96.7% confidence intervals of the ratios TFAST/TFED, for AUC0-t, Cmax and AUC 0-inf were inside the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%.

Study LESVILEVE/21/BQ-6 (LVM-BESD-10-LLV/21) was an open-label, two-period, two-way, crossover, randomised, single-dose, dose-proportionality study of Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolongedrelease granules in sachets, as 3,000 mg (3×1000 mg sachets) once per day (test-1 formulation) versus 1000 mg (1×1000 mg sachet) once per day (test-2 formulation) in healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions. The overall design of the study is supported. the time points for blood samples collection are considered acceptable. The wash out period of 10 days appears acceptable, taking into account that the Test product T1/2 is 7±1 hours. The selection of the PK parameters is appropriate.

The statistical analysis did not show statistically significant differences between both treatment administered.  The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios T1/T2, for AUC0-t and Cmax were inside the accepted bioequivalence criteria of 80.00-125.00%, therefore it can be agreed that equivalence with respect to extent of absorption between the Test2 and the Test1 formulation was shown. It can be agreed that the dose proportionality criteria were met.

Study  LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23  was  an  open  label,  two-period,  two-way  crossover,  block  randomized, multiple  dose  bioequivalence  study  LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23  in  healthy  volunteers  with  administration under  fasting  conditions  aimed  to  demonstrate  the  steady  state  bioequivalence  between  the  TEST prolonged-release granules in sachets formulation and a corresponding dose of REFERENCE film-coated extended-release  tablets,  both  administered  under  fasting  conditions  for  5  consecutive  days.  As  a comparator in the Study, KEPPRA XR 750 mg film-coated extended-release tablets of UCB (Country of purchase: United States) was used. Since there is no approved levetiracetam-containing modified release formulation in the EU that could be used as a comparator and since the study is a supportive study, the use of the US comparator can be considered acceptable. The overall design of the study is supported. The wash out period of 11 days appears acceptable, taking into account that the Test product T1/2 is 7±1 hours. The selection of the primary PK parameters (AUC(0τ), Cmax.ss, Cmin.ss, is supported. The 90% CI of the relative mean plasma levetiracetam AUCt, Cmax.ss,  and Cmin ss of test to reference products were between 80.00 and 125.00%.

However, with respect to concentration at the end of dosing interval after the last administered dose, Ctau.ss, the TEST/REFERENCE geometric mean ratio was not within the acceptance criteria of 80.00125.00% after multiple dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since Cτau,ss (concentration at the end of the dosing interval at steady state) is a primary PK parameter it cannot be agreed that the BE between the Test product and the US comparator was shown.

To predict cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extracellular fluid (ECF) levetiracetam levels following administration of levetiracetam prolonged-release granules in comparison with Keppra IR, the applicant developed PBPK model. The results from Studies LVM-BESD-10-LLV/21 and LVM-BESD-12LLV/22 were used for the external verification of the model.

It is noted that the model has structural limitations because it does not include the brain mass compartmentalisation (it does not separate intracellular and extracellular space). The brain mass has been modelled as a single compartment (as acknowledged by Verscheijden et al). In fact, ECF does not belong to the brain mass, and is modelled as an independent compartment. This structure is not physiologically correct.

Moreover, since data on concentrations of levetiracetam in the CSF was taken from Rambeck at al (2006), which included only 3 patients treated with levetiracetam, predictions based on the model cannot be considered informative and the predictive power of the model is uncertain. The assumptions that lower proportion of subjects treated with the test PR product will achieve Cminss concentrations compared to subjects treated with the reference product should therefore be treated with caution. However, given the limitations of the model and specificity of the target indication, predictions based on the model are not considered adequate to replace the therapeutic equivalence study (part of the MO).

No efficacy/safety studies have been conducted by the applicant. Instead, the applicant performed the real-word evidence study LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4, aimed to compare the proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication between new users of oral levetiracetam XR and new users of oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice. The study was non-interventional, retrospective, cohort study in new users of Levetiracetam IR or XR using a large national private claim registry from the US.

In total 428 and 442 subjects in the Levetiracetam XR and Levetiracetam IR cohorts, respectively, were included in the analysis.

The proportion of subjects free from seizures for at least 24 weeks while receiving stable dose of medication was higher for subjects who received Levetiracetam XR (49.8%) than levetiracetam IR (34.6%). Non-inferiority of levetiracetam XR compared with levetiracetam IR was shown. However, the submitted RWD study evaluating non-inferiority between Keppra XR and Keppra IR is at best supportive but cannot be considered a replacement for a therapeutic equivalence study. Bias cannot be excluded as the study is non-randomized and lacks assay sensitivity. Moreover, it is questioned whether the appropriate patient population was included in the study. A large proportion of patients in both cohorts (around 30%) used concomitant anti-seizure medication (ASM) of which the impact on Keppra efficacy cannot be excluded. In addition, not every patient was ASM treatment naïve, between 30-40% of patients in the cohorts had at least one prior ASM. It is known that the chance of having drug resistant seizures increases with each previous ASM used, and it cannot be excluded that this could have impacted the results on the primary endpoint seizure freedom. Moreover, the results of the conducted analysis are not considered relevant for demonstration of the bridge between the test product and the reference product, since no data from patients treated with the test product were included in the analysis. Furthermore, since in the Study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23 the concentration at the end of dosing interval at steady state Ctau,ss ratio T/R, was not within the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%, the bioequivalence cannot be concluded to be shown for the Test product and the US comparator (part of the MO).

Moreover, in line with the information provided in the Clinical Overview and results of the study LVMBEMD-14-LLV/23, Tmax of Keppra XR and Levetiracetam PR differed by approximately 5 h, while the maximum Tmax was equal for both products. However, the minimum Tmax of Keppra XR and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Levetiracetam PR differs by approximately 3h. It should be noted that in the completed study LESVILEVE/23/BQ-2 the concentration at the end of the dosing interval, Ctau (i.e. Ctrough), the TEST/REFERENCE geometric mean ratio was not within the acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00%. There were no severe AE observed in the conducted PK studies. The incidence of the AEs was generally comparable after administration of the Reference and the Test product.

In Study LVM-BESD-12-LLV/22, the incidence of AE was lower after administration of the Test product under fed conditions (26.19%) compared to fasted conditions (35.71%). There were no new safety signals identified in the conducted PK studies.

## 3.3.8. Conclusions on clinical aspects

## Due to following reasons, Epixram is not considered bioequivalent with Keppra:

For a hybrid application with a new pharmaceutical form with a prolonged release profile and change in strength, as a principle, comparative clinical efficacy and safety data are needed in addition to PK data. The waiver of the therapeutic equivalence study is not possible even if the assessment of concentration-effect relationship indicates that there is a well-defined relationship between plasma concentration(s) of the active substance /active metabolite(s) and clinical response because the three possibilities to waive the therapeutic equivalence studies given in section 5.2.1. of the Guideline on the Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Evaluation of Modified Release Dosage Forms are not applicable since:

- The shape of the profiles are not mimicked, which is a requirement for the first scenario.
- Bioequivalence between the reference and the test product has not been shown in terms of Cmax,ss for the second scenario
- It cannot be excluded that differences in the PK between the reference and the test products will not influence the safety and efficacy for the third scenario.

The results of the RWE study are not considered relevant for demonstration of the bridge between the test product and the reference product, since no data from patients treated with the test product were included in the study. Furthermore, the results of Study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23 showed that the TEST/REFERENCE Ctau.ss, geometric mean ratio was not within the acceptance criteria of 80.00125.00% after multiple dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The submitted RWD study evaluating non-inferiority between Keppra XR and Keppra IR is at best supportive but cannot be considered a replacement for a therapeutic equivalence study. Bias cannot be excluded as the study is non-randomized and lacks assay sensitivity. Moreover, it is questioned whether the appropriate patient population was included in the study. A large proportion of patients in both cohorts (around 30%) used concomitant anti-seizure medication (ASM) of which the impact on Keppra efficacy cannot be excluded. In addition, not every patient was ASM treatment naïve, between 30-40% of patients in the cohorts had at least one prior ASM. It is known that the chance of having drug resistant seizures increases with each previous ASM used, and it cannot be excluded that this could have impacted the results on the primary endpoint seizure freedom.

In the light of  the results of Study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23,  the results of the real-word evidence study LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4, aimed to compare the proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication between new users of oral levetiracetam XR and new users of oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice in the US appear not relevant for the current MAA. Predictions based on the PBPK model are not considered adequate to replace the therapeutic equivalence study.

In conclusion the therapeutic equivalence study cannot be waived and the applied product is not approvable.

## 4. Benefit/risk assessment

This application concerns a hybrid version of Levetiracetam, film-coated tablets. The reference product Keppra is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Keppra is also indicated as adjunctive therapy · in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy. · in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. · in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.

No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature has been provided.

The PK studies form the pivotal basis for this MAA.

Two PK studies (Study LVM-BEMD-09-LLV20 and Study LVM-BESD-12-LLV/22) were aimed to assess bioequivalence of the test prolonged-release granules in sachets formulation versus the reference product Keppra immediate release film-coated tablets.

Study LESVILEVE/21/BQ-1 (LVM-BEMD-09-LLV/20) was an open-label, two-period, two-way crossover, multiple-dose BE study of levetiracetam 1000 mg XR granules in sachets, administered at the dose of 3000 mg once per day (test formulation) versus equal daily dose of the reference product (Keppra 500

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg IR film-coated tablets) administered twice daily in healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions. The overall design of the study is supported.

The wash out period of 10 days appears acceptable, taking into account that the Test product T1/2 is 7±1 hours. The selection of the primary PK parameters (AUC(0τ), Cmax.ss, Cmin.ss, and secondary PK parameters (Cav.ss, Tmax.ss and PTF) is supported.

The 90% CI of the relative mean plasma levetiracetam AUCt and Cmin ss of test to reference products were between 80.00 and 125.00%.

However, the 90% CI of plasma Levetiracetam Cmax of test to reference products were outside 80.00 and 125.00% (65.32%  - 73.43%) .

Study LESVILEVE/22/BQ-1 (LVM-BESD-12-LLV/22) was an open-label, three-period, crossover, randomised, single-dose study to assess bioequivalence and food effect of Levetiracetam 3×1000 mg XR granules in sachets once daily administered in fasting and fed conditions versus equal dose of the Reference  product  (Keppra  500  mg  ×  3  IR  film-coated  tablets)  twice  daily  administered  in  fasting conditions  to  healthy  male  and  female  volunteers.  However,  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms EMA/CHMP/EWP/280/96 Rev1, if there is no clinically relevant food effect on the immediate-release formulation, a 2-way cross-over study comparing the modified release formulation in fasted and fed states could be sufficient (given that other  studies  compare  the  modified  release  and  the  immediate  release  formulations  under  fasting conditions).

Only AUC0-t was considered a primary PK parameter, which is not considered appropriate. In line with Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms EMA/CHMP/EWP/280/96 Rev1, Cmax should be included for the assessment of food effects . However, the confidence interval was provided for Cmax and AUC 0-inf, the results were within the conventional acceptance range.

The 96.7% confidence intervals of the ratios TFAST/R, for AUC0-t were inside the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%. However, for Cmax the bioequivalence criteria were not met (The 96.7% confidence intervals 57.55 and 64.62). Therefore, the BE between the Tfast and the Reference product cannot be concluded . The 96.7% confidence intervals of the ratios TFAST/TFED, for AUC0-t, Cmax and AUC 0-inf were inside the bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%.

The applicant conducted multiple dose bioequivalence study LESVILEVE/23/BQ-2) of the proposed product Levetiracetam PR 1000 mg (Test) versus Keppra XR 750 mg (approved in the US).

Study  LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23  was  an  open  label,  two-period,  two-way  crossover,  block  randomized, multiple  dose  bioequivalence  study  LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23  in  healthy  volunteers  with  administration under  fasting  conditions  aimed  to  demonstrate  the  steady  state  bioequivalence  between  the  TEST prolonged-release granules in sachets formulation and a corresponding dose of REFERENCE film-coated extended-release  tablets,  both  administered  under  fasting  conditions  for  5  consecutive  days.  As  a comparator in the Study, KEPPRA XR 750 mg film-coated extended-release tablets of UCB (Country of purchase: United States) was used. Since there is no approved levetiracetam-containing modified release formulation in the EU that could be used as a comparator and since the study is a supportive study, the use of the US comparator can be considered acceptable. The overall design of the study is considered acceptable.

The wash out period of 11 days appears acceptable, taking into account that the Test product T1/2 is 7±1 hours. The selection of the primary PK parameters (AUC(0τ), Cmax.ss, Cmin.ss, is supported.

The 90% CI of the relative mean plasma levetiracetam AUCt, Cmax.ss,  and Cmin ss of test to reference products were between 80.00 and 125.00%.

However, with respect to concentration at the end of dosing interval after the last administered dose, Ctau.ss, the TEST/REFERENCE geometric mean ratio was not within the acceptance criteria of 80.00125.00% after multiple dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since Cτau,ss (concentration at the end of the dosing interval at steady state) is a primary PK parameter it cannot be agreed that the BE between the Test product and the US comparator was shown.

Study LESVILEVE/21/BQ-6 (LVM-BESD-10-LLV/21) was an open-label, two-period, two-way, crossover, randomised, single-dose, dose-proportionality study of Levetiracetam 1000 mg prolongedrelease granules in sachets, as 3,000 mg (3×1000 mg sachets) once per day (test-1 formulation) versus 1000 mg (1×1000 mg sachet) once per day (test-2 formulation) in healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions. The overall design of the study is supported. the time points for blood samples collection are considered acceptable. The wash out period of 10 days appears acceptable, taking into account that the Test product T1/2 is 7±1 hours. The selection of the PK parameters is appropriate.

The statistical analysis did not show statistically significant differences between both treatment administered.  The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios T1/T2, for AUC0-t and Cmax were inside the accepted bioequivalence criteria of 80.00-125.00%, therefore it can be agreed that equivalence with respect to extent of absorption between the Test2 and the Test1 formulation was shown. It can be agreed that the dose proportionality criteria were met.

To  predict  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  and  extracellular  fluid  (ECF)  levetiracetam  levels  following administration of levetiracetam prolonged-release granules in comparison with Keppra IR, the applicant developed PBPK model.

Moreover, since data on concentrations of levetiracetam in the CSF was taken from Rambeck at al (2006), which included only 3 patients treated with levetiracetam, predictions based on the model cannot be considered  informative.  The  assumptions  that  lower  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  the  test  PR product will achieve Cminss concentrations compared to subjects treated with the reference product should therefore be treated with caution. However, given the limitations of the model and specificity of the  target  indication,  predictions  based  on  the  model  are  not  considered  adequate  to  replace  the therapeutic equivalence study .

The applicant performed a RWE study LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4, aimed to compare the proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication between new users of oral levetiracetam XR and new users of oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice. The study was non-interventional, retrospective, cohort study in new users of Levetiracetam IR or XR using a large national private claim registry from the US.

In total 428 and 442 subjects in the Levetiracetam XR and Levetiracetam IR cohorts, respectively, were included in the analysis.

The proportion of subjects free from seizures for at least 24 weeks while receiving stable dose of medication was higher for subjects who received Levetiracetam XR (49.8%) than levetiracetam IR (34.6%). Non-inferiority of levetiracetam XR compared with levetiracetam IR was shown. The submitted RWD study evaluating non-inferiority between Keppra XR and Keppra IR is at best supportive but cannot be considered a replacement for a therapeutic equivalence study. Bias cannot be excluded as the study is non-randomized and lacks assay sensitivity. Moreover, it is questioned whether the appropriate patient population was included in the study. A large proportion of patients in both cohorts (around 30%) used concomitant anti-seizure medication (ASM) of which the impact on Keppra efficacy cannot be excluded. In addition, not every patient was ASM treatment naïve, between 30-40% of patients in the cohorts had at least one prior ASM. It is known that the chance of having drug resistant seizures increases with each previous ASM used, and it cannot be excluded that this could have impacted the results on the primary endpoint seizure freedom.

However, the results of the conducted analysis are not considered relevant for demonstration of the bridge between the test product and the reference product, since no results of studies conducted with the test product were included in the analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Furthermore, the results of Study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23 showed that the TEST/REFERENCE Ctau.ss, geometric mean ratio was not within the acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00% after multiple dosing. In the light of  the results of Study LVM-BEMD-14-LLV/23,  the results of the real-word evidence study LESVILEVE/22/RWE-4, aimed to compare the proportion of subjects who were seizure-free for at least 24 weeks while receiving a stable dose of medication between new users of oral levetiracetam XR and new users of oral levetiracetam IR in the clinical practice in the US appear not relevant for the current MAA. Predictions based on the PBPK model are not considered adequate to replace the therapeutic equivalence study .

From the quality point of view products cannot be recommended for approval.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product therefore cannot be concluded.

The application contains inadequate quality and clinical data and the bioequivalence has not been shown.

## 4.1. Conclusions

The overall benefit /risk balance of Epixram is considered negative, given the major objection raised in the list of questions.
