## Annex IV

Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for mirabegron, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The MAH has cumulatively reviewed the cases of confusional state using the HLGT Deliria (including confusion). From the 138 cases identified, none was considered as an index case by the MAH and only 55 cases were classified as informative. From these informative cases, only 14 cases were described in detail as they are considered as informative positive cases. From these cases, in 9 patients the confusion symptoms started within one week of start of mirabegron and all of them had positive dechallenge. They recovered in a short time after mirabegron discontinuation. There was also a case with confirmed positive rechallenge of symptoms after starting mirabegron three times. In addition, among the cases considered by the MAH as informative confounded cases there is also a case with confusion aggravated 2 days after initiating mirabegron and in the medical history a similar episode occurred 2 months prior the report after initiating mirabegron.

Cumulatively and according to the summary tabulations, confusional state was the most frequently serious Psychiatric disorder reported (37 serious reports, 18.5% of the serious psychiatric disorder reported.

In summary, in spite that the majority of the patients had pre-existing medical conditions or concomitant medications that may cause confusional state, there are some cases with a narrow time to onset and a positive dechallenge and two cases with positive rechallenge (one confirmed and other suspected). Most of patients are elderly patients according to the information included in the EVDAs but there are also non-elderly patients. In addition, the use of mirabegron in elderly patients is high according to the data from postmarketing exposure presented in the PSUR.

Therefore, after reviewing all data, confusional state should be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC with frequency unknown.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mirabegron the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing mirabegron is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
