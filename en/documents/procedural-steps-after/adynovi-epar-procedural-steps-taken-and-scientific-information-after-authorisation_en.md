1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0035 | Update of sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add a new warning on anaphylactic reaction and to add 'anaphylactic reaction' to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency 'Not Known', based on the cumulative review of MAH global database and literature search. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 13/07/2023 | SmPC and PL | Cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported, therefore sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated to add a new warning on anaphylactic reaction and to add 'anaphylactic reaction' to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency 'Not Known'.
