## STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

## For procedures finalised after 1 June 2004 please refer to module 8B .

- On 12 November 1999 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 relating to a change in the  address  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder.  The  EMEA  approved  the  variation  on 9 December 1999, which required amendments to be incorporated in the relevant sections of the Commission Decision. The European Commission amended the Decision on 22 February 2000.

Subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications agreed upon are summarised in the table below:
