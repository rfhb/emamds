1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

These data support persisting immune memory induced infants primed with Hexyon/Hexacima. Immunogenicity data in HIV-exposed infants (infected uninfected) showed that Hexyon//Hexacima is immunogenic in the potentially immunodeficient population of HIV-exposed infants whatever their HIV status at birth. No specific safety concern was observed in this population. Inclusion of syncope within the precautions for use. Syncope can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope.

| WS/1792/G   | This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. C.I.4 (type II) - Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to revise the warning regarding preterm infants and to add new information on immunogenicity in preterm infants and in infants born from women vaccinated during pregnancy, based on the final results from study A3L00053-EXT; this is an observational cohort study conducted by the Center for the Evaluation of Vaccination in Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Institute of University of Antwerp with DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T vaccine, aimed to describe the concentrations of IgG against the different antigens. The RMP version 12.0 has been submitted an updated accordingly, following revision 2 with consequential update to the safety concerns. C.I.z (type IB) - Update of sections 2 and 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add warning for excipients with known effect: phenylalanine, potassium and sodium, according to the European guideline 'Excipients in the labeling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use SANTE-2017-11668\". The package leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH/SOH took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5   | 24/09/2020   | 24/06/2021   | SmPC and PL   | Based on data generated from study A3L00053-EXT, immunogenicity data have been made available for 105 preterm infants (born after a gestation period of 28 to 36 weeks). These data support the use of Hexacima/Hexaxim/Hexyon in preterm infants. As expected in preterm infants, lower immune response has been observed for some antigens, when indirectly compared to term infants, although seroprotective levels have been achieved. Immune responses to Hexacima/Hexaxim/Hexyon in infants born (preterm and term) to women vaccinated with Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis) during pregnancy were included in the product information. The rate of seroprotected prior to their own primary vaccination is lower in the pre-term born. Nevertheless, a benefit of the maternal immunization is seen for both groups. The data shown for the Pertussis antigens show that the maternal immunization results in higher geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in the infants regardless of pre-term status and after the primary and booster immunization all GMCs are similar regardless of vaccination group. The fold increases due to primary immunization are lower in the maternally-vaccinated. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.   |
