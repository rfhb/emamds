## 1. Introduction

On 27 April 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from the current phase 3 to phase 4 based on the emergence of a new Influenza A (H1N1) virus and its widespread presence in Mexico and the United States of America (USA).

On  29  April  2009,  the  WHO  raised  the  level  of  influenza  pandemic  alert  to  phase  5,  based  on assessment  of  available  information  and  following  expert  consultations.  Advice  was  given  to  all countries to activate their pandemic preparedness plans and to monitor unusual outbreaks of influenzalike illness and severe pneumonia.

There are presently four antiviral drugs available for treatment of influenza and these belong to two classes: adamantane inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir  and  zanamivir).  The  novel  influenza  virus  detected  in  humans  has  been  found  to  be resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. Laboratory testing however indicated that these viruses may be susceptible to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).

Tamiflu is a centrally authorised product with a marketing authorisation valid since 20 June 2002.

Tamiflu is indicated in the treatment of influenza in patients 6 months of age and older who present with symptoms typical of influenza, when influenza virus is circulating in the community. It is also indicated in post-exposure prevention in individuals one year of age or older. Tamiflu is approved as hard capsules and powder for oral suspension.

Considering the spread of the novel Influenza A (H1N1) and the potential clinical need in case of a declared pandemic, the EMEA requested that dosing recommendations in children younger than 1 year of  age  for  oseltamivir  should  be  investigated,  therefore,  the  Executive  Director  of  the  European Medicines Agency (EMEA) presented on 30 April 2009, a request for a CHMP opinion under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

In May 2009 the European Medicines Agency has given guidance on the use of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) in children under one year of age in the case of a declared influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.

- During an officially declared influenza A/H1N1 pandemic the benefits of the use of Tamiflu outweigh its risks in the treatment of children under the age of one year.
-  The recommended dosage for treatment is 2 to 3 mg per kg body weight twice daily.
-  The recommended dosage for prophylaxis is 2 to 3mg per kg body weight once daily and should not exceed 10 days.
- Hospitalisation of children below 1 year of age in case of an Influenza A/H1N1 pandemic, including  the  children  below  3  months  of  age,  is  recommended  by  the  CHMP.  However  it should follow recommendations from Member States depending on the local situation.

Assessment of the data can be found in the assessment report of the Article 5(3) procedure published on the EMEA website at the following addresses:

http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/tamiflu/28766209en.pdf http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/tamiflu/32609509en.pdf

During its plenary meeting held in June 2009, the CHMP was of the opinion that Tamiflu Product Information must be updated to include recommendations on the use of Tamiflu for children below 1 year of age in the context of the Novel Influenza (H1N1) pandemic.

During its plenary meeting held in July 2009, the type II variation II/68 was concluded and the CHMP adopted  a  positive  opinion  to  extend  the  therapeutic  indication  of  Tamiflu  to  include  treatment  of children between 6 and 12 months of age in case of a pandemic influenza.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On the 11th of September 2009, the MAH submitted this type II variation II/70 in order to extend the therapeutic indication of Tamiflu to include treatment of children between 1 and 6 months of age and prophylaxis of children less than 1 year of age in the case of a pandemic influenza.

It should be noted that in parallel the MAH submitted a type II variation II/71 to include in the Product Information (PI)  some  recommendations on the  preparation  of  an extemporaneous  solution  and  the dosing for children less than 1 year of age.

## 2. Clinical aspects

## 2.1. Rationale for the proposed change

During its plenary meeting held in June 2009, the CHMP was of the opinion that Tamiflu Product Information must be updated to include recommendations on the use of Tamiflu for children below 1 year of age in the context of the Novel Influenza (H1N1) pandemic.

Reference  is  made  to  the  Article  45  (1)  of  the  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council, stating:

'1. By 26 January 2008, any paediatric studies already completed, by the date of entry into force, in respect of products authorised in the Community shall be submitted by the marketing authorisation holder for assessment to the competent authority.

The competent authority may update the summary of product characteristics and package leaflet, and may vary the marketing authorisation accordingly. Competent authorities shall exchange information regarding the studies submitted and, as appropriate, their implications for any marketing authorisations concerned.

The Agency shall coordinate the exchange of information'.

In  the  view  of  the  EMEA,  the  following  2  studies  fall  under  the  scope  of  the  above  mentioned provision as they were already completed by its date of entry into force:

- Final Summary of Japanese Retrospective Surveillance and Prospective Studies in Children Less than 1 Year of Age,
- The Completed NIH Chart Review - CASG 113 FSR submitted by the MAH in June 2007.

On the 17 th of  July 2009, the MAH submitted this type II variation II/68 in order to extend the use of Tamiflu to the treatment of children between 6 and 12 months of age in case of pandemic influenza. The MAH provided on dosing recommendations down to 6 months of age, taking into account the large safety data from prospective and retrospective surveillance studies in 2477 children &lt; 1 year of age of which more than 300 are 3-6 months of age and 100 are &lt; 3 months. The MAH had access to limited pharmacokinetic data from an ongoing NIH study ' A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic and Safety Evaluation of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for the Treatment of Children Less Than 24 Months of Age with  Confirmed Influenza Infection '  (CASG 114), which indicated that using a dose of 3 mg/kg in children  6-12  months  of  age  provides  plasma  drug  exposures  in  the  majority  of  patients  similar  or higher to those shown to be clinically efficacious in older children and adults.

However, at that time the MAH had access to insufficient PK data in children &lt; 6 months of age to provide dosing recommendations in this very young population.

In  the  frame  of  the  adoption  of  the  CHMP  opinion  for  the  variation  II/68,  the  MAH  committed  to submit a type II variation by 1st September 2009 to update the Product Information in line with the analysis of the available PK data including recommendations for 0-6 months of age and to propose a wording for the use of Tamiflu in post-exposure prophylaxis in children, which is the scope of this type II variation II/70.

## 2.2. Analysis of data submitted

## ¾ Extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  to  include  treatment  of  children  between 0 and 6 months of age in case of pandemic influenza

## - Description of the data

In the frame of the type II variation II/68 to extend the therapeutic indication to include treatment of children between 6 and 12 months of age in case of pandemic influenza adopted by the CHMP in July 2009 (Commission Decision granted 9 September 2009), the MAH submitted additional information on  the  ongoing  NIH  study  CASG  114.  This  study  CASG  114  is  a  prospective,  age-stratified pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and safety evaluation of oseltamivir therapy in children less than 24  months  of  age  with  confirmed  influenza  infection.  Between  48  and  108  infants  with  confirmed influenza are expected to be enrolled into one of five age cohorts see table 1 below.

The table 1 - Enrolment scheme.

| Cohort   | Age          | EnrollmentSequence                                                                | Anticipated Sample Size   | Anticipated Starting Dose                         |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| I        | 12-23 Months | May be enrolled at any time during the study.                                     | 12                        | 30 mg bid                                         |
| II       | 9-11 Months  | Will be enrolled at the beginning of the study and simultaneously with Cohort II. | 9-24                      | 3 mg/kg bid                                       |
| III      | 6-8 Months   | Will be enrolled at the beginning of the study and simultaneously with Cohort II. | 9-24                      | 3 mg/kg bid                                       |
| IV       | 3-5 Months   | Sequential: will be enrolled after CohortsII-III are enrolled.                    | 9-24                      | 3 mg/kg bid or dose determined by previous cohort |
| V        | 0-2 Months   | Sequential: will be enrolled after cohort IV is enrolled.                         | 9-24                      | 3 mg/kg bid or dose determined by previous cohort |

At  study  onset,  Cohort  II  and  III  are  enrolled  simultaneously.  Cohorts  IV  and  V  are  enrolled sequentially by decreasing age groups, predicated upon the pharmacokinetic and safety data from the preceding  cohort.  The  oldest  cohort  (Cohort  I),  which  falls  under  the  marketed  indication  for oseltamivir treatment, is enrolled at any time during the study.

The  scientific discussion linked to  this  procedure  can  be  found  on  the  EMEA  website  at: http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/tamiflu/tamiflu-H-402-II-68-AR.pdf

To support this type II variation II/70, the MAH provided interim pharmacokinetic data on children aged 0 to 6 months from the NIH study CASG 114, which are the basis on this assessment.

## - Results and Discussion

CASG  114  is  an  AUC  (Area  Under  Curve)-targeted,  age  de-escalation  study  to  determine  the appropriate  dose  of  oseltamivir  (OST)  in  paediatric  patients  with  confirmed  influenza  infection. Oseltamivir is converted to a carboxylate metabolite which is the active substance against influenza.

## The AUC target was defined as follows:

The  estimated  mean  AUC12  of  oseltamivir  carboxylate  (CBX)  is  3800  ng.h/mL  in  older  children. Assuming a 30% coefficient of variation, the standard deviation is 1140 ng.h/mL. The lower target limit  for  the  CBX  AUC12  target  is  2660  ng.h/mL  (3800  ng.h/mL  minus  1  standard  deviation)  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cohorts  II-V.  The  target  upper  limit  for  the  CBX  AUC12  is  7,700  ng.h/mL  (2  standard  deviations above the mean exposure following a regimen of 150 mg bid). Cohorts II-V began dosing at 3.0 mg/kg bid (not to exceed 30 mg bid). OST and CBX concentrations for intensive pharmacokinetic analysis are obtained at steady-state on Day 3 of treatment at 0 hr (baseline), 1 hr, 2-3 hr, 5-7 hr, and 10-12 hr.

OST  and  CBX  concentration-time  results  were  analyzed  in  real-time  using  non-compartmental methods. Modification of this dose is predicated upon data from the first 3 to 9 subjects enrolled in each  of  these  cohorts.  All  dose  adjustments  are  made  in  a  linear  fashion.  In  addition,  they  are examining the AUCmetabolite:AUCparent ratio for Cmax and AUC12 across each cohort.

The cohorts with any subjects enrolled to date and the dose administered are summarized below. Because this study is adaptive by design, a second dosage is being evaluated in the 9-11 months age group.

| Cohort   | Age (months)   | Dose Administered   |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1        | 12-23          | 30 mg bid           |
| 2        | 9-11           | 3.0 mg/kg bid       |
| 2B       | 9-11           | 3.5 mg/kg bid       |
| 3        | 6-8            | 3.0 mg/kg bid       |
| 4        | 3-5            | 3.0 mg/kg bid       |
| 5        | 0-2            | 3.0 mg/kg bid       |

As already discussed in the frame of the type II variation II/68 for the children 6-12 months of age these new interim data show that the 3mg/kg twice daily dose will lead to a higher mean exposure to oseltamivir  in  children  as  compared  to  adults  with  75mg  x  2.  The reason to  have  this  higher  mean exposure has been that children need a higher exposure since they have a higher viral load and viral shedding of longer duration. This could also help avoiding the emergence of resistance to the drug by under  dosing,  which  supports  what  has  been  described  in  Japan  where  high  incidence  of  resistant influenza strains seems to concur with low oseltamivir doses. Taking all these data into consideration the  CHMP confirmed  the dose  to  be  3 mg/kg  for  the  treatment  of  children  6-12  months  of  age  as adopted in the July 2009 CHMP (Type II variation II/68).

Additionally according to a recent publication 1 , the liver enzyme needed to metabolize oseltamivir are present  at  birth  and  are  maturing  with  time  and  that  the  liver  function  in  the  lower  age  groups  is sufficiently developed to metabolize oseltamivir, but excretion of the metabolite via kidneys is lower than in the older age groups. This would correlate well with the fact that the estimated Glomerular Filtration  Rate (GFR) of the neonates 0-1 month of age is less than half of that of the infants 6-12 months of age according to the Schwartz formula 2 .  The GFR increases significantly during the first 6 months of age.

The current data on children 0-6 months of age is very limited. The exposure to the active metabolite concentration seems to increase especially in the youngest age group (0-2 months). The median values of  exposure  are  higher  than  the  target  concentration of  3800  ng.h/ml,  although  it  is  still  within  the target range defined by the study protocol. The current protocol of CASG 114 does provide an option to reduce the dose in case the AUC of the metabolite is above 7700 ng.h/ml in 3 or more patients out of 9. As this limit has not been reached in the lower age groups, no exposure data is available on lower doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since the exposure of the metabolite clearly increases in the youngest age groups and no safety data has been provided the CHMP could not agree with the initial suggestion of the MAH that the dose would be 3 mg/kg for children between 1 and 6 months of age. At least in the youngest age group (0-3 months of age) a lower than 3 mg/kg dosing should be considered.  The MAH was therefore requested to carry out a modeling of the exposure with a lower dose than 3 mg/kg for this age group.

During  the  Oral  explanation,  which  took  place  on  22  September  2009,  the  MAH  presented  a pharmacokinetic  model  to  simulate  different  doses  and  dosing  schedules  in  an  attempt  to  derive relationships between drug exposure and response to treatment.

The model proposed by the MAH was developed using NONMEM, a non linear mix effect program. Data were available from 1 month of age. A sample of 100 subjects was taken from a model of 1000 profiles to produce box-whisker plots.

The aim was to compare a predicted OC (Oseltamivir Carboxylate) exposure in children less than 3 months of age with different doses with the OC exposure in adults dosed at 75 mg. The modelling data presented by the MAH supports the use of a dose between 2 and 3 mg for children less than 1 year of age as recommended by the CHMP in May 2009.

For children aged 1-3 months, it was shown that a dose of 2,5mg/kg provides the same exposure than in the older cohorts and a higher exposure than in adults dosed at 75 mg, which should suppress the higher viral load in children than in adults. The lower dose 2 mg/kg for this age range would give a lower exposure than the exposure in adult at a dose of 75 mg.

For children less than 1 month of age, the MAH did not provide any additional pharmacokinetic data or safety data at the time of the submission of this type II variation II/70. No modeling data for this age range was presented by the MAH during the oral explanation. However the CHMP discussed the urgent need for instructions to be given to health care professional in order to treat children younger than  1  month  of  age  to  face  this  current  pandemic  situation.  Due  to  the  non  maturity  of  the  renal system leading to a lower clearance than older children, one could assume that the exposure to OC in children  younger  than  1  month  of  age  dosed  with  2  mg/kg  should  be  higher  than  the  exposure  in children aged 1-3 months dosed with 2 mg/kg and therefore slightly higher than the OC exposure in adults dosed at 75 mg. Therefore, in the light of the very limited data provided so far for this very young  population  and  balancing  the  urgency  of  the  current  situation  with  a  prudent  approach,  the CHMP concluded that a lower dose of 2 mg/kg should be recommended to treat children less than 1 month of age in the context of an pandemic influenza only.

The CHMP also concluded that the MAH should submit any updated data/information they receive concerning this ongoing NIH study CASG 114.

The  safety  data  recently  provided  in  connection  with  the  Drug  Safety  Report  (DSR)  No.1034695 focusing on the safety of oseltamivir in children less than one year of age included only data from children  6-8  months  of  age  or  older  from  this  study.  These  data  including  pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data available in children less than 1 year old were presented in this DSR submitted in August 2009. In September 2009 the CHMP concluded the following:

- Overall  clinical  data  in  4565  children  less  than  one  year  of  age  were  presented  from  the following sources: In the Japanese prospective Interventional Study, among the study subjects, who  experienced  ADRs,  one  third  of  patients  experienced  neuropsychiatric  events.  And  in many cases, causal association with oseltamivir cannot be ruled out. This is a major concern and evaluating and diagnosing neuropsychiatric events in infants is a challenge for especially parents or guardians and also for HCPs in clinical settings. In most situation, the ADRs mostly expressed as crying/screaming by infants, cannot be interpreted correctly.
- In  the  Japanese  prospective  surveillance  study,  subjects  in  the  Tamiflu  arm  tended  to  have higher incidence of ADRs compared to other treatment and non treatment groups. Among the age groups, 3-6 months old age children frequently experienced ADRs (10.24%).The children below 6 months old may be vulnerable to the side effects and risk  management should be focussed in this age group of children.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- German retrospective study in hospitalised infants is the only European study available so far in infants. In this study, more than half of the patients (96/157) experienced GI events such as vomiting and diarrhoea. The number of infants experienced other ADRs was not presented.
- The CASG114 study was designed for sequential enrolment. The efficacy and safety, mainly efficacy may vary since the virulence of influenza strains may change with season. No new safety  concerns  were  identified  based  on  the  data  presented  for  the  children  older  than  6 months old. No nervous SOC ADRs have been reported. Only one psychiatric ADR, 'Staring' was  reported  in  cohort  III.  Safety  results  from  children  less  than  6  months  old  are  to  be submitted when available.
- In  the  USA  claims  data  base,  no  significant  increase  in  ADRs  in  the  oseltamivir  arm  was reported.  No  ADRs related to neuropsychiatric disorders was presented in the report.  This data  base  used  ICD  9  codes,  which  may  slightly  differ  from  the  MeDRA  code  in  some situations. Extrapolation to whole population is restricted since this data included only insured patients.

Based  on  the  safety  data  presented  by  Roche  in  this  report,  children  less  than  one  year appeared to tolerate oseltamivir at the doses used between 3.0-4.3 mg/kg/day.

Until the cut off date of 29 April 2009, 78 cases including 118 events were retrieved from the MAH's safety database. Of the reported events, a 59/118 were unexpected and 50/118 events were serious. One  (1)  fatal  case  was  reported.  Based  on  the  information  available,  there  seems  to  be  no  causal relationship  of  oseltamivir  in  this  fatal  case.  Emergence  of  viral  resistance  was  not  reported. Convulsion  was  frequently  reported  in  infants  and  is  a  listed  event  in  the  PI.  Among  unexpected events, hypothermia was frequently reported. One (1) serious and 5 non serious events of hypothermia were retrieved. In the above unexpected cases, due to the temporal relationship the causal relationship of  oseltamivir  cannot  be  completely  excluded.  The  unexpected  events  such  as  hypothermia, encephalitis/encephalopathy, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and liver disorder should be kept under close surveillance in infants as well as in children and adults. The MAH should also closely monitor convulsion in infants.

Based  on  the  data  presented  in  this  DSR,  no  new  safety  signal  was  identified  in  this  population. Although most of the ADRs from the ADVENT data base appeared to be unexpected in an infant, however, overall, ADR pattern was consistent with the established safety profile in children aged &gt;1 year age.

Prior  to  the  CHMP  September  2009  plenary  meeting,  the  MAH  provided  some  additional  safety information on the children 0-2 months of age: out of 6 neonates 3 had diarrhea, there was one report on irritability, one of insomnia and one report on rash.  These adverse events are in the known safety profile of Tamiflu.

Based on the data presented there is no safety restriction in the use of oseltamivir in infants during the pandemic situation.

## - CHMP conclusion

Considering all the data submitted and assessed so far for children below 6 months of age, the CHMP concluded that the following should apply during an influenza pandemic outbreak:

- A dose of 3mg/kg should be given bid during 5 days to treat children between 3 and 6 months of age,

- A dose of 2,5mg/kg should be given bid during 5 days to treat children between 1 and 3 months of age,

- A dose of 2mg/kg should be given bid during 5 days to treat children less than 1 month of age.

The CHMP also concluded that the MAH should submit regular updated data from this ongoing NIH study CASG 114.

It  should be noted that the MAH submitted the protocol of the study WP22849 currently titled: ' An open  label,  prospective,  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  and  safety  evaluation  of  oseltamivir (Tamiflu)  in  the  treatment  of  infants  up  to  12  months  of  age  with  laboratory  confirmed  influenza infection ', which we refer as 'EU PK study was submitted to CHMP and PDCO and the assessment was performed in August 2009. This protocol proposed the use of a 3mg/kg for all children below 1 year of age, however in the light of the dosing recommendations adopted by the CHMP through this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

type II variation II/70, the MAH will update the protocol and submit very rapidly the CTAs (Clinical Trials Authorisations) to the selected EU countries. This EU PK study in planned to start in November 2009. The MAH should commit to submit regular update on the progress of this study.

## ¾ Extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  to  include  post-exposure  prophylaxis  for children less than 1 year of age in case of pandemic influenza

Throughout the approved age range for Tamiflu, effective prophylaxis against clinical influenza has been shown to be achieved using a single dose equivalent to one of the two doses administered for bid treatment regimen during 10 days instead of 5 days for the treatment.

Protection is then maintained as long as the drug is administered, but ceases as soon as prophylaxis is stopped.

There is currently no scientific rationale to suggest that the validity of this approach in 1 year old and older that have been in contact with a circulating influenza strain should be different in neonates and infants.

Therefore, in line with this approach and with the extension of indication to include treatment less than 1 year old children, the CHMP is of the view that for post-exposure prophylaxis during an influenza pandemic outbreak:

- A dose of 3mg/kg should be given once a day during 10 days to children between 3 and 6 months of age,

- A dose of 2,5mg/kg should be given once a day during 10 days to children between 1 and 3 months of age,

- A dose of 2mg/kg should be given once a day during 10 days to children less than 1 month of age.

It should be noted that due to time constraints, the MAH was not in a position to submit an updated version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  in  line  with  this  extension  of  indication.  The  CHMP agreed that this updated RMP would be submitted at a later stage for assessment.

## 2.3. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

The CHMP concluded that overall data suggest that the benefit of using Tamiflu for the treatment and post exposure prophylaxis of children between 0 and 6 months of age outweighs the risk in the context of a pandemic influenza.

The  CHMP  decided  that  Tamiflu  Product  Information  should  therefore  be  updated  to  include recommendations of dose to treat children between 0 and 6 months of age in the context of a pandemic influenza and recommendations of dose in case of an exposure to a circulating pandemic influenza strain for children less than 1 year of age.

## 2.4. Changes to the Product Information

- Sections 4.1 SPC has been updated to include treatment of children between 0 and 6 months of age and prophylaxis for children less than 1 year of age in case of a pandemic influenza
