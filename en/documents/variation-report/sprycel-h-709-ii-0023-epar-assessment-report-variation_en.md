## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  is  a  haematopoietic  stem  cell  disorder  associated  with  a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 to produce the Philadelphia chromosome. This  chromosomal  translocation  results  in  a  chimeric  protein  product  BCR-ABL,  which  is  a constitutively  active  form  of  the  ABL  tyrosine  kinase.  CML  is  a  progressive  myeloproliferative disease, which evolves through chronic, accelerated, and blast crisis phases.

The  Philadelphia  chromosome  and  resultant  constitutively  expressed  BCR-ABL  protein  tyrosine kinase is present in &gt; 90-95% of patients with CML and 20% - 30 % of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, has become the standard of care for treatmentnaive patients with chronic phase CML based upon the results of the pivotal Phase 3 International Randomised Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS) study. While not a cure, the clinical benefit provided by  imatinib  has  led  to  reduced  need  for  stem  cell  transplantation  in  this  patient  population.  In newly diagnosed chronic phase CML (CP-CML) with 8 years of follow-up, imatinib was associated with a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 82% of patients and an estimated 8-year eventfree survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of 81% and 85%, respectively, with data approved and  included  in  the  Product  Information  of  Glivec.  Despite  the  results  of  the  IRIS  study, approximately 42% of patients discontinued imatinib during this 8-year experience due to either adverse events/safety, unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome, death or other reasons. With imatinib treatment, transformation to accelerated or blast phase stages of the disease with a significantly poorer prognosis still occurs in over 7% of patients over 5 years.

Imatinib resistance can result from mutation of the BCR-ABL gene or the over-expression of the BCR-ABL protein.  Intolerance  to  imatinib  is  associated  with  adverse  events  (AEs)  including  fluid retention, QT  prolongations, changes  in liver function,  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia  and diarrhoea.

For patients who are intolerant or resistant to imatinib, therapeutic alternatives as dasatinib and nilotinib are approved as second line treatment.

Dasatinib is a potent, broad spectrum ATP-competitive inhibitor of 5 oncogenic tyrosine kinases/kinase families: BCR-ABL, SRC, c-KIT, PDGFR and ephrin receptor kinases. Dasatinib binds to the active and inactive conformations of the ABL kinase and confers inhibitory activity in ABL kinase domain mutations that render imatinib ineffective. Dasatinib is ~325-fold more potent than imatinib in inhibiting BCR-ABL in vitro.

On  23  December  2005,  orphan  designation  (EU/3/05/339)  was  granted  by  the  European Commission for dasatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia.

Sprycel (dasatinib) was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union on 20 November 2006. It is currently indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase CML  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy  including  imatinib  mesylate  and  for  the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)  and  lymphoid  blast  CML  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy .  The  currently approved posology is 100 mg administered QD (once daily) in subjects with chronic phase CML and 140 mg QD in subjects with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In this type II variation (C.I.6.a), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) of Sprycel applied for a new indication in the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase.

Consequently,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics (SmPC) and the Package Leaflet have been updated. Annex II has been updated to include the updated version of the risk management plan (version 8.1).

The  MAH  also  took  the  opportunity  to  include  the  marketing  authorisation  numbers  of  recently approved 80 mg and 140 mg strengths in Annexes I and IIIA.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/31/2010 for the following condition(s):

-  Philadephia chromosome (BCR-ABL translocation)-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia
-  Philadephia chromosome (BCR-ABL translocation)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

The PIP is not yet completed.

## 1.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 1.2.1. Introduction

The MAH did not conduct new non-clinical studies to support the use of dasatinib in the patient population covered by the new indication. The initial marketing authorisation application included most of the studies required for a long term use in patients with long life expectancy. Exception were the carcinogenicity studies which are currently ongoing, and the reproductive toxicity package from which only the embryo-fetal toxicity study has been performed in rats and rabbits.

## 1.2.2. Toxicology

## Carcinogenicity

The MAH provided a very brief summary of the status of the recently-completed (in-life portion) carcinogenicity study in rats, as it is recognised these data are considered of relevance in view of the expected long treatment duration of newly diagnosed CML patients. This oral carcinogenicity study in rats was initiated in August 2007 as a commitment (based on Guideline ICH Topic S1B Carcinogenicity:  Testing  for  Carcinogenicity  of  Pharmaceuticals),  and  the  in-life  portion  of  this study was completed in August 2009. Doses were 3 mg/kg/day (the presumed maximum tolerated dose), 1mg/kg/day, and 0.3 mg/kg/day (based on Guideline ICH Topic S1C(R2): Dose selection for carcinogenicity  studies  of  pharmaceuticals).  Peer  review  of  the  pathology  data  and  microscope slides  has  been  recently  completed.  Evaluations  by  the  study  pathologist  and  peer-review pathologist  indicated  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  dasatinib-related  tumors.  The  final  report  is currently expected for submission at the latest by December 2010, as previously agreed with the CHMP (FUM 005).

## Reproduction Toxicity

In  embryofoetal  development  (Segment  II)  studies,  dasatinib  induced  embryolethality  with associated decreases in litter size in rats, and foetal skeletal alterations in both rats and rabbits. These effects in both rats and rabbits occurred at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity.

The  current  dasatinib  SmPC  reflects  the  embryo-lethality  observed  in  previous  embryo-foetal development and fertility and early embryonic development studies.

It is presently unknown whether dasatinib will be tolerated by late-gestation fetuses and neonates. The MAH committed to, prior to initiation of a large-scale study, perform preliminary range-finding study that begins dosing of cohorts of dams at different time points in development (Gestation Day 16, Lactation Day 0, and Lactation Day 4). Based on the outcome of this initial study the feasibility of conducting a definitive peri- and postnatal development study will be determined.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In  this  application,  the  MAH  included  an  updated  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  report, summarised in the table below.

## 1.2.3. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

The MAH did not conduct new non-clinical studies to support the use of dasatinib in the patient population covered by the new indication. This is acceptable as the initial marketing authorisation application  included  most  of  the  studies  required  for  a  long  term  use  in  patients  with  long  life expectancy.

Preliminary evaluation of the carcinogenicity data does not seem to pose immediate concern.

The enlargement of the population into \"naive\" patients with a longer lasting disease might lead to the  identification  of  pregnant  patients  eligible  for  treatment  during  pregnancy,  during  the  foetal period,  after  complete  organogenesis.  A  preliminary  range-finding  study  that  begins  dosing  of cohorts of dams at different time points in development will be conducted as a post-authorisation commitment. Based on the outcome of this initial study the feasibility of conducting a definitive peri- and postnatal development study will be determined.

In this application, the MAH included an updated ERA report. The default PECsw value (0.7 ug/L) above the trigger limit (0.01 ug/L) led to a phase II analysis. Therefore, the risk of an adverse environmental impact from use of dasatinib was evaluated in Phase I, Phase II Tier A and Phase II Tier  B  -  according  to  ERA  CHMP  guideline  and  supporting  guidance  by  the  European  Chemicals Bureau: Technical Guidance Document (ECB: TGD). A revised PECsw value of 0.00021 μ g/L was obtained  by  accounting  for  human  metabolism  (49.5%  reduction)  and  refining  F pen  (0.000015

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

instead  of  0.01)  based  on  patient  use.  It  was  not  corrected  to  account  for  any  environmental depletion mechanisms.

A  terrestrial  testing  in  tier  B  was  not  conducted  as  the  K oc value  (2430)  is  below  the  10,000 threshold. However, as dasatinib is not readily biodegradable and greater than 10% of dasatinib was measured in the sediment at day 14 a sediment toxicity study was conducted. Dasatinib is sensitive to light and this increases the removal potential of dasatinib in the aquatic environment. The assessment shows that dasatinib does not affect sludge micro-organisms, aquatic organisms (including  sediment  organisms),  or  bio-concentrate  in  aquatic  species  under  the  test  conditions presented in this risk assessment. Of the three chronic toxicity studies conducted the fish was the most sensitive species (NOEC was 0.018 mg/L for the survival endpoint). Dasatinib fails to meet the  bioconcentration  criteria,  one  of  the  three  criteria  for  the  PBT  assessment  so  it  is  not considered a PBT substance.

Taken  together  the  PEC:PNEC  ratios  indicate  that  dasatinib  is  unlikely  to  be  a  concern  for  the aquatic environment and for the sediment compartment. Dasatinib is unlikely to bioaccumulate to any significant extent. Dasatinib may have a tendency to persist in some water-sediment systems. Dasatinib is not considered a PBT substance. Dasatinib is unlikely to adsorb to soil compartment.

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

## 1.3.1. Introduction

This  application  is  supported  by  a  Phase  3  study  CA180056  comparing  confirmed  CCyR (cCCyR) rates  within  12  months  (the  primary  endpoint)  in  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  CML  subjects treated with dasatinib 100 mg QD versus the approved standard of care imatinib 400 mg QD.

The  MAH  also  intends  to  conduct  a  large  prospective  meta-analysis  from  a  confirmatory  set  of ongoing studies with long-term data to establish overall clinical benefit with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Protocol assistance on the pivotal study (CA180056) design and long-term clinical plans was given by the CHMP in July 2007 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310852/2007).

Pharmacokinetics (PK) data on dasatinib from CA180056 were generated for population PK analysis and exposure-response analyses and were included in this application.

## GCP

The pivotal Study CA180056 was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The  MAH  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 1.3.2. Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

The MAH submitted a population PK (PPK) analysis performed with data on 1,216 subjects from 8 clinical  studies  in  subjects  with  all  phases  of  CML  or  Ph+ALL.  Thus  7  studies  with  data  from subjects  resistant  or  intolerant  to  imatinib,  and  study  CA180056  in  235  subjects  with  newly diagnosed CP-CML. PPK analysis has previously been performed on data from the 7 studies that enrolled resistant or intolerant to imatinib subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The exposure-response (E-R) analysis for cCCyR was performed with data from only CA180056, and  the  E-R  analysis  for  safety  (pleural  effusion,  PE)  used  combined  data  from  CA180034  and CA180056.  These  studies  were  selected  based  on  their  inclusion  in  the  previous  PPK  and  E-R analyses, with the addition of data from CA180056 for the E-R analyses on imatinib naive CP-CML subjects.

The  model  adequately  characterised  concentration-time  data  of  dasatinib,  and  showed  no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in dasatinib PK between imatinib naive and imatinib previously treated patients.

The probability of achieving CCyR in newly diagnosed CP-CML patients decreased with increase in dose interruption duration, but was not related to dasatinib exposure (weighted average concentration) over the range produced by 100 mg QD.

The  risk  of  pleural  effusion  in  newly  diagnosed  and  resistant  or  intolerant  to  imatinib  CP-CML patients increased with dasatinib steady-state trough concentration and age.

## Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology

The concentration-time data of dasatinib in CML and Ph+ ALL patients were well described by a linear 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption.

There were no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in dasatinib pharmacokinetics between newly diagnosed CP-CML patients (1st-line) and patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib (2nd-line).

The results of the PPK analysis support the use of dasatinib as first line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.

## 1.3.3. Clinical efficacy

## 1.3.3.1. Introduction

The proposed new indication is supported by a single, multinational, open-label, randomised Phase 3 study  (CA180056)  comparing  cCCyR  rates  within  12 months  (the  primary  endpoint)  in  newly diagnosed  chronic  phase  CML  subjects  treated  with  dasatinib  100  mg  QD  versus  the  approved standard of care imatinib 400 mg QD (Table 2).

A large prospective meta-analysis with &gt; 1,500 subjects is planned to adequately assess long-term efficacy  and  safety  and  will  include  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  CML  from CA180056 (BMS-sponsored  study)  and  2 ongoing  non-BMS  studies  from  cooperative  groups (SPIRIT2  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  SWOG  0325  in  the  US/Canada;  Table  3).  The  goal  of  this meta-analysis is to provide the most reliable and accurate estimates of the differences in long-term efficacy  and  safety  between  subjects  newly  diagnosed  with  chronic  phase  CML  and  treated  with dasatinib 100 mg QD vs. imatinib 400 mg QD.

## 1.3.3.2. Dose-response studies

In the main study CA180056, the selected dose of dasatinib was 100 mg QD. Activity at this dose level  was  first  documented  in  the  Phase  1  study  CA180002  (submitted  in  the  initial  marketing authorisation application). In a Phase 2 study in chronic phase CML subjects (CA180013, submitted in the initial marketing authorisation application) the median average daily dose of dasatinib was 97 mg.

A  Phase  3  dose  optimisation  study  in  chronic  phase  CML  (CA180034)  demonstrated  comparable efficacy but fewer adverse events (AEs) in subjects treated with dasatinib at 100 mg QD vs. 70 mg twice daily (BID). This trial randomised 670 subjects to one of 4 doses: 100 mg QD, 50 mg BID, 140 mg QD, and 70 mg BID. With median treatment duration of 8 months, the response rates, duration  of  major  cytogenetic  response  (MCyR)  and  PFS  were  similar  among  the  4  treatment groups. There was significantly less severe thrombocytopenia (22% on 100 mg QD and 37% on 70 mg BID) and pleural effusions (7% on 100 mg QD and 16% on 70 mg BID) in the 100 mg QD group. There were fewer dose interruptions and reductions on the 100 mg QD dose. Fewer subjects discontinued  dasatinib  due  to  study  drug  toxicity  on  this  group  as  well  (EMEA/H/C/709/II/02, Commission decision on 22 August 2007).

Based on these data, the 100 mg QD dose of dasatinib was selected for the pivotal study for this application.

## 1.3.3.3. Main Study CA180056

## Methods

Study CA180056 (DASISION) is a phase 3 superiority open label, randomised trial comparing dasatinib 100 mg QD with the current standard of care, imatinib 400 mg QD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study Participants

Participants were subjects ≥ 18 years of age, newly diagnosed with chronic phase CML within the past 3 months based on cytogenetic test results of bone marrow, demonstrating the presence of the Philadelphia positive t(9;22) chromosomal translocation.

- o &lt; 20% basophils in the peripheral blood
- o &lt; 30% blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow
- o ≥ 100 x 10 9 /L platelets
- o No  evidence  of  extramedullary  leukemic  involvement,  with  the  exception  of hepatosplenomegaly
- o Ph+ or variants must be demonstrated by BM cytogenetics.
-  Previously untreated chronic phase CML

## Main exclusion criteria

-  History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to CML, including:
- o Diagnosed  acquired  bleeding  disorder  within  one  year  (e.g.,  acquired  anti-factor VIII antibodies)

## Treatments

Dasatinib was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg QD. Subjects were permitted to adjust the time of administration as long as the drug was taken approximately every 24 hours. Dasatinib 50 mg tablets were administered as 2 tablets taken once per day.

Imatinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg QD. Each 400 mg dose was administered with a meal and taken with a large glass of water. Subjects were permitted to adjust the time of administration  as  long  as  the  drug  was  taken  approximately  every  24  hours.  Imatinib  400  mg tablets were administered as 1 tablet taken once per day.

Treatment was to continue until progression of disease or development of intolerable toxicity or subject's decision to withdraw.

Dose modifications were planned as described in Table 4. Dosing above 180 mg QD of dasatinib or 800 mg/day of imatinib was prohibited.

## Table 4 - Dose modification levels

| Dose Level      |   Dasatinib (mg) | Imatinib (ing)   |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Escalation (+1) |              140 | 600-800          |
| Starting dose   |              100 | 400              |
| Reduction (-1)  |               80 | 300              |
| Reduction (-2)  |               50 | 200              |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No prior treatment for CML other than hydroxyurea or anagrelide was permitted before eligibility.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the best cCCyR rates within 12 months in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML subjects treated with dasatinib 100 mg QD versus imatinib 400 mg QD.

The secondary  objectives were  to  compare  Time  in  cCCyR  overall  (a  measure  of  duration  of cCCyR), Major molecular response (MMR) rate at any time, Time to cCCyR overall, Time to MMR overall, Progression-free survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS).

## The tertiary objectives were:

-  To  describe  the  following  efficacy  parameters  within  12  months:  MMR,  Confirmed  major cytogenetic  response  rate  (cMCyR),  Confirmed  complete  hematologic  response  (cCHR), Time in and time to cCCyR.
-  To describe the following study parameters overall: Best overall cCCyR, cMCyR, and cCHR rate, Times to cMCyR and cCHR, Time to treatment failure (TTF), Time to maximum clinical benefit (TMCB).
-  To assess duration of cCCyR within 12 months, duration overall for cCCyR, cMCyR, MMR, and cCHR for each treatment group.
-  To evaluate the toxicity profile for each treatment group.
-  To explore the development of BCR-ABL point mutations in both treatment groups.
-  Pharmacokinetic assessment of dasatinib in relation to efficacy and safety variables.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the best cCCyR rate within 12 months. Secondary efficacy endpoints included time in cCCyR, MMR at any time, time to cCCyR overall, time to MMR overall, PFS and OS.

## Sample size

For sample size estimation, the cCCyR rate within 12 months of dasatinib treatment was assumed to be 81%. With a 2-sided α = 0.05 and power of 90%, a total of 518 subjects were needed to show a statistical significant difference in 12-month cCCyR rates between the 2 groups when the 12-month cCCyR rates in the imatinib 400 mg QD group and the dasatinib 100 mg QD group were assumed to be 69% and 81%, respectively.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was stratified by Hasford score. This is supported since it is possible by the means of Hasford score to identify low, intermediate, and high risk patients concerning survival.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Response (cytogenetic, molecular, and hematologic) and event (e.g., AE of special interest) rates were estimated with their 2-sided, exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the Clopper and Pearson method. The difference in rates between the 2 treatment groups with their 2-sided 95% CI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method of weighting, adjusting for the stratification factor Hasford score. Test for differences in response rates used a 2-sided test stratified by Hasford score using CMH method.

The secondary endpoints will be reassessed again after 5 years using a hierarchical testing procedure. The power of these tests depends primarily on the number of observed events. Therefore, a reassessment seems reasonable, in particular if a considerable number of additional events is expected during the remaining follow-up.

The hierarchical test procedure maintains the overall significance level of the 5-years assessment. The 12-months assessment of the secondary endpoints may be considered as an interim analysis relative to the final assessment after 5 years, and the chosen significance level of 0.0001 ensures that this interim analysis has very little impact on the overall level significance in the final analysis.

The participant flow had no major imbalances.

The number of treated subject n = 517 were equally distributed in the two treatment groups with 258 in each.

The number of discontinued subjects were lower in the dasatinib group [n= 40 (16%)] compared to the imatinib group [n=48 (19%)]. There was a trend towards higher disease progression and treatment  failure  in  the  imatinib  group.  Four  deaths  were  reasons  to  discontinuation  in  the dasatinib group whereas one dead was reason to discontinuation in the imatinib group.

## Recruitment

The first patient first visit occurred on 24 September 2007. The data cut-off date for the 12-month primary analysis was on 11 January 2010. The study is ongoing.

## Conduct of the study

The amendments to the protocol were considered not to have major impact on the study results. Clinically  relevant  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  a  total  of  2  subjects,  1  from  each treatment group for the reason 'lacked criteria for Ph+ chronic phase CML'.

Note: All p values were adjusted for Hasford score.

b For time-to MMR, a hazard ratio of 2.01 indicates that a subject treated with dasatinib is more than 2 times more likely to achieve a MMR at any time compared with a subject treated with imatinib.

a For time-to cCCyR, a hazard ratio of 1.55 indicates that a subject treated with dasatinib is 55% more likely to achieve a cCCyR at any time compared with a subject treated with imatinib.

c For time-in cCCyR (a measure of durability), a hazard ratio of 0.7 indicates that a subject treated with dasatinib is 30% less likely to have disease progression after achieving a cCCyR or never achieving a cCCyR compared with a subject treated with imatinib; subjects who never achieved a cCCyR were considered to have progressed on Day 1.

cCCyR - confirmed complete cytogenetic response, CI - confidence interval, MMR - major molecular response, OS - overall survival, PFS - progression-free survival

## Primary endpoint: cCCyR

Dasatinib treatment produced a significantly (p &lt; 0.007) higher cCCyR rate within 12 months (77%) compared with imatinib (66%) meeting the primary endpoint (Table 9).

Sensitivity analyses were pre-specified for the primary endpoint:

## Secondary endpoints

MMR at any time was significantly higher in dasatinib-treated subjects (n = 135, 52%) compared with imatinib-treated subjects (n = 88, 34%) (p &lt; 0.00003; significance level = 0.0001).

The rate of complete molecular response (CMR) at any time was 8.5% vs. 4.2% in the dasatinib and  imatinib  treatment  groups,  respectively.  This  is  the  most  sensitive  way  of  evaluating  the number of leukemic cells but CMR was not an endpoint.

The  molecular  response  was  achieved  earlier  in  the  dasatinib  treated  subjects  compared  to  the imatinib treated subjects.

The  secondary  endpoint  ' Time  to  cCyR  at  any  time '  was  met  (p&lt;  0.0001;  significance  level 0.0001) with a median of 3.1 and 5.6 months for the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. Cytogenetic  response  was  achieved  earlier  in  the  dasatinib  treated  subjects  compared  to  the imatinib treated subjects.

The secondary endpoint ' Time to  MMR '  was met (p&lt; 0.0001; significance level 0.0001) with a median of 6.3 and 9.2 months for the Dasatinib and Imatinib group respectively. As MMR is more sensitive than cCCyR it is considered a very important endpoint.

Figure 2 - Time to MMR at Any Time - All Randomised Subjects

The secondary endpoint ' Time in cCCyR (At Any Time): All Randomised Subjects ' is not met (stratified log-rank test, p &lt; 0.035; tested at a significance level of 0.0001).

A trend for more durable cytogenetic responses with dasatinib compared with imatinib was seen though. With a hazard ratio of 0.7 indicating subject treated with dasatinib is 30% less likely to have disease progression after  achieving  a  cCCyR  or  never  achieving  a  cCCyR  compared  with  a subject treated with imatinib in the same situation.

At the time of maturity of the secondary endpoints, 'Time in cCCyR (At Any Time)' will be tested after a minimum of 5 years - as rank 2.

Duration of cCCyR (At Any Time) in Subjects with cCCyR was not defined as a key secondary endpoint but shows that the subjects with cCCyR only had very few events, 1/199 and 3/177 for dasatinib and imatinib respectively. It is still too early to assess the durability of response which was expected.

The time-dependent endpoints Overall  survival and Progression-free  Survival are difficult to interpret at this time. The number of events in OS and PFS was too low to allow a conclusion at the present time. With a minimum of 12 months follow-up PFS data are still immature. There were few progression events, 12 (5%) in the dasatinib group and 15 (6%) in the imatinib group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 3 - Progression-Free Survival - All Randomised Subjects

<!-- image -->

The  PFS  at  12  months  with  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  96.4  %  (CI:  94.1-98.7)  and  96.7% (CI: 94.4-99.0%) for the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. The secondary endpoint 'PFS' will be tested after a minimum of 5 years - as rank 6.

No significant difference was seen in OS between the two treatment groups with OS at 12 months at 96.4% and 96.7% in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. The follow-up period in the pivotal study is too short to detect a difference in OS between the treatment groups. Maturation of overall survival results are anticipated at the 5 years follow-up.

## Tertiary endpoints

Transformation  to  accelerated  or  blast  phase of  CML  occurred  less  frequently  in  dasatinib treated  subjects  (5/259,  1.9%,  all  blastic  phase)  compared  to  imatinib  treated  subjects  (9/260, 3.5%, all blastic  phase).  This  endpoint  was  not  mature  yet  but  showed  no  detrimental  effect  of dasatinib.

One of the tertiary objectives was to explore the development of BCR-ABL point mutations in both treatment groups. The MAH stated that the mutations were assessed in subjects at the time of disease progression or at end of treatment (EOT). Some of these mutations have been reported to  confer  resistance  to  imatinib.  Bone  marrow  samples  were  sequenced  and  reported  by MolecularMD (Portland, OR). The spectrum of point mutations in the BCR-ABL gene at the time of progressive  disease  or  EOT  was  described.  Subjects  were  grouped  by  mutation  status  (i.e.,  no mutation, location, IC50 to imatinib) by mutation status and off-treatment reason, and by specific mutation.

In treated subjects who discontinued study therapy and had mutation data, 4/24 (17%) subjects in the dasatinib group and 5/35 (14%) in the imatinib group had mutations identified at the end of treatment. All mutations were outside the P-loop or activation loop. Among the 4 dasatinib-treated subjects,  the  T315I  mutation  (3)  or  F317L  mutation  (1)  were  identified.  Mutations  identified  in 5 imatinib treated subjects were M244V (1), E355G (2), F359V (1), and 1 subject had 2 mutations (D276G and F359C). BCR/ABL mutations will also be assessed with yearly updates of the study results and with longer follow-up.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ancillary analyses

In most subpopulations, rates of cCCyR within 12 months (primary efficacy endpoint) were higher in dasatinib-treated subjects compared with imatinib-treated subjects. In some subpopulations with a limited number of subjects enrolled (&lt; 21 and  65 years of age, black and other races, North American region), no clinically meaningful comparisons can be made.

## 1.3.3.4. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and metaanalysis)

In  the  final  advice  letter  from  the  Protocol  Assistance  (July  2007),  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the sponsor's  proposal  that  the  long-term  clinical  benefit  of  dasatinib  can  be  derived  from  a prospectively designed meta-analysis of several individual well-controlled randomised clinical trials meeting  pre-specified  design  specifications.  The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  pooling  data  from  a number  of  clinical  trials  represents  the  only  realistic  possibility  of  accurately  determining  the long-term clinical benefit of dasatinib. As the meta-analysis protocol was not available at the time of the Protocol Assistance procedure, this application included the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for such meta-analysis. This SAP aims to pool data from the 3 individual studies and run a uniform model to assess treatment effect. The SAP is also designed to evaluate the consistency of such approach by investigating the heterogeneity in treatment effect and conducting sensitivity analyses on different subpopulations and endpoints.

No analyses performed across trials are found concerning efficacy yet.

## 1.3.3.5. Clinical studies in special populations

No clinical studies in special populations have been submitted in this application. Experience from the currently approved indication is reflected in the SmPC from earlier trials.

No subjects &lt; 18 years old were included in the pivotal study. Efficacy and safety in children and adolescents  under  the  age  of  18  years  has  not  been  previously  established  either.  Very  few subjects  more  than  75  years  old  and  even ≥ 66  years  old  have  been  studied  in  the  proposed indication.  The MAH provided adequate justification for this. The treatment of older patients should be similar to the overall patient population in the study. While the safety profile (overall rates of AEs) of dasatinib in the geriatric population was similar to that in the younger population, patients aged ≥ 65  years  are  more  likely  to  experience  fluid  retention  events  and  dyspnoea.    This  is consistent  with  the  observations  in  the  second-line  treatment  of  CML  with  dasatinib  (imatinib resistant/intolerant subjects) and is included in the SmPC, section 4.4 as well as in section 4.8 and it is considered that the treating physician should be aware of these potential differences in safety to effectively manage the treatment of the older patient.

Concerning renal impairment no clinical studies have been conducted. In the pivotal study, patients with  serum  creatinine  concentration  &gt;  3  times  upper  limit  of  the  normal  range  were  excluded. Since  the  renal  clearance  of  dasatinib  and  its  metabolites  is  &lt;  4%,  a  decrease  in  total  body clearance is not expected in patients with renal insufficiency.

Concerning hepatic impairment it is known from earlier findings from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose. However, due to the limitations of the study, caution is recommended when administering dasatinib to patients with hepatic impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.3.3.6. Discussion on clinical efficacy

This application was supported by a single, multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 study based  on  surrogate  endpoints  with  a  minimum  of  12  months  of  follow  up  data.  In  addition  a confirmatory set of studies with long-term data to establish overall clinical benefit, with a minimum of 5 years of follow up, is ongoing.

Although a confirmation trial would be desirable, the fact that this is a one-pivotal study application is in line with the available guidance (Points to consider on application with 1) meta-analyses; 2) one  pivotal  study,  CPMP/EWP/2330/99)  as  there  is  a  pharmacological  rationale  and  a  plausible hypothesis, previous data on efficacy (in second line in the same disease) is not unconvincing, the results do not show any indication of a potential bias, the treatment benefit is large enough to be clinically  valuable,  statistical  evidence  is  strong,  the  trial  seems  to  have  internal  validity  and  all important endpoints show similar findings.

The  CHMP  stated  in  the  protocol  assistance  (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310852/2007)  that  in  the proposed setting the long-term clinical benefit can be derived from a prospectively designed metaanalysis  with  individual  studies  meeting  the  design  specifications  of  the  meta-analysis.  This  is acceptable because of the small population of patients with CML and resulting difficulty in recruiting a large number of patients.

The open-label design is not considered to be of any concern as the majority of the endpoints are objectively determined i.e. cytogenetic, molecular and haematological endpoints.

The  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  are  adequate  as  they  reflect  the  proposed  indication  and  the anticipated risks involved in the treatment with dasatinib.

In  the  pivotal  study  subjects  were  randomized  1:1  stratified  by  Hasford  score  to  receive  either Dasatinib 100 mg QD or Imatinib 400 mg QD. The selection of the 100 mg QD dose of dasatinib in the study was based on previous dose-response studies and the phase 3 dose optimisation study in chronic  phase  CML  (CA180034) and seems reasonable. The choice and posology of the imatinib control arm is acceptable as it is the current standard of care in the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase.

The primary endpoint in the pivotal trial (cCCyR at 12 months) was endorsed by the CHMP in the protocol assistance procedure. Cytogenetic response evaluated in an interim analysis at 12 month was  used  as  surrogate  primary  endpoint  when  Glivec  (Imatinib)  was  approved  in  first  line treatment of CML (IRIS). In later analysis of the IRIS trial it was documented that CCyR at one year is predictive for PFS.

Using PFS or OS as primary endpoints is not considered feasible as it will take years before the results  are  mature.  MMR  could  have  been  acceptable  as  a  primary  endpoint  as  it  is  a  more sensitive way of measuring residual disease, and the previous protocol assistance recommended MMR  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  But  since  the  advice  was  given,  progress  has  been  made  to standardise molecular monitoring, and consequently, the present approach is accepted, i.e. CCyR is considered a validated endpoint.

The secondary and tertiary endpoints are found relevant to support the primary endpoint.

In general, the statistical analyses were adequate and address the relevant question using valid tools. Comparisons of the secondary endpoints were performed at a significance level of 0.0001; this level allowed the testing for these endpoints without impacting the overall type I error. Using an extremely low significance level for the secondary endpoints ensures that these tests have essentially no impact on the overall significance level. Overall, the test strategy is satisfactory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The baseline data were well balanced between the two treatment groups.

As for the results, dasatinib showed superiority to imatinib in first line treatment in subjects with CML  in  chronic  phase.  The  primary  endpoint,  cCCyR  rate  within  12  months,  is  clearly  met  as dasatinib  treatment  produced  a  significantly  (p  &lt;  0.007)  higher  cCCyR  rate  within  12  months compared with imatinib. The consistency of the results for the primary endpoint across subgroups supports  the  robustness  of  the  data.  The  primary  endpoint  is  supported  by  the  secondary endpoints MMR at any time, Time to cCCyR at any time and Time to MMR. The MAH committed to provide yearly updates of the results from the trial.

## 1.3.3.7. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

Dasatinib 100 mg QD induced significantly higher rates of CCyR and MMR compared to imatinib 400 mg QD in adults with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. A faster time to remission was observed.

Long term data on PFS and OS issued from a meta-analysis of trial CA180056 and similar trials comparative  with  imatinib  will  be  submitted  as  a  post-authorisation  commitment  in  order  to provide a more definitive assessment of long-term efficacy of dasatinib.

## 1.3.4. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The  assessment  of  the  safety  of  dasatinib  with  a  minimum  of  12 months  of  follow-up  in  adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML is based on analyses of 516 treated subjects, 258 in the dasatinib arm and 258 in the imatinib arm. Safety data are presented for all treated subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

There  were  no  subjects  under  the  age  of  18  years  participating  in  the  study.  The  number  of subjects ≥ 65 years old were rather small, n = 25 in the dasatinib group and n = 29 in the imatinib group. The average daily dose (mg/day) was 99.0 (21-136) in the dasatinib group and 400 (125657) in the imatinib group.

Subjects with dose interruptions were higher in the dasatinib group (52.3 %) compared with the imatinib  group  (35.3  %).  The  reasons  for  the  first  dose  interruption  were  hematologic  toxicity (12.4%) and non-hematologic toxicity (8.5%) in the dasatinib group whereas the main reason in the imatinib group was hematologic toxicity. Subjects with dose reductions were also higher in the dasatinib group (23.3 %) compared with the imatinib group (14.0%) with mainly 1-2 reductions in both groups and mainly due to hematologic and non-haematologic toxicities. More subjects were having a dose escalation in the imatinib group compared to the dasatinib group (14.0 % vs. 5.4%) and were mainly due to 'no CCyR' and 'no CHR ' in the imatinib and dasatinib group respectively .

## Adverse events

Overall the AEs seen (&gt;/= 10%, any grade, drug related) were either seen with a lower or equal frequency in the dasatinib group compared to the imatinib group except for pleural effusions seen in 26 subjects (10%) in the dasatinib group (only grade 1and 2) and not seen in any subjects in the imatinib group (Table 10).

Overall  the  safety  profiles  of  the  two  treatments  are  almost  similar  and  no  unexpected  safety events for dasatinib were seen. However from the currently approved indications, pleural effusions are known to be associated with dasatinib, oedema and muscle cramps with imatinib and this is still evident.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

More deaths were seen in the dasatinib group, n = 10 (3.9%), compared to the imatinib group, n = 6 (2.3%).

The cause of the deaths in the dasatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), infection (n = 4) and myocardial infarction (MI, n = 2). Six of the subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib (disease progression n = 1, infection n = 3, MI n = 2) and 4 died more than 30 days after last dose of dasatinib (disease progression n = 3 and infection n = 1).

The cause of the deaths in the imatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), MI (n = 1) and unknown (n = 1). Four of the subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of imatinib (disease progression n = 2, MI n = 1 and unknown n = 1) and 2 died more than 30 days after last dose of imatinib because of disease progression.

Death  because  of  infection  was  only  seen  in  the  dasatinib  group.    None  of  these  four  subjects appeared  to  have  significant  leukopenia  or  neutropenia  at  the  time  of  infection  and  were  all receiving  multiple  antibiotics.  Besides  from  that  the  causes  of  death  were  similar  in  the  two treatment groups.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) (drug-related) were reported by 8% and 5% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAEs (drug-related) experienced by 2 or more subjects included pleural effusion (4 subjects, 2%), thrombocytopenia (3 subjects, 1%), and pyrexia (2 subjects, 0.8%) in the dasatinib group. SAEs (drug-related)  reported  by  2  subjects  each  in  the  imatinib  group  included  febrile  neutropenia (0.8%) and vomiting (0.8%). All other drug-related SAEs were reported by 1 subject each.

Grade 3 and 4 SAEs (drug-related) were reported by 4% of subjects in each treatment group.

Grade  3  and  4  SAEs  (drug-related)  reported  by  2  or  more  subjects  were  thrombocytopenia  (3 subjects,  1%)  in  the  dasatinib  group  and  febrile  neutropenia  (2 subjects,  0.8%)  in  the  imatinib group.  All  other  severe  drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  by  1  subject  each.  Of  the  4  SAEs  of drug-related pleural effusion in dasatinib-treated subjects, none were severe.

## Safety issues of special interest in the dasatinib arm

Fluid retention is a well known safety issue in patients treated with TKIs. Associations with pleural effusions  with  dasatinib  treatment  and  oedema  with  imatinib  treatment  are  observed  in  the currently approved indications.

In  the  pivotal  study  fluid  retention  (all  grades)  was  seen  more  frequently  with  imatinib  than dasatinib  (42%  vs.  19%).  The  most  frequent  fluid  retention  in  the  dasatinib  group  was  pleural effusion (10.1%) and superficial oedema (8.9%). In the imatinib group it was superficial oedema (35.7%) and generalised oedema (6.2%). Other drug-related fluid retention AEs were reported for &lt; 2% of the subjects in either group. The risk of fluid retention is reflected in the SmPC.

Most often the dasatinib treated subjects with pleural effusions were managed by interruption of dasatinib. Pleural effusion did not in general impair the ability of subjects to obtain a CCyR (88.5%) or achieve MMR (65.4%).

Pulmonary  oedema was  reported  for  1  subject  (0.4%)  in  the  dasatinib  group  (Grade  1  and considered  drug  related).  It  is  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Pulmonary  hypertension  occurred  in association with dasatinib and appeared as a consequence of other fluid retention events. It was reported as drug-related events in 3 (1.2%) in the dasatinib group. It is reflected in the SmPC as well.

Bleeding events (regardless of relationship to study treatment) was reported in 30 (11.6%) and 27 (10.5%)  subjects  in  the  dasatinib  and  imatinib  groups,  respectively.  Severe  (Grade  3  to  4) bleeding was reported in 3 (1.2%) and 4 (1.6%) subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively. Drug-related bleeding (consisting of GI bleeding, CNS bleeding, and other hemorrhage) was infrequent and comparable between groups. In the dasatinib group 13 subjects (5.1%)  had  bleeding  of  any  grade  (2  GI  bleedings  and  11  other  hemorrhage).  In  the  imatinib group  12  subjects,  (4.7%)  experienced  bleeding  of  any  grade  (1  GI  bleedings  and  11  other hemorrhage).  This despite a higher incidence of severe thromobocytopenia in the dasatinib group (dasatinib: 19.1%,  imatinib: 10.5%).  More  information  must  be provided concerning the chronological relation of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic episodes, and the relation thrombocytopenia grade and bleeding.

Severe  drug-related  bleeding  was  reported  in  1  (0.4%)  dasatinib-treated  subject  and  2  (0.8%) imatinib-treated subjects.

As  for  the cardiac  events ,  the  protocol  excluded  subjects  with  significant  recent  cardiac  events within 3 to 6 months prior to enrolment. However, nearly one quarter of the subjects had some degree  of  cardiac  co-morbidity  i.e.  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  diabetes  and  peripheral  artery disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs in the MedDRA SOC of cardiac disorders were more than twice as likely in subjects with cardiac co-morbidity at baseline compared with subjects without cardiac co-morbidity at baseline in both groups. Warnings are reflected in the SmPC.

The  rates  of  cardiac  events,  regardless  of  relationship,  were  higher  with  dasatinib  treatment compared  to  imatinib  treatment  (26  subjects,  10.1%  vs.  18  subjects,  7.0%,  respectively),  the rates  of  drug-related  cardiac  events  were  infrequent  in  both  treatment  groups  (dasatinib  13 subjects, 5.0%; imatinib 12 subjects, 4.7%).

In  the  dasatinib  group  the  most  frequent  cardiac  events  were  congestive  heart  failure/cardiac dysfunction (1.6%), palpitations (1.2%), arrhythmias (1.2%) and pericardial effusions (1.2%).

In the imatinib group the most frequent cardiac events were palpitations (1.6%), congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction (1.2%) and arrhythmias (0.8%).

One subject in each treatment group had QT prolongation and one person in the imatinib group only had ventricular arrhythmia. Of the 23 subjects with drug-related cardiac AEs all had resolution of their AEs, except for 3 subjects in the imatinib group (two with decreased ejection fraction and one with ventricular arrhythmia). Drug-related cardiac events led to discontinuation in 2 subjects, both treated with dasatinib (grade 3 pericardial effusions, grade 4 QT prolongation).

QTc(F) &gt; 500 msec was seen in one subject in each treatment group. The median QTc (F) change from baseline was lower with dasatinib compared with imatinib (3.0 msec vs. 8.2 msec).

None of the subjects had a severe cardiac dysfunction with a LVEF &lt; 20% during the study. Eleven subjects  had  mild  or  moderate  cardiac  dysfunction  (10  of  these  from  baseline).  Seven  of  the 11 subjects  had  baseline  cardiac  risk  factors  including  prior  MI,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF), hyperlipidaemia, diabetes or hypertension (4 dasatinib, 3 imatinib). Eight of the 11 subjects remain on study treatment (5 subjects in the dasatinib group and 3 subjects in the imatinib group).

The  rate  of  abnormally  elevated  pulmonary  artery  systolic  pressure  was  found  in  15  subjects (5.8%)  in  the  dasatinib  group  vs.  7  subjects  (2.7%)  in  the  imatinib  group.  Seven  of  the  15 subjects  in  the  dasatinib  group  had  a  change  of  &lt;=  20  mmHg  from  baseline,  4  subjects  had  a change of &gt;20 mmHg and 4 subjects were not reported at baseline.  There was only one subject in the imatinib group who had a change of &gt;20 mmHg from baseline.

## Laboratory findings

Concerning haematology, dasatinib differ from imatinib by higher rate of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia  (19.1%  vs.  10.5%).  Furthermore  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the dasatinib  group  reported  recurrent  events  of  grade  3  to  4  thrombocytopenia  (6.2%  vs.  1.6%) compared with the imatinib group but without bleeding related to recurrent thrombocytopenia in the dasatinib group. The median duration of the first occurrence of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia were 2.8 weeks vs. 3.4 weeks in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively.

Grade  3  to  4  baseline  hematologic  abnormalities  were  found  in  2.3%  or  less  of  randomised subjects. Most subjects had some degree of cytopenia on study; however, the majority was grade 1 or 2. Otherwise between the dasatinib and imatinib groups, the rates of grade 3 to 4 leukopenia (8.6%  vs.  9.7%),  neutropenia  (20.7%  vs.  20.2%),  and  anemia  (10.2%  vs.  6.6%)  were comparable.

A  total  of  7 subjects  (dasatinib:  4,  imatinib:  3)  reported  grade 3  to  4  ALT  and/or  AST  or  total bilirubin levels during the study. Elevations in liver function tests led to study drug discontinuation in 2 subjects both from the imatinib group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade  3  to  4  creatinine  levels  were  reported  for  3 subjects  (1  dasatinib-treated  subject  and  2 imatinib-treated subjects).

With the exception of phosphorus, there were few cases on-study of Grade 3 to 4 levels in these other chemistries (calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, potassium, sodium, uric and acid) and  little  difference  between  the  treatment  groups.  Hypophosphatemia,  a  known  side  effect  of imatinib, was reported as grade 3 in 11 dasatinib-treated subjects (4.4%) and 54 imatinib-treated subjects (21.6%) and no grade 4 events were reported.

## Safety in special populations

Concerning gender related differences, a higher proportion of AEs were seen in females compared to males (88.6% vs. 78.4%) as well as AEs leading to discontinuation (6.2% vs. 2.6%). A higher proportion of deaths were reported in males than in females (4.2% vs. 1.4%).

Concerning  pregnancy  there  are  no  adequate  and  well  controlled  studies.  It  is  furthermore unknown whether dasatinib is excreted in the human milk.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

It  is  well  known  that  the  following  drugs  may  decrease  dasatinib  plasma  concentrations: CYP3A4 inducers, antacids and H2 antagonists/proton pump inhibitors. Furthermore it is also well known that CYP3A4 substrates may have their plasma concentrations altered by dasatinib.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported by 5% and 4% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively. Severe drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 3 % in each treatment group.

Concerning drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation in more than one subject the MAH indicated that in the dasatinib group 4 subjects had cytopenias and 3 subjects had pleural effusion that led to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  In  the  imatinib  group,  3  subjects  had  cytopenias  that  led  to discontinuation of study drug. All other drug-related AEs inclusive severe drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by one subject each.

## Post marketing experience

Dasatinib was first approved worldwide in June 2006 and is currently approved in over 60 countries worldwide. Based on routine pharmacovigilance activities conducted by BMS Global Pharmacovigilance  and  Epidemiology,  review  of  postmarketing  data  confirms  that  dasatinib  is tolerated.  The  safety  profile  of  dasatinib  remains  favorable  and  similar  to  the  profile  established during clinical trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.3.4.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The  assessment  of  the  safety  of  dasatinib  with  a  minimum  of  12 months  of  follow-up  in  adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML is based on analysis of 516 treated subjects, 258 in the dasatinib arm and 258 in the imatinib arm. The number of randomized and treated subjects as  well  as  the  duration  of  therapy  (14.01  and  14.28  months  in  the  dasatinib  and  imatinib  arm respectively) was overall well balanced.

The safety profiles of both dasatinib and imatinib did not indicate any new or unexpected major concerns.

Drug  related  non-haematological  adverse  events  associated  with  both  treatments  were  primary grade 1 or 2.

AEs are seen in 93% of the subjects in both treatment groups. Drug related AEs (any grade) are seen in 80% and 85% in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively. Drug related grade 3-4 AEs was reported in 30% and 24 % in the dasatinib and imatinib group respectively.

Most frequent drug related AEs in the dasatinib group were: diarrhoea (17%), headache (12%) and pleural effusion (10%). Most frequent drug related AEs in the imatinib group were: superficial oedema  (36%),  nausea  (20%),  muscle  spasms  (17  %),  diarrhoea  (17%),  rash  (13%),  eyelid oedema (13%), myalgia (12 %) and vomiting (10%).

AEs (drug related) seen with higher frequency in the dasatinib group compared to imatinib: pleural effusion (10 vs. 0 %) and headache (12 vs. 11%).

AEs  (drug  related)  seen  with  higher  frequency  in  the  imatinib  group  compared  to  dasatinib: superficial  oedema  (36%),  nausea  (20%),  muscle  spasms  (17  %),  rash  (13%),  eyelid  oedema (13%), myalgia (12 %) and vomiting (10%).

More deaths were seen in the dasatinib group (n = 10, (3.9%)) compared to the imatinib group (n = 6, (2.3%)). The cause of the deaths in the dasatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), infection  (n  =  4)  and  MI  (n  =  2).  Six  of  the  subjects  died  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose  of dasatinib. The cause of the deaths in the imatinib group were disease progression (n = 4), MI (n = 1) and unknown (n = 1).

SAEs (drug-related) were reported by 8% and 5% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively.  SAEs  (drug-related)  experienced  by  2  or  more  subjects  included  pleural  effusion (4 subjects,  2%),  thrombocytopenia  (3  subjects,  1%),  and  pyrexia  (2  subjects,  0.8%)  in  the dasatinib group. SAEs (drug-related) reported by 2 subjects each in the imatinib group included febrile  neutropenia  (0.8%)  and  vomiting  (0.8%).  All  other  drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  by 1 subject  each.  Grade  3  and  4  SAEs  (drug-related)  were  reported  by  4%  of  subjects  in  each treatment  group.  Grade  3  and  4  SAEs  (drug-related)  reported  by  2  or  more  subjects  were thrombocytopenia in the dasatinib group and febrile neutropenia in the imatinib group.

Pleural  effusions  are  known  to  be  associated  with  dasatinib,  oedema  and  muscle  cramps  with imatinib. These findings were confirmed in the pivotal study.

Other safety issues of special interests are those observed in association with dasatinib in currently approved indications or recognised events in other agents within this drug class i.e. myelosuppression, haemorrhage, cardiac disorders and QT-prolongation.

There were few cases of grade 3 to 4 levels in chemistries with the exception of phosphorus and little  difference  between  the  treatment  groups.  Hypophosphataemia,  a  known  side  effect  of imatinib, was reported as grade 3 in 11 dasatinib-treated subjects (4.4%) and 54 imatinib-treated subjects (21.6%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported by 5% and 4% of subjects in the dasatinib and imatinib groups, respectively. Severe drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 3 % in each treatment group.

## 1.3.4.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Dasatinib is well tolerated. The safety profile of dasatinib has some differences compared to the safety profile of imatinib however it is not worse and acceptable in the proposed indication.

From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  postmarketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 1.4. Risk Management Plan

In this application, the MAH submitted an update to the risk management plan (version 8.1) which is considered acceptable.

## 1.5. Benefit-risk balance

## Benefits

##  Beneficial effects

The efficacy of dasatinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP has been evaluated in a Phase III,  open label, randomised superiority trial (study CA180056 or DASISION) comparing dasatinib 100 mg QD with imatinib 400 mg QD. A total of 519 patients were randomised, 259 patients in the dasatinib group and 260 patients in the imatinib group.

The  open-label  design  is  considered  acceptable  as  the  majority  of  the  endpoints  are  objectively determined i.e. cytogenetic, molecular and haematological endpoints.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  primary  endpoint  was  cCCyR  rate  at  12 months.  This  endpoint  is  widely  accepted  as  a surrogate of  clinical  benefit  and  the  adequacy  of  the  primary  surrogate  endpoint  stems  from  an analysis of the IRIS trial showing that CCyR at 1 year is predictive for PFS. This surrogate endpoint should be supported by time-dependent endpoints such as PFS and OS.  In that context it should be taken into account that the overall 7-year survival rate for patients with newly diagnosed CMLCP treated with imatinib is now estimated to be 86 %.

Treatment with dasatinib produced a significantly (p &lt; 0.007) higher cCCyR rate within 12 months (77%)  compared  with  imatinib  (66%)  meeting  the  primary  endpoint.  The  primary  endpoint  is supported by the secondary endpoints MMR at any time, Time to cCyR at any time and Time to MMR.

The  PFS  rates  at  12  months  are  96.4%  (dasatinib)  and  96.7%  (imatinib),  and  the  OS  rates  at 12 nonths are 97.2% (dasatinib) and 98.8 (imatinib). The PFS and OS data are still immature but will be provided post authorisation. Also, the rates of progression to CML-AP or CML-BC cannot be reliably assessed at this point in time.

Overall, study CA180056 convincingly demonstrates a favourable effect of dasatinib in comparison with imatinib in the first line treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase.

##  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Efficacy in terms of cCCyR beyond 12 months is not known. Time-dependent endpoints are needed for a more definitive assessment of long term efficacy. At present OS and PFS are still immature but no detrimental effect is seen in the dasatinib group or the imatinib group.  The MAH committed to provide yearly updates of the results from the trial.

If  dasatinib  substitutes  imatinib  as  the  preferred  first-line  treatment  for  CML-CP  there  is  no evidence-based second-line therapy for patients failing dasatinib. However, this important clinical issue  is  not  expected  be  resolved  by  the  applicant  at  this  point  in  time.  However,  the  MAH committed  to  make  proposals  to  prospectively  collect  response  data  (type,  magnitude  and duration)  in  patients  receiving  second  line  therapy  after  relapse  or  disease  progression  with dasatinib.

## Risks

##  Unfavourable effects

The observed safety profile for imatinib and dasatinib in the pivotal study was consistent with the known  safety  profile  for  both  compounds.  There  were  no  new  or  unexpected  major  findings. Dasatinib is overall well tolerated. The safety profile of dasatinib has some differences compared to the safety profile of imatinib, however, it is not worse and acceptable in the proposed indication.

Pleural  effusions  are  known  to  be  associated  with  dasatinib,  oedema  and  muscle  cramps  with imatinib.  These  findings  were  confirmed  in  the  pivotal  study.  Pleural  effusion  was  the  most common fluid retention  in  the  dasatinib  group  (10%  vs.  0%)  but  discontinuation  overall  due  to pleural  effusion  is  infrequent.  All  pleural  effusions  were  grade  1  to  2.  Most  often  the  dasatinib treated subjects with pleural effusions were managed by interruption of dasatinib but diuretic, dose reduction, corticosteroids and one thoracocentesis were also used. Three subjects discontinued due to pleural effusion. Pleural effusion did not in general impair the ability of subjects to obtain a CCyR or achieve MMR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regards to haematological toxicity dasatinib differ from imatinib by higher rate of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (19.1% vs. 10.5%). Most subjects had some degree of cytopenia on study; however, the majority was grade 1 or 2.

Another safety issues to be mentioned is the rate of abnormally elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (&gt; 40 mmHg) which was found in 5.8% in the dasatinib group vs. 2.7% in the imatinib group.

##  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

When  pleural  effusions  (or  other  conditions)  are  treated  with  interruption  of  dasatinib  or  dose reduction it is not known if the duration of efficacy is sustained or the subjects will progress earlier. This, although the subjects in general did not have their ability to obtain a CCyR impaired in the pivotal study.

Also,  the  etiological  relevance  of  dasatinib  treatment  to  cardiac  dysfunction,  including  cardiac failure, conduction disturbances, ischemia and myocardial infarction doesn't seem well defined or quantified.

The  relation  of  haemorrhage  to  thrombocytopenia  or  to  other  haemostatic  defect  secondary  to dasatinib is not fully clarified.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

##  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The  higher  cCCyR  within  12  months  achieved  with  dasatinib  as  compared  to  imatinib  are  very promising results indicating substantial higher efficacy for the second generation TKI dasatinib as compared with the hitherto standard of care of patients with newly diagnosed CMP-CP.

The observed safety profile for dasatinib in the pivotal study was consistent with the known safety profile.  There  are  so  far  no  indications  that  dasatinib  has  any  detrimental  effects  on  OS  as compared to imatinib.

##  Benefit-risk balance

In  conclusion  treatment  of  first  line  CML-CP  subjects  show  clear  superiority  of  efficacy  in  the dasatinib  group  compared  to  the  imatinib  group.  Long  term  efficacy  results  are  warranted,  and should be submitted postapproval. The safety profile of dasatinib is in some aspects different from that of imatinib but not worse, and overall manageable.

## 1.5.1. Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Sprycel is not similar to Glivec and Tasigna within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 (See appendix 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.6. Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Sprycel in the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of this extension of indication.

In  addition,  the  CHMP,  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  141/2000,  considers Sprycel not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000) to Glivec and Tasigna for the same therapeutic indication.

Furthermore, the CHMP takes note that the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan is not fully completed yet as only some of the measures are completed.

## User consultation

The MAH provided a justification for not performing a consultation with target patients groups, for the submitted application. In line with EMA guideline, and within the scope of the current proposed changes, the MAH considered as not necessary to conduct another consultation with target patient groups for the package leaflet of SPRYCEL (dasatinib) for this pertaining Type II new indication, and proposed to perform a readability test based on an approved PL (resulting from this Type II variation and the recently completed line extension EMEA/H/C/709/X/22, commission decision on 30  September  2010)  for  its  inclusion into  the  upcoming  5-year  renewal  application.  The justification provided by the MAH was endorsed.
