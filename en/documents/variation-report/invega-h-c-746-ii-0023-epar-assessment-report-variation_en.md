## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Schizoaffective disorder is a common, chronic, and disabling mental illness. Schizoaffective disorder as defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria has  features  of  both  schizophrenia-including  2  or  more  of  the  following  symptoms:  hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviour, or negative symptomsand prominent affective symptoms consistent with major depression or mania 1 . According to DSM-IV, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is made when the symptom criteria for schizophrenia are met and during  the  same  continuous  period  there  is  a  major  depressive  episode,  manic  episode,  or  mixed episode. During that same period, hallucinations or delusions must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms.

Schizoaffective  disorder  includes  all  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  a  manic  episode  and/or  a  major depressive episode, in addition to the presence of  symptoms  consistent with schizophrenia. Nevertheless,  the clinical features of schizoaffective disorder differ from  bipolar disorder  and schizophrenia  in  important  ways,  including  prognosis  and  approaches  to  treatment.  The  course  of schizoaffective disorder is ill  defined,  with  overall  prognosis  appearing  to  be  intermediate  to  that  of schizophrenia and affective disorders 2 .

The  lifetime  prevalence  of  schizoaffective  disorder  ranges  from  0.3%  to  0.8% 3 .  The  incidences  of schizoaffective  disorder  and  schizophrenia  were  approximately  24%  and  32%,  respectively,  among frequent users of mental health services 4 .

Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder have similarities in terms of symptoms, comorbidities, and genetic risk. Thus, atypical antipsychotics may be particularly useful in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. However, currently there is no antipsychotic that has been approved for use in this indication in the European Union (EU).

In this type II variation, the MAH initially applied for an extension of indication of Invega as follows:

'Treatment of schizoaffective disorder as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants.'

Furthermore, the MAH requested consideration of this application under Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC)  No  726/2004  and  submitted  a  justification  that  the  application  concerns  a  new  therapeutic indication which is claimed to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

Invega prolonged release tablets (Paliperidone ER) are currently approved in the European Union (EU) for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  with  recommended dose of 6 mg once daily. Dosage adjustment may be required within the recommended range of 3-12 mg once daily.

Paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) belongs to the class of atypical antipsychotics and is the major metabolite of risperidone, used for the treatment of schizophrenia.

## 1.2. Non clinical aspects

## Environmental risk assessment (ERA)

The  MAH  predicted  that  based  on  available  epidemiological  studies,  the  approval  of  the  proposed indication  will  not  significantly  increase  the  use  of  paliperidone  in  the  EU.    Taking  into  account  the updated calculation of the PEC refinement based on actual use of the product and that in the studies, both patients with schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia were included, the ERA was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

The development program completed to support the proposed extension of indication consisted of:

-  Two  Phase  I  studies  to  investigate  the  possible  interactions  between  divalproex  sodium  and paliperidone in healthy subjects (R076477-BIM-1003) and in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder or schizoaffective disorder (R076477-BIM-1004), when coadministered;

-  Two  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  6  week,  Phase  III  studies,  to assess the efficacy and safety with 2 dose levels(R076477-SCA-3001) 5  and flexible doses (R076477SCA-3002) 6  of paliperidone

Additionally, the MAH also provided some pharmacokinetic (PK) data from patients with schizoaffective disorder  and  the  results  from  an  in  vitro  induction  study  (FK5875),  previously  submitted  in  the withdrawn application (EMEA/H/C/746/II/19).

A Phase 3b safety and tolerability study (SCH-4005) in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and with active hepatic disease is also currently ongoing.

In April and May 2009, the MAH sought national scientific advices at the MPA and BfARM, respectively on  whether  the  proposed  clinical  program  could  support  a  claim  for  an  indication  in  schizoaffective disorder. During the national scientific advices, the main considerations were related to the following requirements: sensitivity  analysis  related  to  efficacy  (responder  analysis);  subgroup  analyses  for  1) the  primary  endpoint  with  subjects  who  had  major  depression  or  mania,  2)  for  co-medication (antidepressants (AD) only, mood stabilizers (MS) only, AD and MS, neither AD or MS); consistency on both  PANSS  positive  and  negative  symptoms;  generalisibility  of  the  data  to  the  EU  population  and adequate supportive data (e.g dose finding studies) on the proposed dosing regimen.

## 1.3.1 Pharmacokinetics

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## 1) Study R076477-BIM-1003

This was an open label, 2-treatment, single-sequence study in 24 healthy men (one subject withdrew consent).

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of divalproex sodium (VPA) at steady state on the PK of a single dose of paliperidone ER (12 mg). The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of a single dose of 12 mg paliperidone ER on the steady-state PK of divalproex sodium ER.

Divalproex  sodium  ER  (extended  release)  increased  the  plasma  exposure  of  paliperidone  by  an estimated  51%  (Cmax:  maximum  plasma  concentration)  and  52%  (AUC0-∞:  area  under  the  plasma

5 hereafter referred to as SCA-3001

6 hereafter referred to as SCA-3002

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinite time). Median Tmax for paliperidone was approximately 24 hours for both treatments. The estimated half-life of paliperidone was not different between the treatments (mean 23.5 hours for paliperidone alone and 24.0 hours for paliperidone + VPA).

VPA steady-state concentrations were similar after administration of divalproex sodium ER alone and after co-administration of  paliperidone ER and divalproex sodium ER. The treatment ratios for Cmax,ss (maximum plasma concentration during a dosing interval at steady state) and AUCτ  (area under the plasma  concentration-time  curve  during  a  dosing  interval)  were  close  to  100%.  The  90%  CIs (confidence intervals) for  geometric  mean  ratios  of  AUCτ  and  Cmax,  ss  (maximum  plasma concentration during a dosing interval at steady state) fell within 80% and 125%.

The frequency of the adverse events (AEs) were 35 % for the combination (paliperidone+VPA) and 79 % for paliperidone alone.

## 2) Study R076477-BIM-1004

This was an open label, single-sequence, PK drug-drug interaction study of oral paliperidone ER coadministered with oral divalproex sodium ER (DEPAKOTE ®  ER, Abbott) in clinically stable subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder or schizoaffective disorder who were on valproate therapy.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential effect of multiple doses of paliperidone

## ER tablets on the steady-state PK of VPA.

Fourteen of the 17 enrolled subjects completed the study as per the study protocol and three subjects were withdrawn due to an adverse event, withdrawal of consent, and the third due to a positive test for cocaine. One subject did not fast for 10 hours before intake of divalproex sodium on Day 7 and plasma  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  for  VPA  were  excluded  from  descriptive  statistics  and statistical analyses.

Mean  VPA  steady-state  concentration-time  profiles  were  comparable  after  co-administration  of paliperidone ER and divalproex sodium ER and after administration of divalproex sodium ER alone.

Plasma  VPA  steady-state  concentrations  were  similar  after  administration  of  divalproex  sodium  ER alone and after co-administration with paliperidone ER. Mean AUCτ and Cmax,ss values were similar for both treatments.The VPA treatment ratios for Cmax,ss and AUCτ were close to 100%. The 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratios of AUCτ and Cmax,ss fell within 80 and 125%.

The  number  of  subjects  who  reported  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  higher  during  treatment  with paliperidone ER plus divalproex sodium ER than during treatment with divalproex sodium ER alone (63 versus (vs). 18%). One subject experienced a serious adverse event (blood creatinine increased), and one subject was discontinued from study due to a non-serious adverse event (akathisia). The increase in  blood  creatinine  was  based  on  an  isolated  laboratory  finding,  without  clinical  signs  of  acute  renal impairment, and the finding was considered by the laboratory as likely recorded in error.

## · Additional pharmacokinetic analysis

No specific PK studies have been conducted in patients with schizoaffective disorder and no plasma samples  were  taken  from  the  Phase  III  studies  included  in  this  variation  application.  In  two schizophrenia  studies  previously  submitted  (SCH-102  and  SCH-1014),  patients  with  schizoaffective disorder were allowed for inclusion and some PK data were obtained in these studies.

A total of thirteen subjects with schizoaffective disorder (5 from Study SCH- 102 and 8 from Study SCH-1014) and 58 subjects with schizophrenia (27 from Study SCH-102 and 31 from Study SCH-1014) were included in this subgroup analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results  indicated  that  no  pharmacokinetic  differences  between  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder and those with schizophrenia were observed.

## · In vitro metabolism

An in vitro induction study (Study FK5875) has been performed, to assess the effect of paliperidone on the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes.

Omeprazole  led  to  a  13-fold  increase  in  CYP1A2  activity  compared  to  vehicle  alone.  Rifampicinmediated induction of CYP2C19 activity, led to a moderate, but significant 2-fold increase compared to vehicle  alone.  Rifampicin  led  to  a  moderate,  but  significant  2.3-fold  increase  of  CYP3A4  function compared to vehicle alone. Paliperidone did not induce, nor inhibit, CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4.

## · Discussion on pharmacokinetic aspects

A single paliperidone ER dose or multiple dosing with paliperidone ER did not affect VPA steady state concentrations.

In the multiple dose paliperidone ER study (R076477-BIM-1004), different VPA doses (500 to 2000 mg once daily) were administered, but since all subjects remained on a stable dose of VPA throughout the study, this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Multiple dosing with paliperidone ER 12 mg/day did not affect the pharmacokinetics of VPA. The paliperidone dose used in this study was the highest recommended dosage in both schizophrenia and the schizoaffective disorder indications.

However,  in  the  single  dose  paliperidone  ER  study  (R076477-BIM-1003),  an  effect  of  VPA  coadministration was observed with approximately 50% higher exposure to paliperidone. According to the MAH, the most likely mechanism behind the observed increase in exposure an absorption-based interaction:  a  prolongation  of  the  gastric  residence  time  of  the  paliperidone  ER  tablet  could  have extended  the  time  for  paliperidone  absorption  in  the  small  intestine,  and  thus,  increased  the bioavailability.  It  was  also  hypothesized  that  prolongation  of  the  gastric  residence  time  in  those subjects who showed the highest treatment ratio of AUC and Cmax may have been caused by a physical phenomenon  such  as  swelling  of  the  divalproex  sodium  ER  tablets,  which  might  have  prevented passage through the pylorus.

In  the  CHMP's  view,  Invega  is  an  OROS  (oral  osmotic  system)  formulation,  and  it  is  known  that concomitant intake with a high-fat meal increases the bioavailability by 50-60%, which is also thought to be due to an effect on gastric emptying and consequently a larger time for absorption in the small intestine. Even if both formulations used in this interaction study are ER and the divalproex sodium ER tablet, it seems rather unlikely that the size increase (due to swelling) would be so extensive that it would affect passage through the pylorus. The CHMP therefore considered that the mechanism behind the observed interaction was not completely clear and recommended that information based on the study results could be reflected into the SPC.

In  study  R076477-BIM-1003,  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  observed  were  consistent  with  the  known safety profile of divalproex sodium ER  and paliperidone ER tablets and the combined treatment did not result in a higher incidence of  AEs due to an increase in plasma concentrations of paliperidone.

No interaction study with lithium has been performed. Although an interaction between paliperidone and  lithium  does  not  seem  theoretically  plausible,  the  CHMP  recommended  this  information  to  be reflected into the SPC.

The potential for paliperidone to induce CYPs 1A2, 2C19 and 3A4 was also investigated in an in vitro study  (FK5875),  including  positive  controls.  No  induction  was  observed  with  paliperidone.  The rifampicin-mediated induction was relatively low, being approximately 2-fold for both CYP 2C19 and 3A4, while omeprazole caused a 13-fold induction of CYP1A2. The small effect observed with rifampicin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indicates that the study may not be very sensitive in detecting an inducing effect. Considering that the rifampicin induction effect was very small, the validity of the study for assessment of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 induction is questioned and therefore the CHMP still maintained its recommendation for non inclusion of this information into the SPC.

## 1.3.2 Clinical efficacy

## · Main clinical studies

Two  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  6  week,  Phase  III  studies  were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety with 2 dose levels (SCA-3001) and flexible doses (SCA3002) of paliperidone.

Studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 were multicenter and conducted in the US, India (both SCA-3001 and SCA-3002),  Russia  and  Ukraine  (SCA-3001),  Asia  and  Romania  (SCA-3002)  with  a  majority  of  US patients included in these studies. The design was similar in the two studies.

## METHODS

## Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria

Patients who enrolled were: male or female, 18 to 65 years of age; fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder; experiencing an acute exacerbation with a Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale  (PANSS) score of at least 60; presenting a score of &gt; 4 on at least 2 of the PANSS items ( Hostility,  Excitement,  Tension,  Uncooperativeness,  and  Poor  Impulse  Control)  at  screening  and randomisation, and presenting a score of &gt;16 on the Young Mania rating Scale (YMRS) and/or a score of &gt;16 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21) at screening and randomisation.

Key exclusion criteria were: meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or schizophreniform disorder; currently meeting criteria for any other Axis I diagnosis except  substance  abuse;  meeting  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for  substance  dependence  in  the  6  months before  study  entry,  an  Axis  II  diagnosis  of  Mental  Retardation  or  Borderline  Personality  Disorder; suicide attempt within 12 months or at imminent risk of suicide according to the investigator's clinical judgement, and first episode (no prior history of psychotic symptoms).

## Randomisation and Blinding

Randomisation  was  centralised  with  randomly  permuted  blocks  and  stratified  by  site  and  by concomitant  treatment  with  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  versus  no  such  concomitant treatment.The capsules of study drug, including placebo, were identical in appearance. To further keep the blind, post-baseline prolactin levels were not available to the investigators or the sponsor during the course of the study.

## Treatment period

After a screening and wash-out period of 2-5 days, eligible patients were randomised to 6 weeks of double-blind  treatment  with  paliperidone  ER  or  placebo.  The  patients  were  hospitalised  during  the wash-out period and at least for the first 8 days of double-blind treatment.

In  study  SCA-3001  the  patients  were  assigned  to  a  low  or  high  dose-group  of  paliperidone  ER  or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio, while in study SCA-3002 the patients were assigned to paliperidone ER in a flexible dose regimen or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.

In  the  low  or  high  dose  comparison  to  placebo  (study  SCA-3001),  paliperidone  ER  treated  patients were started on 12 or 6 mg/day. During the first 15 days the dose could be reduced once to 9 and 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg, respectively. After at least 4 days on a reduced dose, the dose could be increased to the original dose.

In  the  flexible  dose  study    (study  SCA-3002),  paliperidone  ER  treated  patients  were  started  on  6 mg/day for 4 days, and thereafter the dose could be adjusted between 3 and 12 mg/day until Day 15.

In neither of the studies dose adjustment was allowed after the Day 15 visit.

## Primary/Secondary Endpoints

The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included: change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS-24; change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS subscales and factor scores; actual and change from baseline to Week 6 in Clinical Global Impression of Severity for Schizoaffective disorder (CGI-C-SCA); CGI of Change-SCA (CGI-C-SCA) at week 6; responder rate (defined as the percentage of patients with &gt;30% reduction from baseline in PANSS total score and a CGI-C-SCA &lt;2 at week 6); change from baseline to Week 6 in HAM-D-21; change from baseline to Week 6 in YMRS.

## Statistical Method

All  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  with  the  Intent-To-Treat  (ITT)  analysis  set  which  included  all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had both a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline PANSS assessment.

The primary endpoint and all other variables measuring change from baseline were analysed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, concomitant treatment stratum and country as fixed factors and baseline score as covariate. The treatment effect was estimated with the difference between LS means with accompanying 95% confidence interval.

The responder data were analysed with the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for concomitant medication stratum and country.

In the three-armed study (SCA-3001) the overall type I error was controlled with the Hochberg stepup  procedure.  All  secondary  analyses  were  considered  supportive  and  no  further  adjustments  for multiplicity were planned.

In all analyses the primary approach for imputation of missing values was the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method. Alternative analyses were performed with a repeated measures mixed effects model (MMRM), and analyses where increasingly worse (up to 20 %) LOCF values were imputed for missing values in the active treatment group while the originally imputed LOCF value was kept for the placebo group.

## RESULTS

## 1) Study SCA-3001

## Patient characteristics

Three hundred and eighty seven patients were enrolled, and of these 316 were randomised to a low or high dose of paliperidone ER, or placebo. Almost all patients were included in the ITT populations. The withdrawal rate was dose-dependent with more discontinuations on placebo (41.1%)  and lower doses (33.9%), mainly due to lack of effect and withdrawal of consent.

Demographic characteristics were similar for the three treatment groups with the exception of body weight and body mass index (BMI), which were higher in the placebo group especially compared to the paliperidone ER low dose group.

A significant difference versus placebo was observed for the paliperidone ER high dose group for the primary endpoint PANSS Total score while a significant result was not achieved for the low dose group (Table 5 and Figure 1).

For the key secondary variables PANSS-24, HAM-D-21, YMRS, responders and percentage of patient much or very much approved on the CGI-C-SCA scale, there was an overall pattern of significant or nearly significant results in favour of both dose groups versus placebo with a clear tendency of dose response (Table 5).

Although there was no statistical evidence of a differential effect depending on whether the patient was on  concomitant  treatment  with  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  or  not  (treatment-byconcomitant medication interaction, p-value=0.641), the effect was clearly less pronounced  and not reaching statistical significance for patients on concomitant treatment (see Figure 2).

Neither  was  there  any  statistical  evidence  of  a  differential  effect  with  respect  to  country  or geographical region. However there is some tendency of a lower effect in US patients compared to Non-US patients (Table 6).

## 2) Study SCA-3002

## Patient characteristics

Three hundred and ninety one patients were enrolled, and of these 311 were randomised to flexibly dosed paliperidone ER (3-12 mg), or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The withdrawal rate was higher on placebo (45.3%) versus active treatment (38%,) mainly due to lack of effect.

The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to demographic characteristics as well as with respect to baseline severity.

Baseline ratings and psychiatric history are presented in Tables 7 and 8.

A significant difference comparable to the difference seen for the high dose in study SCA-3001 was observed for flexibly dose paliperidone ER versus placebo.

All key secondary efficacy variables were statistically significant in favour of paliperidone ER.

There was no statistical evidence of a treatment-by concomitant medication interaction (p=0.486) and the difference versus placebo was statistically significant for both strata (Figure 4).

Neither was there any statistical evidence of country or regional difference but similar to study SCA3001 the magnitude of effect tended to be lower for US patients compared to Non-US patients (Table 11).

## · Supportive studies

There  are  no  studies  demonstrating  an  effect  beyond  6  weeks  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective disorder.  To  support  the  maintenance  of  the  effect,  the  MAH  referred  to  the  data  establishing maintenance of effect in the initial CHMP approval of the schizophrenia indication, primarily a relapse prevention study (SCH-301), with some support from open-label extension studies (SCH-701, SCH703, SCH-704 and SCH-705) conducted in schizophrenia. In study SCH-301, patients responding to 14 weeks open label paliperidone treatment were randomised to continue on active treatment or placebo. Roughly twice as many patients had a relapse on placebo compared with paliperidone (see Figure 5).

## Figure 5

In the 4 open label studies, flexible doses of paliperidone ER were administered covering the range 3 to  15  mg.  The  combined  intent-to-treat  analysis  sets  of  the  4  studies  included  a  total  of  1,309 subjects,  among  whom  895  received  paliperidone  ER  for  greater  than  6  months  and  571  received paliperidone  ER  for  more  than  1  year.  In  all  studies,  the  mean  PANSS  total  score  decreased  from baseline (open-label) to end point.

In  study  SCH-703,  improvement  during  the  open-label  treatment  phase  was  more  prominent  for subjects treated with placebo during the double-blind phase, although incremental improvement was also noted in subjects previously treated with paliperidone ER and olanzapine.

In  study  SCH-704,  subjects  entering  the  open-label  phase  had  previously  experienced  statistically significant  decreases  in  the  mean  PANSS  total  score  during  double-blind  treatment.  Despite  this improvement  already  realized  at  the  start  of  the  open-label  phase,  continued  improvement  was observed during open-label treatment. Improvement  during the open-label phase was most pronounced in  subjects  previously  treated  with  double-blind  placebo,  as  these  subjects  had  notably higher PANSS scores at open-label baseline.

In study SCH-705, subjects previously treated with double-blind placebo had the most improvement.

In  study  SCH-701,  the  largest  treatment  effect  during  the  open-label  extension  was  observed  in subjects  treated  with  double-blind  placebo,  as  these  subjects  had  notably  higher  PANSS  scores  at open-label baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH also referred to studies with the mother compound risperidone in which schizophrenia as well as schizoaffective patients have been studied (RIS-USA-79, RSI-SCH-401, RIS-INT-57) and the Vieta et  al  study  (2001).  Comparative  pharmacokinetic  data  were  also  presented  to  further  support  this proposed extrapolation.

In  study  RIS-USA-79  stable  outpatients  fulfilling  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for  chronic  schizophrenia  or schizoaffective disorder were randomised to at least one year double-blind treatment with risperidone 2-8  mg/day  (median  modal  dose  4  mg)  or  haloperidol  5-20  mg/day  (median  modal  dose  10  mg). Primary endpoint was time to relapse with relapse defined as clinical deterioration, increased level of care, or violence towards self and/or others.  Overall the result was in favour of risperidone and the magnitude  of  effect  was  similar  in  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  and  in  patients  with schizophrenia (Table 12).

## Table 12 Relapse rates in the overall population and the two sub-populations in study RISUSA-79.

In  a  12  months  double-blind  study  (RSI-SCH-401)  comparing  two  doses  of  risperidone  long-acting injection in subjects with stable schizoaffective disorder (n=66) or stable schizophrenia (n=258) similar relapse rates (15% vs 22%, respectively) were observed.

In  a  12  months  open  label  study  (RSI-INT-57)  comparing  three  doses  of  risperidone  long-acting injection in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, improvements in PANSS total score were  statistically  significant  (p≤0.004)  at  each  time  point  in  all  3  dose  groups  for  subjects  with schizophrenia  Similarly,  for  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder,  the  improvement  in  PANSS  total score in each dose group was statistically significant (p≤0.029) at each time point.

In the Vieta et al. study (2001),  a long-term (6-month) open-label adjunctive study of risperidone in 541 subjects with bipolar I disorder (55% of subjects), schizoaffective disorder, bipolar subtype (34%), bipolar  II  disorder  (8%),  or  bipolar  disorder  not  otherwise  specified  (3%),  statistically  significant improvements  from  baseline  in  all  efficacy  measures  (YMRS,  HAM-D,  PANSS  total  score,  PANSS subfactors, and Clinical Global Impression) at the 6-month end point were observed. Mean (SD) scores on the YMRS decreased from 25.6 (10.7) at baseline to 2.4 (4.6) at end point (p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 10). Mean (SD) HAM-D scores declined from 12.8 (7.9) at baseline to 4.1 (4.8) at 6 months (p&lt;0.001).

Further  long-term  clinical  studies  with  paliperidone  ER  and  other  related  compounds  (paliperidone palmitate,  risperdal  consta),  conducted  either  in  bipolar  I  disorder,  schizophrenia  or  treatment resistant  depression,  were  referred  by  the  MAH  as  supportive  data.  All  of  these  populations  had  at least one symptom domain of schizoaffective disorder (psychosis, mania and depression).

In  the  schizophrenia  study  PSY-3001,  subjects  were  treated  with  flexible  doses  of  paliperidone palmitate  in  a  9-week  transition  phase,  followed  by  a  12-week  maintenance  phase.  The  dose  of paliperidone palmitate was fixed in a second 12-week period of the maintenance phase. Those subjects who  continued  to  achieve  symptom  response  were  then  randomly  assigned  to  continue  with  fixed doses of paliperidone palmitate or were switched to placebo. Results are presented in Figure 6.

## Figure 6

In the Bipolar I disorder study BIM-3004, treatment periods consisted of a 3-week double-blind acute treatment  phase;  a  12-week  double-blind  continuation  phase;  a  double-blind  maintenance  phase (lasting until the subject experiences a recurrence); and a follow-up phase. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to paliperidone ER or olanzapine (for assay sensitivity) in the double-blind acute treatment phase of the study. Paliperidone ER was dosed once daily in a flexible dosage range of 3 to 12  mg/d  to  optimize  each  subject's  level  of  clinical  response  and  tolerability  of  the  study  drug. Subjects who achieved a clinical response (i.e., a reduction from baseline [Day 1] in YMRS total score of  ≥50%)  at  the  end  of  the  3-  week  acute  treatment  phase  entered  the  double-blind  continuation phase. At the end of the 12-week continuation phase, all subjects in the paliperidone ER treatment arm who achieved remission (i.e., YMRS ≤12 and MADRS ≤12) for each of the last 3 weeks of the phase were re-randomly assigned to paliperidone ER or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Results are presented in Figure 7.

In the Bipolar I disorder study RIS-BIM-3003, treatment periods consisted of 3 weeks of open-label oral risperidone treatment ; 26 weeks of open-label stabilization on risperidal consta; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period with risperidal consta treatment (up to 24 months); and an 8week  open-label  extension  with  risperidal  consta.  Subjects  who  met  criteria  for  an  initial  response during open-label oral risperidone treatment were eligible to enter the 26-week open-label stabilization on risperidal consta. Subjects who entered double-blind treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a continuation of the dose of risperidal consta (25, 37.5, or 50 mg) they received at the end of the open-label stabilization period or placebo injections every 2 weeks for up to 24 months. Results are presented in Figure 8.

In the Bipolar I disorder study RIS-BIP-302, subjects had 4 or more mood episodes in the 12 months prior the study entry. Following a 16-week, open-label stabilization phase with risperidal consta plus treatment  as  usual  (TAU),  remitted  subjects  entered  a  52-week,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled relapse prevention phase. Randomly assigned subjects continued treatment with adjunctive risperdal consta  (25-50  mg  every  2  weeks)  plus  TAU  or  switched  to  adjunctive  placebo  injection  plus  TAU. Results are presented in Figure 9.

In the treatment resistant depression study RIS-INT-93, all subjects entered the first portion of the study  in  a  4-  to  6-week  phase  to  confirm  resistance  using  open-label  citalopram  treatment.  Those subjects with a suboptimal response defined as &lt;50% reduction in 17-item HAM-D score) were eligible to  enter  the  open-label  risperidone  augmentation  phase  (0.25-2.0  mg/d)  for  4  to  6  weeks.  Those subjects who demonstrated a clinical response to risperidone augmentation (defined as HAM-D score ≤7 or CGI-S ≤2) were eligible to enter the 24-week double-blind phase. In the double-blind phase, subjects  either  continued  receiving  risperidone  plus  citalopram  or  were  switched  to  placebo  plus citalopram.Results are presented in Figure 10.

## · Choice of the Dose

The  MAH  recommended  6  mg  once  a  day  for  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder  with  the possibility to adjust the dose between 3 and 12 mg/day.

In the CHMP's view, the low dose, particularly 3 mg, is not supported by the clinical studies, as study SCA-3001  clearly  favored  the  high  dose  group.  Also  a  dose  recommendation  for  3  mg  cannot  be deduced  from  study  SCA-3002,  as  only  single  cases  received  3mg/d  and  30-35%  patients  each received 6mg, 9mg or 12mg/d as final dose.

Following MAH's justifications on dosing recommendation, the CHMP was still of the opinion that the low dose could not be recommended. In study SCA-3001, the low dose (6 mg/d, with option to reduce to 3mg/d) was not efficacious with a mean change in PANSS of -27.4 vs -21.7 (placebo group) (p= 0.187). In the other pivotal study SCA-3002 only 3 out of 304 patients (1%) were treated with the 3 mg dose in study SCA-3002. The CHMP recommended to modify the proposed posology in the SPC accordingly.

## · Additional analyses

At  the  CHMP's  request,  analyses  from  pivotal  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002  were  performed  to compare the efficacy in the sub-groups defined as 'antidepressants only' and 'mood stabilisers only'. Primary endpoint results were presented in Figure 11:

## Figure 11

A  post-hoc  analysis  from  pooled  pivotal  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002  was  also  conducted measuring changes from baseline for YMRS and HAM-D and PANSS total scores for 3 subgroups of subjects: with prominent manic symptoms at baseline (defined as YMRS total score ≥16), prominent depressive symptoms at baseline (defined as HAM-D total score ≥16), or mixed symptoms at baseline (defined as both YMRS and HAM-D total scores ≥16). Results are summarised in tables 13-15:

(-13.5,-3.4) The ANCOVA model included treatment, protocol, country-within-protocol, and concomitant medication as fixed effects,and baseline value as a covariate.

Further analyses were also performed excluding patients on prohibited additional antipsychotics prior to the last PANSS assessment (see Tables 16, 17 and Figure 12).

Additionally, post-hoc responder analyses that considered subjects who discontinued from the study as non-responders showed that at week 6, the proportions of subjects who responded to treatment were statistically significantly greater than placebo for studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 (34.6% and 23.7%, respectively)  in  the  ER  groups  (SCA-3001:  55.1%,  p=0.002  for  the  high  dose  group;  SCA-3002: 35.7%, p=0.048 for the flexible dose group). However, the proportion of subjects who responded to treatment  was  not  statistically  significant  over  the  placebo  in  the  paliperidone  ER  low  dose  group (45.2%;  p=0.067)  for  study  SCA-3001.  Same  analyses  excluding  subjects  receiving  prohibited concomitant  antipsychotic  medication  prior  to  the  last  PANSS  assessment  during  the  study  showed similar results.

Analyses comparing sub-groups defined as 'concomitant use of lithium' and 'no concomitant use of lithium' were performed in subjects with prominent depressive symptoms for HAM-D total score and in subjects with prominent manic symptoms for YRMS total score. Results are summarised in Tables 18 and 19, respectively.

ANCOVA=analysis of covariance

Cross-reference: Attachment G.2

The p value for interaclion is from an ANCOVA model with fixed effects for trealment, lithium use, shudy identifier, country nested within study identifier, interaction of treatment and lithium use, and with baseline value as a covariate.

For  the  subgroup  of  subjects  who  used  lithium  during  the  study,  the  mean  improvement  in  the paliperidone ER group was numerically smaller than in the placebo group (-18.1 vs. -18.5), while for the subgroup of subjects who did not receive lithium the numerical differences between paliperidone ER and placebo (-24.8 vs. -16.4) favoured paliperidone ER.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

In  two  placebo-controlled  short-term  phase  3  studies,  statistically  significant  effect  in  favour  of paliperidone ER for the primary endpoint PANSS Total score was shown. The clinical relevance of the results is illustrated in responder analyses showing differences versus placebo of 22 and 12.5 %-units for  the  two  studies,  respectively.  The  validity  of  these  effects  for  schizoaffective  patients  are substantiated  in  analyses  of  secondary  endpoints,  including  PANSS-24  which  consist  of  the  PANSS items  corresponding  to  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for  schizoaffective  disorder,  and  clinically  relevant reductions  of  depressive  and  manic  symptoms  in  patients  with  pronounced  affective  symptoms  at baseline.

In  study  SCA-3001,  an  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  9-12  mg/day  (high  dose  group)  has  been demonstrated  for  the  primary  endpoint  with  consistent  support  in  the  analyses  of  the  secondary endpoints.

In study SCA-3002, an effect of flexibly dosed (3-12 mg/day) paliperidone ER has been demonstrated.

The  number  of  EU  patients  studied  was  limited  (81  patients  from  Romania).Otherwise  the  study population is dominated by US patients (with a potentially less pronounced effect), and Asian patients. After  a  subgroup  analysis  (EU  Caucasians  vs  US  Caucasians)  performed  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP considered  these  results  to  be  sufficiently  supportive  of  the  external  validity  of  the  two  short-term studies.

However, the CHMP raised major concerns regarding the comparative efficacy data between monotherapy  and  combination  with  anti-depressives-mood  stabilizers,  as  presented  by  the  MAH.  For instance,  in  study  SCA-3001,  although  no  statistical  evidence  of  a  differential  effect  depending  on whether the patient was on concomitant treatment with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers or not (treatment-by-concomitant  medication  interaction,  p-value=0.641)  was  observed,  the  change  in PANSS  Total  score  was  clearly  less  pronounced  not  reaching  statistical  significance  for  patients  on concomitant  treatment(see  Figure  2).  Moreover,  apart  from  PANSS  total  score,  which  reflects  the schizophrenia component, the CHMP considered that information was required in both settings about the effect on the affective component (mania, depression).

Following the above major concern, the MAH performed a post-hoc analysis pooling the pivotal studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002. In the pooled analysis, clinically relevant effects on PANSS and YMRS total scores were demonstrated in patients with mood stabilizers only and in patients with antidepressants only.  The  CHMP  noted  that  no  effect  is  observed  in  patients  on  both  mood  stabilizers  and antidepressants. However, this observation is based on 50 patients in total and must be interpreted with caution. In subgroup analyses of the pooled studies, highly significant effects on PANSS and YMRS total  scores  have  been  demonstrated  for  patients  with  prominent  manic  symptoms,  prominent depressive symptoms, as well as in patients with prominent mixed symptoms. The point estimates of difference in the least-squares (LS) mean changes from baseline for the YMRS and PANSS total scores were respectively : -4.8 and -8.2 (prominent manic symptoms at baseline); -3.1 and -7.9 (prominent depressive symptoms) and -4.2 and -8.5 (prominent mixed symptoms). The magnitude of effect for all endpoints was considered by the CHMP clinically relevant and comparable to other studies of acute treatment in schizophrenia, manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and major depressive episodes, respectively. As expected the effect on manic symptoms is less pronounced in patients with prominent depressive symptoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Prior  to  any  final  conclusions  on  the  above,  further  analyses  were  required,  excluding  patients  on prohibited  additional  antipsychotics  prior  to  PANSS  total  score  assessment.  Results  (see  Figure  12) were consistent with the earlier analyses (Figures 2 and 4) in the 'no concomitant medication' stratum. In  both  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002  using  the  pre-specified  and  post-hoc  responder  analyses, paliperidone ER had a statistically favourable effect on the proportion of responders relative to placebo among subjects with schizoaffective disorder. Same analyses excluding subjects receiving prohibited concomitant  antipsychotic  medication  prior  to  the  last  PANSS  assessment  during  the  study  showed similar results.

The  overall  effect  of  lithium  in  the  pivotal  studies  was  also  questioned  by  the  CHMP  and  subgroup analyses were performed by the MAH in subjects with prominent depressive symptoms for HAM-D total score  and  in  subjects  with  prominent  manic  symptoms  for  YRMS  total  score  and  in  all  subjects  for PANSS total score to address this point. In total, 29 patients on paliperidone ER and 22 on placebo received at least one dose of lithium meaning 11% of subjects in the placebo group and 7% of subjects in  the  combined  paliperidone  ER  group  used  lithium  during  the  phase  III  studies.  With  respect  to affective  symptoms  rated  with  HAM-D  and  YMRS  total  scores,  there  were  no  major  numerical differences in magnitude of effect between patients with no concomitant lithium use and patients with any lithium use, and no indication of a treatment by lithium use interaction (see Tables 18 and 19). In contrast,  for  psychotic  symptoms  rated  with  PANSS  Total  Score,  the  effect  seen  in  the  overall population  is  entirely  attributed  to  the  subgroup  with  no  lithium  use.  However,  due  to  the  limited number of patients, the CHMP considered that no reliable conclusions can be drawn on this issue.

To further support the effect of paliperidone ER as monotherapy or add-on treatment in schizoaffective disorder, indirect comparison of efficacy results between paliperidone ER and other antipsychotics from available  clinical  studies  in  this  population  was  also  conducted  by  the  MAH.  However,  the  CHMP considered this analysis of limited value. The CHMP noted that only 2 published randomised, doubleblind studies comparing an antipsychotic versus an antidepressant or mood stabilizer were identified7 .

The proposed initial extrapolation of available long term data from the schizophrenia studies and from the  studies  with  the  mother  compound  risperidone  (performed  in  schizophrenia  and  schizoaffective disorder)  to  support  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective disorder  was  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  The  pivotal  studies  had  a  maximum  length  of  6  weeks  and longer-term maintenance studies were not included in the development program. Although pharmacokinetic  data  were  presented  to  support  the  extrapolation  using  the  mother  compound risperidone,  all  schizophrenia  long  term  studies  with  paliperidone  ER  had  an  open-label  design  and neither  risperidone  or  comparators  used  in  the  proposed  supportive  long  term  studies  have  been authorised in schizoaffective disorder.

In light of the above major concern related to extrapolation of long term data to support the long-term maintenance  of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective  disorder  and  on  the  basis  of  the available  data  to  date,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  Central  Nervous  System  Scientific  Advisory Group  (SAG-CNS)  to  discuss  the  need  for  long-term  efficacy  data  for  paliperidone  in  the  applied indication. The SAG-CNS was held on 13 July 2010 and the main conclusions were the following:

- Ideally, long-term studies in the target population with outcome scales validated for schizoaffective disorder  should  have  been  performed.  However,  in  the  absence  of  such  studies,  it  was  considered reasonable  that  there  is  maintenance  of  effect  on  psychotic  symptoms  during  prolonged  treatment since the psychotic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder are similar to those in schizophrenia. Thus, this was considered a valid extrapolation.

A double-blind study of adjunctive carbamazepine versus placebo on excited states of schizophrenic and schizoaffective disorders. Acta Psychiatr Scand 1989;80:250-9.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The group was convinced that there is good evidence of maintenance of effect on manic symptoms. From the submitted documentation, the SAG-CNS is not convinced that there is a clinically significant effect on depressive symptoms. The HAM-D scale is not validated for measuring depressive symptoms in  schizophrenia  and  related  disorders.  Other  assessment  scales  which  have  been  validated  should have been considered (i.e. the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia). There was no evidence for a tachyphylactic mechanism.

To further address the above major concern, additional long-term clinical studies with paliperidone ER and other related compounds (paliperidone palmitate, risperdal consta), conducted either in bipolar I disorder,  schizophrenia  or  treatment  resistant  depression,  were  referred  by  the  MAH  as  supportive data. All of these populations had at least one symptom domain of schizoaffective disorder (psychosis, mania and depression).

An oral explanation took place on 20 July 2010. In the MAH's view:

- overlap in symptom presentation according to DSM-IV criteria supports the validity of extrapolation of  data  in  different  populations  having  one  of  the  symptom  domains  of  schizoaffective  disorder (psychosis, mania, depression);

- studies RIS-USA-79, RIS-SCH-401 and RIS-INT-57 showed that patients with schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia responded similarly;

- generally, there is a consistent benefit across acute and maintenance studies in psychotic and mood disorders for paliperidone and risperidone;

- the maintenance of the effect of paliperidone ER has been demonstrated in psychosis (study SCH-301) and in preventing any mood episode in (study BIM-3004). In addition, comparative data from studies with paliperidone ER and risperdal consta showed an effect in preventing manic/mixed episodes.

Having considered the SAG-CNS conclusions and the oral explanation provided by the MAH, the CHMP recommended the following indication:

'INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms  of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.\"

On the basis of the available data, the CHMP also recommended to include in section 4.2 of the SPC related  to  schizoaffective  disorder  that  'Maintenance  of  effect  has  not  been  studied'.  The  CHMP requested a long-term maintenance study on paliperidone palmitate to be conducted to confirm the maintenance  of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  in  this  population.  Additional  pharmacokinetic  data  on switching from oral paliperidone to paliperidone palmitate should also be provided by the MAH. The request  for  these  data  has  been  included,  upon  request  of  the  CHMP,  in  a  new  version  of  the  risk management plan.

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  has  identified  that  an  effect  on  depressive  symptoms  has  not  been demonstrated, which should be clearly reflected in the product information. The HAM-D 21 scale used in the clinical trials is not validated for schizoaffective disorder and also includes symptoms that could be attributed to psychosis/mania. Furthermore, some improvement of depressive symptoms may be expected when treating an acute and distressing psychotic episode even in the absence of a genuine antidepressive  effect  of  the  administered  drug.  On  the  basis  of  the  maintenance  study  protocol,  as proposed by the MAH, the CHMP recommended the use of HAM-D-17 scale.

*Three subjects (Subject 211617, Subject 211706, and Subject 211008) had mean daily doses greater than 12 mg/day. The mean daily doses (13.5 mg, 13.44 mg, and 12.065 mg) were calculated as the total dose divided by the treatment duration where total dlose is based on the nuumber of capsules taken at each given dose and the duration of treatment is based on the treatment start and stop dates. Since there was not a daily drug administration log, mean daily dose computations were based on calculated treatment duration.

In  Study  SCH-4005,  114  subjects  received  conventional  or  atypical  oral  antipsychotics  for  4  weeks (Phase  1),  and  84  subjects  cross-titrated  from  oral  antipsychotic  treatment  to  paliperidone  ER treatment for 1 week and then received paliperidone ER for 4 weeks (Phase 2, starting dose 6 mg/d, dose range 3 to 12 mg/d). Of the 84 subjects receiving paliperidone ER during Phase 2, the median duration of exposure was 34 days, and the mean (SD) duration was 30 (9.2) days, and the average daily dose was 7.5 mg. This treatment resulted in 6.89 subject-years of paliperidone ER exposure.

## · Adverse events

Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  (TEAEs)  were  reported  for  65%  of  622  subjects  during  the double-blind  phase  of  the  studies.  In  44%,  AEs  were  considered  possibly,  probably,  or  very  likely related to study drug.

All common treatment-emergent adverse events, ie, events that occurred in at least 5% of subjects in any treatment group during the double-blind phase, are presented in Table 21.

Events more frequently reported for paliperidone compared with placebo, were in the Nervous system disorders  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  with  39.8%  vs.  27.7%,  respectively  and  the  Gastrointestinal disorders  SOC  with  24.5%  vs.  19.8%,  respectively.  With  respect  to  common  TEAEs,  tremor, hypertonia, somnolence, and dyspepsia occurred at higher incidences (more than 3%) in paliperidone ER-treated  subjects  compared  with  placebo.  Also  events  such  as  akathisia,  dizziness,  sedation dystonia, were among commont reported events, more frequently seen in paliperidone groups.

In  subjects  receiving  concomitant  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers,  TEAEs  occurred  at  a greater  incidence  compared  to  those  subjects  not  receiving  these  therapies  (70.4%  versus  60.5% respectively).  Within  the  strata,  those  without  concomitant  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers, TEAEs  occurred  in  49%  on  placebo,  and  66%  on  paliperidone  (total),  while  in  the  group  on concomitant medication, TEAEs occurred in 70% of both placebo and total paliperidone.

## · Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths

In  phase  III  studies,  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  for  37  subjects  (5.9%),  and  AEs  lead  to discontinuation of 40 subjects (6.4%). incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo (6.9%) vs. the total paliperidone group (5.5%), and higher for paliperidone ER low dose (9.3%) compared with the high dose (2.0%). Most of the SAEs were related to psychiatric disorders.

There were two cases of suicidal ideation in the placebo group, and one case of suicidal behaviour in the  low  dose  paliperidone  group.  These  SAEs  were  considered  related  to  the  underlying  psychiatric disorder. In the paliperidone group there were two cases of serious infection, while all other SAEs were reported as single occurrences across all treatment groups. All SAEs (excepted case related to small intestinal obstruction) were considered unrelated to paliperidone.

There were no deaths reported during any of the studies (BIM-1003, BIM-1004, SCA-3001, and SCA3002), or up to the cut-off date of 01 May 2009 in study SCH-4005.

## · Discontinuation due to AEs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 7% of subjects withdrew due to adverse events in the placebo group as well as in the total paliperidone ER group. Discontinuation due to AEs ranged from 4% of subjects in the paliperidone ER high dose group to 9% of subjects in the low dose group. Consequently, no apparent dose relationship in relation to withdrawal was observed.

## · Laboratory findings and vital signs

Apart from elevated serum prolactin levels (see below), there were no other clinically relevant mean changes from baseline at any time point across treatment groups for laboratory analytes, including hematology, renal function, liver function, fasting blood glucose, serum lipid, and urinalysis parameters. In the high paliperidone ER group, slight increases in mean changes from baseline to endpoint in ALT and AST values were noted, with no corresponding change in the median values.

There were no clinically noteworthy differences in means or mean changes from baseline to end point in any laboratory analyte for paliperidone ER-treated subjects receiving antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers relative to subjects receiving paliperidone ER alone.

There were no clinically relevant differences in mean changes from baseline for supine and standing pulse rate or systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the placebo and paliperidone ER groups. Review of number of subjects with increases in standing and supine pulse rates above limits defined as clinically  important,  showed  a  higher  percentage    of  increases  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects compared  with  placebo  (eg  15%  and  9%  for  standing  pulse  rate  in  the  total  paliperidone  ER  and placebo groups, respectively).

## · Other safety findings

## Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS)-Related Adverse Events

The overall incidence of EPS-related AEs was higher in paliperidone treated subjects (19.8%) than in placebo-treated  subjects  (10.9%),  corresponding  to  e.g.  parkinsonism,  hyperkinesias,  tremor  and dystonia. All treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse events were considered by the investigator to be mild or moderate in severity, except dystonia (n=1, placebo) and tremor (n=1, paliperidone ER flexible dose group). None was reported as a serious AE.

## Suicidality

There were no reports of completed suicide in either study. Suicidality during the double-blind phase was reported by 3% of placebo-treated and 0.5% of paliperidone ER-treated subjects. Six subjects in the placebo group experienced suicidal ideation that was considered mild (n=2), moderate (n=2), or severe (n=2). One subject in the paliperidone ER low dose group experienced suicidal behavior that was  considered  severe,  and  1  subject  in  the  paliperidone  ER  high  dose  group  experienced  suicidal ideation that was moderate in severity.

## Depression

The depressed mood and depression experienced by the placebo- and paliperidone ER-treated subjects were mild or moderate in severity.Overview of the AEs are presented in Table 22.

## Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

No cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were reported in either study.

## Potentially Prolactin-Related Events

Mean changes from baseline in serum prolactin levels were greater in paliperidone ER-treated subjects than placebo and greater in paliperidone ER-treated females than in paliperidone ER-treated males. Prolactin-related  adverse  events  occurred  in  2.1  %  of  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  and  more frequently  in  females  (6  of  9  cases)  than  in  males.  All  potentially  prolactin-related  events  were considered mild or moderate in severity. No subject discontinued. Three of the 10 potentially prolactinrelated adverse events (ie, erectile dysfunction in 1 male and galactorrhoea in 2 females) were noted as persisting. The remaining 7 adverse events resolved.

## Glucose-Related Events

The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  glucose-related  adverse  events  was  (&lt;1%)  and  corresponded with  the  general  lack  of  clinically  significant  changes  in  blood  glucose  levels.  Two  subjects  in  the paliperidone ER flexible dose group experienced blood glucose increased (blood glucose value of 13.9 mmol/L at 6 weeks; normal range of 3.6 to 7.7 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (blood glucose value of 17.3 mmol/L at 6 weeks), respectively. Both events were considered to be moderate in severity.

## Weight-related events

Weight-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  8.1%  of  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  and  2.5%  of placebo-treated subjects. It included  weight increased (4.0% of paliperidone vs. 1.5% for placebo), increased appetite (2.4% vs. 0.5%, respectively), neither of which increased in frequency with dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Weight decrease was reported as well (1.0%  paliperidone vs. none on placebo) ; decreased appetite (1.4%  versus  0.5%,  respectively).  All  except  one  (weight  increased  in  one  female  subject  on paliperidone ER flexible dose) were considered mild or moderate in severity. No subject discontinued study treatment due to a weight-related TEAE.

In  addition,  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects  with  a  screening  BMI  of  30  kg/m2  or  greater  (obese) gained more weight at end point than paliperidone ER-treated subjects with a screening BMI less than 25 kg/m2 (normal) or 25 to less than 30 kg/m2 (overweight). A higher percentage of paliperidone ERtreated subjects (5%) had an increase in body weight of 7% or greater than placebo-treated subjects (1%), and the increase in body weight of 7% or more was dose related (3% low dose vs. 7% high dose group); with a 1% incidence in the placebo group.

## Cardiovascular Effects: Proarrhythmic Potential

There was 1 subject on paliperidone ER low dose group who experienced a grand mal convulsion that was considered severe. There were no other TEAEs suggestive of proarrhythmic potential.

## Electrocardiograms

Increases of 30 to 60 msec from average predose values in corrected QTcLD intervals at endpoint were reported for 2.6% of paliperidone ER-treated subjects compared with 0.6% of subjects in the placebo group. No subject experienced an increase in QTcLD interval greater than 60 msec.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Short  term  safety  data  from  the  two  Phase  3  studies  with  paliperidone  ER  in  patients  with schizoaffective disorder do not reveal any new safety concerns, compared with what is known from previous studies with paliperidone and from experience with risperidone. Interim data from an ongoing open label Phase 3b study in 114 subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and hepatic disease were also analysed.

In the two phase 3 studies, events more frequently reported for paliperidone compared with placebo, were in the Nervous system disorders SOC (39.8% vs. 27.7%, respectively) and the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC (24.5% vs. 19.8%, respectively). With respect to common TEAEs, tremor, hypertonia, somnolence, and dyspepsia occurred at higher incidences (more than 3%) in paliperidone ER-treated subjects compared with placebo. Also events such as akathisia, dizziness, sedation and dystonia, were among commonly reported events, more frequently seen in paliperidone groups.

The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  for  placebo  (6.9%)  vs.  the  total  paliperidone  group  (5.5%),  and higher for paliperidone ER low dose (9.3%) compared with the high dose (2.0%). Most SAEs appeared in the Psychiatric disorders SOC (19 of 27).

Among events of special interest, the overall incidence of EPS-related AEs was higher in paliperidone treated subjects (19.8%) than in placebo-treated subjects (10.9%), corresponding to e.g. parkinsonism, hyperkinesias, tremor and dystonia. Regarding prolactin, mean changes from baseline in serum prolactin levels were greater in paliperidone ER-treated subjects than placebo and greater in paliperidone  ER-treated  females  than  in  paliperidone  ER-treated  males.  Prolactin-related  adverse events occurred in 2.1 % of paliperidone ER-treated subjects and more frequently in females (6 of 9 cases) than in males. As expected, weight increase occurred more frequently in paliperidone treated subjects, compared with placebo.

When  comparing  the  overall  reporting  of  adverse  events  across  regions,  there  was  a  difference between European patients (180 of 622 subjects were from Romania, Russia and Ukraine) and those from the USA and Rest of the World, with lower frequencies reported by EU-patients. This was also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed  for  paliperidone  ER-treated  subjects,  since  adverse  events  were  reported  by  a  higher percentage of subjects at non-European sites (78.3%) compared with European sites (43.0%).

However,  a  dose-relationship  was  found  for  a  significant  number  of ADRs  (e.g  .  toothache, pharyngolaryngeal pain, galactorrhoea, tremor, akathisia, somnolence, nausea, dyspepsia, constipation, insomnia, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, increased appetite).

Additionally,  significant  effect  related to  concomitant  medication  on  the  rate of  ADRs  was  observed. This information was subsequently reflected in the SPC.

Furthermore, the CHMP required further long-term safety to confirm above findings beyond a six week observation  period.  To  address  this  major  concern,  the  MAH  referred  to  studies  with  the  mother compound risperidone in which bipolar as well as schizoaffective patients have been studied (RSI-INT57,  RIS-BIP-302),  taking  into  account  that  categories  and  dosages  of  medications  used  most frequently in these populations are similar.

In Study RIS-INT-57, which included 110 patients with schizoaffective disorder and 561 patients with schizophrenia, long-acting risperdone was administered every second week for 12 months. Concomitant  treatment  was  allowed  and  among  the  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  48% received  antidepressants  and  49%  received  mood  stabilizers.  No  unexpected  safety  issue  was identified and overall the safety profile was comparable for the two diagnoses. There was no tendency of increasing safety problems over time (81 of the patients with schizoaffective disorder remained on treatment for the entire study period).

In 12 months study (RIS-BIP-302) in bipolar depression long-acting risperidone (n=72) was compared to placebo as add-on to treatment as usual, which in the risperidone group included antidepressants (31%) and mood stabilizers (90%). Overall the safety pattern was as expected for risperidone with tremor (24%), insomnia (19%), and muscle rigidity (11%) being the most frequent events. Compared to placebo the total incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was lower and with respect to severity fewer events were moderate or severe.

Overall, the CHMP considered these data reassuring and supportive of the safety profile of paliperidone ER  in  the  proposed  indication,  taking  into  account  the  comparative  PK  data  of  paliperidone  versus risperidone. More than 100 patients have been treated for 12 months concomitantly with antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  and  risperidone  in  doses  comparable  to  or  higher  than  the recommended dose range for paliperidone in schizoaffective disorder.

No  new  safety  issue  has  been  identified  and  no  major  increased  incidence  of  treatment  emerging adverse events has been observed. However, the CHMP considered that data on safety and efficacy during long-term treatment with paliperidone was desirable to confirm the findings of the other studies conducted with the mother compound, risperidone. In addition, the CHMP recommended to align the safety  information  regarding  hyperprolactinaemia  with  the  approved  SPC  for  long  acting  risperidone injection. The CHMP also recommended further revision of the proposed SPC information related to EPS.

During  the  oral  explanation  held  on  20  July  2010,  the  MAH  provided  further  data  on  depressive switches  with  paliperidone  ER.  In  pivotal  studies  (SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002),  the  incidence  of  such event was 6.1% (8/132) versus 11.3% (8/71) in paliperidone ER and placebo groups, respectively. In study  BIM-3004,  the  incidence  was  7.2%  (44/563)  and  6.2%  (9/146)  in  paliperidone  ER  and olanzapine  groups,  respectively.  The  MAH  concluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  for  increased depressive switches with paliperidone ER.

However,  in  the  absence  of  comparative  data  on  such  event  with  other  antipsychotics,  the  CHMP recommended to include a warning on possible switch to depression, given the effect on depressive symptom of paliperidone ER has not been established in the intended population.

* Pharmacokinetic data supporting switching from oral paliperidone to paliperidone palmitate will also be provided in March 2014 to support the long-term efficacy and safety of paliperidone in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 1.3.5 User Consultation

The MAH referred to the Readability Testing of the paliperidone tablets Package Leaflet (PL) conducted during the assessment of the initial marketing authorisation application.

The MAH considered that minor changes have been proposed in the PL. Since the change mainly relate to  the  adverse  drug  reactions  listing  in  the  PL  and  that  the  layout  is  not  significantly  changed,  this justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2. BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT

## 2.1 Benefits

Paliperidone  ER,  the  active  metabolite  of  risperidone,  has  earlier  been  approved  for  treatment  of schizophrenia  based  on  studies  demonstrating  efficacy  in  acute  short-term  treatment  as  well  as maintenance  of  effect.  To  fulfil  the  regulatory  requirements  for  the  additional  claim  schizoaffective disorder the MAH has performed specific studies in that patient population.

In two placebo-controlled short-term studies statistically significant effect in favour of paliperidone ER for  the  primary  endpoint  PANSS  Total  score  was  shown.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  results  is illustrated in responder analyses showing differences versus placebo of 22 and 12.5 %-units for the two studies, respectively. The validity of these effects for schizoaffective patients are substantiated in analyses of secondary endpoints, including PANSS-24 which consist of the PANSS items corresponding to the DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, and clinically relevant reductions of depressive and manic symptoms in patients with pronounced affective symptoms at baseline.

In the pooled analysis, clinically relevant effects on PANSS and YMRS total scores were demonstrated in  patients  comedicated  with  mood  stabilizers  only  and  in  patients  with  antidepressants  only.  In subgroup analyses of the pooled studies, highly significant effects on PANSS and YMRS total scores have  been  demonstrated  for  patients  with  prominent  manic  symptoms,  prominent  depressive symptoms, as  well  as  in  patients  with  prominent  mixed  symptoms.  The  magnitude  of  effect  for  all endpoints was considered by the CHMP clinically relevant and comparable to other studies of acute treatment in schizophrenia, manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and major depressive episodes, respectively. As expected the effect on manic symptoms is less pronounced in patients with prominent depressive symptoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Maintenance  of  effect  has  not  been  specifically  studied  with  paliperidone  ER  in  patients  with schizoaffective  disorder.  The  CHMP  has  also  identified  that  effects  on  depressive  symptoms  has  not been demonstrated.

Having  considered  the  SAG  conclusions  and  the  oral  explanation  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP recommended the following indication:

'INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms  of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.\"

On the basis of the available data, the CHMP also recommended to include in section 4.2 of the SPC related to schizoaffective disorder that 'Maintenance of  effect has not been studied'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2 Risks

In the clinical program for schizoaffective disorder 420 patients have been treated with paliperdone ER. The safety profile in this indication is as expected from the studies in schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder as well as from the overall safety database for the mother compound risperidone. No new safety concerns have been identified.

However, the CHMP required further long-term safety to confirm the above findings beyond a six week observation  period.  To  address  this  major  concern,  the  MAH  referred  to  studies  with  the  mother compound risperidone in which bipolar as well as schizoaffective patients have been studied (RSI-INT57,  RIS-BIP-302),  taking  into  account  that  categories  and  dosages  of  medications  used  most frequently in these populations are similar.

Overall, the CHMP considered these data reassuring and supportive of the safety profile of paliperidone ER  in  the  proposed  indication,  taking  into  account  the  comparative  PK  data  of  paliperidone  versus risperidone. More than 100 patients have been treated for 12 months concomitantly with antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilizers  and  risperidone  in  doses  comparable  to  or  higher  than  the recommended dose range for paliperidone in schizoaffective disorder. No new safety issue has been identified and no major increased incidence of treatment emerging adverse events has been observed. However, the CHMP recommended to align the safety information regarding hyperprolactinaemia with the approved SPC for long acting risperidone injection. The CHMP also recommended further revision of the proposed SPC information related to EPS.

A dose-relationship was also found for a significant number of ADRs (e.g .toothache, pharyngolaryngeal pain, galactorrhoea, tremor, akathisia, somnolence, nausea, dyspepsia, constipation, insomnia, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, increased appetite).

Additionally,  significant  effect  related to  concomitant  medication  on  the  rate of  ADRs  was  observed. This information was subsequently reflected in the SPC.

A  long-term  maintenance  study  has  been  agreed  to  be  conducted  by  the  MAH,  which  will  further provide long-term safety data in this population.

## 2.3 Balance

In the overall study population, clinically relevant effects on psychotic and manic symptoms have been demonstrated in schizoaffective disorder that with respect to severity compares well with schizophrenia and no additional safety concerns have been identified.

However,  no  specific  long-term  data  on  paliperidone  are  available  to  confirm  the  maintenance treatment.  In addition, effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.

A  long-term  maintenance  study  has  been  agreed  to  be  conducted  by  the  MAH,  as  part  of  the  risk management plan.

## 3. Conclusion

On 18 November 2010, the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  applicant  taking  into  account  the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and considered the indication to be new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  that  it  is  held  to  bring  a  significant  clinical  benefit  in  the  absence  of  existing  therapies  (see appendix).

Invega

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1 . Introduction

Paliperidone  (R076477)  is  a  monoaminergic  antagonist  with  a  high  affinity  for  serotoninergic  (5hydroxytryptamine  type  2A)  and  dopaminergic  D2  receptors.  Paliperidone  (9-hydroxyrisperidone)  is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The controlled release of paliperidone from the extendedrelease formulation results in slower absorption of paliperidone than an immediate-release formulation, steadily  rising  plasma  concentrations on the  first day of dosing, and reduced fluctuations in plasma concentrations at steady state.

Invega was first granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 25 June 2007 for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

In September 2009 the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted an application for a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/746/II/23) to include the new indication ' Treatment of schizoaffective disorder as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants' for Invega.

In the initial assessment of the variation application, the CHMP raised major objections on both efficacy and safety as well as a number of other concerns. Based on the outcome of Central Nervous System Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG-CNS)  and  CHMP  assessment,  the  applicant    amended  the  proposed indication  as  follows:  'INVEGA  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  psychotic  or  manic  symptoms  of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.\"

In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH applied for an extended marketing protection period for Invega in the context of the current Type II variation.

The  request  is  based  on  the  MAH's  position  that  the  approval  of  paliperidone  PR  in  the  sought indication  will  offer  significant  clinical  benefit  compared  with  existing  therapies  since  no  other medications are currently approved for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in the EU.

## 2. Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by the applicant

## Proposed new indication as compared to already authorised indication

Schizoaffective disorder is a common, chronic, and disabling mental illness associated with significant impairment of functioning. Schizoaffective disorder is recognized in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) as a  distinct  diagnostic  entity  (APA  2000;  WHO  1993),  with  clinical  features,  course,  and  outcome differing  from  schizophrenia  (Lake  2007,  Cheniaux  2008,  Peralta  2008).  Schizoaffective  disorder includes the signs and symptoms of a manic episode and/or a major depressive episode, in addition to the  presence  of  symptoms  consistent  with  schizophrenia.  Nevertheless,  the  clinical  features  of schizoaffective  disorder  differ  from  bipolar  disorder  and  schizophrenia  in  important  ways,  including prognosis  and  approaches  to  treatment.  Compared  with  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  subjects  with schizoaffective disorder show a higher risk of substance abuse, higher hospitalisation rates, and higher suicide rates (Cheniaux 2008, Olfson 2009, Radomsky, 1999).

According to DSM-IV, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is made when the symptom criteria for schizophrenia are met and during the same continuous period there is a major depressive episode, manic  episode,  or  mixed  episode.  During  that  same  period,  symptoms  that  meet  Criterion  A  for schizophrenia (ie, 2 or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms) must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence  of  prominent  mood  symptoms  (APA  2000).  Diagnostic  criteria  for  schizoaffective  disorder according  to  ICD-10  are  slightly  more  inclusive  than  DSM-IV  criteria,  and  include  persons  in  whom definite schizophrenic and definite affective symptoms are prominent simultaneously, or within a few days  of  each  other,  within  the  same  episode  of  illness,  and  for  whom  the  episode  does  not  meet criteria for either schizophrenia or a depressive or manic episode (WHO 1993).

In an analysis of Medicaid claims data from 2 U.S. states focusing on over 55,000 adults treated for schizoaffective  disorder or  schizophrenia,  roughly  one-third  were  treated  for  schizoaffective  disorder (Olfson 2009). In this analysis patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely to receive cotreatment for substance use or for an anxiety, depressive, bipolar, or other mental disorder during the prestudy period (Olfson 2009). Similar to previous reports, the patients with schizoaffective disorder were also significantly more likely to be treated with mood stabilisers, antidepressants, and/or anxiolytics. Furthermore, patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely to receive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

psychotherapy. This analysis supports the current diagnostic classification that regards schizoaffective disorder  and  schizophrenia  as  distinct  diagnostic  entities  and  suggests  a  more  complicated  clinical course and more complex treatment needs in patients with schizoaffective disorder.

Given the complex medication regimens often utilised in schizoaffective disorder, these patients may be at particularly high risk for cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions, especially when coadministering certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. In addition, it has been suggested that  patients  with  affective  symptoms  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  the  extrapyramidal  side  effects associated with antipsychotic medications (Gao 2008).

## Details of existing therapies related to the proposed new indication

There  are  no  medications  approved  for  use  in  schizoaffective  disorder  in  the  EU  to  the  applicant's knowledge. Furthermore, no treatments have been systematically studied in patients with schizoaffective  disorder  nor  are  there  any  widely  accepted  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  this condition. Nonetheless, patients with schizoaffective disorder are often prescribed complex pharmacological  regimens  as  clinicians  attempt  to  manage  the  psychotic  and  affective  symptoms (Malhi 2005).

Therefore, despite the widespread use of antipsychotics alone or in combination with antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, there are little data (aside from that  contained  within  the  current  application)  that  support  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  practice. While off-label uses are legal and in many instances may be in the best interest of patients, they have not received the same degree of independent scrutiny through randomised clinical trials as agents that have been approved by Regulatory authorities (Pickar 2008).

## Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy as presented by the applicant

The efficacy and safety of paliperidone PR has been shown in 2 adequately powered and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical  studies  in  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder  (R076477-SCA-3001  and  R076477SCA-3002; hereafter referred to as SCA-3001 and SCA-3002, respectively). These data were further supported  by  results  from  2  completed  Phase  1  drug  interaction  studies  (R076477-BIM-1003  and R076477-BIM-1004; hereafter referred to as BIM-1003 and BIM-1004).

The  2  Phase  3  trials  (SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002)  included  adult  subjects  with  a  Structured  Clinical Interview  for  DSM-IV  Disorders  (SCID)-confirmed  DSM-IV  diagnosis  of  schizoaffective  disorder  who were experiencing an acute exacerbation. In SCA-3001, patients were assigned to 1 of 2 dose levels of paliperidone: a low-dose group (6 mg/day with the option to reduce to 3 mg/day) or a high-dose group (12 mg/day with the option to reduce to 9 mg/day). In SCA-3002, patients received flexible doses of paliperidone (3-12 mg/day, starting at 6 mg/day).

In  addition  to  study  medication,  subjects  were  permitted  to  receive  concomitant  treatment  with  a mood stabiliser and/or antidepressant, provided these medications had been given at a stable dose within 30 days of screening. Approximately half the subjects enrolled received ongoing treatment with a  mood  stabiliser  and/or  antidepressant  during  the  studies.  Therefore,  the  study  populations  were representative of the patient population likely to be treated with paliperidone PR in clinical practice. Randomisation was stratified by site and by treatment with concomitant medications (antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers) vs. no concomitant treatment with those medications.

Efficacy  was evaluated using the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS), as validated multiitem inventory composed of 5 factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts,  uncontrolled  hostility/excitement,  and  anxiety/depression.  As  secondary  outcomes,  mood symptoms  were  evaluated  using  the  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  (HAM-D-21)  and  the  Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).

The findings of the Phase 3 studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 have provided evidence for the efficacy of paliperidone PR in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder

Studies SCA-3001 and SCA-3002 showed superior efficacy of paliperidone PR high dose (12 mg/day, with option to reduce to 9 mg/day) and paliperidone PR in a flexible-dose range of 3 to 12 mg/day (starting  dose  6  mg/day)  to  placebo  on  the  primary  efficacy  variable  (change  from  baseline  to  end point in PANSS total score), as well as on other efficacy endpoints including the YMRS and HAM-D-21 in  subjects  with  prominent  mania  and  depression,  respectively.  In  subgroup  analyses  of  the  pooled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies, paliperidone PR was effective when used both as monotherapy and when administered with concomitant  antidepressants  and/or  mood  stabilisers.  Overall,  there  was  a  small  mean  numerical advantage in patients receiving paliperidone PR monotherapy vs combination therapy.

Efficacy on PANSS, YMRS, and HAM-D-21 scores was demonstrated regardless of baseline mood status. In subgroup analyses of the pooled studies, highly significant effects were demonstrated for patients with prominent manic symptoms (YMRS total score ≥16), prominent depressive symptoms (HAM-D-21 total score ≥16), or mixed symptoms (both YMRS and HAM-D-21 total scores ≥16) at baseline.

These findings were further supported by improvements in other secondary efficacy variables such as the change in the PANSS 24-item score corresponding to DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, PANSS subscales and factor scores, and global impressions of illness (CGI-S-SCA and CGI-C-SCA).

The improvement in the PANSS total score and the change in the severity of illness were of significant magnitude to be clinically  meaningful.  After  6  weeks  of  treatment,  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects treated with paliperidone PR than with placebo were treatment responders. The efficacy of paliperidone PR was independent of the demographic characteristics age, sex, race, or geographic location, as well as of baseline affective symptomatology.

## Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety as presented by the applicant

Paliperidone  PR  is  an  atypical  antipsychotic  approved  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia,  with  over 150,000 patient-years of postmarketing exposure worldwide.

The  clinical  development  program  of  paliperidone  PR  in  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder included  2  completed  Phase  3  studies,  in  which  420  subjects  with  schizoaffective  disorder  were exposed  to  paliperidone  PR  for  a  total  of  39.3  subject-years;  a  Phase  1  drug  interaction  study  in healthy men in which 24 subjects were exposed to paliperidone PR for a total of 0.13 subject-years; a Phase  1  drug  interaction  study  in  subjects  with  schizophrenia,  bipolar  I  disorder,  or  schizoaffective disorder in which 16 subjects were exposed to paliperidone PR for a total of 0.21 subject-years; and an ongoing  Phase  3b  study  in  subjects  with  schizophrenia  or  schizoaffective  disorder  and  with  hepatic disease in which 84 subjects were exposed to paliperidone PR for 6.89 subject-years through the cutoff date.

The comprehensive safety data of 1,107.00 subject-years in 2,054 individual subjects in the Phase 3 clinical  development program of paliperidone PR in schizophrenia complements the safety data from clinical studies of paliperidone PR in the new indication.

Paliperidone PR, administered in daily doses ranging from 3 to 12 mg, either as monotherapy or in combination with antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers, was generally well tolerated for a period of 6  weeks  in  the  2  double-blind  placebo-controlled  studies  SCA-3001  and  SCA-3002.  There  were  no deaths in either Phase 3 study, in either Phase 1 study, or in the ongoing Phase 3b study through the cutoff date.

There was no difference between the paliperidone PR and placebo groups with respect to the incidence of suicidality-related adverse events in the completed Phase 3 schizoaffective disorder studies. Adverse events  related  to  depression  were  infrequent  and  occurred  in  numerically  fewer  paliperidone  PRtreated than placebo-treated subjects.

Extrapyramidal symptoms  have  been  associated  with atypical antipsychotics in patients with schizoaffective  disorder  (Janicak  2001,  Keck  2001).  There  were  no  reports  of  tardive  dyskinesia  or neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the 4 completed studies. In the Phase 3 studies, extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse events and concomitant use of anticholinergic medications were reported at higher rates in subjects treated with paliperidone PR compared to placebo. In SCA-3001, anticholinergic  medications  were  used  more  frequently  in  the  paliperidone  PR  high  dose  group compared with the low dose group. The EPS-related adverse events were usually mild and usually did not lead to withdrawal, and none was serious. These findings are consistent with the data from Phase 3 studies of paliperidone PR in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Consistent  with  the  findings  of  the  clinical  program  in  schizophrenia,  ECG  data  did  not  suggest  an increased cardiovascular risk with paliperidone PR in the dose range of 3 to 12 mg. No adverse events of  ventricular  fibrillation  and  flutter  or  torsade  de  pointes  occurred  during  any  of  the  completed studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With  the  exception  of  mostly  asymptomatic  increases  in  serum  prolactin  levels,  changes  in  clinical laboratory test values in subjects receiving paliperidone PR for up to 6 weeks were transient, largely asymptomatic, and considered not clinically  relevant.  Limited  weight  gain  was  observed  in  subjects treated with paliperidone PR; a dose-related trend in weight gain was apparent in SCA-3001.

A greater proportion of subjects receiving paliperidone PR in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event  as  compared  to  those  subjects  receiving monotherapy. There was also a higher incidence of adverse events in placebo-treated subjects in the combination  therapy  stratum  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects  receiving  monotherapy.  This suggests  that  in  subjects  treated  with  combination  therapy  (paliperidone  PR  plus  antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers), a considerable number of the adverse events observed may be related to the antidepressant and/or mood stabiliser rather than paliperidone PR. There were no other differences of clinical concern in the safety and tolerability profile of paliperidone PR given alone or in combination with antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers.

Psychiatric disorders that were serious or led to discontinuation of study drug occurred more frequently in subjects in the paliperidone PR low dose group receiving concomitant antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers. This may potentially have been due to less effective control of psychiatric disorders in the low dose group compared to the high dose and flexible dose groups, as well as more severe illness in subjects receiving antidepressants and/or mood stabilisers at enrollment.

Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care as presented by the applicant As  summarised  above,  paliperidone  PR  has  demonstrated  a  favorable  benefit-risk  profile  in  the treatment  of  schizoaffective  disorder  in  2  large,  well-controlled  Phase  3  studies.  The  population included in these studies were well-defined using current diagnostic criteria and reflective of the realworld setting, in that they were receiving an atypical antipsychotic alone or in combination with mood stabilisers and/or antidepressants.

These  studies  represent  the  first  large-scale,  placebo-controlled  studies  conducted  in  patients  with schizoaffective disorder. No other agent has been studied in this population in such a rigorous manner. Therefore, the key benefit paliperidone PR offers over other medications is that it is the only agent that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in schizoaffective disorder according to current standards.

The  Sponsor  conducted  a  review  of  the  literature  to  explore  the  efficacy  of  paliperidone  PR  versus other agents in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Consistent with findings of other literature reviews  (Levinson  1999,  Keck  1999,  Jäger  2010),  no  other  large-scale,  prospective,  well  controlled studies were identified during the Sponsor's review of the literature.

Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  meaningful  comparisons  between  paliperidone  PR  and  other agents in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Of note, most of the studies identified during the search  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  antipsychotics  and  mood  stabilisers  as  monotherapy,  which  is  not reflective of clinical practice. Only 2 double-blind, randomised, controlled studies involving adjunctive treatment  of  an  antipsychotic  with  an  antidepressant  or  mood  stabiliser  were  identified  during  the Sponsor's review (Brockington 1978, Okuma 1989).

## MAH's overall conclusion supporting significant clinical benefit

Schizoaffective disorder is a serious, disabling, and persistent mental illness associated with significant impairment of functioning and a high lifetime risk of suicide. The loss of life and disability due to severe impairment  of  functioning  in  patients  with  schizoaffective  disorder  results  in  a  substantial  cost-ofillness  burden to society. Despite the significance of this condition, current therapies have not been studied  in  adequate  and  well-controlled  clinical  trials  and  there  are  no  European  Agency-approved medications for the treatment of this illness.

There  is  a  need  for  efficacious  treatments  of  schizoaffective  disorder  with  a  favourable  benefit-risk balance.  As  documented  in  the  current  application  (EMEA/H/C/746/II/23),  paliperidone  PR  has demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk balance in the acute treatment of psychotic and manic episodes of  schizoaffective  disorder  in  2  well-controlled  Phase  3  studies.  These  studies  (SCA-3001  and  SCA3002)  represent  the  first  large-scale,  placebo-controlled  studies  in  the  treatment  of  schizoaffective disorder. As no other agents are approved for schizoaffective disorder, the approval of paliperidone PR in  this  indication  would represent a significant and clinically meaningful contribution to patient care, allowing clinicians to make evidence-based decisions when considering treatment choices.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Assessment of the applicant's justification of significant clinical benefit

## Proposed new indication

Taking into account the provisions of the 'Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period  (November  2007)' ,  the  CHMP  is  of  the opinion that the proposed new indication: 'INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms  of  schizoaffective  disorder. Effect  on  depressive  symptoms  has  not  been  demonstrated.\" can be considered as a new therapeutic indication.

## Details of existing therapies related to the proposed new indication

There are currently no authorised medicinal products for the use in schizoaffective disorder.

Psychotherapy is recognised as a non-pharmacological approach to treatment. However, psychotherapy is generally used in association with pharmacological treatment and therefore does not constitute alone an existing therapeutic alternative.

The CHMP considered therefore that no existing therapies are currently available for this new indication.

## Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy

In the overall study population, clinically relevant effects on psychotic and manic symptoms have been demonstrated in the new indication for schizoaffective disorder, a disease that with respect to severity compares well with schizophrenia. However, the data provided to support the long-term maintenance of effect were questioned by the CHMP.

In light of the concern related to extrapolation of long term data to support the long-term maintenance of  the  effect  of  paliperidone  ER  in  schizoaffective  disorder  and on  the  basis of  the  available  data to date,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  SAG-CNS  to  discuss  the  need  for  long-term  efficacy  data  for paliperidone  in  the  applied  indication.  The  group  was  convinced  that  there  is  good  evidence  of maintenance of effect on manic symptoms. However, from the submitted documentation, the SAG was not convinced that there is a clinically significant effect on depressive symptoms.

The MAH concluded that there was no evidence for increased depressive switches with paliperidone PR. However,  in  the  absence  of  comparative  data  on  such  event  with  other  antipsychotics,  the  CHMP recommended to include a warning on possible switch to depression, given the effect on depressive symptom of paliperidone PR has not been established in the intended population.

On the basis of the available data, the CHMP recommended the following indication: 'INVEGA is indicated for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.\"

In the absence of existing therapies for the above-mentioned new indication, the CHMP considered that there is significant clinical benefit on efficacy for Invega in the targeted population.

## Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety

In the clinical program for schizoaffective disorder 420 patients have been treated with paliperidone ER. The safety profile in this indication is as expected from the studies in schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder as well as from the overall safety database for the mother compound risperidone.

Overall, the CHMP considered the data reassuring and supportive of the safety profile of paliperidone ER  in the proposed  indication,  taking  into  account  the  comparative  pharmacokinetic  data  of paliperidone versus risperidone.

More than 100 patients have been treated for 12 months concomitantly with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers and risperidone in doses comparable to or higher than the recommended dose range

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for  paliperidone  in  schizoaffective  disorder.  No  new  safety  issue  has  been  identified  and  no  major increased incidence of treatment emerging adverse events has been observed.

Overall, the CHMP considered that the safety profile for Invega remains unchanged. In the absence existing  therapies  for  the  above-mentioned  new  indication,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  no significant clinical benefit on safety for Invega can be identified at this present time.

## Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care

The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Invega  is  expected  to  contribute  to  patient  care  as  an  authorised medicinal product.

## 4. CHMP Conclusion

Following the overall assessment of the efficacy and safety data provided, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk  ratio  of  Invega  is  positive  for  the  following  indication:  'INVEGA  is  indicated  for  the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Effect on depressive symptoms has not been demonstrated.\"

In the absence of existing therapies, the CHMP considered that the justification for one additional year of marketing protection was valid.

## 5. Outcome

The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, and taking into account the provisions of the ' Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period (November 2007) ',  considered that the new therapeutic indication is held to bring significant clinical benefit in the absence of existing therapies.
