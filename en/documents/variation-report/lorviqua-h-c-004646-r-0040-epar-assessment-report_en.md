## 1. Background information on the annual renewal

The European Commission issued on 6 May 2019, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for Lorviqua. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA.

A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Pfizer Europe MA EEIG, submitted to the Agency on 31 October 2024 an application for renewal of the conditional MA for Lorviqua. The expiry date of the MA is 8 May 2025.

The period covered by this annual renewal is 06 August 2023 to 05 August 2024.

The application contained a justification in support of the possible granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations.

## 2. Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance

The MAH is seeking renewal for two authorised Lorviqua presentations 100 mg and 25 mg film-coated tablet.

The MAH submitted the B7461027 clinical study report within the current annual renewal to fulfil the last outstanding specific obligation and consequently to request the granting of a full marketing authorisation, no longer subject to specific obligations, in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

## Efficacy

The final CSR from study B7461027 was submitted. This is a non-comparative study of use of lorlatinib in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, who had disease progression after one prior secondgeneration ALK-TKI (alectinib or ceritinib as first line of treatment) for metastatic disease. The study was designed to substantiate the clinical efficacy in that particular population with a larger sample size (N=71) compared to pivotal Study 1001 (EXP-3B cohort; N=28).

A total of 71 participants were treated with lorlatinib at 23 centres in 7 countries. The first participant was enrolled on 29 September 2020 and enrollment was completed on 13 June 2023. The primary completion date (PCD) was 29 May 2024. All treated patients had at least 1 prior anti-cancer drug therapy, 16.9% received prior chemotherapies, 84.5% received alectinib as prior ALK inhibitor and 15.5% received ceritinib as prior ALK inhibitor. Moreover, 47.9% had at least 1 prior anti-cancer radiotherapy and 14.1% underwent at least 1 prior anti-cancer surgery. The median duration of study intervention was 9.69 months.

The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR by independent review (ICR). The ITT analysis showed that 4 (5.6%) patients had a confirmed CR and 36.6% had a confirmed PR, resulting in an ORR of 42.3% (95%CI: 30.6%, 54.6%). The study met its primary endpoint as the lower limit of the 95%CI around the estimated ORR exceeded 30%. Of note, the ORR was slightly higher in patients who had received prior ceritinib (45.5%) versus those who had prior alectinib; however, no firm conclusions could be made due to the small sample size of patients who had prior ceritinib.

## Safety

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  new  safety  signals  were  observed  in  the  study  therefore  no  new  safety  concerns  are  raised. Frequencies of adverse reactions were updated in sections 4.8 and 4.4 to reflect the updated safety data set including the additional 71 patients from study B7461027. They remain largely in line with existing frequencies.

In summary, the ORR of 42.3% shown from single-arm study B7461027 is in line with what has previously been reported (42.9%) and the efficacy in the second-line setting after a second-generation ALK-TKI is considered to be confirmed with a reasonable sample size (N=99). Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been adequately updated with the final results of study B7461027.

The remaining Specific Obligation is considered fulfilled, and its deletion from the Annex II is recommended.

The marketing authorisation of Lorviqua can be switched from conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization.

Within this renewal the MAH also requested a change to the proposed due date for submitting the CSR of the study B7461006 (CROWN) (Annex II.D condition). The originally agreed due date of 30 June 2025 was estimated based on the total number of OS events available at the time of the first interim analysis of OS (51 OS events, 26% information fraction (IF), data cutoff date 20 March 2020). Since that time, OS events in the CROWN study have accrued more slowly than originally projected, making this due date no longer tenable. Based on a revised OS prediction the MAH expects that the 139 OS events required for the pre-specified second interim analysis of OS (at 70% IF) will be met in Apr 2027 (95%CI Apr 2026-Jul 2028). The proposal to change the CSR submission due date to 01 Dec 2027 is considered acceptable.

Minor updates to the product information were also made, in line the latest QRD template.

The Benefit risk of Lorviqua remains positive and unchanged.

## Risk Management Plan

The updated RMP v5.3 was found acceptable.

## 2.1. Specific Obligations (SOBs)

## Compliance of SOB data submitted

During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the SOBs have been submitted that are overall compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and in terms of acceptability of data submitted.

As part of this annual renewal the CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends its deletion from the Annex II:

Study B7461027 : Single-Arm Study of Lorlatinib in Participants with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Whose Ongoing Disease Progressed After One Prior Second Generation ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). This is a Phase 4 open-label, multicenter, multi-national, non-randomized, prospective, single-arm study of lorlatinib in adult participants with ALK-positive NSCLC who progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as first line of treatment for metastatic disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Updated list of specific obligations (SOBs)

The last SOB has been fulfilled and the data available concerning this product is considered comprehensive; therefore, there are no remaining Specific Obligations.

## 2.2. Benefit-risk Balance

## Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do not have an impact on the benefit-risk of Lorviqua in the approved indications.

The data collected as part of the specific obligation for Lorviqua during the period covered by this annual renewal supported its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indications.

The MAH has submitted data from the requested single-arm study B7461027, which was a SOB for the CMA of lorlatinib and the main objective was to substantiate the clinical efficacy in the second-line setting after a second-generation ALK-TKI with a larger sample size (N=71) compared to pivotal Study 1001 (EXP-3B cohort; N=28).

Since the results show an ORR of 42.3%, which is fully in line with what has been previously reported (42.9%), the efficacy in the second-line setting after a second-generation ALK-TKI is considered to be confirmed with a reasonable sample size (N=99). Moreover, no new safety signals were observed in the study.

Therefore, the benefit-risk balance of Lorviqua in the approved indications remains positive.

No new post-authorisation measures are requested.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, the benefit-risk balance for Lorviqua in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable and all specific obligations have been fulfilled, and therefore the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations is recommended, subject to the conditions and obligations as detailed in this assessment report.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of new data submitted as part of the renewal application amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB are recommended

## Conditions of the marketing authorisation

The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions:

## Outcomes and estimation

## Efficacy

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Confirmed Objective Tumor Response Assessed by ICR

Based on the ICR assessment of ITT Analysis Set (N=71), 4 (5.6%) participants had a confirmed CR and 26 (36.6%) participants had a confirmed PR, resulting in an ORR of 42.3% (95%CI: 30.6%, 54.6%) (Table 7). The study met its primary endpoint as the lower limit of the 95%CI around the estimated ORR exceeded 30%.

- Of the 60 participants who received prior ALK-TKI of alectinib, the ORR was 41.7% (95%CI: 29.1%, 55.1%) per ICR assessment. Of the responders, 2 participants received prior alectinib + chemotherapies.
- Of the 11 participants who received prior ALK-TKI of ceritinib, the ORR was 45.5% (95% CI: 16.7%, 76.6%) per ICR assessment. Of the responders, 3 participants received prior ceritinib + chemotherapies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a post-hoc analysis, the ORR of the participants with measurable disease at baseline per ICR assessment (N=64) was evaluated. Of the 64 participants with measurable diseases at baseline, 3 (4.7%) participants had a confirmed CR and 26 (40.6%) participants had a confirmed PR, with the ORR of 45.3% (95%CI: 32.8%, 58.3%).

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

## Confirmed Objective Tumor Response Assessed by Investigator

Based on the investigator assessment of ITT Analysis Set (N=71), 1 (1.4%) participant had a confirmed CR and 25 (35.2%) participants had a confirmed PR, resulting in an ORR of 36.6% (95%CI: 25.5%, 48.9%) (Table 8). The confirmed ORR assessed by the investigator was consistent with the ORR assessed by ICR, further corroborating the robustness of the estimation of the ORR.

## Discussion

## Efficacy

The MAH has submitted the final CSR from the requested single-arm study B7461027, which was a SOB for the CMA of lorlatinib. This is a non-comparative study of use of lorlatinib in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, who had disease progression after one prior second-generation ALK-TKI (alectinib or ceritinib as first line of treatment) for metastatic disease. The study was designed to fulfill the goal to substantiate the clinical efficacy in this particular population with a larger sample size (N=71) compared to pivotal Study 1001 (EXP-3B cohort; N=28).

A total of 71 participants were treated with lorlatinib at 23 centres in 7 countries. The first participant was enrolled on 29 September 2020 and enrollment was completed on 13 June 2023. The primary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

completion date (PCD) was 29 May 2024. All treated patients had at least 1 prior anti-cancer drug therapy, 16.9% received prior chemotherapies, 84.5% received alectinib as prior ALK inhibitor and 15.5% received ceritinib as prior ALK inhibitor. Moreover, 47.9% had at least 1 prior anti-cancer radiotherapy and 14.1% underwent at least 1 prior anti-cancer surgery. The median duration of study intervention was 9.69 months.

The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR by independent review (ICR) and the ITT analysis showed that 4 (5.6%) patients had a confirmed CR and 36.6% had a confirmed PR, resulting in an ORR of 42.3% (95%CI: 30.6%, 54.6%). The study met its primary endpoint as the lower limit of the 95%CI around the estimated ORR exceeded 30%. Of note, the ORR was a bit higher in patients who had received prior ceritinib (45.5%) versus those who had prior alectinib, however, no firm conclusions can be made due to the small sample size of patients who had prior ceritinib. Overall, the ORR of 42.3% is in line with what has previously been reported (42.9%), and therefore the efficacy in the second-line setting after a second-generation ALK-TKI is considered to be confirmed with a reasonable sample size (N=99).

Safety

No new safety signals were observed in the study so no new safety concerns are raised. Frequencies of adverse reactions were updated in sections 4.8 and 4.4 to reflect the updated safety data set including the additional 71 patients from study B7461027. They remain largely in line with existing frequencies.

In conclusion, the CHMP is of the opinion that the remaining Specific Obligation has been fulfilled and therefore recommends its deletion from the Annex II.

## 5.3. Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data regarding the remaining SOB has emerged. The new data emerged are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data submitted.

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data regarding the following SOB have emerged. The SOB is considered fulfilled:

002: Study B7461027: Single-Arm Study of Lorlatinib in Participants with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Whose Ongoing Disease Progressed After One Prior Second Generation ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) This is a Phase 4 open-label, multicenter, multi-national, non-randomized, prospective, single-arm study of lorlatinib in adult participants with ALK-positive NSCLC who progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as first line of treatment for metastatic disease.

## 6. Additional scientific data provided relevant for the assessment of the benefit/risk balance

## 6.1. Clinical efficacy

With this submission the MAH provided a short updated based on the request from procedure EMEA/H/C/0004646/II/15 for approval of the indication for the first-line treatment for ALK-positive advanced lung cancer based on the results of the pivotal Phase 3 CROWN trial. The CHMP requested that, in the absence of a mature OS analysis and with the aim to clarify the benefit deriving from treatment of patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the MAH should provide PFS2 data updates for the CROWN (B7461006) study in the context of the annual renewals.

In annex to the updated overview the MAH provided some results. PFS2, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression on first subsequent systemic anticancer therapy or death. As of 31 October 2023, 48 PFS2 events (32%) and 78 PFS2 events (53%) have occurred in the lorlatinib and crizotinib arm, respectively. With a median duration of follow-up for PFS2 of 61.4 months (95%CI: 59.2-62.5) in the lorlatinib arm and 58.4 months (95%CI: 56.8-61.9) in the crizotinib arm, PFS2 was longer in patients from the lorlatinib compared to crizotinib arm (HR, 0.43; 95%CI: 0.30-0.62). Median PFS2 was NR (95%CI: NR-NR) with lorlatinib and 37.9 months (95%CI, 27.4-50.1) with crizotinib and the 60-month PFS2 rate was 67% in the lorlatinib arm and 37% in the crizotinib arm.

## 6.2. Clinical safety

Cumulatively,  there  have  been  899  clinical  trial  cases  (1056  SAEs)  reported.  During  the  reporting interval, there have been 35 clinical trial cases (38 SAEs) reported, which is fewer than in the previous interval  (41  cases  with  47  SAEs).  In  addition,  there  have  been  9095  post-marketing  cases  (20,742 AEs/ADRs) reported cumulatively and 2477 post-marketing cases (5721 AEs/ADRs) reported during this reporting interval.

Completed Clinical Trials: There were no completed safety trials during the reporting period of the Addendum to the Clinical Overview (ACO). During the reporting period of the latest PBRER (DLP March 2024),  there  was  1  completed  clinical  trial  from  the  lorlatinib  development  program  that  was  not considered to be a safety trial:

- Study B7461001: A phase 1/2 study of PF-06463922 (an ALK/ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer harboring specific molecular alterations.

The  MAH reports  that  lorlatinib  was  generally  tolerable,  as  AEs  were  primarily  mild  to  moderate  in severity, and manageable as rates of permanent discontinuations due to AEs were low and could be managed by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard supportive medical therapy.

Ongoing Clinical Trials: During the reporting period, there were 6 ongoing clinical trials, that were not considered  to  be  safety  trials,  from  the  lorlatinib  development  program:  B7461006,  B7461024, B7461027,  B7461039,  B7461040,  and  B7461042  (Cstone  Study  CS3011-201).  No  new  clinically important information has emerged from above mentioned studies during the reporting period.

The Clinical Study Report (CSR) for EU Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) B7461027 [A singlearm study of lorlatinib in participants with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed after one prior second generation ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor  (TKI)]  was  submitted  on  09  September  2024.  The  MAH  reports  that  69  of  71  participants (97.2%) experienced treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), of whom 64 had treatment-related TEAEs.

- The most frequently reported (≥20% of participants) all -causality TEAEs were Hypercholesterolemia (59.2%),  Hypertriglyceridemia  (56.3%),  Edema  (46.5%),  Fatigue (26.8%) and Peripheral Neuropathy (21.1%).
- 23 (32.4%) participants experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), of whom 1 participant had a  treatment-related  SAE.  The  all-causality  treatmentemergent  SAEs  occurring  in  ≥2%  of participants were Dyspnoea (4.2%), Pulmonary embolism (4.2%), Cerebrovascular accident (2.8%) and Pneumonia (2.8%). There was 1 treatment-related treatment-emergent SAE of Pneumonia reported in this study, and this SAE was CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adverse Events) Grade 3 and resulted in study intervention interruption.

- 10  (14.1%)  participants  experienced  Grade  5  TEAEs  leading  to  deaths,  with  none  of  them related to the study intervention as assessed by the investigator.
- 9  (12.7%)  participants  experienced  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study intervention. None of the TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study intervention was related to the study intervention as assessed by the investigator.

In summary, lorlatinib treatment was generally tolerable, and when appropriate, AEs were manageable through temporary discontinuation, dose reduction, and/or standard supportive medical therapy. Safety data from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of lorlatinib with no new safety signals identified. Overall, the lorlatinib risk/benefit ratio remained favourable.

Lorlatinib is also being studied in 2 ongoing clinical trials from other Pfizer clinical development programs. The first  (Study  B9991046) is an open-label study for participants continuing from Pfizer-sponsored avelumab clinical studies. The second (Study C4481001) is: a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of PF-07284892 (a SHP2 inhibitor) as a single agent and in combination therapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.

There are 14 ongoing Investigator Sponsored Research (ISR) Studies and Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Studies. No clinically relevant information has emerged from these studies.

Non-Interventional Studies: There were no completed or ongoing PASS.

Other studies where the primary aim of the trial was to identify, characterise or quantify a safety hazard or  confirm  the  safety  profile  of  the  medicinal  product  include  the  ongoing  non-interventional  study B7461018. There were no completed safety studies.

- Study B7461018 - Special investigation for Lorbrena tablets: Lorbrena ALK NSCLC ROS1 PMS Japan. No clinically important information has emerged from this safety study.

There were 3 completed non-interventional studies that were not safety studies.

- Study B7461032 Therapeutic effectiveness of lorlatinib after alectinib in ALK-positive NSCLC patients in Japan
- Study B7461044 Profile and Treatment Patterns of Patients with locally advanced/metastatic ALK+ or EGFR + NSCLC in Mexico: A cross-sectional database study
- Study B7461046 Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer in Colombia.

There are 2 ongoing non-interventional studies

- Study B7461034 A prospective, single-arm, open-label, non-interventional, multicentre, Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study of Lorviqua (registered)
- Study B7461041 Drug treatment patterns and Effects for metastatic non-small cell Lung cancer patients In NORway (DELINOR)

No clinically important information has emerged from completed and ongoing non-interventional studies during the reporting period.

Medication Errors: During this reporting interval, there were no serious CT cases contained in the MAH's safety database that reported medication errors and no medication errors involving lorlatinib were identified  from  medical  literature  sources.  Review  of  the  post-marketing  cases  received  during  this reporting interval revealed no patterns of medication errors involving lorlatinib. There were 65 cases (2.6% of the total interval dataset as compared to 3.3% in the previous 1-year ACO) reporting 70 events potentially indicative of a medication error. In 7 cases, the error was a misuse of the product by the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient  (i.e.  taking  it  incorrectly  as  personal  preference).  All  of  the  medication  error  events  were considered non-serious. The most frequently co-reported AEs were coded to the PTs: Off label use (8), Neoplasm progression (6), Abdominal discomfort (5), Asthenia, Haemoglobin decreased, and Oedema (4 each).

Literature: A search of the Medline and Embase databases identified 1 article for lorlatinib.

- LI, Huqun, Wang Chongshu, Guo, Cuilian, Post-marketing safety of lorlatinib: a real-world study based  on  the  FDA  adverse  event  reporting  system.  Front.  Pharmacol.  15:1385036.  doi: 10.3389/ fphar.2024.1385036

A total of 2,941 AE reports were found to be associated with lorlatinib among the 8,818,870 AE reports obtained from the FAERS database. 167 lorlatinib-related AE signals  were identified. The  frequently reported AEs including hypercholesterolemia, oedema, and cognitive disorder were in line with those observed in clinical trials and drug instruction. However, AEs such as interstitial lung disease and AV block indicated in the drug label require further evaluation. More attention should be paid to the new potential unexpected AEs including pulmonary arterial hypertension and radiation necrosis. The authors state that majority of AEs occurred within the first 2 months after lorlatinib initiation with a median onset time of 51 days.

The MAH comments that Radiation necrosis and Thromboembolic migrans are not labelled events for lorlatinib, and although the review of the available information from post marketing, clinical trials and literature does not support a causal association with lorlatinib at this time, this article is deemed to be relevant to be included in the ACO. Based on the data provided in the article, the MAH's conclusion could be endorsed. Nevertheless, this article is also presented in the PSUR that is currently under assessment (PSUSA/00010760/202409),  in  which  a  more  detailed  assessment  will  be  performed.  In  addition, Interstitial lung disease, AV block and Pulmonary arterial hypertension are safety concerns in the PSUR and  are  being  assessed  in  PSUSA  procedures,  including  the  ongoing  PSUSA/00010760/202409 procedure.

Signal  overview: During  the  reporting  period,  the  signals  of  Proteinuria,  Vision  disorders  and Respiratory disorders in combination with immunotherapy were evaluated and are presented below. These signals were refuted. There are no newly identified signals for lorlatinib between the DLP of the latest PSUR and the DLP of the ACO.

The MAH has provided an overview of pharmacovigilance system inspections carried out during the reporting interval. None of the 10 conducted PhV inspections had impact on the benefit/risk of the medicinal product.

## 6.4. Discussion

The submitted PFS2 data with 32% and 53% events in the lorlatinib vs the crizotinib arm, respectively, shows a reassuring and promising HR of 0.43 (95%CI: 0.30-0.62). Median PFS2 was not reached with lorlatinib and 37.9 months (95%CI: 27.4-50.1) with crizotinib. Therefore, the risk of any detriment on OS seems unlikely and no further PFS2 data are requested.

The only outstanding request is the recommendation to submit final OS data from the phase 3 CROWN study ( B7461006) by December 2027. The submission date is suggested to be postponed as it is an event-driven analysis and the OS event occurrence over the last 2 years have been slowing down. This is acceptable.

## 7. Risk management plan

The MAH has submitted an updated RMP (v5.2) within the annual renewal procedure.

Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: The purpose of this RMP update is to reflect the latest safety information on lorlatinib and to remove the specific obligation to submit the B7461027 CSR. B7461027

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is  a  post-authorisation efficacy study designed to confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib in patients whose disease progressed after treatment with one prior second generation ALK-TKIs, alectinib or ceritinib. The submission  of  the  B7461027  study  report  fulfils  the  specific  obligation  and  thereby  supports  the conversion from conditional approval to standard marketing authorisation. Additionally, the proposed due date for submitting the CSR for the B7461006 study is updated.

## Safety concerns

Table 15: Summary of Safety Concerns

| Summary of safety concerns   | Summary of safety concerns                                                       |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Important identified risks   | Central Nervous System (CNS) effects Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis |
| Important potential risks    | Atrioventricular (AV) block Pancreatitis Embryo-foetal toxicity                  |
| Missing information          | Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment                              |

Considering the data in the safety specification, the safety concerns listed by the MAH are appropriate.

The MAH updated Part I Product Overview to remove information on additional monitoring for lorlatinib in the EU. The MAH also updated the following Part II modules:

SI Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s) - Epidemiological data has been updated with the most recent data available.

SIII Clinical Trial Exposure - The exposure data was updated with a new data lock point. The data for the B7461001 and B7461027 studies were based on the final CSRs, and the data lock point for B7461006 is 29 May 2024, with three datasets pooled together.

SIV Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials - Relevant data has been updated.

SV Post Authorisation Experience - Post-marketing experience data has been updated up to the data lock point of 30 June 2024.

SVII Identified and Potential Risks - Updated safety data based on final B7461001 and B7461027 CSRs, data lock point for B7461006 study is 29 May 2024, and post marketing data till 30 June 2024.

According to the Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module V - Risk management systems (Rev 2) (EMA/838713/2011 Rev 2), Section SVII.1 ' Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission ' is expected to be 'locked' and not change after the approval of the initial RMP. Therefore, no change to this section can be endorsed (see assessment of the MAH responses). All other changes in Part I and Part II are endorsed.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 100 mg oral dose of lorlatinib in participants with normal hepatic function and participants with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. | Missing information on patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment | Final Protocol Submission: Study/Trial Completion: Final Report Submission: | 05 May 2022 31 December 2024 30 September 2025                        |

*Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product.

Category 2 are Specific Obligations in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances under Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 or in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation under Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004.

Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures).

No changes were made to RMP Part III Pharmacovigilance Plan. Lorlatinib hepatic impairment study (B7461040) is a required additional PhV activity that is currently ongoing.

Regarding Part IV Plans for Post-authorisation Efficacy Studies, the MAH removed the completed postauthorisation efficacy study B7461027 and updated the Milestone for the study B7461006 (01 Dec 2027), which is endorsed.

## Risk minimisation measures

The MAH reported editorial changes to Part V.1 Routine Risk Minimisation Measures and consequently to Part V.3. Summary of Risk Minimisation Measures.

## Elements for a public summary of the RMP

The elements for a public summary of the RMP require revision following the conclusion of the procedure:

Part VI has been updated according to the changes mentioned above (i.e. to Part IV and Part V). Study B7461027 is removed from studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation, Milestone for the study B7461006 is updated, and editorial changes are made.

## Annexes

The RMP annexes have been updated appropriately:

Annex 5: The completed post authorisation efficacy study B7461027 was removed.

Annex 8: The summary of changes made within RMP v5.2 was added.

In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  update  Central  Nervous  System/  Psychiatric  Events  -

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Specific Adverse Drug Reaction Follow-up form in Annex 4. The MAH removed questions from the FUQ that are part of every individual case safety report (e.g. start date and end date, outcome of the adverse event,  action  taken  with  lorlatinib,  etc.),  which  could  be  endorsed.  Updated  FUQ  now  only  contains questions for obtaining information that is not collected through standard reporting forms.

## 7.1. Overall conclusion on the RMP

The RMP version 5.3 is acceptable

## 8. Changes to the Product Information

Changes to the Product Information (PI), based on the submitted data within the scope of this procedure, are introduced during the assessment of this renewal (see attached PI with comments).

The MAH is amending the product information with the following changes:

- Removal of the specific obligation to submit B7461027 clinical study report and that the product has been authorised under 'conditional approval' scheme
- Removal of inverted black triangle
- Changes to section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 were introduced to reflect data from study B7461027 (updated safety and efficacy data largely in line with existing safety and efficacy profile)
- Update of the due date for submitting the CSR including overall survival data of the B7461006 study
- Implementation of the QRD template v10.4 by removing the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) local representative
- Update of the date of latest renewal
- Introduction of minor administrative change in the package leaflet (change in the name of the local representative for Ireland)

## Additional monitoring

Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lorviqua (Lorlatinib) is removed from the additional monitoring list as the condition(s) to the marketing authorisation have been fulfilled.

Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

## 9. Draft Request for Supplementary Information - RfSI
