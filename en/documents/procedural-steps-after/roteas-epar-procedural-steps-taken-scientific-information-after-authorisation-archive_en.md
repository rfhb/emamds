| II/0003             | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in line with changes already introduce to Lixiana (EMEA/H/C/002629/II/0012) in order to add information deriving from clinical data for the use of edoxaban as anticoagulant therapy for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation undergoing cardioversion. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update section 4.8 of the SmPC as per the requirement of the finalised PSUSA/00010387/201610 procedure to include headache, abdominal pain and dizziness with a common frequency as new adverse drug reactions. The MAH also took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0 and to introduce some editorial changes and minor corrections. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new | 30/11/2017 | 26/07/2018 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Roteas can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion. For transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, Roteas treatment should be started at least 2 hours before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation. Cardioversion should be performed no later than 12 hours after the dose of Roteas on the day of the procedure. For all patients undergoing cardioversion: Confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Roteas as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should follow established guidelines for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion. |
