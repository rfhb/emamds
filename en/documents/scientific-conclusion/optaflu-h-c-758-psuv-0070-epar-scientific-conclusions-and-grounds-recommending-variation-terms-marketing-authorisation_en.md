During the current PSUR period (19 May 2014), the MAH updated their reference safety information regarding the AE term Extensive Limb Swelling (ELS) and announced an adaptation of the EU SmPC/PL accordingly. It was noted that ELS is a rare but known reaction that may occur with any vaccine. Based on the review of ten cases presented in this PSUR, ELS has been reported in 4 cases cumulatively and cannot be excluded in 4 cases. Therefore, in view of available data regarding extensive limb swelling, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Optaflu, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell cultures) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
