## I. INTRODUCTION

Gilead  submitted  the final  clinical  report  for  Study  GS-US-103-0518 A  Phase  3  Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Adefovir Dipivoxil in Children and  Adolescents  (Age  2  to  &lt;  18)  with  Chronic  Hepatitis  B in  accordance  with  Article  46  of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

Gilead stated that study GS-US-103-0518 is a stand alone study and in accordance with Article 16(2) of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  data  submitted  do  not  influence  the  benefit-risk  balance  for adefovir  dipivoxil  and  therefore  do  not  require  taking  further  regulatory  action  on  the  marketing authorisation for Hepsera.

Rapporteur's  comment:  In  Europe,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  48  weeks  data  from  the  pivotal paediatric study GS-US-103-0518 did not provide convincing arguments to consider that the use of adefovir might be more beneficial than deleterious in adolescents. Methodological limitations, poorly convincing efficacy results (notably for HBeAg seroconversion) and uncertainties as regards the longterm  safety  profile  of  the  drug  in  children  were  pointed  out.  As  a  consequence,  the  MAH, acknowledging the CHMP concerns, proposed not to pursue an extension of indication for Hespera in adolescent patients at this stage.

In addition, in accordance with FU2 028 (FUM 9), additional analyses of the presence of basal core promoter and pre-core mutations at baseline among hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive paediatric patients were conducted in Study GS-US-103-0518. These results are still being gathered. However, preliminary data has been provided and are discussed in the current report. II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION II.1 Information on the development program The pediatric development program for ADV included 4 studies: 3 completed clinical pharmacology studies (GS-02-515, GS-02-517, and GS-02-536 final Clinical Study Reports were submitted in June 2007 with the Type II variation to extend the pediatric indication to include treatment of adolescent patients,  Hepsera  type  II  variation  II30 )  and  a  recently  completed  pediatric  efficacy  and  safety study (GS-US-103-0518). Study GS-US-103-0518 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADV in pediatric subjects with CHB who were 2 to &lt; 18 years old at the time of the first dose of study treatment. Forty-eight weeks interim efficacy and safety data were provided from this study as part of the Type II variation II30.  The  ADV  doses  were  based  on  the  findings  of  a  Phase 1/2  clinical  pharmacology  study conducted  in  45 pediatric  subjects  with  CHB  (Study  GS-02-517).  An  investigational  ADV  oral suspension  was  used  in  subjects  2 -11  years  old  and  the  marketed  10-mg  ADV  tablet  was  used  in subjects 12 to17 years old. The investigational oral suspension formulation was developed to allow age- and weight-based dosing of pediatric patients for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy and safety of the drug in pediatric patients. The effects of long-term therapy with ADV in this patient population were to be assessed in this 5-year study. On the basis of the Week 48 data from Study GS-US-103-0518, Hepsera tablets was approved for the treatment of adolescents (≥ 12 years of age) with CHB by the US Food and Drug Administration on 19 December 2007.

Rapporteur's comment: As illustrated above, during the open-label phase of the study patients could be withdrawn from adefovir if either : -they had respond to therapy, i.e.  had  HBV  DNA&lt;1000  copies/ml  and  achieved  HBeAg seroconversion; or if, on the contrary: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

-  they failed to suppress HBV DNA, i.e. they had HBV DNA&gt; 1000 copies/ml under ADV (or under ADV+LAM in treatment-experienced adolescents  patients)
- As  a  consequence,  patients  who  remained  on  ADV  during  the  open-label  phase  of  the  study  were patients who achieved HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml and tolerated study drug. However, on a case-bycase basis, regardless of age or prior lamivudine exposure, an investigator may have determined that the benefit of continuing ADV, despite suboptimal suppression of HBV, clearly outweighed the risk of resistance development.
- Overall, a heterogenous population of patients were on study drug or off drug during the open-label study. Some difficulties in the interpretation of results for the open-label phase might be anticipated.

A total of 136 subjects (96 ADV-ADV, 40 PLB-ADV) discontinued study drug between Weeks 48 and 240. The  reasons  for  study  drug  discontinuation  were HBsAg or HBeAg seroconversion (55 subjects),  other  (61  subjects), missing  (8  subjects),  subject  noncompliance  (5  subjects),  withdrew consent (2 subjects), progression of disease (2 subjects), adverse event/intercurrent illness (1 subject), lost to follow-up (1 subject), and nonresponse to study drugs (1 subject).).

Of the 162 subjects who participated in the open-label period, 81 subjects (46 ADV-ADV, 35 PLBADV) completed the open-label study period, and 71 of these subjects (43 ADV-ADV, 28 PLB-ADV) entered treatment-free follow-up. A total of 26 subjects completed Week 240 on study drug (12 ADVADV, 14 PLB-ADV). Of these 26 subjects, 17 were on a combination of lamivudine plus ADV per virologic failure criteria stipulated in Amendment 3. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

In  the  12  to  17  year-old  age  group,  of  the  75  subjects,  57  subjects  (42  ADV-ADV; 15  PLB-ADV) discontinued the study drug between Weeks 48 and 240. The most common reasons for discontinuing the study drug were other (25 subjects), HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion (22 subjects).

Rapporteur's comment: Only half of the patients (n=81/162) completed the 5-year study period (either on  or  off  drug  at  week  240)  and  among  them  71  patients  entered  treatment-free  follow-up,  which makes the assessment of the long term data rather limited.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among the 162 patients who entered open-label period, 26 (16%) were still on ADV at the end of the 5 year  study;  55  patients  (34%)  discontinued  study  drug  following  'success'  (HBe-  or  HBs-  Ag seroconversion); most (56%) of the patients discontinued study drug for 'other reasons' (many due to treatment failure).

Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  data  for  the  open-label  period  (n  =  162)  were  similar between the ADV-ADV and PLB-ADV groups. The mean age (11 years) and age range (2 to 17) were the same in both groups. Males comprised 63.0% of the ADV-ADV subset, and comprised 68.5% of the  group  assigned  to  PLB-ADV.  Racial  distribution  was  similar  across  both  groups,  with  61.1% White and 26.9% Asian in the ADV-ADV group and 72.2% White and 18.5% Asian in the PLB-ADV group.

Summary of CHMP conclusion on the 48 weeks efficacy data (made in the setting of VAR II30 in 2008):

The  majority  of  subjects  had  HBV  genotype  A  at  baseline  (48.8%).  Most  (57%)  were  treatmentexperienced  patients.  Mean  (SD)  baseline  HBV  DNA  was  8.8  (0.82)  log10  copies/mL  and  median ALT levels were 2.3 ULN; which was similar between the 2 treatment groups. Rapporteur's  comment:  Baseline  characteristics  of  the  open-label  analysis  set  were  similar  to  the baseline characteristics of the global study population, i.e. not a population with active CHB. -Results As  a  reminder,  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (HBV  DNA  &lt;  1000  copies/mL  plus  Normal  ALT)  results from the study Week 48 analysis were the following: Randomized-and-Treated (RAT) analysis set ADV = adefovir dipivoxil, PLB = placebo a Age at first dose of study treatment; ranges are inclusive (ie, 2 to &lt; 7 years; ≥ 7 to &lt; 12 years; ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years) b Week-48 data; if Week 48 was missing, Week 44 was carried forward; if Week-44 was missing, missing = failure c Fisher's Exact test (ADV versus placebo at end of blinded treatment); missing = failure analysis Of note, in view of the poor results in the 2-6 and 7-11 years children included in study GS-US-1030518, the Applicant did not apply for an extension of the indication in these age groups and only requested to extend the indication of Hepsera to adolescents. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

'The proportion of children aged 12 to &lt;18 years old who achieved the primary endpoint (serum HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml  and  normal  ALT  at  48  weeks)  was  significantly  higher  in  adefovirtreated patients when compared to placebo-treated patients (ADV: 12 (23%) vs Placebo: 0).

However,  before  encouraging  the  use  of  adefovir  of  adolescents  by  granting  an  indication  in  this target population, several issues need to be carefully weighted.

- -the study population has particular limitations :
- o limited sample size : ADV: n=56, Placebo: n=27
- o does  not  strictly  match  the  population  targeted  in  clinical  practice  with  active, progressive disease

In this study patients were eligible if they had ALT levels ≥ 1.5 ULN. Therefore, a significant part of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the small population included in this pivotal study have minimal hepatitis disease.

- -the definition of the primary endpoint is not optimal since it does not include the rate of HBeAg seroconversion.
- -As a matter of fact, the significant antiviral efficacy of adefovir is no longer apparent on the relevant  endpoint combining  serum  HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml, normal ALT and HBeAg seroconversion (there is no statistically significant difference on the proportion of patients who achieved  this combined endpoint : ADV 7%, placebo 0%).

These results are explained by the fact that no difference was observed over the placebo arm in term of HBeAg seroconversion in children above 12 years old (11% vs 11%).

- -Given  the  low  LLQ  of  the  HBV  DNA  assay  used  in  this  study  (i.e.  169  copies/ml), a  more stringent  criterion  of  the  virological  response  might  have  been  chosen for  the  primary endpoint.

Surprisingly,  with  the  stringent  definition  of  decrease  of  HBV  DNA  to  undetectable  level  (at  169 copies/ml),  a  better  response  is  observed  in  younger  children  when  compared  to  adolescents (whereas they were considered as poorer responders on the proportion of patients achieving HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml). Indeed, only 4 patients (7%) achieved undetectability in the 12-17 years age group (versus 13% and 17% in the age groups 2-6 and 7-11, respectively).' A major objection was raised by the CHMP. The MAH acknowledging the CHMP concern decided not to pursue an extension of HESPERA in adolescents. - ADV Open-label Period (current submission): The  key  Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints  from  open-label  period  of  study  GS-US-103-0518  are presented below: Mean change from baseline in HBV DNA level The decreasing trend in  mean  serum  HBV  DNA continued over time after ADV Week 48 in both treatment groups, at which time mean change was -3.43 log10 copies/mL (standard deviation [SD] 1.561) in the ADV-ADV on-treatment group (n=106) and -3.69 log10 copies/mL (SD 1.658) in the PLB-ADV on-treatment group (n=50). By ADV Week 240, mean change from ADV baseline in HBV DNA was -5.87 log10 copies/mL (SD 1.826) in the ADV-ADV on-treatment group (n=7) and only slightly smaller in the ADV-ADV offtreatment group (n=39) at Week 240 (-5.02 log10 copies/mL, SD 1.474). At ADV Week 192 (last ADV time point for the PLB-ADV group), mean change from ADV baseline in HBV DNA for the PLB-ADV on-treatment group (n=9) was -5.41 log10 copies/mL (SD 1.573). For those in the PLB-ADV off-treatment group at Week 192 (n=26), mean change was smaller (-4.46 log10 copies/mL, SD 1.701). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## HBV DNA&lt;1000 copies/ml

After  Week  72,  the  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  ADV-ADV  on-treatment  group  with  HBV  DNA below 1000 copies/mL declined overall, dropping to 5.6% (6/108 subjects) by ADV Week 240, based on  an  analysis  in  which  subjects  with  missing  data  were  considered  as  failures  (Missing=Failure analysis). After ADV Week 48, the percentage of subjects in the PLB-ADV on-treatment group with HBV  DNA  below  1000  copies/mL  increased  to  33.3%  (18/54  subjects)  at  ADV  Week  96,  and decreased  to  14.8%  (8/54  subjects)  by  ADV  Week  192.  For  the  ADV-ADV  on-treatment  group  at Week 192, 14.8% (16/108 subjects) had HBV DNA below 1000 copies/mL.

When considering only the patients who remained on ADV (as reflected by Missing=Excluded analysis), the percentage in the ADV-ADV on-treatment group with HBV DNA below 1000 copies/mL at ADV Week 192 was 94.1% (16/17 subjects), and was somewhat lower by ADV Week 240 (6/7 subjects, 85.7%). The percentage of subjects in the PLB-ADV on-treatment group with HBV DNA below 1000 copies/mL was 100% at ADV Week 132 (18/18 subjects), and was 88.9% (8/9 subjects) by ADV Week 192.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Due to the number of discontinuations in this study (of importance, discontinuation was required per protocol if HBV DNA was confirmed ≥ 1000 copies/mL), the last on-treatment HBV DNA results are relevant.  Overall  about  half  of  the  subjects  had  HBV  DNA  below  1000  copies/mL  at  the  last  ontreatment visit. In the ADV-ADV group 42.6% (46/108 subjects) had HBV DNA values below 1000 copies/mL, and in the PLB-ADV group 61.1% (33/54 subjects) were below this threshold at the last on-treatment visit. Normal ALT The percentage of subjects of any age with normal ALT for both the on-treatment ADV-ADV and PLB-ADV groups generally decreased over time after ADV Week 48, while the opposite was true for those in both off-treatment groups (M=F analysis). Age group 12 to 17 years Of  note,  there  were  no  notable  differences  in  HBV  DNA  and  ALT  endpoints  based  on  subgroup analyses of subjects aged 12 to 17 years versus those based on all age groups combined. HBe seroconversion Overall, 68/160 subjects (42.5%) on treatment at their last visit had experienced  HBeAg seroconversion, and 73/135 subjects (54.1%) off treatment at their last visit had done so. Moreover,  78.3%  of  subjects  (54/69)  achieved  durable  HBeAg  seroconversion,  with  a  somewhat higher percentage achieving seroconversion in the ADV-ADV group (37/45 subjects, 82.2%) than in the PLB-ADV group (17/24 subjects, 70.8%). Mean duration of durable HBeAg seroconversion for all age groups was 762 days (SD 371.2) in the ADV-ADV group and 643 days (SD 291.5) in the PLBADV group. HBs seroconversion Four  subjects  in  the  ADV-ADV  group  and  1  subject  in  the  PLB-ADV  group  experienced  HBsAg seroconversion during the study (note: seroconversion occurred during ADV therapy at W180 for the patients in the PLB-ADV group). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Among the 162 patients who entered open-label period, half discontinued prematurely from the study. Furthermore, at week 240, only 26 (16%) were still on ADV (most of the patients having stopped study drug due to insufficient virologic suppression).

After  48  weeks  on  ADV,  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HBV  DNA  was  -3.43  in  patients  initially randomized to ADV and -3.69 in patients initially randomized to placebo. At the end of ADV treatment (W240  for  ADV-ADV  patients  and  W192  for  PLB-ADV  patients),  mean  change  from  baseline  was almost  similar  in  both  groups:  -5.87  log 10 copies/ml  in  ADV-ADV  patients  (n=7)  and  -5.41  log10 copies/ml in PLB-ADV patients (n=9). For the few patients who remained on study drug during the 5 years study, it seems that receiving placebo during the first 2 years of the study was not 'pejorative' in terms of virological response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the study results, and notably HBV DNA and ALT endpoints, are hardly interpretable due to the fact that:

- sample size are limited (half of the patients completed the open-label period of the study)
- the open-label dataset is heterogenous (eg: exposure to ADV is heterogenous, on-treatment patients included some patients on ADV+LAM combination therapy, off-treatment patients included patients who stopped ADV for failure to treatment or, on the contrary, following seroconversion).

Nevertheless, we can note that around half of the paediatric patients failed to adequately suppress HBV DNA. For the remaining patients, virologic suppression (HBV DNA&lt;1000 copies/ml) was mostly associated  with  HBeAg  seroconversion  since  around  50%  of  paediatric  patients  had  HBeAg seroconversion  in  this  study;  a  rate  close  to  the  rate  reported  in  long-term  study  in  adults. Seroconversion was documented as durable for 78% of these patients. It was noteworthy that at the end of the double-blind period, 11% of adolescents patients had HBeAg seroconversion in both the ADV arm and the placebo arm at week 48. Spontaneous seroconversion was not documented in the open-label phase of the study since patients on placebo were switched to ADV after W48. Very few (n=4) achieved the ideal endpoint of HBsAg seroconversion.

Comparison with adults data: As a reminder, in HBeAg+ adults patients, long term data were available from study GS-98-437. At week 240, 42 patients (25%) were still on ADV; among them 39% had HBV DNA &lt;1000 copies/ml and  66%  had  normalized  ALT.  Median  change  from  baseline  was  -4.05  log10 copies/ml.Over  the course of the study, 48% of patients had confirmed HBeAg seroconversion and 2% (n=4) had HBs seroconversion. To conclude, the long-term efficacy data are based on limited sample size and are presented for a heterogeneous  population  which  makes  the  interpretation  of  the  study  results  very  difficult.  As recognised by the MAH, ADV is not an optimal treatment for paediatric patients including adolescents patients.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  at  the  end  of  the  5  years  study,  more  than  50%  of  patients  were insufficiently suppressed and withdrawn from ADV. The long-term data further support the negative opinion previously given by the CHMP on the basis of the 48 weeks data of the study. Clinical Virology findings Cumulative Summary of Resistance Surveillance by Treatment and Previous HBV Treatment Exposure Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- a Subjects were excluded from analysis if HBV DNA values were &lt; 169 copies/mL at Week 240/last time point or if subject discontimed study drug but remained in the study.
- b One subject in this category diseontimued study dhug at Week 44 with HBV DNA ≥&gt; 169 copies/mL, the sample was not evaluated for genotypic changes since only Week 48 samples were to be tested.
- C Two subjects in the category (treatment naive in the placebo amm) discontimued prior to the open-label phase and were therefore not evaluated for genotypic changes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Annual resistance surveillance was conducted for all subjects who had HBV DNA levels greater than or equal to the level of detection by PCR (≥ 169 copies/mL) during the open-label phase of the study. Among  subjects  originally  randomized  to  receive  ADV,  the  rtN236T  ADV-associated  resistance mutation developed in one treatment-naive subject.

Development  of  the  rtN236T  mutation  occurred  at  Week  240  of  ADV  monotherapy  and  was associated  with  virologic  breakthrough.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  developing  ADV  associated resistance  mutations  (rtA181V/T  or  rtN236T)  within  the  HBV  pol/RT  among  subjects  originally receiving ADV was 0% and 4% for the experienced and naïve populations, respectively.

None of  the  PLB-ADV  subjects  developed  an  ADV-associated  resistance  mutation  while  on  ADV monotherapy.

Among the 32 subjects who received lamivudine in addition to adefovir, the rtA181T ADV and LAMassociated  resistance  mutation  was  observed  in  one  subject  at  the  last  time  point  on  therapy. Development of  the  mutation  occurred  at  Week  204;  the  subject  was  originally  randomized  to  the ADV arm and added LAM at week 144. In addition, one subject  developed lamivudine-associated mutations  (rtL180M  and/or  rtM204V/I).  The  subject  was  originally  randomized  to  the  ADV  arm; lamivudine was added at Week 144, and the mutations were observed at Week 180 (last time point on study drug). Nine  treatment-experienced  subjects  (6  in  the  ADV-ADV  group  and  3  in  the  PLB-ADV  group) entered the study with mutations associated with lamivudine (the rtM204V/I mutation [with or without rtL180M] and the rtA181A/T mutation). All 9 subjects responded to ADV therapy, with a median change  from  baseline  in  HBV  DNA  of  5.41  log10  copies/mL  at  the  last  time  point  on  ADV monotherapy. Rapporteur's comment: As a reminder, no children developed rtA181T or rtN236T mutation over 48 weeks. Only 1 paediatric patient developed ADV mutation (rtN236T) which occurred at Week 240 and was associated  with  breakthrough.  One  additional  patient  that  received  LAM+ADV  developed  rtA181T mutation (which is associated with resistance to LAM and reduced susceptibility to ADV). The low rate of emergence of mutation in this study has to be balanced with the small number of patients who remained on drug during the open-label phase of the study (more than half of the patients (n=87) had discontinued ADV before the end of Year 3 and only 26 were still on drug at the end of the study). Safety Results: Extent of exposure The mean duration of open-label exposure to ADV for all age groups was 98 weeks overall (90 weeks for subjects who received randomized ADV during the first 48 weeks of the study and 113 weeks in subjects who received randomized placebo during the first 48 weeks of the study).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall frequency of AEs during the open-label period was 69.4% of subjects in the ADV-ADV group  and  87.0%  of  subjects  in  the  PLB-ADV  group  while  on  treatment.  While  off-treatment,  the overall frequency of AEs was 55.6% in the ADV-ADV group and 57.4% in the PLB-ADV group.

The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  while  subjects  were  on-treatment  were  pharyngitis  (16.0%), nasopharyngitis (12.3%), abdominal pain (11.7%), headache (9.3%), bronchitis (6.2%), rash (6.2%), and  tonsillitis  (5.6%).  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  while  subjects  were  off-treatment  were hepatitis (includes hepatic flares and exacerbations of hepatitis, 14.8%), pharyngitis (8.6%), pyrexia (8.0%), nasopharyngitis (6.2%), and increased ALT (5.6%).

No new or unexpected AEs were identified. The events observed in the Weeks 48-240 were similar to those observed in the first 48 weeks of the study. Of note, a total of 46 subjects (28.4%) experienced at least one AE related to hepatic status or function during the open-label treatment period.

The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs was 7.4% in the ADV-ADV group and 9.3% in the PLB-ADV group while subjects were on-treatment and 20.4% in the ADV-ADV group and 13.0% in the PLBADV  group  while  subjects  were  off-treatment.  Serious  adverse  events  were  more  common  while subjects  were  off-treatment  than  on-treatment  (on-treatment:  ADV-ADV:  9.3%;  PLB-ADV:  5.6%; off-treatment:  ADV-ADV:  27.8%;  PLB-ADV:  18.5%).  This  was  related  to  the  incidence  of posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B, defined a priori in the protocol as an SAE. Other SAEs in subjects  who  were  on-treatment  included  alcohol  poisoning  (1.2%),  joint  injury  (1.2%),  and depression (1.2%). Two subjects in the ADV-ADV group were withdrawn from the study due to AEs during the openlabel phase while on-treatment; one had moderate depression that was an SAE and considered to be study  drug  related  and  the  other  was  withdrawn  due  to  a  moderate  rash  that  was  considered  to  be related to study drug. With the exception of ALT and AST, no marked laboratory abnormality was reported in more than 8% of  subjects  in  either  treatment  group  during  the  open-label  period.  Of  note,  Grade  3/4  increased creatine kinase was reported in 4.6% of patients in the ADV-ADV group and in 7.4% of patients in the PLB-ADV group while on-treatment. Adverse events of special interest - Hepatic adverse events: A total of 46 subjects (28.4%) experienced at least one AE related to hepatic status or function during the open-label treatment period, most being hepatic flares reported off-treatment. Hepatic flares were defined as a) serum ALT &gt; 2 × study baseline and &gt; 10 × ULN, or, b) an ALT 1grade shift or ALT 2× previous value and total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL or change from study baseline in total bilirubin = 1.0 mg/dL or change from study baseline in PT &gt; 2 seconds or serum albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dL or change from study baseline in serum albumin ≤ -1.0 g/dL. As would be expected, hepatic flares were observed in a much higher proportion of subjects who were off  ADV  treatment  than  those  who  were  on  ADV  treatment.  Four  subjects  (2.5%)  who  were  ontreatment (3 (2.8%) ADV-ADV subjects and 1 (1.9%) PLB ADV subject) and 31 subjects (19.6%) who were off-treatment (ADV-ADV: 23.1%; PLB-ADV: 11.1%) had changes in laboratory values that met the definition of a hepatic flare. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Most hepatic flares were limited to increases in ALT without concurrent confirmed abnormalities in PT, albumin, or bilirubin, except for 3 patients (2 had increased in total bilirubin and 1 had grade 1 abnormalities in PT). None of the hepatic flares were associated with decompensation.

## - Renal adverse events:

No  AEs  suggested  adverse  effects  on  renal  function.  In  addition,  there  were no  subjects  with confirmed  phosphorous  &lt;  2  mg/dL,  or  creatinine  clearance  (Schwartz  and/or  Cockcroft  &amp; Gault) &lt; 50 mL/min.

However,  more  subjects  receiving  ADV-ADV  (15.7%)  on-treatment  had  a  confirmed  increase  in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL above the ADV baseline value compared to PLB-ADV subjects (13.0%). This difference was also seen in subjects who were off-treatment (ADV-ADV: 19.4%; PLB-ADV: 7.4%).

- Adverse events related to appetite No subject had an AE related to decreased food intake or weight loss. Two (1.2%) on-treatment ADVADV subjects and 2 (1.2%) off-treatment subjects (one ADV-ADV and one PLB-ADV) had anorexia, that were judged as unrelated to study drug. In  general,  the height,  weight,  and  BMI  Z-scores  for  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  were lower  than  Z-scores  for  the  reference  population  at  Week  240  for  subjects  who  were  ontreatment. However,  Z-scores  for  height  and  weight  for  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  were similar to those for the reference population for subjects who were off-treatment at Week 240. There were statistically significant differences in height and weight between the two treatment groups at Week 240 only (p = 0.017 and p = 0.048, respectively). However, very small numbers of subjects were  included  in  this  calculation  at  Week  240  (ADV-ADV:  5;  PLB-ADV:  8).  No  significant differences  in  height  or  weight  were  seen  at  any  other  time  point  for  both  treatment  groups  while subjects were on-treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in weight between the two treatment  groups  for  subjects  who  were  off-treatment  at  Week  192  only  (p  =  0.019).  There  was  a statistically significant difference in BMI between the two treatment groups at Week 48 (p = 0.005). No significant differences in BMI were seen at any other time point for both treatment groups while subjects were on-treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in BMI between the two treatment groups for subjects who were off-treatment at Week 144 (p &lt; 0.001). Rapporteur's comment: No unexpected adverse events were reported during the open-label period of the study. However, a notable  high  rate  of  hepatic  flares  post-treatment  was  reported  in  this  paediatric  study.  Indeed, around 20% of study patients experienced hepatic flares following discontinuation of ADV (less than 10% had exacerbation of hepatitis post-treatment in adults studies -437 and -438). Fortunately, none were  associated  with  decompensation  in  this  study.  Nevertheless,  the  high  rate  of  hepatic  flares reported in the paediatric population is of concern. Confirmed increase in creatinine of 0.5mg/dl was reported in 2.5% of patients on-treatment and 3.1% of patients off-treatment. None were associated with renal adverse events in this study. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

As for other nucleoside analogs, particular caution should be given to laboratory abnormalities which might be associated with mitochondrial toxicity. Of note, grade 3/4 increases in creatinine kinase were reported in around 5% of patients in this study but none were associated with marked clinical events.

Finally, the long-term safety data on ADV do not allow dispelling the fears as regards the potential impact  of  ADV  on  appetite-related  disorders  and  growth.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  BMI  Z-scores  were negative in both the ADV-ADV and PMB-ADV groups at W240 indicating that patients had lower BMI at the end of the study than typical for their age and gender.

## B. ASSESSMENT OF SUPPLEMENTAL DATA RELATED TO FU2 028.7

In accordance with FU2 028 (FUM 9), additional analyses of the presence of basal core promoter and pre-core mutations at baseline among hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive paediatric patients were conducted  in  Study  GS-US-103-0518.  The  purposes  of  these  analyses  were  to  assess  whether  the presence of these mutations can predict the likelihood of HBeAg seroconversion, and of whether these mutations  are  related  to  treatment  response.  These  results  are  still  being  gathered.  However, preliminary  data  has  shown  that  the  baseline  incidence  of  basal  core  promoter  mutations  was significantly associated with confirmed HBeAg seroconversion, but the baseline incidence of precore mutations was not. Poster 360 (Chappell et al, 2009) details the preliminary data (please see in annex). Final results from these additional analyses will be shared when available.

Rapporteur's comment: The  clinical  impact  of  pre-existing  basal  core  promoter  and  precore  mutations  at  baseline  on  the likelihood of seroconversion will be discussed in the light of the final data. MAH's conclusions on the Benefits and Risks Based on the efficacy and safety findings of Study GS-US-103-0518, the sponsor concludes that ADV provides  a  treatment  option  in  12 -17-year-old  patients  with  CHB.  However,  it  is  not  an  optimal treatment  as  a  sizable  proportion  of  adolescent  patients  failed  to  achieve  HBV  DNA  suppression &lt;1000 copies/mL. Additionally, given the failure to suppress HBV DNA adequately in a majority of the  2 -6-  and  7 -11-year-old  subjects  and  the  attendant  risk  of  genotypic  adefovir  resistance,  ADV treatment presents an uncertain risk-benefit ratio in patients less than 12 years of age. Although some younger patients may derive virologic or serologic benefit, the majority of these subjects would be at risk for emergence of resistance due to the failure of ADV to suppress HBV DNA adequately. This would limit future treatment options. It would therefore seem prudent to defer treatment with ADV until an age at which adequate virologic suppression would be expected. Based on the data presented in this application, no changes to the national prescribing information are proposed to support the use of Hepsera in pediatric patients.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) n°1901/2006, GILEAD is submitting the final study report for the paediatric study GS-US-103-0518. The 48 weeks double-blind data from this study were previously assessed by the CHMP in the setting of the extension variation II30, submitted by the MAH to extend the indication of Hepsera to adolescents above 12 years of age. In the light of the 48 weeks data, the CHMP considered that the clinical study did not provide convincing arguments to consider that the use of ADV might be more beneficial than deleterious in adolescents. In view of the major objections raised by the CHMP, the MAH decided not to pursue the extension of indication. As such, HEPSERA is not indicated in adolescents in Europe.

As a matter of fact, and as a general consideration, it is noteworthy that since the arrival of drugs with both high potency and high genetic barrier, tenofovir and entecavir, the place of drugs such as adefovir and lamivudine has been quite marginalised in the therapeutic armamentarium, whatever the situation. The  long-term  data  presented  in  the  current  submission  do  not  allow  reversing  the  previous conclusion. The available data do not support a positive benefit/risk ratio for Hepsera in paediatric patients, including adolescents. As a matter of fact, most of the patients, including adolescents, were insufficiently suppressed with HEPSERA. In terms of safety, the high rate of hepatic flares reported in this study following discontinuation of ADV is of concern. Increase in creatinine and CPK levels as well as the fears as regards a potential impact on growth are also causes for concern for the paediatric patients. HEPSERA SPC currently reflects the 48 weeks data of study GS-US-103-0518. The wording aimed at discouraging the off label use of adefovir in the paediatric population. The long-term data should also be shortly reflected. We would be in favour of replacing the terms 'due  to  insufficient  data'  by  'due  to  the  limitations  of  the  available  data  on  safety  and  efficacy', insofar that insufficient might appear somewhat contradictory when considering that long term data are now available. The message should that the available data as such fail to provide sufficient degree of reassurance in terms of efficacy and safety. We propose to revise the SPC as follows: 4.2: Children and adolescents: Hepsera is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 years due to insufficient the limitations of the available data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1). 5.1 Paediatric population: The efficacy and safety of a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg to 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil in children (aged from 2 to &lt; 18 years) was examined in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 173 paediatric patients (115 on adefovir dipivoxil, 58 on placebo) who had HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B, serum ALT levels ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and compensated liver disease.  At week 48, in children aged 2 to 11 years old, no statistically significant difference was observed in the proportions of patients that achieved the primary endpoint of serum HBV DNA &lt; 1,000 copies/ml and normal ALT levels between the placebo arm and the adefovir dipivoxil arm.  In the adolescent population (n=83) (aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years), significantly more patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil achieved the primary efficacy endpoint and obtained significant reductions in serum HBV DNA (23 %) compared to placebo-treated patients (0 %).  However, the proportions of subjects who achieved HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 were similar (11 %) between the placebo arm and the adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg arm in adolescent patients.

Overall, the safety profile of adefovir dipivoxil in children was consistent with the known safety profile in adult patients.  However, a signal towards a higher rate of decreased appetite and/or food intake was observed in the adefovir arm as compared to the placebo arm.  At week 48 and 96, mean changes from baseline in weight and BMI Z scores tended to decrease in adefovir dipivoxil-treated patients. No long-term safety data or long-term resistance data are available with adefovir dipivoxil in children.

At Week 48, all placebo-treated subjects who did not exhibit HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion, plus all ADV-treated subjects, were offered the opportunity to receive open-label ADV from study week 49

through to week 240. A high rate (30%) of hepatic flares were reported following discontinuation of adefovir dipivoxil during the 3 years open label phase of the study. Furthermore, for the few patients who remained on drug at week 240 (n=12) BMI Z score was lower than typical for their age and gender. Very few patients developed adefovir-associated mutations up to 5 years; however, the number of patients who remained on drugs above week 96 was limited.

Due to their limitations, Tthe clinical data available are insufficient do not allow to draw definitive conclusions on the benefit/risk ratio of the adefovir treatment in children with chronic hepatitis B (see section 4.2)'.

Finally,  the  MAH acknowledged that HEPSERA is not an optimal option for paediatric patients in view of  its  low  potency  in  this  population.  This  consideration  of  course  also  holds  true  for  adults. Hepsera can no longer be regarded as an optimal first line monotherapy besides tenofovir or entecavir should be reflected in the SPC.

Fully acknowledging that it is out of the scope of this FUM, the Rapporteur would nevertheless like to take the opportunity of this procedure, to ask the applicant to make a proposal for a revision of the indication. The following concept should be introduced \"when the use of an alternative antiviral agent with  a  higher  potency  and  a  higher  genetic  barrier  is  not  available  or  appropriate  and  the  need  to combine  the  drug  with  a  second  agent  without  cross-resistance  to  adefovir  in  patients  with decompensated liver disease.'  Recommendation Fulfilled The MAH should commit to submit type II variation to reflect the long-term data from study GS-US-103-0518  in  paediatric  patients  and  to  revise  the  indication  to  reflect  the  fact  that Hepsera  can  no  longer  be  regarded  as  a  first  line  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  HBVinfected patients. FUM 28: The MAH should submit the final results from the analyses of the incidence of basal core promoter and precore mutations at baseline among HBeAg paediatric patients when available.
