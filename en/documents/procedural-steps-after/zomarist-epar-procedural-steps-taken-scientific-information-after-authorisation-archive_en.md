| WS/1072   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC, subsection 'cardiovascular risk', with results from a new meta- analysis evaluating the cardiovascular safety of vildagliptin. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to bring the annexes in line with the latest QRD template version 10, and to merge the two SmPCs into one single SmPC for Eucreas, Icandra and Zomarist. Moreover, the section on pregnancy and breast-feeding in the PL for Eucreas/Icandra/Zomarist has been aligned with the wording used for Galvus/Jalra/Xiliarx. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 21/04/2017   | 16/03/2018   | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL   | A meta-analysis of independently and prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events from 37 phase III and IV monotherapy and combination therapy clinical studies of up to more than 2 years duration (mean exposure 50 weeks for vildagliptin and 49 weeks for comparators) was performed and showed that vildagliptin treatment was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk versus comparators. The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including acute myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was similar for vildagliptin versus combined active and placebo comparators [Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (M-H RR) 0.82 (95% CI 0.61 1.11)]. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9,599 (0.86%) vildagliptin-treated patients and in 85 out of 7,102 (1.20%) comparator-treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component showed no increased risk (similar M-H RR). Confirmed heart failure (HF) events defined as HF requiring hospitalisation or new onset of HF were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients and 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients with M-H RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.68 1.70).   |

C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | 25/04/2014 | 13/04/2015 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The MAH has provided information on clinical studies that may provide further safety data with regards to pancreatic safety in patients treated with vildagliptin. In the absence of a CV outcome study, the VERIFY study is discussed. This study is relatively small (2000 patients) when it comes to investigating uncommon events but instead of long duration (5 years). Adverse events will be captured with routine methods in the study with specific analyses of pancreatic events which is considered sufficient. Timelines have been provided and are acceptable. The MAH has also provided information on the only observational study currently ongoing and planned. The study protocol already includes pancreatitis as an outcome of interest and the protocol has been amended with pancreatic cancer. The updated protocol is included in the updated RMP. The benefit/risk balance for Galvus/Eucreas remains positive. |

| WS/0125   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of product information with data on liver dysfunction received by the MAH from marketed use of vildagliptin. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 20/10/2011   | 24/11/2011   | SmPC and PL   | The clinical safety database for vildagliptin consists of pooled analysis of data from 38 clinical trials including more than 11,500 patients treated with vildagliptin. Furthermore, post-marketing data are available from more than 1.24 million patient years. Data from clinical trials, although not statistically significant, indicate a slightly increased risk of persistent transaminase elevation in patients treated with vildagliptin relative to the comparators. This risk is reflected in the current labeling. Following a request by the CHMP (EMA/549257/2010), the MAH has conducted an evaluation of all reports related to liver dysfunction received from marketed use of vildagliptin (including Galvus and Eucreas) since the original placing on the market. The cumulative post-marketing experience has identified seven cases consistent with a drug-related liver event and a further 15 cases where a causal association cannot be excluded. Based on this, the CHMP considered that the safety information referring to the post-marketing experience in section 4.8 should be updated to reflect this safety concern. Additionally, the MAH agreed to the CHMP request that adverse liver events should be reviewed again in future PSURs.   |

|           | Update of Section 4.4 of the SPC and relevant section of the PL to include a warning on pancreatitis, following assessment of the latest PSUR. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH   |     | of acute pancreatitis, that resolution has been observed after discontinuation and that treatment should not be resumed after pancreatitis has been diagnosed. Few cases of pancreatitis were reported in the clinical trials safety data base and there was no apparent imbalance between vildagliptin and comparators/placebo. In five of the cases the pancreatitis occurred in the context of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis and all the four cases in which vildagliptin was re-initiated belonged to this group. That is, all the rechallenged cases had an easily identifiable risk factor for pancreatitis present and all four rechallenges were negative. The post-marketing data presented with the current variation covers the period up to 30 April 2011. The cut-off date for the latest PSUR was 30 Nov 2010, thus the current report covers an additional time period of five months. Overall, the analysis of post-marketing events consistent with pancreatitis in vildagliptin agents revealed 42 cases of pancreatitis/acute pancreatitis and 15 cases of reported elevated lipase/amylase. The majority of reported cases had additional risk factors for pancreatitis. A warning statement on acute pancreatitis and that patients should be informed on the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis has been introduced in the product information, in line with the current warnings given for other DPP4-inhibitors. The data provided with this variation is not considered to   |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications | 16/12/2010 | 27/01/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | During the review of the original marketing authorization application for vildagliptin, there was only a limited number of patients > 75 years who had been treated with vildagliptin (N=113) in clinical studies. Since then, the number of elderly patients ? 75 years treated with vildagliptin has increased. In the enlarged database, 334 patients > 75 years were exposed to vildagliptin, 295 of which are included in the main safety population and up to 187 in the efficacy populations. The majority of the patients were treated with the approved dose 50 mg bid. The submitted analyses support a similar efficacy in elderly patients compared to the younger population with respect to reduction of HbA1c and FPG. The treatment was largely weight neutral and the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low. No other safety issues compared to comparators or the |

| WS/0005/G | This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Section 5.1 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC) has been updated to include information on 2 new vildagliptin studies. Additionally, the adverse event pancreatitis has been added to section 4.8 of the SPC. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH | 20/05/2010 | 05/07/2010 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The MAH has provided results from two clinical studies (LAF237A2338 and LMF237A2302) and proposed to include information from these studies in section 5.1 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC). The first one was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment (52 weeks) with vildagliptin to gliclazide in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. The presented results from this study are in line with what has been seen in previous studies with vildagliptin in combination with sulfonylurea. The second study was a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled initial combination therapy study with the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin plus metformin in drug naïve patients with T2DM. The results of this study demonstrated that initial combination therapy with the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin plus metformin was statistically superior to that of both individual monotherapy components. Initial combination therapy is not recommended as first line treatment in treatment guidelines and is not in line with the approved indication for vildagliptin. However, the CHMP accepted that information on this study was added to section 5.1 of the SPC. |

The increased database was also utilized to conduct an extensive analysis of the cardiovascular safety of vildagliptin. The CHMP agreed that this information is consistent with the previously submitted pooled safety data and does not signal any new, unidentified concerns. Additionally, section 4.8 of the SPC and relevant section of the Package Leaflet have been updated to include pancreatitis as a post-marketing adverse event.   |

| II/0003 | Update of SPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 and PL to include information on the results of 3 active-controlled long- term clinical studies. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 23/07/2009 | 02/09/2009 | SmPC and PL | During the review of the initial Marketing Authorisation application for vildagliptin, the Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to submit the results of ongoing, active- controlled, long-term, comparative studies. This included one 2-year monotherapy study, one ? 2-year add-on combination therapy study with metformin, and one 1-year (24 week + 28 week extension) add-on combination therapy study with metformin. The results of these studies have now become available and are discussed in the current variation application. Furthermore, a review of the safety of vildagliptin has been performed, integrating data from the above studies of up to more than 2 years in duration as well as from additional studies. |

In all studies the absolute reduction of HbA1c with vildagliptin was lower compared to the comparators. Concerning safety, vildagliptin has a hypoglycemia profile superior to that of glimepiride and similar to that of pioglitazone and metformin. Previously, signals concerning hepatic and skin safety have been identified. In the current updated safety data set, slightly higher odds of having a persistent transaminase elevation with vildagliptin were found. Concerning skin safety, the incidences of skin/vascular AEs were low and not statistically significant. No additional safety signals were seen.   |
