## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain  to  which  most  or  all  humans  are  immunologically  naïve  emerges  to  cause  clinically  apparent illness,  and  then  spreads  easily  from  person  to  person  worldwide.  Pandemics  are  different  from seasonal  outbreaks  of  influenza,  as  the  latter  are  caused  by  subtypes  of  influenza  viruses  that  are already circulating in the world whereas pandemics are caused by new subtypes or by subtypes that have not circulated among people for a long time.

The influenza viruses constitute a genus within the family of orthomyxoviruses that are able to infect a wide  range  of  species.  The  primary  site  of  infection  and  of  viral  replication  is  in  the  respiratory epithelium. The segmented RNA genome of influenza viruses encodes two major surface antigens haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Haemagglutinin facilitates viral attachment to respiratory epithelia and neuraminidase appears to cleave the bond between the viral haemagglutinin and the host cell receptor, so facilitating the release of virions from infected cells and allowing spread to uninfected cells in the vicinity. Both H and N antigens of influenza A and B viruses may undergo minor antigenic changes (antigenic drift)  over  time.  Antigenic  drift  necessitates  regular  (most  often  annual)  updating  of  the  A  and  B strains that are included in inter-pandemic (seasonal) influenza vaccines. Major  changes  (antigenic  shift)  in  haemagglutinins  occur  much  less  commonly  and  only  in  type  A strains but are of great importance to human health. Antigenic shifts may occur via serial mutations or by gene re-assortment. The H1N1v strain responsible for the current pandemic is a triple reassortant containing genes variably derived from avian, swine and human adapted strains. Specific guidance has been developed for the fast track assessment procedure for pandemic influenza vaccines 1 , which can only be used once WHO/EU have officially declared the pandemic. The procedure involves the submission and evaluation of a core pandemic dossier during the inter-pandemic period, followed  by  a  fast  track  assessment  of  the  data  for  replacing  the  mock-up  vaccine  strain  with  the recommended pandemic strain as a variation to the MAA. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has submitted a Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (core  pandemic  dossier)  for  Pumarix  in  line  with  the  above mentioned guidelines. Pumarix  is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine, containing the mock-up strain H5N1 derived by reverse  genetics  from  the  avian  influenza  virus  A/Indonesia/05/2005  (H5N1)  The  final  formulation contains 3.75 μ g haemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. Pumarix is indicated for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance. From  an  epidemiological  point  of  view  it  is  very  unlikely  that  influenza  strain  A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) would be the next pandemic strain, since the H5N1 virus continues to undergo antigenic drift. It is also possible that the next pandemic will not be caused by a H5N1 virus but will be due to another subtype  of  influenza  virus  (e.g.  with  haemagglutinin  of  type  H2,  H7  or  H9).  In  line  with  the  core dossier  concept,  a  variation  would  therefore  have  to  be  submitted  to  introduce  the  WHO/EU recommended strain, prepared from the influenza virus causing the pandemic, prior to use of Pumarix in a pandemic. Pumarix is not indicated for prophylactic use during the prepandemic period. Using immune parameters to predict protection Medicinal product no longer authorised

Influenza virus infection elicits host production of antibody against several viral components but the major  antigens  are  the  haemagglutinin  and  neuraminidase  molecules.  Antibody  to  haemagglutinin

(anti-HA) is thought to play a major role in immunity and is effective in neutralising virus infectivity. The role of anti-neuraminidase antibody in protection is less clear and this is rarely measured except for  specific  experimental  reasons.  Serum  neutralising  antibody  is  functional  but  is  not  routinely measured because these assays are labour intensive and require use of cell cultures.

There are data to indicate that HI titres of at least 1:40 and SNA titres of at least 1:8 may correlate with  protection  against  seasonal  influenza  in  young  healthy  people.  HI  titres  of  1:10  -  1:20  are associated with lesser degrees of protection. Some authors propose that HA titres of 1:65 and SNA titres of 1:80 are required for good protection, especially in the elderly. The data seem to go back to Meikeljohn et al . (1952), Hobson et al . (1972) and Potter and Oxford (1979). In particular the latter study suggested that HI titres of about 1:30-1:40 correlated with about 50% protection (at least in healthy  adults)  against  challenge  with  the  then  current  seasonal  strain.  Overall,  the  basis  for  these cut-offs for predicting protection against seasonal influenza cannot be considered to be definitive and may not be applicable in a pandemic situation.

The  clinical  studies  presented  in  the  application  have  assessed  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of Pumarix ('Q-Pan H5N1', manufactured in Saint-Foy, Quebec, Canada) in adults. One of these studies directly compared  Pumarix  with  Pandemic  influenza vaccine (H5N1)  (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals ('D-Pan H5N1', manufactured in Dresden, Germany).

The reference virus for Pumarix used in the clinical development programme is A/Indonesia/05/2005/PR8-IBCDC-RG2  (H5N1),  which  was  developed  by  the  US  Centre  for  Disease Control (CDC) using reverse genetics. The reassortment strain combines the H5 and N1 segments to the  PR8  strain  backbone.    In  addition  the  H5  was  engineered  to  eliminate  the  polybasic  stretch  of amino-acids at the HA cleavage site that is responsible for high virulence of the original strains. The virus is propagated in fertilised hens eggs. The vaccine consists of a suspension vial with the H5N1 antigen and an oil-in-water emulsion vial with the AS03 adjuvant, which are mixed extemporaneously. Thiomersal, at a final concentration of 10  g/ml (5  g per dose) in the adjuvanted vaccine, is added because of the multi-dose presentation.

Critical steps and one intermediate (the inactivated whole virion monovalent bulk) have been identified and  are  sufficiently  controlled.  Proposed  hold  periods  are  specified  and  validated.  Specifications  for inactivated whole virion monovalent bulk intermediate are acceptable.  Nine data sets from the 2006, 2007 and 2008 A/Indonesia/5/2005 drug substance production campaigns were used to illustrate the robustness and consistency of the Quebec H5N1 drug substance manufacturing process.  The results provided  demonstrate  the  consistency  of  the  Quebec  H5N1  drug  substance  production  process, irrespective of the upstream facility used and egg-processing scale.

Ph. Eur. = European pharmacopoeia; Mn = monograph 2.2.2. Active Substance Manufacture The  manufacturing  process  for  the  monovalent  bulks  is  developed  from  the  applicant's  experience gained  in  production  of  its  seasonal  vaccines  Flulaval  and  Fluviral,  which  are  licensed  in  USA  and Canada but not in the EU.  The manufacturing process for the monobulks is different to the process reviewed  and  approved  for  the  Pandemrix/Prepandrix  licences  (the  prepandemic  and  pandemic adjuvanted vaccines produced at the applicant's German site in Dresden).  The manufacturing process can be divided into five main parts:  Propagation  of  the  working  seed  in  fertilised  hen's  eggs,  harvesting  and  pooling  of  infected allantoic fluids  Inactivation of the monovalent split virus using UV and formaldehyde/thiomersal  Concentration and purification of the whole virus bulk  Splitting of the monovalent with sodium deoxycholate  Homogenisation and sterile filtration The production process for monovalent bulks is adequately described.

## Product Specification

Specifications for excipients and analytical procedures are in line with USP and/or NF.  The applicant has assessed the differences between the USP and PhEur requirements for specifications and methods relevant  to  the  excipients  used  in  Pumarix  and  presented  an  acceptable  strategy  for  testing  in  the future.

Controls of final bulks (sterility, HA, total protein, residual ovalbumin, thiomersal, residual formaldehyde and residual sucrose) and final containers (sterility, bacterial endotoxins, pH, thiomersal, appearance, osmolality and HA) of the antigen vial are acceptable (in line with PhEur).  Methods are either in line with PhEur or are validated

## Stability of the AS03 adjuvant

Compliance with the product specifications has been shown on a number of batches representatives of the final formulation and commercial scale manufacture.  There are no final products process-related or degradation impurities. Container Closure system Adequate  data  are  provided  to  affirm  the  quality  of  the  container  closure  system.    HA  content, appearance,  sterility,  thiomersal  content  and  pH  are  measured  as  stability-indicating  parameters  as part of the stability studies.  Stability test methods and specifications are identical to those at release. 18 months stability data are provided for lots AFLPA109A-112A and demonstrate that specifications are met.  An 18 month shelf-life for final containers based on the real time data submitted is acceptable. Drug Product (AS03 adjuvant vial) AS03  is  an  oil-in-water  emulsion  in  3mL  multi-dose  (10  dose)  glass  vials.    Squalene  and  DLα -tocopherol) form the oily phase (10%v/v) and phosphate buffered saline the aqueous phase (90%v/v). Polysorbate 80 is used as a surfactant to stabilise the oil/water interface. Pharmaceutical Development Developmental changes implemented since the first clinical studies have been stated and non-clinical and clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable. Manufacture of the AS03 adjuvant vial Formulation of the AS03 adjuvant consists of the preparation of the bulk followed by filling into glass vials.    Process  parameters  are  identified.    No  routine  in-process  tests  are  conducted.    Bioburden  is adequately controlled throughout the manufacturing process. Specifications of the AS03 adjuvant With  the  exception  of  squalene,  all  excipients  are  described  and  controlled  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur. Adequate quality control of squalene is performed by the supplier and by GSK (according to an internal GSK monograph which is in line with the Ph.Eur. monograph for squalane). Emulsion bulk and AS03 final containers are tested at release for Description, Identity and Content of adjuvant components (polysorbate 80, DLα -tocopherol and squalene), pH, Endotoxin content, Sterility, Particle size, Polydispersity index and Volume (final containers only). Tests  for  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins  are  performed  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  tests  for polysorbate  80,  DLα -tocopherol  and  squalene  are  validated.    The  method  used  for  particle  size analysis and associated system suitability measurements is acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Data provided from the stability studies for the bulk emulsion support the proposed shelf life of 2 years. For final AS03 container lots a shelf-life of 36 months has been approved.

## Drug Product (mixed H5N1 and AS03 vial)

At the time of vaccine administration the content of the adjuvant vial is withdrawn from the vial with a syringe and is injected into the antigen vial and shaken.

Data from 'withdrawable' volume studies conducted to support the required overfill for both antigen and  adjuvant  vials  have  been  provided.  Results  from  uniformity  of  dose  studies  demonstrate  that content  of  HA,  squalene,  Polysorbate  80  and  tocopherol  for  each  dose  of  the  10-dose  vial  remains equivalent.

Preclinical development of Pumarix was generally in agreement with current guidelines. The antigen is produced in hen's eggs using the same process as that is applied to the applicant's own FluLaval brand of seasonal influenza vaccine approved outside the EU.

SDS PAGE and Western blot analysis performed show that HA profiles of the adjuvanted formulation are comparable to the non-adjuvanted formulation and remain unchanged after a period of 24 hours at 25°C.  Compatibility between the antigen and adjuvant after 24h at 25°C has been demonstrated by evaluation of appropriate key quality criteria.  Preservative efficacy of thiomersal concentration after mixing the content of the antigen container with AS03 adjuvant has been shown in line with Ph.Eur. 5.1.3.    The  applicant  has  shown  that  there  is  limited  (less  than  10%)  physico-chemical  interaction between the Quebec split virion antigen and the adjuvant system and thus, there seems to be no need for controlling antigen/adjuvant interaction for this product as a release test (same as Prepandrix/Pandemrix).  There is sufficient evidence that there is little/no effect of the reconstitution conditions on the essential characteristics of the antigen/adjuvant combination. Current  in-use  experience  with  AS03-adjuvanted  H1N1v  vaccine  has  demonstrated  that  the  antigen suspension is prone to significant aggregation which is not dispersed on addition of the adjuvant.  Data available  for  Pumarix  H5N1  (visual  and  by  nephelometry),  show  that  aggregation  appears  lower  for H5N1 strain when compared against H1N1v strain.  The nephelometry method has been validated and is proposed to be used as an IPC and also in stability studies, the specification is not as yet set until further experience is gained, this is acceptable. It is acceptable that a number of studies regarding aggregation will be addressed by the applicant as post-authorisation commitments (see section 2.7). In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 3 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact  on  the  Risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within and agreed timeframe. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1.

A  safety  pharmacology  study  was  conducted  in  rats  with  intravenous  dosing  of  Quebec-derived  AWisconsin virus at 60 μ g haemagglutinin /ml adjuvanted with AS03.

Two single dose and two repeat dose general toxicity studies have been reported and a further two repeated dose toxicity studies in rabbits are ongoing.

The applicant also presented results from immunogenicity studies in mice and of homologous and heterologous influenza challenge studies in ferrets, each using H5N1 vaccine, manufactured in eggs at the Quebec site. ('Q-Pan')

Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) The safety studies included in the dossier were all compliant with GLP. 2.3.2. Pharmacology Two aspects of the pharmacology profile of the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 Quebec influenza vaccine have been studied: (a) immunogenicity and protection studies in animals, and (b) the mode of action of the AS03 adjuvant system. · The ability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response in animals.  Immunogenicity studies in naïve mice and immunogenicity and efficacy studies in a naïve ferret model were conducted to demonstrate the immunogenicity as well as the efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine against mortality and morbidity induced by challenge with viral strains homologous and heterologous to the vaccine strain. · The mode of action of the AS03 adjuvant system.  In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to explore the mechanism by which AS03 combined with split antigen promotes a robust and persistent humoral and cellular response. In addition to these studies, a safety pharmacology experiment in rats was conducted to assess the vaccine effect on cardiovascular and respiratory systems The mechanism of action of the adjuvant has already been assessed and discussed during the MAA procedure for the D-pan vaccine (Pandemrix). Overall the data indicate that AS03 does not simply act as a 'delivery system' for the influenza split antigen but rather works as a stimulant of the adaptive immune response, especially the cellular component. AS03 appears to induce a stronger as well as a broader immunity. This is particularly important for inducing protection of a naïve population against a virus that is prone to antigenic drift, such as pandemic influenza. Primary pharmacodynamic studies Two immunogenicity studies were conducted in mice using H5N1 vaccine manufactured at the Quebec facility, adjuvanted with AS03.  One used vaccine antigens from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and the second used vaccine antigens from A/Indonesia/5/2005.  Immunogenicity was greater in the presence of the adjuvant  by  both  measures  used  (quantification  of  antigen-specific  IgG  in  sera,  haemagglutination inhibition  tires)  and  a  dose-response  relationship  was  shown  between  antigen  dose  and  serum  IgG concentrations; however, there was no evidence of a dose-relationship using the functional antibody measure. Vaccine efficacy studies  were conducted in ferrets exposed to lethal challenge doses of homologous virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005), or heterologous virus (vaccine prepared from A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 and the challenge virus was A/Hong Kong/156/97 H5N1) and a final experiment where the vaccine was based on H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/04 and the challenge virus was A/Indonesia/05/2005 (10 5  TCID).  All studies  indicated  that  adjuvanted  vaccine  conferred  protection  from  lethal  challenge  with  influenza virus, whereas without adjuvant, or with a half-dose of adjuvant, vaccine efficacy was compromised. Viral  shedding,  lung  viral  load  measures  and  serology  results  were  generally  internally  consistent. Cross-reactivity was indicated. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

## Safety pharmacology programme

A  safety  pharmacology  study  (0016/072148)  was  performed  in  8  nine-week-old  male  Wistar  rats. Under surgical anaesthesia, the rats underwent cannulation of the femoral artery, jugular vein, and trachea,  and  insertion  of  subcutaneous  ECG  electrodes.  Under  continuous  anaesthesia  by  infusion pump, rats were treated by intravenous bolus with 1ml/kg of saline placebo (n = 4) or Quebec-sourced A/Wisconsin/67/05  influenza  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  AS03  (n  =  4).  The  final  concentration  of  the influenza antigen was 30µg/ml and the AS03 concentration represented the full human dose. Over 120 minutes after infusion there was a tendency for minute volume to increase in all animals, and a single animal in the actively treated group showed a transient inverted P wave on ECG. Both occurrences are non-specific and often observed in such experiments; and there was no evidence of any treatmentspecific changes in cardiorespiratory performance.

The CHMP highlighted that while safety pharmacology studies should be performed in a relevant animal model, the clinical relevance of the rat for an influenza vaccine can be questioned. In addition, The 2h post-dose  observation  time  only  covers  the  very  acute  effects  of  vaccination.  The  current  clinical experience with AS03 adjuvanted vaccines do not indicate that vital physiological/ organ systems are affected  by  the  adjuvant.  In  addition  an  antigen  specific  effect  on  such  systems  is  also  not  to  be expected. Therefore the limited safety pharmacology testing (without the use of the actual antigen) is accepted. The CHMP pointed out that dose extrapolation on ml/kg base for adjuvants from animals to humans is complicated. However the full human dose was considered sufficient for a safety pharmacology study. Overall, no concerns for human use were raised. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No studies were performed. Since this is an MAA for a vaccine, this was considered acceptable. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Experimental studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active ingredients in Pumarix have not been performed. This is in line with the relevant guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03 2.3.4. Toxicology The toxicity profile of the AS03-adjuvanted Quebec influenza vaccine has been evaluated in single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies in New Zealand White rabbits. Reproductive toxicity testing was described in rats. Single dose toxicity Two single-dose toxicity studies have been conducted on AS03-adjuvanted vaccines. The first of these used A/H3N2 antigens (A/Wisconsin/67/2005), prepared using the same manufacturing process as the one used for H5N1 antigen. The second used the Quebec-sourced H5N1 (A/Indonesia/5/2005) antigen at a 30µg dose. For both of these studies, local tolerance data were also collected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

| NZW rabbit (3/sex/group) | Q-H3N2 + AS03                | Saline, AS03, 15µgHA + AS03 | no deaths or clinical signs                     | 1536-06196       |
| NZW rabbit (3/sex/group) | Q-H5N1 (30µg) + AS03         | Saline, 30 µg + AS03,       | HA no unscheduled deaths or associated toxicity | 2990/355         |

Minor inflammation at the injection site was noted in all groups, which is indicative of the injection method. The adjuvanted vaccines were associated with fasciitis, cellulitis, and in males, granulomatous myositis.  However,  there  was  no  difference  in  severity  between  the  adjuvanted  seasonal  and  H5N1 antigens, suggesting that this is associated with the adjuvant and not with the antigen. Repeat dose toxicity Four repeat-dose toxicity studies have been conducted on AS03-adjuvanted vaccines, all using New Zealand White rabbits.  The first study (1990/956 ) used repeated doses of A/H5N1 antigens produced in Dresden (using the Fluarix process). This study has been assessed during the MAA of Pandemrix/ Prepandrix, and the findings in this study in animals receiving AS03 (with or without antigen) (increases in fibrinogen, WBC (neutrophils), spleen weight,  large  iliac  lymph  nodes,  lymphoid  hyperplasia)  are  indicative  of  an  acute  and  transient inflammatory response. No delayed systemic effects due to the test vaccine could be observed. The  second  study  (1536-06194)  used  Quebec  and  Dresden-sourced  A/H3N2  split  influenza  viruses (produced using the FluLaval or Fluarix processes) as a surrogate for the A/H5N1 split influenza virus. It  should be noted that the Quebec H3N2 antigen is produced according to the same manufacturing process  as  the  Quebec  H5N1  antigen  and  therefore  it  contains  the  same  levels  of  impurities  and residuals as the H5N1 antigen. This second repeat-dose study was specifically designed to mimic two separate  immunization  series  repeated  at  a  prolonged  interval,  as  might  occur  in  a  prime-booster strategy or with annual vaccination. The study confirmed the absence of overt toxicity by the Q-sourced product, in comparison with the Dsourced product, however with a strain belonging to the 'normal' seasonal vaccines and showed no specific findings. For  the  third  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (2990/356)  10  male  and  10  female  rabbits  were  dosed intramuscularly with saline or Quebec H5N1 antigen (30 μ g HA) + AS03 on days 1, 15 and 29. Five were killed on days 32 (three days after the third injection) and five on day 57 (28 days after the third injection). For  the  fourth  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (8550)    20  male  and  20  female  rabbits  were  dosed intramuscularly with saline or Quebec H5N1 antigen (3.8 μ g HA) + AS03 on days 0, 14 and 28.  They were killed on day 31 (3 days after the third inoculation) or 57 (29 days after the third inoculation). These studies found local toxicity and immune system changes in response to vaccination which were expected,  reversible  and  consistent  with  previous  findings  from  similar  studies  carried  out  with adjuvanted influenza vaccines. The studies submitted for the MAA of Pumarix used the full human dose given intramuscularly to rabbits in a manner sufficient to support the intended clinical dosing. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity of the adjuvant alone was assessed in two in vitro tests (reverse mutation (Ames) test in bacteria;  gene  mutation  in  mouse  cells)  and  one in  vivo test  (micronucleus  test  in  the  rat  after intravenous administration). The vaccine was not tested. No indication of genotoxicity was evident.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies were performed according to the Note for Guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95 guidance) and the Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (EMEA/CHMP/ VEG/134716/2004).

## Reproduction Toxicity

For a reproductive toxicity study (1536-08129) with AS03-adjuvanted Quebec-derived H5N1 vaccine female rats were dosed with one of the following: 1. Phosphate buffered saline (control group); 2. AS03 adjuvant prior to mating; AS03 diluted 1:1 with PBS during gestation and lactation 3. PBS prior to mating; Quebec H5N1 vaccine + AS03 adjuvant during gestation and lactation and 4. Quebec H5N1 vaccine + AS03 adjuvant. Dosing was as two intramuscular injections into the rear limbs 28 days prior to cohabitation with untreated male rats, on gestation days (GD) 7, 9, 12 and 16 and on postnatal day 7.  After confirmation of mating, female rats were divided into two equal cohorts, one of which would be allowed to bear their litters, the other of which would undergo caesarean section on GD 21. Overall the data indicated that neither the AS03 adjuvant alone or AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine had any adverse effect on female rats or their offspring. To address further the use of the vaccine in the first trimester of pregnancy and to supply direct proof of lack of effects claimed in early pregnancy (i.e in rats, on gestation days 1-6), the applicant provided data from a similar study using D-Pan H1N1-AS03 adjuvanted vaccine and AS03 adjuvant.  This study was assessed previously for Pandemrix. For  this  study  (HEY0001),  rats  were  injected  intramuscularly  with  saline,  H1N1v/AS03A  or  AS03A adjuvant on day 0 to 6 after mating.  Adult females were examined macroscopically at necropsy on Day 14 after mating and their uterine contents examined. That assessment concluded that no evidence of a concern for use of the vaccine early in pregnancy. Local Tolerance Local tolerance was assessed in the single dose studies in rabbits (1536-06196 and 2990/355), see above. Local tolerance assessment of AS03 alone and Quebec-manufactured H3N2 antigen at a dose containing 15µg of HA (i.e., approximately 20-fold higher than the intended human dose on a body weight basis) combined with a full human dose of AS03 did not show any adverse clinical observation in rabbits (Bridge GPS Study Number 1536-06196). Dermal responses did not differ between controls and experimental groups.  There were no adverse observations noted at necropsy.  Minimal or mild subacute inflammation of the subcutaneous and/or epimysial tissue was noted in animals receiving the adjuvant, with or without influenza antigen.  There were no microscopic findings specifically associated with the presence of influenza antigen in the test article.  In general, a single intramuscular injection of influenza vaccine containing 15µg of HA and a full human dose of AS03 were well tolerated by New Zealand White rabbits. Medicinal product no longer authorised

These results were confirmed in a second study where local tolerance was assessed using AS03 adjuvanted Quebec H5N1 antigen.  In this study (Covance Study Number 2990/355), rabbits received one single IM administration of either of three candidate vaccines - two manufactured with Quebecsourced seasonal antigens (60µg HA/dose) adjuvanted or not with AS03 (human half-dose) and one manufactured with the Quebec H5N1 antigen (30µg HA/dose) adjuvanted with AS03 (human dose) œ or saline control. Minor inflammation was observed in all vaccine and control groups, which is indicative of an effect of the dose method as opposed to any of the vaccine components.  The adjuvanted vaccines were associated with fasciitis, cellulitis, and in males, granulomatous myositis. There was no clear difference in severity of these conditions between the two adjuvanted vaccines, indicating that this was an effect of the adjuvant and not the vaccine antigen.

## Other toxicity studies

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk assessment was included in the application. According to the guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 'Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' vaccines due to the nature of their constituents are exempted from the requirement to provide an environmental risk assessment in the application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product for human use.

Vaccine efficacy studies  were conducted in ferrets exposed to lethal challenge doses of homologous virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005), or heterologous virus (vaccine prepared from A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 and the challenge virus was A/Hong Kong/156/97 H5N1) and a final experiment where the vaccine was based on H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/04 and the challenge virus was A/Indonesia/05/2005 (10 5  TCID).  All studies  indicated  that  ASO3-adjuvanted  vaccine  conferred  protection  from  lethal  challenge  with influenza  virus,  whereas  without  adjuvant,  or  with  a  half-dose  of  adjuvant,  vaccine  efficacy  was compromised. Viral shedding, lung viral load measures and serology results were generally internally consistent, although in one experiment there was a lack of concordance between the test facility and the applicant's laboratory results for seroconversion. Cross-reactivity was indicated.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Single and repeated dose toxicity studies did not reveal any unexpected findings. The local adverse effects are well-known to be associated with the AS03 adjuvant, and the benefit-risk should be weighed in the clinical studies. The reproduction toxicity studies conducted with a Q-sourced H5N1 vaccine in combination with the AS03 adjuvant  given  at  day  6  and  later,  did  not  give  rise  to  any  concern.  A  study  that  addressed vaccination in early pregnancy, that is, prior and up to implantation of the embryo raised no concerns. The Flulaval data from another study indicate that an unadjuvanted Q-sourced vaccine is also without effect on reproductive endpoints. As a whole the data presented were considered sufficient to support a marketing authorisation for Pumarix. 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The applicant discussed the mode of action of AS03 adjuvant and its use in prophylactic vaccines.  The applicant also presented results of immunogenicity  studies in  mice  and  of  homologous  and heterologous influenza challenge studies in ferrets, each using H5N1 vaccine, manufactured in eggs at the Quebec site. The use of adjuvant is important as it is intended to allow a lower dose of antigen which will allow more subjects to be vaccinated for a given amount of antigen.  The mode of action of AS03 is likely to be  through  an  effect  to  augment  the  function  of  antigen  presenting  cells  with  release  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  that  cause  effects  detected  in  animals  in  toxicity  studies.    Such  effects  are inherent in the mechanisms of action of AS03 adjuvant.  The applicant provided numerous publications relating  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  adjuvants  and  their  impact  on  immune  system  function, including  that  of  antigen  presenting  cells.  Use  of  AS03  adjuvant  to  augment  immunogenicity  is considered adequately justified. Two immunogenicity studies were conducted in mice using H5N1 vaccine manufactured at the Quebec facility, adjuvanted with AS03.  One used vaccine antigens from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and the second used vaccine antigens from A/Indonesia/5/2005.  Immunogenicity was greater in the presence of the adjuvant  by  both  measures  used  (quantification  of  antigen-specific  IgG  in  sera,  haemagglutination inhibition  tires)  and  a  dose-response  relationship  was  shown  between  antigen  dose  and  serum  IgG concentrations; however, there was no evidence of a dose-relationship using the functional antibody measure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No concerns for  human use was suggested by a safety pharmacology study in rats conducted with intravenous dosing of Quebec-derived A-Wisconsin virus at 30 μ g haemagglutinin /ml adjuvanted with AS03.

Two single dose and four repeat dose general toxicity studies have been reported.  Apart from proinflammatory changes at the injection site that are related to the primary mode of action of the AS03 adjuvant, there was no toxicity of note.  These studies used the full human dose given intramuscularly in a manner sufficient to support the intended clinical dosing.

Reproductive toxicity testing was described in rats.  Testing suggested that the Quebec-manufactured vaccines tested did not adversely affect female fertility or pregnancy and no effect was indicated in the F1  generation.    A  study  with  H5N1  vaccine  did  not  identify  toxicity  associated  with  vaccination  in pregnancy animals when dosed from day 6 or pregnancy. A study that addressed vaccination in early pregnancy, that is, prior and up to implantation of the embryo raised no concerns. Genotoxicity of the adjuvant was tested and indicated no positive findings. The applicant provided results of a reproductive toxicity study with H5N1-AS03 adjuvanted vaccine in which there was proof of H5N1-antibody exposure; no toxicity was identified. Overall,  the  preclinical  studies  did  not  raise  any  concerns  in  terms  of  toxicity,  and  the  mainly  local reactions observed were expected and reversible. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction This application dossier of Pumarix (i.e. Q-Pan H5N1)was based primarily on clinical studies that evaluated the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  AS03-adjuvanted  vaccines  containing  Quebec  sourced  antigens  from A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  and  some  data  from  a  version  containing  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  (H5N1), manufactured in Dresden, Germany (i.e. D-Pan H5N1). The applicant also reported data from a study that directly compared  AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing antigen from the H5N1  pandemic  strain manufactured in Quebec (Q-Pan H5N1, Pumarix) or Dresden (D-Pan H5N1'). Further  clinical  data  on  the  approved  formulation  of  Pumarix  are  expected  in  accordance  with  agreed timelines as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  Tabular overview of clinical studies carried out outside the community: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Assays As in all the previously reported studies with D-Pan and H5N1, sera were forwarded to GSK. Assays for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and serum neutralising antibody (SNA) were performed as previously described. In brief, these assays were as follows: HI - The standardised and validated micromethod uses four HI units of the appropriate antigen and a 0.5% horse erythrocyte  suspension.  Horse  erythrocytes  contain  a  high  proportion  of α 2,  3  linkages thus  making  them  more sensitive for  the  detection  of  antibody  to  avian  HA  in  the  HI  assay.  All  HI assays were performed in duplicate in the same run along with control sera and each run was judged against  acceptance  criteria.  The  validation  results  of  the  assay  based  on  the  Indonesia  strain  have been provided. SNA The previously described microneutralisation assay was used. A cell suspension, containing a defined  amount  of  Madin-Darby  Canine  Kidney  (MDCK)  cells  is  then  added  to  the  pre-incubated mixture of virus and heat-inactivated serum and incubated at 37°C. Virus replication is determined by testing the supernatant of each well in a haemagglutination assay using chicken erythrocytes. All SN assays are run in triplicate in the same run. The assay variability is controlled by the use of control sera  included  in  each  run  and  each  run  is  judged  against  acceptance  criteria.  The  assay  cut-off  is defined as 1:28, which results from pre-dilution of the sera and is the first computable ND50 value. The specificity of the neutralisation assay has been estimated by testing a set of samples from naïve (i.e.  previously  unvaccinated)  children  (6  to  9  years)  collected  before  vaccination  with  the  seasonal vaccine.  Out  of  46  subjects,  one  was  slightly  positive.  These  data  are  described  in  the  Validation Report. Based on this result, the specificity of the SNA can be estimated to be 98%. 2.5.1. Main studies Q-PAN H5N1-001 This was a randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre, active-controlled study conducted at 10 sites (7 in the US and 3 in Canada). The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate the adjuvant activity  of  AS03  by  comparing  immune  responses  to  Q-Pan  H5N1  3.8  µg  HA/AS03  at  full  and  half strengths versus Q-Pan HA 3.8 µg alone. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the Day 42 HI antibody response to homologous virus in subjects receiving two doses of vaccine Superiority of the adjuvanted formulation was declared if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) on the GMT ratio exceeded 2.0 and the lower bound of the 95% CI on the difference in SCR exceeded 15%.

The following formulations were used in the different groups: Group A ('Q000ASO3') -  Quebec manufactured 3,8 µg HA (A/Indonesia/5/05), no Adjuvant Group B ('Q100AS03')  -  Quebec manufactured 3,8 µg HA, full dose Adjuvant Group C ('Q50AS03')    -  Quebec manufactured 3,8 µg HA, half dose Adjuvant Group D ('D100AS03') -  Dresden manufactured 3,8 µg HA, full dose Adjuvant Group E (\"D50AS03\")    -  Dresden manufactured 3,8 µg HA, half dose Adjuvant Four blood samples were to be drawn at D0, D21, D42 and D182. Subject populations were defined as in previous studies with H5N1 vaccine (i.e. total vaccinated {VC}, according to protocol {ATP} for safety and ATP for immunogenicity). The  sample  size  was  based  on  the  evaluation  of  superiority  of  Q-Pan  plus  adjuvant  versus  Q-Pan without adjuvant using the SCR and GMT at Day 42, both of which required a statistically significant result.  Each  test  was  to  have α =0.05 (two-sided)  at  a  power  of  95%,  yielding  an  overall  power  of approximately 90% for the simultaneous tests. Based on the FDA draft guidance on pandemic vaccines of March 2006 a 0.3 log10 mean difference (= a 2-fold difference in GMT ratio) for the HI antibody titres and a 15% difference in SCR were to be regarded as meaningful. It was planned that if the first step of the analysis based on Day 42 data indicated that: a) GMTs fulfilled the ≥ 2-fold criterion for adjuvant effect and b) Treatment Groups B and C both demonstrated a Day 42 point estimate for the rate of vaccine homologous HI reciprocal titres ≥ 40 of at least 76% Then two additional groups were to be recruited as follows: · Group H: Quebec-manufactured A/Indonesia/5/05 H5N1 antigen containing 1.9 µg of HA with full strength ASO3 on Days 0 and 21 (N ≈ 50) · Group  I:  Quebec-manufactured  A/Indonesia/5/05  H5N1  antigen  containing  1.9  µg  of  HA  with half strength AS03 on Days 0 and 21 (N ≈ 50). These  additional  groups  were  recruited  but  the  results  were  not  provided  in  the  initial  application dossier. Study Population Subject populations were defined as in previous studies with H5N1 vaccine (i.e. total vaccinated {VC} and according to protocol {ATP} cohort for safety and ATP for immunogenicity). Of 680 vaccinated subjects (68 at each of the 10 study sites) numbers by group were as follows: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 680 (100%) enrolled subjects received a study vaccine. The ATP safety (ATP-S) cohort consisted of 672  (99%)  of  the  680  subjects.  The  ATP  immunogenicity  (ATP-I)  cohort  consisted  of  648  (95%) subjects.

The demographic information for the total vaccinated cohort was similar to that of the ATP-I cohort. The mean age of study subjects was 38.6 years, with a minimum age of 18 years and a maximum age of 64 years. A total of 371 (54.6%) subjects were between the ages of 18 and 40, and the remaining 309 (45.4%) subjects were between the ages of 41 and 65. A total of 393 (57.8%) subjects were female and 287 (42.2%) subjects were male. The majority (86.8%) of subjects were Caucasian; of the remaining  subjects,  5.6%  were  African  American,  4%  were  unspecified  race,  1.3%  were  Southeast Asian, and all other races were less than 1%.

HI Results up  to D42 for the initial 5 treatment groups Quebec- versus Dresden-manufactured vaccine o Group B (Q100AS03) and Group C (Q50AS03) were pooled to form the Quebec group o Group D (D100AS03) and Group E (D50AS03) were pooled to form the Dresden group. GMTs for each group were adjusted for age and baseline HI antibody titre and then a ratio of the group GMTs was calculated.  For  the  groups  to  be  considered  equivalent  the  limits  of  the  95%  confidence interval  on  the  ratio  were  to  be  between  0.67  and  1.5.  This  criterion  was  met  for  both  the A/Indonesia/5/05 antibody (ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.75-1.17) and the A/Vietnam/1194/04 antibody (ratio 1.16; 95% CI 0.92-1.46) as shown below. Adjuvant activity The differences between Group B (full adjuvant; Q100AS03) and Group A (no adjuvant; Q000AS03) in HI SCRs to A/Indonesia/5/05 and A/Vietnam/1194/04 met the pre-defined criteria for superiority of adjuvanted vaccine.

Comparison of Quebec antigen with full or half strength AS03 showed numerically higher SCRs and GMTs with full strength adjuvant. The differences were not large enough to indicate superiority of full over half strength adjuvant. The results for homologous virus are shown below.

When examined by age (18 - 40 and 41 - 64 years) the criteria for adjuvant effect were fulfilled in both strata but the homologous virus SCR dropped 4% in the younger age group and 12% in the older group  when  the  adjuvant  strength  was  halved.  Similarly,  the  GMT  was  only  slightly  affected  in  the younger age group but there was a 2-fold reduction in GMT in the older age group. HI data up to D182 The lower bound of the 95% CI for SCRs exceeded 85% at Day 42, but not at D21, in the four groups that received adjuvanted Quebec or Dresden antigen compared to 9.6% in Group A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due  to  the  low  numbers  who  were  seropositive  with  respect  to  A/Indonesia  before  vaccination  the SPRs followed the SCRs. The difference in GMTs between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines at Day 42 was very large (being 321-480 in the adjuvanted groups and 11 in the non-adjuvanted group. A similar pattern was observed for GMTs for HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/04 although the actual GMTs were much lower for the clade 1 Vietnam strain.

The  GMFRs  increased  markedly  after  the  second  vaccine  dose  in  the  adjuvanted  antigen  groups  to reach 93-95 with full strength adjuvant and 64-69 for half-strength adjuvant at D42 compared to only 2.1 in the unadjuvanted antigen group.

- Group  I:  Quebec-manufactured  A/Indonesia/5/05  H5N1  antigen  containing  1.9  µg  of  HA  with half strength AS03 (=AS03B) on Days 0 and 21 (N = 50).

HI data at D182: Only the groups that had received full-strength adjuvanted vaccine maintained SCRs (based on HI to homologous virus) with lower 95% CI that were ≥ 40%. However, there was little difference between D182 SCRs in groups that received full or half-dose adjuvant and these groups had SCRs that were markedly superior to that in the unadjuvanted group. SCRs based on HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/04 were notably lower and were from 0% - 11% and 9% at Day 182. SPRs were nearly identical to the SCRs. SPRs for HI to A/Vietnam/1194/04 ranged from 1-13%. The  GMFRs  were  all  between  4.5  and  5.6  for  the  adjuvanted  groups  compared  to  1.1  in  the  nonadjuvanted  antigen  group.  The  difference  in  GMFR  between  adjuvanted  and  unadjuvanted  vaccine groups at Day 182 was similar to that observed at Day 21. NA data up to D182 in a subset Up to 40% of tested subjects per group were seropositive for NA to the vaccine strain before the first dose and up to 80% were seropositive for NA against A/Vietnam/1194/04. D42  GMTs  were  highest  in  and  similar  between  D-Pan  (1497)  and  Q-Pan  (1567)  groups  with  full strength  AS03.  GMTs  were  1242  and  1353  in  the  half  strength  AS03  groups  and  only  184  in  the unadjuvanted  group.  There  was  less  difference  in  GMTs  between  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  at D182 (between 414 and 456). At  baseline  12.8%  to  23.4%  per  group  had  titres ≥ 1:80  for  the  homologous  virus.  Among  195 subjects across the four adjuvanted vaccine groups all but two were seropositive at Day 21 and all were seropositive at Day 42 and at D182. At D42 all 195 subjects had titres ≥ 1:80 and there was little decline in this proportion by Day 182. After  two  doses  of  vaccine  all  who  were  seronegative  with  respect  to  A/Vietnam  at  baseline demonstrated a response in the adjuvanted treatment groups. At Day 182 the two groups that had received full strength AS03 vaccines retained the highest response rates relative to baseline. At Day 182 the proportions with titres ≥ 1:80 were still 16 to 20 percentage points higher in the adjuvanted groups. NA against the drifted clade 2 strains A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (a clade 2.2 virus) and A/Anhui/1/05 (a clade  2.3  virus)  was  measured  in  sera  obtained  from  recipients  of  Q-Pan  vaccine  containing  full strength AS03. No subject was seropositive to A/Anhui/1/05 at baseline. At D42, 80.3% had NA titres against  A/Anhui  of ≥ 40  and  60.6%  had  titres ≥ 80.  However,  by  D182  only  23.6%  were  still seropositive. In contrast, the baseline seropositivity rate was 35.7% for NA to A/turkey/Turkey/1/05, at which time approximately 25% had titres ≥ 40. At D42 all subjects were seropositive and 98.6% had titres ≥ 80. In addition, NA persisted such that at D182 60.7% still maintained a response. Results up to D182 for the contingent arms It was planned that if Day 42 data indicated that: a) GMTs fulfilled the ≥ 2-fold criterion for adjuvant effect and b) Groups B and C had D42 rates of vaccine homologous HI titres ≥ 40 of at least 76% Then two additional groups were to be recruited as follows: · Group H: Quebec-manufactured A/Indonesia/5/05 H5N1 antigen containing 1.9 µg of HA with full strength ASO3 (=AS03A) on Days 0 and 21 (N = 50) Medicinal product no longer authorised

HI  seropositivity  rates  at  D0  were  0%  -  6%  in  these  additional  100  subjects  (about  half  per  age stratum).  At  D42,  GMTs  were  nearly  two-fold  higher  in  the  AS03 A group  and  were  higher  in  the younger age stratum. All CHMP criteria (SPR, SCR and SCF) were met at Day 42 in both adjuvanted groups and in both age strata.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research (CBER) requirement that the lower bound of the 95% CI for the SCR should meet or exceed 40% was not met by either contingent arm at D21 but was easily met in both groups at D42. Neither group still met the criterion at D182 when the actual SCRs were 49% and 47%. SCRs for HI against A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/Anhui/1/05 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 were  lower  than  for  A/Indonesia/5/05  but  D42  values  exceeded  the  CBER  requirement  in  Group  H (QR100AS03). Also, the CBER requirement was exceeded against at D42 against A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 in Group I (QR50AS03).

The  D42  SPRs  were  84.0%  and  95.9%  in  AS03B  and  AS03A  groups,  respectively.  In  the  older  age stratum  an  absolute  21%  reduction  in  SPR  was  observed  with  half  the  adjuvant  dose  (95.8%  vs. 75.0%).  There  was  a  much  smaller  difference  between  adjuvant  groups  in  the  younger  stratum (92.3% vs. 96.0%). The CBER requirement that the lower bound of the 95% CI for the SPR should meet or exceed 70% was not met at D21 but was met at D42 in both groups (only just in the half dose adjuvant group). The D42 SPRs for A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/Anhui/1/05 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 did not attain the CBER criterion. The GMTs at D42 showed a higher value in Group H although the 95% CI overlapped. There was a substantial decline in GMT for both groups by D182, with actual values comparable to those at D21. The GMT pattern observed relative to adjuvant effects was comparable between drifted strains and the vaccine-homologous virus, although actual GMTs were much lower for the drift variant virus strains. The pattern of changes in GMFRs followed the changes in GMTs as noted above. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The contingent group data at D182 were also provided for age strata 18-40 and 41-64 years and for vaccine homologous and heterologous viruses. Within each age cohort the HI seropositivity rates and GMTs were higher in the sub-groups that received full dose adjuvant. The magnitude of the effect of halving the adjuvant did not appear to be greater in the older cohort in this study using half the usual dose of antigen. At D42 and D182 the SPRs in the younger cohort showed only a modest difference according to the adjuvant dose. In the older cohort the effect was more marked at D42 but there was no difference at D182. The SCRs followed the same pattern. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The SCFs showed an effect of adjuvant dose in the younger cohort. SCFs were much lower in the older cohort and only at D42 was there any evidence of an adjuvant dose effect.

HI  antibody  responses  to  drift-variant  viruses  were  lower  overall,  but  showed  similar  patterns  as reported above for the two age cohorts. Titres were highest against the more closely (serologically) related A/turkey/Turkey and least for the clade 1 representative A/Vietnam. The pre-vaccination SNA seropositivity rates were quite high in this study despite the very low rates observed with HI data. Both treatment groups demonstrated a neutralising antibody vaccine response (as assessed by a post-vaccination reciprocal titre ≥ 56 for initially seronegative subjects or a ≥ 4-fold increase in reciprocal titre for initially seropositive subjects) at D21, with a further increase at D42. At D42 a neutralising antibody response against A/Indonesia/5/05 was detected in 92% (95% CI 80.497.7) and 98% (95% CI 89.4-99.9) of subjects per group. At D182 the response rates had declined in both treatment groups to reach 80% (95% CI 65.7-89.8) and 78% (95% CI 63.4-88.2), but remained slightly above rates at D21. The  SNA  data  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  showed  some  advantage  for  full  dose  adjuvant  in  the younger subjects but not in the older subjects. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

NA responses against drifted strains were lower. The D42 response rates for A/Vietnam/1194/04 were 35% and 16% while those for  A/Anhui/1/05  (74%  and  73%)  and  A/turkey/Turkey/1/05  (85%  and 92%) were higher. The D182 rates were 33% and 23% for A/Vietnam/1194/04, 37% and 19% for A/Anhui/1/05 but 79% and 68% for A/turkey/Turkey/1/05.

In line with the response rates the GMTs increased after each dose and were numerically higher in the full dose adjuvant group on D21, D42 and D182.

Study Q-Pan H5N1-001 set out to examine several different issues. The data supported use of AS03 in conjunction  with  3.8  µg  HA  and  a  comparable  performance  of  Q-Pan  H5N1  and  D-Pan  H5N1. Administration of two doses was shown to be necessary. Use of half strength AS03 was also acceptable but  there  were  some  advantages  for  full  strength  adjuvant  in  older  subjects  and  against  drifted variants.

The pattern observed relative to adjuvant effects and GMTs over time for NA against the drifted strains tested  was  comparable  to  that  seen  with  the  vaccine-homologous  virus  although  actual  GMTs  were generally much lower for the drift variant virus strains. Titres ≥ 1:80 were observed in 16% and 12% at D0. At D42 all subjects were seropositive and only one was seronegative at D182. At Day 21 ≥ 80% had titres ≥ 1:80 against A/Indonesia/5/05, reaching 100% at D42 and persisting at &gt; 90% at D182. Most subjects had detectable NA against A/Vietnam/1194/04 at baseline and titres ≥ 1:80 were noted in 67% and 74% per group. At Day 21 and Day 42, &gt; 90% per group had titres ≥ 1:80 and &gt; 85% maintained that level at D182. In contrast, most (&gt; 90%) subjects were seronegative at baseline for NA against A/Anhui/1/05.  By D42 69% and 53% per group had titres ≥ 1:80 against this strain and at D182 rates had dropped to 25% and 10%. Also, most (75% and 77%) were seronegative at baseline for A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 but at D42 &gt; 90% had titres ≥ 1:80 and 78% and 69% still had these titres at D182. Discussion on Q-Pan-H5N1-001 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The contingent groups provided additional information on half the HA dose administered with full or half strength AS03. Based on the HI data and the CBER criteria the data suggested that two doses of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine  containing  half  the  amount  of  antigen  plus  full  strength  AS03  or  half  strength  AS03  (i.e. Group I) might be satisfactory in healthy adults aged 18-64 years. However, the D42 data suggested (taking into account also the responses to drifted variants) that half the adult dose of HA and AS03 might  be  a  less  secure  regimen  overall,  which  paralleled  the  observation  made  when  full  and  half strength AS03 were administered with 3.8 μ g HA in this same study. The contingent group data were not shown separately at D182 for age strata 18-40 and 41-60 years but all other data have suggested that immune responses are likely to be somewhat lower in the latter group and are more sensitive to a reduction in AS03 than in the younger cohort.

When the data were shown according to age cohorts 18-40 and 41-64 years it was notable that HI responses did not show a consistent benefit for full dose adjuvant in the older cohort when AS03 was combined with half  the  approved  dose  of  antigen.  In  addition,  where  some  advantage  for  full  dose adjuvant was apparent in the older cohort the magnitude of the effect was not obviously greater than for the younger cohort. These results did not give the same picture by age sub-groups as was noted with the approved HA dose administered in conjunction with full or half dose antigen. Q-Pan H5N1-010 (booster phase of Q-Pan H5N1-001) This was the booster phase of Q-Pan-H5N1-001 in which A/turkey/Turkey vaccine was administered at  about  15  months  after  the  initial  immunisation  series.  There  were  469  subjects  enrolled, representing  69%  of  the  680  that  were  randomised  into  Q-Pan-001.  Subjects  were  randomised  to receive adjuvanted or unadjuvanted booster doses in a ratio of 3:2. Adjuvanted vaccine was used to boost  Groups  A  (primed  with  unadjuvanted  vaccine;  bottom  in  diagram),  B1,  C1,  D1  and  E1  (grey shaded  boxes  from  top).  Unadjuvanted  vaccine  was  administered  to  Groups  B2,  C2,  D2  and  E2 (unshaded boxes from top). Medicinal product no longer authorised

This randomised, observer-blind study assessed immune responses to a booster dose of heterologous H5N1  (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005)  given  about  15  months  after  completion  of  Q-Pan  H5N1-001  (see

above). Subjects (N=469) who agreed to participate in this follow-on study (= 69% of those enrolled in  Q-Pan  H5N1-001)  were  randomised  to  receive  adjuvanted  (full  strength)  or  unadjuvanted  HA booster doses in a ratio of 3:2. Adjuvanted vaccine was used to boost Group A subjects (primed with unadjuvanted vaccine) and a proportion of subjects from each of the other groups (denoted B1, C1, D1 and E1) while the remainder received an unadjuvanted booster (denoted B2, C2, D2 and E2).

The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  whether  the  booster  dose  was  more  immunogenic  in  subjects primed  with  two  doses  of  heterologous  H5N1  adjuvanted  with  full  dose  [A]  or  half  dose  [B]  AS03 compared  to  subjects  primed  with  unadjuvanted  antigen.  HI  responses  to  the  booster  dose  were compared against the CBER criteria for HI SCRs and SPRs at 10 days post-dose.

For  Groups  B1  +  D1  the SCR (96.0%)  showed  95%  CI  91.0-98.7%,  which  exceeded  the  CBER guidance  target  of  40%.  The  CBER  guidance  target  for  SCR  was  exceeded  for  subjects  who  were seronegative at baseline (90.4) and those who were seropositive at baseline (86) as well as in each age  stratum.  In  addition,  the SPR for  Groups  B1  +  D1  was  99.2%  (95%  CI  95.7-100%),  which exceeded the CBER guidance target of 70%. The SPR for each age stratum also exceeded the CBER guidance target.

Pre-booster (i.e. on Day 0 of study 010) 16.3% of subjects primed with unadjuvanted vaccine (Group A) were seropositive to A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 compared to 68.6% primed with AS03A (Groups B1, B2, D1 and D2) and 63.5% primed with AS03B (Groups C1, C2, E1 and E2). Seropositivity against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 H5N1 was observed for 10.2% in Group A, 55% primed with AS03A and 49% primed with AS03B. At D10 post-booster the SCR was 96% in Groups B1 + D1 and 91.5% in Group A.  The 95% CI around the  difference  did  not  meet  the  target  of  a  lower  bound ≥ 15%  so  the  response  to  an  adjuvanted booster  dose  was  not  significantly  greater  in  those  primed  with  AS03A  vs.  those  who  received  an unadjuvanted  primary  series.  The  actual  difference  in  SCR  was  larger  for  subjects  who  were seropositive at baseline (14.3% and 5.4%, respectively) but the lower bound of the 95% CI did not meet the target ≥ 15% in either case. In addition, the difference between groups did not meet the target of a lower bound of 95% CI ≥ 15% for either age stratum. For the adjusted GMT ratio for Groups B1 + D1 / Group A (824 vs. 286) the lower level of the 95% CI was just less than 2 (1.9). Thus, according to the pre-defined criterion the response to an adjuvanted booster dose after priming with HA/AS03A was not superior to that observed after unadjuvanted HA priming. The adjusted GMT ratio in Groups B1 + D1 (GMT 1206.6) to Group A (GMT 188.8) for subjects aged 18 to  40  years  was  6.39  with  a  95%  CI  of  3.53-11.58,  which  met  the  target  of  a  LL  95%  CI  &gt;  2.  In contrast, the corresponding comparison for subjects aged 41 to 64 years gave a ratio of 1.50 with 95% CI of 0.85-2.63. Therefore the overall lack of difference between groups in GMT ratio was driven by the results of the older age stratum. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Responses to the booster dose were also compared between those who were primed with AS03A or AS03B. The SCRs were high for all groups and the difference in SCR (B1 + D1 vs. C1 + E1 was -

Pumarix

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.43% (95% CI -5.92 to 5.28%) so it was concluded that there was no difference between responses to the booster according to the amount of adjuvant used for the priming doses. This conclusion also applied regardless of baseline serostatus. Furthermore the difference in SCR for subjects aged 18 to 40 years was 1.67% (95% CI -4.65 to 8.90%) while that for subjects aged 41 to 64 years was -1.69% (95% CI -11.42 to 8.96).

GMTs at  Day  10 for  subjects  in  Group  A,  Groups  C1+E1  and  Groups  B1+D1,  respectively,  were 229.6, 810.5 and 847.3 with lower values at Day 42 of 155.4, 699.5 and 652.2. For subjects primed and boosted with adjuvanted vaccines, the GMT for subjects aged 41 to 64 years was approximately half of that seen in younger subjects. For subjects who received unadjuvanted booster there was little difference between the age strata. Older subjects in Group A had GMTs that were nearly double those seen in the younger age stratum.

## Q-Pan H5N1-002

The adjusted GMT ratio (B1 + D1 vs. C1 + E1) was 1.06 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.44). The GMT ratio was 1.04 (95% CI 0.68-1.59) for subjects aged 18 to 40 years and 1.13 (95% CI 0.73-1.75) for subjects aged 41 to 65 years. In those primed without AS03 (Group A), with AS03B (Groups C1 + E1) or with AS03A (Groups B1 + D1) the post-boost (day 10) SCRs were 91.5%, 96.5% and 96.0%, respectively. Thus,  subjects  who  received  a  booster  vaccine  with  AS03A,  regardless  of  whether  priming  was adjuvanted or unadjuvanted, had high SCRs on Day 10. The corresponding SCRs  at  Day  42 were 87.2%, 95.6% and 96.1%, respectively. In  contrast,  subjects  who  received a  booster vaccine without adjuvant had lower point estimates of SCRs  ranging  from  64.6  to  72.9%  across  groups,  regardless  of  priming  condition.  SCRs  for A/Indonesia/5/2005  were  very  similar  to  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  results.  With  the  exception  of subjects in Group A, there was a trend for lower SCRs for the 41 to 64 years of age stratum. However, the SCR 95% CIs overlap for all vaccine groups given the small sample size. Day 42 SCRs ranged from 57.0% to 96.4% for all groups. Discussion on Q-Pan-H5N1-010 A single booster dose of A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 adjuvanted with AS03A elicited an immune response at Day 10 that exceeded CBER guidance targets for HI SCR and SPR against the booster strain and the priming strain (both being clade 2) in subjects primed with A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03A. Based on the protocol-defined criteria, the  SCRs and GMTs indicated that A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005/AS03A was not more  immunogenic  in  those  primed  with  A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03A  compared  to  those  who  had received unadjuvanted vaccine in the primary series. The immunogenicity of the adjuvanted booster dose was very similar among recipients of adjuvanted priming regimens without regard to the AS03 formulation (full or half dose) used at priming. All groups that received adjuvanted booster doses had SCRs in excess of 90% but the post-boost GMTs showed a clear trend to be higher in those who had received adjuvanted vaccine for priming. Priming  with  adjuvanted  vaccine  and  boosting  with  unadjuvanted  vaccine  produced  a  quantitatively weaker immune response than boosting with adjuvanted vaccine. Those primed with full or half dose AS03 and boosted with AS03 vaccine had the most robust immune response at both Days 10 and 42 after the booster dose. This study did not demonstrate an inhibitory effect on the booster response of unadjuvanted priming as has been noted in some other trials.  This  may  relate  to  the  fact  that  the booster viral strain used in this study is more closely related to the priming antigen (clade 2.2 vs. 2.1) than has been the case in some other datasets (clade 2.1 vs. clade 1). The results of this study need to take into account the fact that the priming and boosting strains are closely  related  (both  are  clade  2  viruses,  with  some in-vitro cross-reactivity  of  HI  antibodies). Therefore  the  results  may  not  be  extrapolated  more  broadly  to  suggest  that  boosting  with  AS03adjuvanted vaccine can be successful regardless of the priming vaccine formulation.

This  randomised,  observer-blinded  and  placebo-controlled  study  was  conducted  during  2008  in  N. America and included evaluations of lot to lot consistency study and age-specific immune responses. Participants  were  to  be  aged  18  to  49  years  and  in  good  health  or  aged  &gt;  49  years  and  in  stable health. Subjects in each age stratum were randomly assigned (3:1 ratio) to receive vaccine from one of three lots or placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects were sub-randomised to have samples analysed for primary immunogenicity assessments at D0, D42 and D182.

The study vaccine contained 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/05 H5N1 plus the same AS03 and thiomersal content as already approved for D-Pan (i.e. before the variation to approve thiomersal-free product).

The assignment of treatment was as follows:

The primary immunogenicity objectives were:  To  demonstrate  that  HI  antibody  responses  to  Q-Pan  at  D42  met  or  exceeded  the  CBER Guidance targets for SCRs and SPRs when tested separately for subjects aged 18 to 64 years and &gt; 64 years.  To demonstrate lot to lot consistency in subjects aged 18 to 49 years. Equivalence was to be tested for each of the 3 pair wise ratios of HI GMTs based on a 2-sided 95% confidence bounds for all the 3 pair wise ratios falling between the limits 0.67 to 1.5. The target sample size was approximately 4440 healthy adults aged 18 years or older in 8 dose groups (3330 to receive Q-Pan and 1110 placebo). Subjects were sub-randomised to have samples analysed for primary immunogenicity assessments and a subset of D182 sera was to be analysed. Of 4561 randomised in the study 3072 were aged 18 to 64 years (2304 vaccine and 768 placebo) and 1489 were aged &gt; 64 years (1118 vaccine and 371 placebo). By D182 there had been 218 subjects withdrawn from the study, mainly due to loss to follow-up (58 Q-Pan and 24 placebo with a complete primary vaccination course; 24 and 13 with an incomplete primary vaccination course).

Very  few  subjects  were  HI  seropositive  at  D0  in  either  of  the  age  strata.  The  post-vaccination  D42 SCRs were higher in the younger age stratum but the lower 95% CI in subjects in both strata who were seronegative at baseline exceeded the CBER requirements. In the Q-Pan group, the D42 SCRs (and the lower 95% CI around these SCRs) exceeded the CHMP criteria in both age strata.

Q-Pan  recipients  aged  18-64  years  and  &gt;  64  years  maintained  SCRs  at  D182  that  still  reached  or exceeded the CBER criteria. In each case the lower 95% CI exceeded 50%. In addition, the D182 SCRs in Q-Pan recipients still reached or exceeded the CHMP criteria. Since so few subjects were seropositive (or seroprotected) before vaccination the D42 the SPRs were almost the same as the SCRs and therefore the conclusions were generally the same as for the D42 SCRs above. In contrast, at D182 the SPRs in Q-Pan subjects no longer met the CBER criteria but were &gt; 60% for both age strata and the lower 95% CI exceeded 55%. At Day 182 the SPR among Q-Pan recipients aged 18-60 years had fallen to 62.0% and was comparable with the SPR for the older cohort (63.5%). Therefore the rate in the younger cohort no longer met the CHMP criterion. Assessment of lot to lot consistency based on HI GMTs The D42 GMFRs in both age cohorts met the CHMP criteria after vaccination (51.4 and 17.2, compared to 1.0 in the placebo groups). The D182 GMFRs in vaccinated subjects were 7.4 and 7.8. The 95% CI for the GMT ratios at D42 are shown in the next table. In each case these fell within the pre-specified limits and therefore the applicant concluded that lot to lot consistency was demonstrated. NA at D42 At baseline, the majority of subjects in the 18 to 64 years age group were seronegative for NA against A/Indonesia/5/05 (72%) and A/Vietnam/1194/04 (60%). At Day 42 all subjects tested in the 18 to 64 years  group  were  seropositive  against  A/Indonesia/5/05  and  all  had  titres ≥ 1:80  while  the seropositivity rate against A/Vietnam/1194/04 was 96.7% and 85.1% had titres ≥ 1:80.

The majority of subjects aged &gt; 60 years were seropositive at baseline for the two viruses but there was a demonstrable immune response with &gt;90% reaching titres of at least 1:80 against these viruses by D42. A 4-fold rise in NA (vaccine response) was documented against A/Indonesia/5/05 in 94% of vaccinated subjects  in  the  18  to  64  years  group  and  78%  of  older  subjects  compared  to  rates  against A/Vietnam/1194/04 of 62% and 27%. Response rates to Q-Pan were higher in subgroups that were seronegative before vaccination. Correspondingly, the NA GMTs were higher in the elderly for both viruses. For A/Indonesia/5/05 the GMT for  the  18  to  64  years  age  group  had  increased  by  66-fold  at  D42  while  there  was  a  12-fold increase in the older age group. Increments in GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/04 were 5-fold and just over 2-fold in respective age groups after two doses of Q-Pan. D182 neutralising antibody data were to be obtained from a subset of 250 subjects who were preselected at the time of randomisation. At D182 for 226 eligible subjects the percentages that still met the  criteria  for  vaccine  response  were  numerically  higher  in  the  younger  age  cohort  regardless  of baseline serostatus. Also, at D182 the greater GMT for the younger cohort was sustained with nonoverlapping 95% CI vs. the older age cohort. Although 72% of subjects aged 18 to 64 years were seronegative (&lt; 1:28) at baseline the percentage with titres ≥ 1:80 was 13.3%. Among those aged &gt; 64 years only 28% were seronegative at baseline and 45.7% already had titres ≥ 1:80. At Day 42 all subjects aged 18 to 64 years and 95.7% aged &gt; 64 years had titres ≥ 1:80 against A/Indonesia/5/05 and most of these subjects retained at least titres at this level at D182 regardless of age. Comparable results were obtained in the TVC analysis. Discussion on Study Q-Pan-H5N1-002 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study demonstrated that Q-Pan containing A/Indonesia/5/05 elicited HI responses to homologous virus  at  D42  that  met  the  CBER  and  CHMP  criteria  in  the  respective  age  groups.  However,  the responses in the younger age stratum were significantly higher than in the older age stratum. The SCR criteria and GMFR criteria were still met at D182 in both age strata while the CBER SPR criteria were not met in either of the age strata and the CHMP criteria were met only in the older age stratum. Prevaccination NA seropositivity rates were higher than pre-vaccination HI seropositivity rates and were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher for A/Vietnam than for A/Indonesia. Nevertheless, there was a clear response to vaccination in both  age  strata  at  D42  with  responses  documented  with  respect  to  vaccine-homologous  virus  and A/Vietnam.

This open label study in three phases (009, 022 and 023) carried out with D-Pan H5N1, in children 3-9 years of age which has also been previously assessed within the Marketing Authorisation for Arepanrix and Pandemrix was divided into three parts as shown below: In Phase A randomisation was to half the adult dose (1.9 µg of HA) + half the AS03 or to Fluarix In Phase B and Phase C randomisation was to (allocation ratio 3:1) full HA/half AS03 ( Phase B ) or to the adult dose ( Phase C ) with a Fluarix control group. Immunogenicity up to D42 Phase A The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 and so seropositivity rates were zero. On Day 21, the GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain were slightly increased in the Half HA/Half AS03 group in both age strata and then increased markedly after the second dose (540.3 for 6-9 years; 392.7 for 3-5 years). A similar pattern but lower response was seen against A/Indonesia/05/2005 (60.8 for 6-9 years; 53.5 for 3-5 years). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the Fluarix group no subject seroconverted for HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/2004  or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no subject was seroprotected. On Day 42 the NA GMTs against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 group had reached 1155.1 in the  6-9  years  age  stratum  and  1044.4  in  the  3-5  years  age  stratum,  whereas  the  increase  from baseline  in  the  control  group  was  very  small  (104.5  for  6-9  years;  158.4  for  3-5  years).  The  NA seropositivity  rates  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 group increased to 90.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum and to 91.7% in the 3-5 years age stratum on Day 21, with non-overlapping CIs (when compared with Day 0). All subjects in the AS03 group were seropositive for NA at D42 while the seropositivity rates in controls for NA against the vaccine strain on Days 21 and 42 were within the same range (78.6% - 80.0%).

On Day 42 the NA SCR against the vaccine strain in the Half HA/Half AS03 group had reached 100% in the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.6% in the 3-5 years age stratum. In contrast there was no further increment in SCRs in the control group after a second dose of Fluarix.

## Phase B

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pre-vaccination  HI  GMTs  for  antibody  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  and  A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 in all vaccine groups and age strata except for one subject in the 3-5 years cohort. By Day 42 GMTs for HI against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 vaccine group were 615.8 for 6-9 years and 678.1 for 3-5 years age groups and reached 64.9 to 73.7 against A/Indonesia but were still below the cut-off value in the control group. Seropositivity rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs.

Pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥ 1:28 and were 25.6 to 65.5 while baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 47.1% to 78.6%. On Day 42 GMTs exceeded 1500 in the AS03 group but there was a negligible increase  in  the  control  group.  The  seropositivity  rates  and  seroconversion  rates  followed  the  same pattern as the GMTs.

In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group the Day 42 SCRs and SPRs against the vaccine strain reached 97.8% for subjects aged 6-9 years and 97.6% for subjects aged 3-5 years. SCRs and SPRs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 increased to 68.9% and 76.2% in respective age groups. The ≥ 70% threshold for  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  met  for  HI  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004. At Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 123.2 for 6-9 years and 132.3 for 3-5 years. The increments in SCFs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were relatively modest (13.0 and 14.7). In the Fluarix group no subject seroconverted for HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/2004  or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no subject was seroprotected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Phase C

Pre-vaccination  GMTs  for  HI  antibody  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  and  A/Indonesia/05/2005  were &lt;1:10 regardless of age stratum or vaccine group and so seropositivity rates were zero. Day 21 HI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GMTs against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  slightly  increased  in  the  AS03  vaccine  group  in  both  age strata and by Day 42 they had reached 883.5 for 6-9 years and 956.4 for 3-5 years. HI GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the AS03 group were also much higher at D42 (92.5 for 6-9 years; 167.9 for 3-5 years) compared with D21. Corresponding seropositivity rates followed a similar pattern and by D42  all  subjects  in  both  age  strata  were  seropositive  against  A/Vietnam  while  rates  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 had reached 83.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.5% in the 3-5 years age stratum.

## Comparison between Phases at D42

In  the  AS03  vaccine  group  the  Day  42  SCRs  and  SPRs  were  100%  for  both  age  strata  against A/Vietnam and 79.1% to 95.5% against A/Indonesia. The ≥ 70% threshold for the lower bound of the 95%  CI  for  seroprotection  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  met  for  HI  antibody  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in both age strata and was met against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the 3-5 year age stratum. On Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 176.7 and 191.3 compared to 18.5 and 33.6 against A/Indonesia/05/2005. In the control group no subject seroconverted for HI against either strain and none was seroprotected with the exception of one subject with a response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 on Day 21 only. Pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥ 1:28 and were generally comparable between the age strata (range 25.6 to 37.3). Despite the low GMTs, the baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 30.8% to 46.7%. By Day 42 NA GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 increased about 10-fold in the AS03 group in both age strata and all children were seropositive whereas there was no further increase in GMTs in the control group and the seropositivity rates ranged from 61.5% to 87.5%. The seroconversion rates also showed the marked differences between AS03 and control for both age strata. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There was a trend for higher HI GMTs and SCFs against both strains and a higher NA GMT against the vaccine  strain  with  the  formulations  tested  in  Phases  C  and  B  compared  to  Phase  A.  The  immune response  tended  to  be  higher  in  Phase  C  when  compared  with  Phase  B.  When  comparing  the formulation used in Phase C or in Phase B with that used in Phase A the difference between A and C was marked whereas the difference between A and B was much less apparent. There were advantages for C over B for HI and NA GMTs and for HI responses to A/Indonesia.

## Immunogenicity at Month 6

By Month 6 the HI GMTS had fallen but were still at least 6-fold higher than the pre-vaccination GMTs in the groups that had received AS03 vaccines. Against A/Vietnam the seroprotection rates at Month 6 in children who received the adult dose vaccine in Part C of the study were 82.8% for 3-5 year-olds and 78% for 6-9 year-olds. These rates compare with 56% and 63.6% in respective age groups who received the half/half vaccine in Part A and with 70.2% and 68.9% who received full dose HA and half AS03 in Part B. The 95% CI overlap between Parts A, B and C within each age stratum. The results for the other parameters shown follow a similar pattern.

## persistence in terms of HI antibodies at month 6

Vaccine strain homologous (against H5N1 A/Vietnam) immune response persistence in terms of HI antibodies at month 6 H5N1 HI Antibodies against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 SPR = percentage with antibody titre  40 1/DIL; SCR = percentage with antibody titre  40 1/DIL after vaccination for initially seronegative subjects, or  4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody titre for initially seropositive subjects; SCF = fold increase in GMTs postvaccination compared with pre-vaccination; PRE = pre-vaccination; PII(M6) = postvaccination at Month 6 In the Fluarix groups in each Part of the study there was no difference between the D0 and the Month 6 HI seropositivity rates and GMTs against either A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia in 3-5 year-olds or 6-9 year-olds.  Therefore  there  was  no  evidence  of  any  augmentation  of  the  HI  immune  response  as  a result of intervening natural exposure to cross-reacting antigens between D42 and Month 6. Against the heterologous A/Indonesia strain 69% of children aged 3 to 5 years who had received the adult dose were seroprotected at Month 6 compared to 6.0% from Part A and 48.9% from Part B of the study. Corresponding rates in children aged 6 to 9 years were 61% versus 4.5% and 26.7%. Vaccine strain heterologous (against H5N1 A/Indonesia) immune response Medicinal product no longer authorised

SPR = percentage with antibody titre  40 1/DIL; SCR = percentage with antibody titre  40 1/DIL after vaccination for initially seronegative subjects, or  4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody titre for initially seropositive subjects; SCF = fold increase in GMTs postvaccination compared with pre-vaccination; PRE = pre-vaccination; PII(M6) = postvaccination at Month 6 NA against A/Vietnam at Month 6 was reported from Part A of the study (i.e. half adult dose versus Fluarix) and showed that in the AS03 vaccine group the GMTs had dropped to a similar degree in both age strata. As at D42 (GMTs 1026 and 1111) the actual GMTs at D180 were comparable for children aged  3-5  years  and  6-9  years  (776  and  759).  At  Month  6  all  children  who  had  received  the  AS03 vaccine had NA titres of at least 1:80. However, in the Fluarix group the GMTs increased between D42 and D180. In the younger age group (3-5 years) the increment was small (from 166 to 200) but is none the less remarkable since a drop in GMT would usually have been expected. In the older age group (6-9 years) the increase was by 6-fold (from  75  at  D42  to  482  at  D180).  These  results  suggest  that  natural  exposure  to  cross-reacting antigens had occurred in the interim period. As a result the seroconversion rates in the 6-9 year-olds at Month 6 were 95% for the AS03 group and 93% for the Fluarix group. Also, all children aged 6-9 years who received Fluarix had NA titres of at least 1:80 at Month 6, while the corresponding rate in the 3-5 year-olds was 80%.

The post-dose 2 SCRs at D14 were lower when the interval between doses was &lt; 14 days. There was no appreciable difference in SCRs between Groups A and B or between Groups C and D and the lower bound of the 98.75% CI for all treatment groups exceeded the CBER target. SCRs were slightly higher for the 18-40 years age stratum within Groups A and B and for the 41-64 age stratum within Groups C and D. SCRs for Groups C and D were lower than those for Groups A and B. At D21 post-dose 2 the SCRs for Groups A, B, C, and D were 95.2%, 92.8%, 80.6% and 74.3%, respectively, and the lower bound of the 95% CI for all treatment groups exceeded CBER guidance targets.

NA was measured against A/Indonesia/05/2005 at Day 42, Month 6 and Month 12 in children who received half dose HA + half ASO3 (Phase A subjects) or Fluarix (control group). The Day 0 samples were erroneously not tested. These samples will be tested and the results will be submitted as they become available. There was a significant heterologous immune response at each time point and the comparison with the control  group  indicates  that  D-Pan  H5N1  elicited  cross-reactive  immunity.  There  were  decreases  in GMTs from D42 to Month 6 and Month 12 but the proportions with NA titres of at least 1/80 remained high in both age groups (89.6% at Month 6 and 87.2% at Month 12 in the 3-6 years group and 90.2% at Month 6 and 82.9% at Month 12 in the 6-9 years group. There was a stark contrast between NA titres in the D-Pan H5N1 group and the Fluarix control group. Discussion on D-Pan H5N1-009 The CHMP considered that the D42 HI data did not fully discriminate between dose groups, but the Month 6 data indicated a strong advantage for using the full adult dose especially in terms of antibody against the drifted strain. Nevertheless all children in the half adult dose group were later shown to have NA titres of at least 1:80 against A/Vietnam. The NA titres at Month 6 and Month 12 against A/Indonesia were reported later and gave a markedly different picture to that provided by the HI data against this strain up to Month 6. The CHMP further highlighted that there are no data on the use of Q-Pan H5N1 in children and agreed that data from H5N1-009 and -023 should  be  included  in  the  SmPC  to  support  the  use  in  children  as  reflected  in sections 4.2 and 5.1. Supportive studies Q-Pan H5N1-009 This  was  an  open-label,  randomised  study  in  Canadian  adults  aged  18-64  years  in  which  Q-Pan A/Indonesia/5/2005 plus AS03 adjuvant (single lots) was administered to equal groups as follows: Group A: One 3.8 µg dose A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 and Day 21 Group B: One 3.8 µg dose A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 and Day 14 Group C: One 3.8 µg A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 and Day 7 Group D: Two 3.8 µg doses A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 (one in each arm). The primary objective was to demonstrate that HI responses to H5N1/AS03 at Day 14 after the second dose (after D0 in Group D) met the CBER criteria for SCR and elicited seroprotective titres in at least 50%. The study was stratified by age 18-40 years and 41-64 years. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For subjects aged 18-40 years in Groups C and D the CBER criterion was not met (98.75% CI lower limits were 47.4% and 49.1%) but was met for the older cohort. At 21 days post dose 2 the corresponding SPR values were 95.2%, 92.8%, 81.9% and 77.0% and the CBER criterion was met in all treatment groups. SPR values 21 days after the second dose did not differ greatly by age group. At D14 post-dose 2 the GMTs were highest in Group A. GMT values 21 days after the second dose differed by age group, especially in Groups A and B. Overall, GMTs for Groups C and D were lower than those for Groups A and B, regardless of age. Immune  responses  to  drift-variant  virus  were  lower  than  for  vaccine-homologous  virus.  Immune responses against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were generally higher than against A/Vietnam/1194/2004. For the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain at Day 14 and Day 21 after the second dose, Groups A and B reached the CBER target for SCR, the CHMP target for SCR, the 50% target for SPR and the CHMP target for SPR while all treatment groups at these time points reached the CHMP target for GMFR. The trend across treatment groups that was seen for the vaccine-homologous virus was also seen for each drift-variant strain so that immune responses were lower for the groups with short intervals between doses. There was an increase in antibody titres for all virus strains between the first and second vaccinations. The data suggested that a longer interval between vaccinations is associated with a larger increase in HI antibodies, with the largest increases seen for Group A. This indicates that the HI antibody response continues to increase at least 21 days after a single vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Discussion on Q-Pan-H5N1-009 The data demonstrated that a minimum dose interval of at least 14 days should be applied and that there are likely some advantages for 21 days between doses. Q-Pan H5N1-011 This  was  an open-label non-comparative study conducted in Japan with stratification by age (20-40 and 41-64 years; N=50 per age stratum planned and enrolled). HI responses were determined against the  vaccine  strain  (A/Indonesia/5/2005  Clade  2.1)  and  two  drifted  strains  (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 Clade 2.2 and A/Vietnam/1194/2004 Clade 1). NA responses were measured against A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Prior to vaccination, 5/100 subjects were seropositive for  HI  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005,  4  for  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  and  6  for  A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

Seropositivity  rates  were  highest  (with  highest  GMTs)  for  A/Indonesia  and  lowest  for  A/Vietnam  at D42. On Day 182, the GMTs against all three strains were lower versus Day 42 but higher than values observed at Day 21. In both age strata the GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 were comparable to those  against  A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  and  higher  than  observed  for  A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  The seropositivity rates and GMTs against vaccine-homologous and drifted strains tended to be higher in the older age cohort. The  &gt;  40%  SCR  threshold  was  exceeded  at  Day  42  in  both  age  strata  for  HI  antibodies  against A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 but not for A/ Vietnam/1194/2004. The SCRs were similar between age strata for all three strains tested. The &gt; 40% SCR threshold was still exceeded on Day 182 for HI antibodies against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005. The threshold was met in both age strata against A/Indonesia/05/2005 but was met only in the older age stratum for A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005. The ≥ 40% threshold for the lower bound of the 95% CI for seroconversion required by CBER was also still met for HI antibodies against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in both age strata but again only the older age group  still  met  the  criterion  against  A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005.  The  SCRs  for  H5N1  HI  antibodies against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 4.1% in the younger cohort and 20.0% in the older cohort. The  &gt;70%  SPR  required  by  the  CHMP  for  adults  aged  18-60  years  and  the  CBER  criterion  were exceeded for HI antibodies against A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain at D42 in both age cohorts but these thresholds were not met for the other two strains in either age stratum.

At D182 the &gt; 70% SPR threshold was not met against any strain but rates still followed the same pattern  by  strain  as  observed  at  D42.  However,  the  &gt;  70%  SPR  threshold  was  still  met  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain in the 41 to 64 years stratum (76.0%) while the CBER criterion was not met. The Day 182 SPRs were still considerably higher compared with those seen D21 but lower than observed  at  D42.  The  SPR  values  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  low  on  Day  182  in  both  age strata (6.1% for 20-40 years; 24.0% for 41-64 years). The &gt;2.5 SCF threshold against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain was exceeded at D21 (3.0) and reached 28.6  by  D42.  At  D42  the  threshold  was  also  reached  for  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  but  not  for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in either age stratum. At D182 the &gt; 2.5 SCF threshold was still exceeded in both age strata for A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005. Neutralising  antibody  (NA)  seropositivity  rates  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005  at  baseline  were  low (11/100). By D42 all subjects were seropositive in both age strata. Similarly, baseline GMTs were 14.4 in the 20-40 years and 18.3 in the 41-64 years groups but reached 579.6 and 473.8 by D42. A higher proportion of subjects were already seropositive before vaccination against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 with 70% in the older and 30% in the younger age stratum and GMTs of 61.9 and 24.8, respectively. At D42 the seropositivity rates were 92.0% and 98.0% in respective age groups with GMTs of 106.5 and 154.7. The D182 GMTs and seropositivity rates for both strains were still high. The GMTs in each age stratum were  higher for  vaccine-homologous  virus.  GMTs  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  had  decreased compared to Day 42 in each age stratum (from 579.6 to 240.5 and from 473.8 to 240.1) but GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 tended to increase in both age strata (from 106.5 to 173.5 and from 154.7 to 208.0) suggesting some natural boosting effect during the 5 months between samplings.

The NA SCR against both strains increased after the second vaccination and reached 97.0% and 47.0% at  Day  42,  respectively.  The  D42  SCRs  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005  were  comparable  between  age strata. The SCR against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was higher in the younger group but this reflects the baseline differences in NA titres. On Day 182, the SCRs were 93.9% against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and 58.6% against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and again showed an age difference.

The proportions with NA titres of at least 1:40 and 1:80 did not change substantially between D42 and D182  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  and  were  comparable  between  age  groups.  However,  the corresponding percentages for NA against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 showed increments at the 1:80 level between D42 and D182, reflecting the observed increases in GMTs. This phenomenon applied in both age strata and the final rates were comparable between age groups. Discussion on Q-Pan H5N1-011 In these 100 Japanese subjects immune responses to Q-Pan/AS03 vaccine containing A/Indonesia/5/2005  at  D42  fulfilled  all  CHMP  and  CBER  criteria  with  no  differences  between  the predefined age strata. The vaccine elicited a high cross-reactive immune response against Clade 2.2 (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005) and a lesser response to a Clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) at D42 with  no  appreciable  differences  between  age  strata.  In  both  age  strata  the  CHMP  criteria  were  still fulfilled against A/Indonesia/05/2005 on Day 182 except for SPR in those aged 20 to 40 years. Also, the SCR and SCF criteria were met against A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 in the older age stratum. The  vaccine  elicited  NA  against  Clade  1  and  Clade  2  viruses  at  D42  following  the  same  pattern  of relative  magnitude  as  for  HI  data.  The  NA  SCRs  against  the  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  lower, particularly  in  the  41-64  years  cohort,  reflecting  the  higher  baseline  seropositivity  rate  in  this  age stratum. Between D42 and D182 there were increases in NA GMTs against A/Vietnam, suggesting that some natural exposure was occurring during the period of the study.

This  was  a    phase  II,  open,  non-randomised  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  reactogenicity  and immunogenicity of one or two booster administrations of Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine in adults aged between 19  and  61  years,  previously  vaccinated  with  2  doses  of  a  pandemic  candidate  vaccine  H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 containing 3.8, 7.5, 15 or 30 μ g HA, adjuvanted or not with AS03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  015  was  a  continuation  (boosting  phase)  of  the  previously  reported  dose-finding  study  007, assessed in the initial MA application for Pandemrix. One of the eight dose/adjuvant groups in study 007  had  been  primed  at  D0  and  D21  with  3.8  µg  HA  (derived  from  A/Vietnam)  +  AS03  as  in  the currently approved  version  of the prepandemic  vaccines.  Boosting  in  study  015  occurred at approximately 14 months after the two priming doses that had been administered in study 007.

In study 015, the four dose groups that had been primed with adjuvanted vaccine in 007 received a single dose of adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 at Day 0 of study 015. The booster dose consisted of 3.8 μ g HA regardless of the dose received for priming (i.e. 3.8, 7.5, 15 or 30 µg HA + AS03 adjuvant). Blood samples were obtained at Days 0, 7, 14 and 21 after the booster.

For  the  main  analysis  concerning  the  group  primed  with  3.8 μ g  HA + AS03 the CHMP criteria were each exceeded at 21 days following the booster for HI responses to the booster homologous strain i.e. A/Indonesia. The HI responses to a single dose of A/Indonesia vaccine strongly suggested that these subjects  had  been  primed  for  A/Indonesia  by  vaccination  14  months  earlier  with  two  doses  of  VT vaccine.

The  four  groups  that  had  been  primed  with  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  in  007  received  two  doses  of adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 at D0 and D21 of study 015. The booster dose consisted  of  3.8 μ g  HA  regardless  of  the  dose  received  for  priming  (i.e.  3.8,  7.5,  15  or  30  µg  HA without adjuvant). Blood samples were obtained at Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 35 and 42. An additional  control  group  (no  previous  doses  of  H5N1  vaccine)  was  enrolled  into  015.  This  group received  two  doses  of  the  same  adjuvanted  vaccine  containing  A/Indonesia/05/2005  as  used  for boosting the eight groups derived from study 007. Doses were given at D0 and D21 and blood samples were obtained at D42. The  pre-  and  post-boost  data  in  the  group  that  had  been  primed  with  two  doses  of  the  currently approved version of prepandemic vaccine and then received a single dose of A/Indonesia vaccine (i.e. each dose containing 3.8 μ g HA + AS03) are of primary importance. It was planned that subjects will be followed for up to 24 months with blood samples obtained at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-boost. The vaccine administered in study 015 consisted of a single lot of HA and single lot of AS03. The Primary objectives of study 015 were: o To assess if the humoral immune response induced 21 days after one booster administration of the  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  fulfils  the  CHMP  criteria  in  subjects  primed  approximately  14 months earlier with two administrations (21 days apart) of the candidate vaccine formulated from a heterologous strain and adjuvanted with AS03. o To  evaluate  the  safety/reactogenicity  of  the  candidate  vaccine  in  terms  of  solicited  local  and general symptoms, unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events. Results The  actual  number  enrolled  was  350  (35  to  50  subjects  per  group).  All  were  vaccinated  while  347 completed  the  study  to  Day  51.  There  were  25  subjects  eliminated  from  the  ATP  immunogenicity cohort (92.9 %), of which 16 were eliminated because of failure to comply with the blood sampling schedule. The number of subjects per group in the ATP immunogenicity cohort was between 28 and 49. There were 40 subjects enrolled from the initial 3.8 μ g HA/AS03 priming dose group and 39/40 were included in the ATP immunogenicity cohort. The overall mean age of the 350 enrolled into 015 at the time of the first vaccination was 36.3 years (range 19 - 61 years). The male-female ratio was 0.8 and 98.6% were of Caucasian/European origin. There were no major differences between the vaccine groups for any of the demographic parameters. HI responses Medicinal product no longer authorised

Responses to the booster homologous ( A/Indonesia ) and booster heterologous ( A/Vietnam ) strains only  for  the  groups  primed  with  3.8 μ g  HA  with  or  without  adjuvant  and  the  control  group  are presented below.

At D0 in study 015 GMTs against A/Indonesia and against A/Vietnam were all low (&lt;10).

- o At Day 7 there were significant increases in GMTs against A/Indonesia in all except the control group with actual GMTs that were highest in the groups that had been primed with adjuvanted vaccine (118.5 to 193.3).

o At Day 21 the GMTs against A/Indonesia were significantly higher in the four groups primed with adjuvanted vaccine (208.4 - 429.5) compared to those primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine and controls  (31  -  77).  There  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  four  dose  groups  primed with adjuvanted vaccine and no significant differences between the four dose groups primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine. Therefore, priming with adjuvanted vaccine was the important factor and not the HA dose administered. o The GMT against A/Indonesia in the Control group at Day 42 (443) was significantly higher than the  values  observed  at  Day  42  for  the  four  groups  that  had  been  primed  with  non-adjuvanted vaccine  (54.3  -  141.4).  This  unexpected  finding  was  not  considered  relevant  for  the  current application,  which  concerns  only  adjuvanted  vaccine,  but  it  is  nevertheless  of  immunological interest and is discussed again below. o At Day 7, the increases in GMTs against A/Vietnam after  a  single  dose  of  adjuvanted  vaccine containing A/Indonesia were significant for the groups primed with A/Vietnam 3.8 µg HA with or without AS03. The actual GMT at day 7 was much higher in the former group (176.8 versus 20.8, respectively) and GMTs in this group remained higher at Day 14 (343.7) and Day 21 (352.8). o The GMT reached 58.3 at Day 42 (i.e. 21 days after the second dose) in the group primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine. o The GMT for the control group began to rise after the second dose to reach 27.1 to 31.7 from Day 28 up to Day 42. In line with the low GMTs at D0 of study 015 the seropositivity  rates for A/Indonesia were low (&lt; 10%) before the booster dose. o The  seropositivity  rate  with  respect  to  A/Indonesia  increased  significantly  by  Day  7  in  the  four groups  primed  with  adjuvanted  vaccine  (84.2  %  -  93.9  %)  and  the  groups  primed  with  nonadjuvanted vaccine (50.0 % - 64.3 %). o In  the  Control  group,  the  seropositivity  rates  rose  significantly  from  two  weeks  following  the administration of the first dose (from 0.0 % to 46.9 %). At Day 28 (7 days after the second dose) the seropositivity rate was 100%. o At  Day  42  the  seropositivity  rate  in  the  group  primed  with  3.8  µg  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  was 67.6% while the rate in the control group was 100 %. o At D0 the seropositivity rate against A/Vietnam was higher in the group primed with A/Vietnam 3.8 µg HA + AS03 (35.9 %) compared with the corresponding non-adjuvanted dose group (5.9%) and Control group (0.0 %). o The  rates  increased  significantly  after  the  first  booster  dose  so  that  by  Day  21  the  rates  in respective groups were 94.9 %, 61.8 % and 30.6 %. o There was no significant increase after the second dose in subjects primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine but the rate in the control group rose significantly (to 73.5 % at Day 28). The seroconversion rates (SCR) against A/Indonesia exceeded 40% at Day 7 for the four groups that had been primed with adjuvanted vaccine (84.2 - 93.9 %) and in three groups primed with nonadjuvanted vaccine (44.7 % - 60.7 %). The SCR at Day 7 was 35.3% in the group that had been primed with 3.8 µg HA without AS03 but reached 64.7% by day 14. The Control group achieved a SCR &gt; 40% at Day 21 (59.2 %) and by Day 42 the rate had reached 98.0 %. This compares with a SCR at D42 of about 64% in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA without AS03.

Against A/Vietnam the SCR was 81.6% at Day 7 for the group primed with 3.8 µg + AS03 while the corresponding dose group primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine exceeded 40% at Day 14 (61.8 %). The threshold was only reached by the Control group after the second dose (Day 28 rate = 59.2 %).

The seroconversion factor against A/Indonesia was &gt; 2.5 in all previously vaccinated groups by day 7. The criterion was also exceeded at Day 14 in the Control group (2.7) and then increased greatly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to 88.6 at Day 42. In contrast the D42 SCF in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA without AS03 was about 10.

Against A/Vietnam the &gt; 2.5 criterion was met in all primed groups at day 7 and at Day 28 in the Control group (6.3). SCFs for the group primed with 3.8 µg + AS03 (21.0 - 42.5) were significantly higher than for the corresponding non-adjuvanted dose group (3.7 - 10.3) and the Control group (1.1 6.5) at all time points.

The seroprotection rates (SPR) against A/Indonesia were all 0-3% at D0. The rate exceeded 70% in the  four  groups  primed  with  adjuvanted  vaccine  by  Day  7  (84.2  %  -  93.9  %).  The  threshold  was reached at Day 14 for groups primed with 7.5 µg HA alone (73.7 %) and 30 µg HA alone (75.0 %), at Day 35 for the group primed with 15 µg alone (71.9 %) and at Day 28 for the Control group (100%). The threshold was not reached for the group primed with 3.8 µg alone at any time-point. SPRs against A/Vietnam were low at D0 (0 % - 10.3 %) but had increased significantly by Day 7 in the groups primed with 3.8 µg HA with or without AS03. A significant increase in SPR was observed on Day 28 in the Control group. However, a SPR &gt; 70% was reached only in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 (84.2 % at Day 7 and 89.7 % at Day 21). Neutralising antibody responses NA titres were measured against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the groups primed with 3.8 µg HA with or without AS03 and in the Control group. o The D0 GMT was significantly higher in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 (157.8) than in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA alone (47.0) and the Control group (19.9). o At D21 significant increases in GMTs occurred in all groups to reach 3708.9, 692.4 and 307.3 in respective groups. o At D42 there was a significant increase in GMT in the Control group only (to 1606.4). The actual GMT was higher than that (933.1) in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA alone and the 95% CI only just overlapped. This finding mirrors the unexpected HI findings noted above. All subjects in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 were seropositive at Day 0 and 92% had a titre ≥ 1:80 compared to 35% in the group primed with non-adjuvanted HA and 6.1% of controls. All subjects in the three groups were seropositive by Day 21, at which time all had titres ≥ 1:80. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cell-mediated immune response

- o At Day 0, the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4 T-cells directed against A/Indonesia or against A/Vietnam  were  higher  in  the  group  primed  with  3.8  µg  HA  +  AS03  compared  to  the corresponding dose group without adjuvant and the Control group.
- o At Day 21, all three groups had a higher frequency of antigen-specific CD4 T-cells compared to D0 (336 - 2721 versus 53 - 1370, respectively).
- o Stimulation with the HA peptide pool (A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/Vietnam/1194/2004) gave the same pattern but the frequencies were lower.

o Responses  after  stimulation  with  A/Indonesia/05/2005  split  strain,  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  split strain or HA peptide pools were similar between groups for each strain. There was no observable increase in the frequency of antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses following vaccination.  No  observable  individual  differences  were  detected  in  any  of  the  groups  whether stimulation was by A/Indonesia/05/2005 split strain, A/Vietnam/1194/2004 split strain or HA peptide pool. o At Day 0, the frequency of memory B-cells directed against A/Indonesia/05/2005 or A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was higher in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 compared to the corresponding dose group without adjuvant and the Control group. o At Day 21, all groups had a higher frequency of memory B-cells compared to D0. The frequency of memory  B-cells  against  both  strains  was  higher  in  the  group  primed  with  3.8  µg  HA  +  AS03 compared to the corresponding dose group without adjuvant and the Control group. Results to D180 post-boosting Of the 350 subjects enrolled and vaccinated in the primary study phase 337 were evaluated at Day 180. The Month 6 post-boost HI data against A/Indonesia showed:  GMTs for the H5N1 AD groups (42.1 - 82.5) were higher than those observed for the H5N1 nonAD (17.6- 24.3) and Control groups (17.8). See Figure 1.  SCRs for the H5N1 AD groups (50.0 % - 75.0%) were higher than those observed for the H5N1 non-AD (30.0 %- 41.7%) and Control groups (32.6%). The &gt;40% SCR threshold was exceeded in all H5N1 AD groups and in the H5N1 15µg and H5N1 30 µg groups.  SPRs for the H5N1 AD groups (50.0 % - 75.8%) were higher than those observed for the H5N1 non-AD  (30.0%-  41.7%)  and  Control  groups  (32.6%).  The  &gt;70%  SPR  threshold  was  only maintained in the H5N1 7.5AD and H5N1 30AD groups.  SCFs &gt;2.5 were maintained in all groups but were markedly higher in the H5N1 AD groups (7.915) compared to H5N1 non-AD (3.3-4.9) and Control (3.6) groups. The HI antibody titres against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were measured at D180 only in the H5N1 3.8, H5N1 3.8AD and control groups.  The  GMT  for  group  H5N1  3.8AD  (192.8)  was  higher  than  those  for  the  H5N1  3.8  (27.5)  and Control groups (7.8). See Figure 1.  The SCR for group H5N1 3.8AD (78.9%) was higher than those for the H5N1 3.8 (51.4%) and Control  (6.5%)  groups.  Thus  the  &gt;40%  SCR  threshold  was  exceeded  in  the  H5N1  3.8AD  and H5N1 3.8 groups.  The SPR for group H5N1 3.8AD (84.6%) was higher than those for the H5N1 3.8 (51.4%) and Control  (6.5%)  groups.  Thus  the  &gt;70%  SPR  threshold  was  only  exceeded  in  the  H5N1  3.8AD group.  The SCF threshold was exceeded in the H5N1 3.8 (4.9) and H5N1 3.8AD (21.6) groups but not in the Control group (1.5).

Neutralising  antibody  titres  were  measured  at  D180  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in  the  H5N1 3.8AD, H5N1 3.8 and Control groups.

- The GMT observed for the H5N1 3.8AD (1422.2) group was higher than that observed for the H5N1 3.8 (502.3) and Control (751.3) groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The SCRs for groups H5N1 3.8 and H5N1 3.8AD were 78.4%-82.9% and were lower than the SCR observed in the Control group (95.7%).

An analysis  of  CMI  responses  (influenza-specific  CD4/CD8  T-cells  expressing  different  immune markers) was performed on a subset of subjects from the H5N1 3.8AD, H5N1 3.8 and Control groups after 4 type of stimulations. Cells  were  stimulated  with  either  a  pool  of  peptides  encompassing  the  haemagglutinin  from A/Indonesia/05/2005 or from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 or with the split antigen from H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 or from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine strains. At Month 6: ·  The  frequency  of  antigen-specific  CD4  T-cells  was  higher  in  the  H5N1  3.8AD  and  Control  groups compared to the H5N1 3.8 group. ·  There  were  no  antigen-specific  CD8  T-cell  responses  detected  in  any  of  the  group  with  the  assay used. · The frequency of memory B-cells specific to the H5N1 antigen was higher in the H5N1 3.8AD group.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy of study 015

The additional data up to D180 post-boost from study 015, support administration of a single dose of the A/Indonesia vaccine to subjects who previously received one or two doses of A/Vietnam vaccine.

The additional data to D180 in study 015 showed that the seroprotection rate against A/Indonesia was just  under  the  70%  threshold  at  D180  whereas  the  seroprotection  rate  against  A/Vietnam  still exceeded 70%.

Even  a  single  dose  of  A/Vietnam  vaccine  had  primed  for  responses  to  a  booster  at  Month 6 with H5N1/Indonesia  vaccine.  HI  responses  to  homologous  and  heterologous  booster  strains  met  and exceeded the CHMP criteria at 7 days post-boost with further increments at Month 6 + 21 days. Therefore,  the  comparable  responses  to  A/Indonesia  vaccine  after  one  or  two  doses  of  VT  vaccine indicate that the D180 data are very unlikely to be different between groups. The CHMP agreed that tha heterologous booster results should be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC of Pumarix 2.6. Clinical safety Due to the staggered reporting of studies in this application there is no overall integration of the safety data. Therefore the findings are summarised by study below. The number of subjects and number of doses evaluated for safety in the two pivotal studies and in supportive studies is shown in the tables below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition, the MAH presented an Integrated Summary of safety (ISS) based on completed adult trials performed with the D-Pan and Q-Pan vaccines that provided data on 12917 subjects aged &gt;18 years old.

In the contingent arms pain was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom (96% for Group H and 84% for Group I) but rates were lower after the second doses and rates of severe pain (Grade 3) were 2%. There were no reports of redness or swelling in Group I while the rates were 2% and 8%, respectively, for Group H with no redness or swelling &gt; 100 mm. Muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom and was reported at much higher rates in the groups receiving adjuvanted vaccine (30.9%-41.6%). Rates of Grade 3 muscle ache were  1-4%.  Incidences  of  solicited  general  symptoms  following  vaccination  with  Q-Pan  or  D-Pan vaccines were comparable when formulated with the same adjuvant content.

In the contingent arms muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom with rates of 38% for Group H and 42% for Group I but the incidence of Grade 3 muscle ache was low (2% and 0%). Fatigue was reported by 30% in each Group and was severe in intensity (Grade 3) in 2% per group. None of these 100 adults had a documented fever after the first dose and only one (in Group H) had a fever recorded after the second dose. No subject received a prophylactic antipyretic. During the 21-day post-vaccination period after each dose 42% and 38% per group received any antipyretic. At least one unsolicited AE was reported following 28.4% of doses of non-adjuvanted HA, 32.2% and 30.1% of Q-Pan doses with full  and half  dose  AS03,  respectively,  and  34.6%  and  40.4%  of  D-Pan doses with full and half dose AS03. No specific AE was reported with &gt; 5% of doses in any vaccine group.  The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  were  headache,  pharyngolaryngeal  pain,  nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and nausea. Lymph node pain and lymphadenopathy were reported after  2.7% of doses in any vaccine group. In the contingent arms at least one unsolicited AE was reported by 58% of subjects in Group H and 46% in Group I. No AE preferred term was reported by &gt; 4 (i.e. 8%) subjects in either treatment group.  Vaccine-related  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  20%  in  Group  H  and  12%  in  Group  I. Unsolicited symptoms requiring a medically-attended visit were reported by 28% in both groups and the most common were hypertension (3) and sinusitis, depression and oropharyngeal pain (2 each), all in subjects in Group I. Screening of the database for AEs with potential immune-mediated causation up to Day 182 identified reports in &lt;3% of subjects overall, including 2.6% in the non-adjuvanted HA group, 2.0%, and 2.6% in the Q-Pan groups and 2.6% and 1.4% in the D-Pan groups. Many of these events seemed to be due to concurrent conditions or other environmental exposures, and essentially all proved to be transient. No vaccine-related SAEs were reported up to Day 182 and there were no deaths. Q-Pan H5N1-010 In  this  extension  study  to  Q-Pan  H5N1-001  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any  symptom (solicited or unsolicited, local or general) after booster doses was approximately twice as high in the groups boosted with adjuvanted  vaccine (A, B1, C1, D1 and E1) vs. those boosted with unadjuvanted vaccine  (B2,  C2,  D2  and  E2).  In  particular,  the  incidence  of  local  symptoms  was  much  higher  for adjuvanted booster vaccine recipients. The overall incidence of Grade 3 symptoms ranged from 0 to 13.6%. A larger percentage of subjects in the adjuvanted booster groups experienced Grade 3 general and local symptoms compared with the unadjuvanted booster groups but only in the isolated case of group E1 was this difference substantial. Grade 3 local symptoms occurred in three subjects, all of whom received adjuvanted booster vaccine. In  Group  E1  there  was  a  variety  of  Grade  3  solicited  general  symptoms,  none  of  which  required medical attention. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pain in subjects aged ≤ 64 years was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom in both the Q-Pan  group  and  the  placebo  group  while  redness  and  swelling  were  much  less  common.  Local reactogenicity did not worsen after the second dose relative to the first dose. In those aged &gt; 64 years pain  was  the  most  commonly  reported  solicited  local  symptom  in  both  groups  but  was  reported  at slightly lower rates than in younger subjects. Grade 3 pain rates were low (0.8% with Q-Pan versus 0.3%  in  the  placebo  group)  and  redness  and  swelling  were  much  less  common  than  pain  in  both treatment groups. One Q-Pan vaccine dose was followed by swelling &gt;100 mm.

Pain at the injection site was reported by 83.7%, 81.9%, 88.3%, 80.0% and 79.3% in the adjuvanted booster vaccine groups (Groups A, B1, C1, D1, and E1) and 22.5%, 25.0%, 28.3% and 14.6% in the unadjuvanted  booster  vaccine  groups  (Groups  B2,  C2,  D2,  and  E2),  respectively.  However,  only  3 subjects reported Grade 3 pain (one in each of Groups B1, C1, and D1). Grade 2 pain was reported by 104 subjects, most of whom had received adjuvanted booster vaccination. Redness and swelling were much less common than pain in all treatment  groups.  Overall,  subjects  41  to  64  years  of  age  had slightly lower incidence rates of local solicited symptoms. Muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom and was reported at a higher rate (up to 48%) by recipients of adjuvanted booster vaccine. Only 0-7% per group reported severe muscle  ache  (Grade  3).  Headache,  fatigue  and  joint  pain  were  very  common  (15.5-25.3%)  with generally greater rates among the adjuvanted booster vaccine groups. Grade 3 fatigue, headache or joint pain was reported by 0-8.6% per group with highest rates among the adjuvanted booster vaccine recipients.  Shivering,  sweating  and  temperature  elevation  were  reported  by  &lt;  10%  across  all treatment groups. The incidence of temperature elevation was low, with 0-7% per group reporting this symptom. Severe shivering, sweating and elevated temperature were reported by 0-3.4% per group. Oral temperature ≥ 38.5º C occurred in one subject in Group D1. At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 150 subjects with a higher rate (up to 43%) in those who received adjuvanted vaccine for priming and boosting. None showed a clear trend between groups or association with adjuvant. Vaccine-related unsolicited AEs were reported by 2.5 - 13.3% per group. The  only  vaccine-related  unsolicited  AEs  reported  by  more  than  3%  in  a  treatment  group  were diarrhoea,  lymphadenopathy,  injection  site  haematoma,  nausea  and  pain  in  extremity.  Unsolicited symptoms requiring a medically attended visit were reported by 54 subjects (from 5.6 - 17.1% per group).  No  AEs  that  qualified  as  potential  immune-mediated  diseases  occurred  during  the  study (through  Day  42).  The  two  SAEs  reported  were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  unrelated  to study vaccine. No subject died through Day 42 and no subject experienced an AE or SAE that led to premature discontinuation. Q-Pan H5N1-002 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Solicited local symptoms (per dose) in study Q-Pan-002 (Total vaccinated cohort)

In the 18-64 years stratum, muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom and was reported at a higher rate for the Q-Pan group (39.3% of doses) than the placebo group (13% of doses).  Grade 3 muscle ache was reported after 2.3% of doses in the Q-Pan group and 1.1% in the placebo group. Incidences of general symptoms were lower in the older age group but muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom and grade 3 muscle ache was reported by (0.6-0.7%). Up to D182 at least one unsolicited AE was reported in the younger cohort following 27.8% of Q-Pan doses and 26.7% of placebo doses but none was reported with more than 2.7% of doses. Most AEs seemed to be due to incidental URTI. Lymph node pain and/or lymphadenopathy AEs were reported following &lt;1.5% of doses in both treatment groups. Reporting rates in the older cohort were 25.7% of Q-Pan doses and 21.4% of placebo doses but no AE was reported with more than 1.8% of doses. Six subjects died in study Q-Pan-002 up to D182 including one death within D42 and five between Day 42 and Day 182. Four had received Q-Pan but all were considered unrelated to vaccination. Safety follow-up through Day 364 showed that 160 subjects reported a total of 210 SAEs at any time during the study, including 111 (3.2%) in the Q-Pan group and 45 (4.0%) in the placebo group. No SAE  preferred  term  was  reported  by  more  than  7  subjects.  None  of  these  SAEs  showed  a  clear association with receipt of the study vaccine products and none was considered treatment-related by the  investigators.  At  least  one  unsolicited  MAE  was  reported  by  1027  (30%)  subjects  in  the  Q-Pan group  and  346  (30.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group,  with  no  substantive  differences  between treatment groups or age strata. No MAE preferred term was reported by &gt; 2.1% of subjects in either treatment group. Thirteen subjects reported AESIs / pIMDs, including 12 subjects in the Q-Pan group and 1 subject in the  placebo  group.  Two  subjects  each  in  the  Q-Pan  group  reported  psoriasis  and  polymyalgia rheumatica  and  one  subject  each  in  the  Q-Pan  group  reported  coeliac  disease,  Crohn's  disease, autoimmune  hepatitis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  facial  palsy,  erythema  nodosum,  radiculitis,  temporal arteritis  and  fourth  cranial  nerve  palsy.  One  subject  in  the  placebo  group  reported  psoriasis.  An additional Q-Pan recipient was reported to have rheumatoid lung, a preferred term not captured in the initial AESI/pIMD query. None of these events was considered vaccine-related by the investigators and only the case of autoimmune hepatitis was retrospectively classified as a SAE although the case did not actually meet the criteria. Review of these cases suggested that a substantial proportion may have had alternative  non-immunologic  causes  or  triggering  events  other  than  the  vaccine  or  may  have represented conditions which antedated vaccination. Q-Pan H5N1-009 The  overall  incidence  of  symptoms  was  comparable  among  all  groups  for  both  doses,  although  the proportion of subjects reporting either local or general symptoms declined modestly after the second dose relative to the first in each group. Pain was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom in all treatment groups and was reported at similar rates for all groups (around 80%). The incidence of severe  pain  (Grade  3)  was  low  (per  subject  rates  of  1.3%,  7.8%,  7.7%  and  2.6%).  Redness  and swelling were much less common than pain in all treatment groups. No subjects reported redness or swelling &gt; 100 mm in any treatment group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Muscle  ache  was  the  most  commonly  reported  solicited  general  symptom  overall  (64.5%,  55.8%, 51.3% and 51.9%) while severe muscle aches (Grade 3) showed overall per subject rates of 2.6%, 7.8%, 6.4% and 2.6%. Fatigue, headache and joint pain were fairly common (14.3-39.0% per subject) but  Grade  3  events  were  reported  in  1.3-5.3%.  The  remaining  solicited  general  symptoms  were reported by &lt; 20% of subjects overall across all treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Temperature  elevation  was  reported  by  2.6%,  5.2%,  1.3%  and  1.3%  and  temperature ≥ 38.5º  C occurred in 1.3%, 2.6%, 1.3% and 0%. Temperatures ≥ 39º C were reported by 2.6% of subjects in Group B and by no subjects in all other treatment groups.

At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 139 subjects overall (rates were 43.6%, 47.4%, 52.6% and 34.6%).  No  AE  was  reported by more  than 6.4%  of subjects in a treatment group. Lymphadenopathy  occurred  in  3.8%,  6.4%,  5.1%  and  2.6%  with  no  consistent  pattern  across treatment groups and no cumulative rates with doses. All lymphadenopathy occurred at the axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes.

The  data  from  study  D-Pan  H1N1-009  (a  phase  II,  randomised,  open-label,  multicentre  study  to evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  Pandemrix  H1N1  following  a  homologous  prime-boost schedule  in  children  aged  6  to  35  months,  assessed  in  Pandemrix  variation  II-0028)  show  that  the reactogenicity of the second half adult dose in children 6 months to 35 months of age is greater than the first within the initial cohort and also when comparing the total 104 who have received a first half adult dose with the 51 who have received a second half adult dose. The patterns of reporting by age stratum indicate  that  local  and  general  reactogenicity  is  higher  after  the  second  half  adult  dose  for most individual symptoms and in all age strata.

No subject experienced an AE that led to premature discontinuation from the study. There were six SAEs  reported  by  three  subjects  up  to  Day  51  but  all  were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be unrelated to study vaccine and were non-fatal. Q-Pan H5N1-011 In  the  Japanese  subjects  included  in  the  study  the  overall  incidence  of  symptoms  was  high  and comparable between age strata and all subjects reported at least one symptom. Grade 3 local and general symptoms were reported with low frequencies ( ≤ 16%). Subjects from the 20-40 years age stratum reported more Grade 3 general symptoms (10%, 5 subjects) compared to the older stratum but there was no clear difference between age strata in terms of Grade 3 local symptoms including those considered to be related to vaccination. Local symptoms, predominantly driven by the incidence of injection site pain, were reported with high and similar frequencies in both age strata. Grade 3 local solicited symptoms were reported with low frequencies with Grade 3 pain at injection site reported in only one subject in the 20-40 years stratum. The overall per dose frequencies in both age strata ranged from 2% to 3% in the 20-40 years stratum and the 41-64 years stratum for redness and swelling/induration, respectively. In general, there was no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  local  solicited  symptoms  of  any  type  or  grade  between  Dose  1  and Dose 2. There were no differences observed in terms of reported frequency of joint pain and shivering between the  age  strata.  In  contrast,  trends  for  higher  frequencies  were  observed  for  the  following  solicited general symptoms in the 20-40 years stratum: fatigue, headache, muscle aches, shivering, increased sweating and fever. The reported frequencies of Grade 3 general symptoms were very low. Fatigue was the most frequently reported general symptom at 71% overall, 78% in the 20-40 years and 64% in the 41-64 years groups. Grade 3 and grade 3-related fatigue was reported only in the 20-40 years stratum  (3  subjects,  6%).  Fever  of  any  grade  ( ≥ GLYPH&lt;31&gt;38°C)  was  reported  by  12%  in  the  20-40  years stratum compared to 10% of subjects in the 41-64 years stratum. Grade 3 and Grade 3-related fever was reported by one subject in the 20-40 years stratum with no reports of Grade 4 fever. Unsolicited adverse events were reported by 51 subjects, including injection site pruritus, injection site warmth  and  nasopharyngitis.  Three  subjects  in  the  younger  cohort  reported  at  least  one  Grade  3 unsolicited  AE  (joint  sprain,  urticaria  and  asthma)  and  28  reported  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE considered to be causally related to vaccination (including urticaria one day after dose 2 that occurred after a first episode of urticaria worsening two days after dose 1). AEs prompting medically-attended visits were reported by 16 subjects. Of these, 13 subjects were in the 20-40 years stratum. However, no specific clinical pattern could be identified.

The overall per-dose frequency of the following adverse reactions was as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Adverse reactions        | Post dose 1   | Post dose 2   |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pain                     | 31.4%         | 41.2%         |
| Redness                  | 19.6%         | 29.4%         |
| Swelling                 | 15.7%         | 23.5%         |
| Fever ( ≥ 38°C) axillary | 5.9%          | 43.1%         |
| Fever ( ≥ 39°C) axillary | 0.0%          | 3.9%          |
| Drowsiness               | 7.8%          | 35.3%         |
| Irritability             | 21.6%         | 37.3%         |
| Loss of appetite         | 9.8%          | 39.2%         |

Loss of appetite The major concern is the rate of fever after the second half adult dose in children aged 6-35 months, which would not be predicted from the prior experience with H5N1/AS03 vaccine in older children aged  3-5  years.  Nevertheless,  fever  may  also  occur  after  the  first  half  adult  dose  and  febrile convulsions have been reported in association. The additional data from D-Pan H1N1-010 (assessed in Pandemrix II-0028) also show higher rates of fever after the second full adult dose in children aged from 3 years upwards but with decreasing rates with increasing age. It would be expected that rates after a second half adult dose in this age group would be lower. Overall discussion on clinical safety Based on the limited data from the direct comparison made within study Q-Pan-001 the safety profile of Q-Pan H5N1 appeared essentially the same as that previously described for D-Pan H5N1. The data from this study and all the other studies from which safety data were reported during the procedure did not raise any new issues for the vaccine construct as a whole. The issue of the potential for the AS03 adjuvant to trigger onset of auto-immune diseases in predisposed individuals remain under close scrutiny but so far without any definitive conclusion possible. The safety database available for Q-Pan H5N1  is  sufficient  to  support  its  use  in  adults.  The  data  from  D-Pan  H5N1-009  was  considered sufficient to support the use in children from 3 years of age. as the data in adults strongly support a conclusion  that  the  safety  of  D-Pan  H5N1  in  children  would  also  apply  to  Q-Pan  H5N1.  The  CHMP however noted the increased rate of fever after the second dose following the use of D-Pan H1N1 in previous studies, which was  especially observed in children 6 - 35 months.

Conclusions on the clinical efficacy The applicant has conducted a full clinical development programme with Pumarix containing Quebec manufactured  H5N1  antigens.  D-Pan  and  Q-Pan  containing  H5N1  strains  have  been  shown  to  have comparable immunogenicity in adults in study Q-Pan H5N1-001 and there are also data in the elderly in  study  Q-Pan  H5N1-002  that  indicate  comparable  responses  between  Dresden  and  Quebecmanufactured vaccines. There are currently no clinical data with Pumarix (i.e. Q-Pan H5N1) in children. While  awaiting  paediatric  data  generated  with  Q-Pan  in  children,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the presentation of the clinical paediatric data obtained so far with D-Pan (H5N1) in the Pumarix SmPC is justified. This is based on the immunological equivalence that was previously shown between Q-Pan (H5N1) and D-Pan (H5N1) in adults. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  available  data  indicate  that  the  safety  profiles  of  H5N1  D-Pan  and  H5N1  Q-Pan  vaccines  are comparable. Taking this into consideration, along with the comparable immune responses observed in adults to D-Pan (H5N1) and Q-Pan (H5N1), the CHMP concluded that the dose recommendations for Pumarix in children can be based on the data presented from study D-Pan H5N1-009 carried out in children 3-9 years of age.

Overall  the  immune  responses  to  Pumarix  and  Pandemrix/Prepandrix  (as  H5N1  vaccine)  can  be considered to be broadly comparable.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The  clinical safety data generated with Pumarix in adults  indicate no safety concerns.

Across the studies pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom. There was also a trend for higher incidences of swelling and redness in groups with adjuvanted vaccines and the rate of induration was significantly higher in adjuvanted groups. However, severe swelling, redness and induration were all reported at low rates. Regional lymphadenopathy may also occur. The most frequently reported general symptoms were fatigue and headache.

Standard  Pharmacovigilance  activities  will  be  conducted  in  pre-pandemic  phases.  However,  in  a pandemic  situation  the  MAH  agreed  to  adapt  pharmacovigilance  activities  according  to  the  CHMP recommendations  for  pharmacovigilance  plans  for  pandemic  vaccines  (EMEA/359381/2009)  and following updates. Modified pharmacovigilance activities in the pandemic period are described in the Risk Management Plan.

All SAEs besides one case of autoimmune hepatitis in study Q-Pan H5N1-002,  which however did not meet the case definition criteria  were considered as not related to vaccination by the investigator . Review  of  these  cases  suggested  that  a  substantial  proportion  may  have  had  alternative  nonimmunologic causes or triggering events other than the vaccine or may have represented conditions which antedated vaccination. Six subjects died in study Q-Pan-002 up to D182 including one death within D42 and five between Day 42 and Day 182. Four had received Q-Pan but all were considered unrelated to vaccination. Safety data generated with D-Pan H5N1 in children also did not reveal any safety concerns, and the CHMP considered that the safety in children can be extrapolated from D-Pan H5N1 to Q-Pan H5N1. Safety data generated from FluLaval, a seasonal vaccine which is manufactured in the same way like Pumarix,  and  from  Arepanrix,  a  pandemic  H1N1v  vaccine  manufactured  with  the  same  process  as Pumarix and which was widely used outside the EU during the 2009-2010 pandemic, indicate also no safety concerns. The safety of Pumarix will be further assessed in a prospective non-interventional cohort safety study with the formulation of the vaccine to be used in the event of a pandemic in addition to the existing commitments for Pumarix as outlined in the RMP and Letter of Undertaking. The  data  from  studies  carried  out  with  Q-Pan  H5N1  vaccine  (i.e.  Pumarix)  is  in  keeping  with  the previous  observations  of  comparable  safety  and  immunogenicity  between  with  D-Pan  vaccines  (i.e. Pandemic Influenza Vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Prepandrix) containing HA derived from H5N1 strains. Having considered the safety concerns in the Risk Management Plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. No post marketing data is currently available from the use of QPan H5N1 vaccines. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (version 3.06) as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan (version 2 June 2010) which included a risk minimisation plan.

Additional risk minimization activities are proposed to address the following potential risks:

- medical errors/misidentification of vaccine,

- contamination of the multiple-dose vials, - coring of the rubber stopper on the antigen vial which have not been properly reported in the summary table of the RMP activities. An updated EU-RMP will be submitted at the time of the next submission of PSUR, including the above potential risks in the summary table of the RMP activities and taking into account the classification of safety concerns as important identified risk, important potential risks and missing information (see section 2.7).

## User consultation

A justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package leaflet  (PL)  has  been  submitted  by  the  applicant  and  has  been  found  acceptable  for  the  following reasons:

The applicant submitted:

-  A full report on User Testing (UT) for the Arepanrix PL (i.e. Q-Pan H1N1v) and

 A 'bridging report' for Pumarix PL. The  applicant  justifies  the  lack  of  specific  User  Testing  with  Pumarix  PL  based  on  the  fact  that  EU guidance states that where sufficient user testing has already been performed on products identified as being similar or related the results of UT can be applied across related leaflets to fulfil Council Directive 2004/27/EC, Article 59 (3). Thus EU guidance on bridging permits the use of successful User Tests carried  out  for  one  or  more  leaflets  (parent  leaflets)  as  justification  for  not  testing  similar  leaflets (daughter leaflets) provided that the daughter leaflets are of sufficiently similar content, design, layout and writing style as the parent leaflet. 2.8. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits  Beneficial effects The  manufacture  of  the  H5N1  antigen,  the  H5N1  formulated  vial  and  the  ASO3  (adjuvant)  vial  are appropriately controlled. Adequate in-process controls, release and shelf life specifications have been set  in  line  with  relevant  requirements  and  satisfactorily  demonstrate  the  quality  of  the  vaccine. Commitments are made by the applicant to update some information when available, which does not impact on the risk/benefit assessment of this vaccine. The proposed formulation of Pumarix has been shown to elicit HI and NA responses to the homologous vaccine strain and to related (clade 2) virus. The data suggest that two doses of vaccine administered at least 21 days apart is likely to be a satisfactory regimen in adults.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. The  actual  protection  that  Pumarix  might  provide  for  a  future  pandemic  influenza  strain  cannot  be predicted from these HI and NA data. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that a lower dose of HA and/or a lower dose of AS03 might be just as satisfactory at least in some sub-groups (e.g. healthy adults aged  &lt;  40  years).  The  large  difference  in  pre-vaccination  seropositivity  rates  between  HI  and  NA assays  has  been  noted  previously  in  H5N1  vaccine  studies  when  testing  against  A/Vietnam  and A/Indonesia but the explanation remains unclear and most likely reflects a combination of factors, e.g. assay variability, - sensitivity  and - standardisation. There are no data with Pumarix in children or in immunosuppressed subjects. The D-Pan H5N1 data available in children aged 3-9 years should be applicable to use of Q-Pan H5N1 in this age group and it is reasonable to suppose that the adult dose regimen would be applicable to those aged 10-17 years. However, it is not possible to predict whether half the adult dose would suffice in children aged &lt; 3 years. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risks

-  Unfavourable effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effect of combining H5N1 HA with AS03 on rates of reported local and general symptoms is now very well documented. The substantial safety database available with Pumarix in adults together with the substantial experience now available with AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines demonstrates the reactogenicity related to the adjuvant but this is not of a degree that would preclude its use. Halving the AS03 per dose gave lower rates of pain but effects on general symptoms were variable with no consistent trend to lower rates with half the adjuvant.

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects.

The safety of D-Pan H5N1 in children aged 3-9 years may be extrapolated to use of Pumarix in this same age range and safety in children aged 10-17 years is likely to be comparable to that in adults. However, safety of full or half adult doses in children aged &lt; 3 years cannot be predicted. Based on the recent experience with second doses of AS03-adjuvanted H1N1v vaccine in this age group there is a potential concern especially regarding the rates of fevers that might be observed. Benefit-Risk Balance  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects This  core  dossier  is  based  on  a  vaccine  containing  a  strain  of  influenza  A/H5N1  with  low  prevaccination HI seropositivity but higher pre-vaccination NA seropositivity. The immune responses vary between  baseline  seropositive  and  seronegative  subsets.  However,  there  will  be  no  pre-vaccination testing in a pandemic situation and it is important to provide a regimen that will trigger high immune responses  even  in  those  who  are  seronegative.  In  addition,  to  use  a  formulation  and  regimen  that provide some degree of persisting and cross-reacting immune responses without eliciting unacceptable reactogenicity.  For  the  paediatric  population,  data  based  on  Pumarix  (i.e.  Q-Pan  H5N1  vaccine)  are awaited. However as the extrapolation of paediatric efficacy and safety data between D-Pan H5N1 and Q-Pan H5N1 vaccines was considered acceptable the data from the paediatric study D-Pan H5N1-009 can be taken into account for the benefit-risk balance in this population. 2.8.1. Conclusion on the benefit-risk balance The overall benefit-risk of Pumarix is considered to be positive. Risk management plan A risk management plan was submitted, version 2 June 2010. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that: -  Standard  Pharmacovigilance  activities  will  be  conducted  in  pre-pandemic  phases.  However,  in  a pandemic  situation  the  MAH  agreed  to  adapt  pharmacovigilance  activities  according  to  the  CHMP recommendations  for  pharmacovigilance  plans  for  pandemic  vaccines  (EMEA/359381/2009)  and following updates. Modified pharmacovigilance activities in the pandemic period are described in the Risk Management Plan. - Additional risk minimization activities are proposed to address the following potential risks: - medical errors/misidentification of vaccine, - contamination of multiple-dose vials, - coring of the rubber stopper on the antigen vial Medicinal product no longer authorised which have not been properly reported in the summary table of the RMP activities. An updated EU-RMP will be submitted at the time of the next submission of PSUR, including the above potential risks in the summary table of the RMP activities and taking into account the classification of safety concerns as important identified risk, important potential risks and missing information (see section 2.7).

## 2.9. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Pumarix  in  the  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared pandemic situation, in accordance with official guidance, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.
