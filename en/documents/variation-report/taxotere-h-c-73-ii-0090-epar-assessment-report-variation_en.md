## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Taxotere 20 and 80 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion (INN: docetaxel) were initially granted  Marketing  Authorisations  (MAs)  under  exceptional  circumstances  for  a  restricted  indication (second line monotherapeutic treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer after anthracycline failure)  in  the  EU  in  1995.  Docetaxel  is  a  semisynthetic  and  important  taxane  which  displays  its cytotoxic/antineoplastic  activity  by  promoting  the  assembly  of  free  tubulin  into  stable  microtubles thereby inhibiting mitosis.

On  30  November  2009  the  Commission  Decision  for  the  additional  strengths  of  20 mg/1ml  and 80 mg/4ml (concentrate for solution for infusion) was issued and on 27 April 2010 the Commission Decision was issued for a new presentation of 160 mg/8 ml of Taxotere concentrate for solution for infusion (one vial formulation).

Meanwhile, after granting full MA and several amendments of the indication, the medicinal product is indicated for:

## Breast cancer

- in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node- positive breast cancer.
-  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition.
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline  or  an alkylating agent.
- in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours  overexpress  HER2  and  who  previously  have  not  received  chemotherapy  for  metastatic disease.
-  in  combination  with  capecitabine  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with locally  advanced  or  metastatic breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous  therapy  should  have  included  an anthracycline.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.
-  in  combination  with  cisplatin  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable,  locally  advanced  or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

## Prostate cancer

- in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

## Gastric adenocarcinoma

- in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

## Head and neck cancer

- -in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

The  scope  of  this  variation  application  is  an  extension  of  the  breast  cancer  adjuvant  treatment indication. The MAH initially proposed the new indication as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer (with one or more high risk factors [see section 5.1]).'

This  application  is  based  on  the  results  of  The  Grupo  Espanol  de  Investigacion  en  Cancer  de Mama (GEICAM) 9805 phase III study (TAX.ES1.301). Study GEICAM 9805 (TAX.ES1.301) compared: TAC (docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) versus FAC (5-fluorouracil in combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide)  as  a  6-cycle  adjuvant  treatment  of  high  risk operable breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes.

Further to the assessment by CHMP the following final indication has been agreed:

'TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with:

- operable nodenegative breast cancer

For patients with operable nodenegative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1).\"

Consequently  to  the  proposed  new  indication,  SPC  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  as  well  as  the Package Leaflet have been updated as well. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to perform a correction in SPC section 6.6 and PL concerning the preparation guide for the 20mg/1ml, 80mg/4ml and 160mg/8ml concentrate for solution for infusion presentations.

## 1.2. Scientific Discussion

## 1.2.1 Non clinical aspects

The MAH did not provide any new nonclinical data in this application which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Ecotoxicity / Environmental Risk Assessment

The  MAH  has  predicted  an  environmental  concentration  in  surface  water  of  3.9 10-4 µg/l  and concluded that no further environmental risk assessment is necessary.

The  MAH  proposed  to  make  a  ratio  of  the  maximal  total  quantity  marketing  forecast  (estimated  at 450 kg/year  in  2011)  to  the  total  quantity  of  water  consumption  in  Europe  during  the  same  period (i.e., 400 106 inhabitants x 200 L x 365 days) and use the usual dilution factor of 10. The exposure would therefore be the following:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Concerning  the  present  Type  II  variation  for  the  combination  of  docetaxel  with  doxorubicin  and cyclophosphamide for the adjuvant treatment of patients with node-negative operable breast cancer eligible to chemotherapy the number of patients concerned would be 7900 patients/year who receive 4  cycles of two 80 mg vials, i.e.:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The MAH stated that logKOW of the active ingredient is 3.2 (calculated). In addition, the MAH referred to a literature review revealing other calculated or measured values as reported in table 1.

Table 1 - Various docetaxel log KOW values

| Source     | Method     |   log K OW value |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| ChemIDplus | Calculated |             2.83 |
| Drug bank  | Calculated |             2.59 |
| Drug bank  | Measured   |             2.4  |
| NDA        | Calculated |             3.2  |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Furthermore, the MAH has provided information on fate (sorption, hydrolysis, aerobic biodegradation) and effects (acute toxicity test on Daphnia, minimal inhibiting concentration for micro-organisms) of docetaxel in the environment without submitting any study report.

## Discussion

The  CHMP  considered  that  for  the  calculation  of  the  exposure  the  number  of  inhabitants  in  Europe must be 497*10 6 (EU27, 2009): 450*10 6 /(497*10 6 *200*365*10) = 0.00124µg/L.

Concerning the present extension of indication, the potential market for docetaxel as chemotherapeutic agent should be considered. That means the increase of the quantity market will be 50.56 kg, based on this calculation: 79000*4*2*80*10- 6  = 500.56 kg.

However, both exposure calculations lead to PECs beneath the trigger of 0.01 µg/L. A Fpen refinement would  be  accepted  by  the  committee  in  Phase  I,  if  the  MAH  provides  the  source  of  breast  cancer incidences.

The logKOW of the active ingredient is 3.2 (calculated). The MAH has further provided information on fate (sorption, hydrolysis, aerobic biodegradation) and effects (acute toxicity test on Daphnia, minimal inhibiting concentration for micro-organisms) of docetaxel in the environment without submitting any study report.

It  was  appreciated  having  received  the  data  available  on  fate  and  effects  of  docetaxel  in  the environment. However, the data submitted are not in line with the guideline on the environmental risk assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/H/C/SWP/4447/00,  June  2007).  As  the environment  is  continuously  exposed  to  human  medicinal  products,  short-term  tests  are  not appropriate. Besides that, only one trophic level was tested. In any case, full test protocols which allow to  check  validity  and  plausibility  of  the  results  and  to  decide  whether  the  use  of  non-OECD  test guidelines would be acceptable need to be submitted.

The MAH argued that a phase I pbt assessment is not deemed to be necessary, because the estimated logKOW is below 4.5. However, the MAH only calculated the logKOW from the environmental assessment included in the NDA. In addition, the MAH referred to a literature review revealing other calculated or measured values as reported in table 1.

Because of lacking data the CHMP did not agree with the MAHs assumption that docetaxel does not present any risk of bioaccumulation. To assess the bioaccumulation potential (logKOW &gt;3) of the base docetaxel the mentioned logKOW -study has to be described in more detail, at least the pH at which the study was conducted, has to be provided. If literature with more detailed parameters or a study report can not be submitted the MAH is asked to perform a KOW-study according to OECD 107 and to submit the final study report. However, if the log KOW &gt; 3 was proven by a study, the MAH committed to perform a bioaccumulation study in line with OECD 305 in Phase II of the risk assessment.

During  assessment  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  medicines  statistics  or  published  epidemiological data on the prevalence of the indication which could be used to refine the market penetration factor in Phase I and to demonstrate that the extension of indication does not lead to an increased exposure of the environment to the active ingredient. However, the CHMP had difficulties to verify the internal data provided and to follow on the basis of the estimation of patients and market forecasts. If the source for medicines statistics or published epidemiological data on the prevalence of the indication which could be used to refine the market penetration factor in Phase I and to demonstrate that the new indication does not lead to an increased exposure of the environment to the active ingredient can not be provided by the MAH, the MAH committed to conduct a Phase II ERA.

## 1.2.2 Clinical Aspects

## 1.2.2.1 Introduction

The submission comprised a single, pivotal phase III trial, TAX.ES1.301/GEICAM 9805. In the adjuvant treatment  of  operable  node-positive  and  node-negative  breast  cancer,  the  recommended  dose  of docetaxel  is  75 mg/m2  administered  1-hour  after  doxorubicin  50 mg/m2  and  cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment in section 4.2 of the SPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  waived  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with Taxotere in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see SPC section 5.1).

## GCP

According  to  the  MAH,  the  protocol  of  study  GEICAM  9805  was  designed  in  compliance  with recommendations of the 18th World Health Congress (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicable amendments, with the laws and regulations, as well as any applicable guidelines, of the countries where the study was conducted.

## 1.2.2.2  Clinical Pharmacology

No pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.

## Discussion and conclusion

No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  during  the  co-administration  of  doxorubicin  cyclophosphamide,  and docetaxel has been observed in the previously submitted study XRP6976D/1001 (a pharmacokinetic interaction study of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i.v. on the combination therapy doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 i.v. and  cyclophosphamide  500  mg/m2  i.v.  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  breast  cancer,  see  variation application EMEA/H/C/073/II/54). No critical issues have been identified concerning clinical pharmacology.

The pharmacokinetic properties of docetaxel are adequately described SPC section 5.2.

## 1.2.2.3  Clinical efficacy

## 1.2.2.3.1 Dose response study(ies)

No dose-response studies were submitted.

In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended  dose  of  docetaxel  is  75 mg/m 2 administered  1-hour  after  doxorubicin  50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide  500 mg/m 2   every  3 weeks  for  6 cycles  (TAC  regimen).  For  the  complete  dosing recommendations,  see  SPC  section  4.2.  The  initial  dosing  recommendation  were  based  on  a  pilot phase II study of docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (Nabholtz et al., J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jan 15;19(2):314-21), see variation application EMEA/H/C/073/II/54.

## 1.2.2.3.2 Main study - GEICAM 9805

Title: A multicenter Phase 3 randomized trial comparing docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) versus 5-fluorouracil in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as adjuvant treatment of high risk operable breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes.

## Treatments

- -TAC : Doxorubicin 50 mg/m² as 15-min IV infusion followed by Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m², as 15-min IV infusion. There was a one-hour interval between the end of the IV infusion of doxorubicin and  the  beginning  of  the  infusion  of  Docetaxel  75  mg/m²  as  1-hour  IV  infusion.  Prophylactic antibiotic  therapy  (Ciprofloxacin  500 mg  orally  twice  daily  for  10 days  starting  on  Day 5  of  each cycle) was compulsory for subjects treated with TAC. The following premedication regimen for fluid retention was compulsory for all subjects treated with TAC. Dexamethasone 8 mg orally for total of 6 doses.
- -FAC : Doxorubicin 50 mg/m² as 15-min IV followed by 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m² as 15-min IV and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² as 15-min IV.

Patients were to receive a total of 6 cycles unless treatment was precluded by relapse, subject refusal, or unacceptable toxicities.

The chemotherapy doses were calculated according to baseline body surface area (BSA) for all cycles, and BSA was to be recalculated if there was a ≥ 10% decrease in body weight compared to baseline.

Dose reduction and/or treatment delay, supportive treatment adjustment, and treatment discontinuation were planned for the 2 treatment groups in cases of severe haematological and/or non

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haematological  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  or  laboratory  abnormalities,  including neutropenia.

In both treatment groups, the following additional therapies were administered:

-  Tamoxifen  20 mg  orally  once  daily  for  5 years,  starting  3  to  6 weeks  after  the  last  course  of chemotherapy for patients with positive ER and/or PR, unless there was a contraindication for the use of tamoxifen therapy
-  Patients treated with lumpectomy were to undergo postoperative radiotherapy after completion of chemotherapy and resolution of any side effect(s).  Radiotherapy was allowed after mastectomy and  chemotherapy  for  node-negative tumours  &gt;5 cm,  according  to  the  guidelines  at  each institution.

A prophylactic antiemetic treatment was recommended for patients in both treatment groups, with the choice of antiemetic left to the discretion of the Investigator.

Subsequent to the initiation of the study, the protocol was amended to require primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)  prophylaxis in all TAC patients (Protocol  Amendment  No. 3, 18 July 2000 was instituted after the first 230 patients were randomized). This was to be used as:

-  primary prophylactic treatment in patients treated with TAC
-  curative treatment in case of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 X 10 9 /L lasting &lt;7 days, febrile neutropenia, or infection
-  prophylactic treatment in patients treated with FAC with a prior episode of febrile neutropenia in an earlier cycle
-  treatment for delayed recovery of ANC at Day 21

Also in the TAC treatment group, antibiotic prophylaxis was to be administered to all patients from the first  cycle  of  treatment.  Ciprofloxacin  was  recommended  at  a  dose  of  500 mg orally  twice  daily  for 10 days starting Day 5 of each cycle. If ciprofloxacin was not available or not tolerated, another oral antibiotic was required, the choice of which was at the discretion of the Investigator.

Patients were also required to receive prophylactic premedication for fluid retention (6 oral doses of dexamethasone 8 mg).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). DFS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of local, regional, or metastatic relapse, or the date of second primary cancer, or death from any cause (whichever occurred first). If there was no event, the patient was censored at the last visit. Patients with only baseline data were censored 1 day after randomization.

The main secondary endpoints were:

- -Overall survival (OS) defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause.
- -Quality  of  life  (QOL).  QOL  evaluation  was  based  on  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-BR23,  selfadministered by the patient.
- -Pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy.

Follow-up visits were to be every 12 weeks (3 months) for the first 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5,  and  then  annually  for  10  years.  Clinical  follow-up  could  be  more  frequent  according  to  the standard of practice at the participating center.

First 2 years:

- -Every 12 weeks: physical examination
- -Every 6 months: haematology and biochemistry in addition to a physical examination
- -Every  12  months:  mammography  and  chest  X-ray  in  addition  to  a  physical  examination, haematology, and biochemistry

Years 3 to 5:

- -Every 6 months: physical examination, haematology, biochemistry
- -Every  12  months:  mammography  and  chest  X-ray  in  addition  to  a  physical  examination, haematology, and biochemistry

Years 6 to 10:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Every 12 months: physical examination, haematology, biochemistry, and mammography
- -Other diagnostic tests (ie, abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan, bone scan) were to be performed only in the presence of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of cancer recurrence.
- -A quality of life assessment was required 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the end of chemotherapy.

## Sample Size

DFS  in  the  control  group  was  estimated  to  be  around  80%  at  5  years.  The  study  was  originally designed to detect a 7.5% increase in DFS for TAC compared to FAC (i.e. from 80% to 87.5%). To detect this difference at a 5% significance level with 90% power, 527 patients were calculated to be necessary in each arm (with an average follow-up period equal to 5 years). According to the MAH, this calculation  took  into  account  an  expected  3%  rate  of  ineligible  patients.  An  interim  analysis  was planned in the initial protocol to take place 3 years after half of the expected recruitment had been completed  using  a  group  sequential  design  (Peto,  1976),  with  a  significance  level  of  0.001  for  the interim analysis.

## Randomisation

The randomisation (1:1)  was centralised  and  stratified  according  to  the  participating  institution  and menopausal status.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was non-blinded.

## Statistical methods

The unstratified log-rank test was used to compare the 2 treatment groups for DFS and OS. All tests of hypotheses were two-sided. The primary efficacy analysis population was the ITT population. The ITT population was defined as the population of all randomized patients, analyzed in the treatment group to  which  they  were  assigned.  Randomized  patients  who  did  not  receive  chemotherapy  according  to randomization were analyzed in the treatment group of randomization.

The QoL population was defined as the population of all randomized patients who presented at least 1 baseline and post-baseline assessment of the QOL instruments. The GHS/QOL (Global Health Quality of Life) score was the primary endpoint of the QOL analysis. The GHS/QOL score was analyzed using a longitudinal  mixed  model  with  treatment  and  time  as  fixed  effects  and  patient  within  the  group  as random effect.

## Results

## Participant flow

The cut-off date for data inclusion is 04 March 2009 (for clinical laboratory results, 05 May 2009), at which point all patients had completed at least 5 years of follow-up (median follow-up time of 6 years and 5 months [TAC: 76 months; FAC: 77 months]). A total of 1060 patients were randomized into the study. The first patient was randomized on 21 June 1999 and the last one on 10 March 2003. Fifty-five (55) centers actively recruited patients. The majority of patients were treated in Spain, with 962 of 1060 (90.8%) in Spain, 42 of 1060 (4.0%) in Germany, and 56 of 1060 (5.3%) in Poland. Details of overall patient disposition are provided in Figure 1.

<!-- image -->

There  were  33  (6.1%)  patients  in  the  TAC  treatment  group  and  13  (2.5%)  patients  in  the  FAC treatment group who discontinued chemotherapy treatment. Adverse events were the primary reason for treatment discontinuations in the TAC group (4.6% of patients), followed by withdrawal of consent (0.9% of patients).

## Recruitment

The first patient was enrolled on 21 June 1999; the last patient was enrolled on 10 March 2003. The statistical analysis plan (SAP), version 1.0 is dated on 11 February 2009. The Study cut-off date was 04 March 2009 with a median follow-up time of 77 months (presented as the final primary efficacy analysis).

## Conduct of the study

The originally planned interim efficacy analysis after 3 years of follow-up was not performed because the number of events was too small for a meaningful analysis.

Two interim efficacy analyses were performed in December 2007 and April 2008; the latter one was an updated analysis. The purpose of these analyses was to present the 5 year follow-up analysis results at the  2008 American Society  of  Clinical  Oncology (ASCO).  Two  other  interim  efficacy  summaries  were performed in May 2006 and May 2007 that were not intended for submission and were for internal data review only.

The following protocol amendments were performed:

About 97% of the receptor-positive subjects in each treatment arm received tamoxifen.

More than 50% of patients in each treatment group received adjuvant radiotherapy (TAC: 57.3%, FAC: 51.2%),  consisting  mostly  of  patients  who  had  undergone  breast-conserving  surgery  (TAC:  53.2%, FAC: 47.4%), but few who had undergone mastectomy (TAC: 4.1%, FAC: 3.8%).

## Numbers analysed

A  total  of  1060  patients  were  randomized  per  protocol.  Seventeen  (17)  patients  were  subsequently found to  be  ineligible  (TAC:  13;  FAC:  4).  Nine  (9)  patients  were  not  treated  (TAC:  8;  FAC:  1)  and 4 patients were not treated with study medication as randomized (TAC: 3; FAC: 1). Three (3) patients did  not  have  baseline  or  postbaseline  efficacy  assessments,  and  2  patients  had  at  least  1  positive lymph node.

a  All randomized patients were included in baseline characteristics and efficacy analysis (ITT population).

b  Excluded patients who had major protocol deviations c  All patients who received study treatment (safety population)

d  One patient randomized to FAC actually received TAC in the first cycle and is therefore analyzed in the TAC treatment group for safety analyses.  Three patients randomized to TAC received TAF and were analyzed in the TAC treatment group, as randomized.

e  Four TAC patients withdrew consent, 3 TAC patients withdrew for 'other' reasons, 1 TAC patient withdrew due to a deviation from the protocol, and for 1 FAC patient the reason for no treatment was missing.

All  1060  randomized  patients  were  included  in  the  efficacy  analysis  (ITT  population).  However, 9 patients did not receive any study treatment, 8 (1.5%) in the TAC group and 1 (0.2%) in the FAC group. The reasons for not being treated were withdrawal of consent (4), deviation from the protocol (1), 'other' (3), and missing (1). Three (3) patients randomized to the TAC group received TAF not according to the protocol, and 1 patient (Patient No. 00916) who was randomized to the FAC group received TAC in the first cycle and FAC in the remaining 5 cycles, not according to the protocol. This patient was analyzed for efficacy in the FAC group and for safety in the TAC group. The 3 TAF patients were analyzed in the TAC treatment group as randomized. Slightly more patients were treated with TAC  compared  with  FAC.  This  was  mainly  due  to  chance  because  randomization  was  stratified  by centers,  and  the  large  number  (N  =  55)  of  centers  carried  a  chance  of  slight  imbalances.  For  the purposes  of  efficacy  analyses,  patients  in  the  ITT  population  were  analyzed  according  to  the randomization group to which they were assigned (TAC: 539; FAC: 521).

Overall Survival (OS)

At the cut-off date of 04 March 2009, and with a greater than 5 year follow-up time (median follow-up time was 6 years and 5 months), 60 (5.7%) patients had died (TAC: 26 [4.8%]; FAC: 34 [6.5%]). No significant  association  was  observed  between  treatment  and  OS  (HR  of  TAC  vs.  FAC  =  0.758, 95% CI = 0.454, 1.263; p=0.2853).

## Quality of Life

A baseline evaluable QLQ-C30 questionnaire was available for 941 (88.8%) of the 1060 randomized patients. A baseline evaluable QLQ-BR23 questionnaire was available for 931 (87.8%) patients.

Compliance with the QLQ-C30 questionnaires was similar in both treatment groups, with a decline from baseline (TAC: 87.6%; FAC: 90.0%) to Cycle 6 (TAC: 71.1%; FAC: 74.1%) and to follow-up 8 (TAC: 25.4%; FAC: 26.3%).

Compliance with QLQ-BR23 questionnaires was similar in both treatment groups, with a decline from baseline (TAC: 86.1%; FAC: 89.6%) to Cycle 6 (TAC: 70.7%; FAC: 73.7%) and to follow-up 8 (TAC: 25.2%; FAC: 26.5%).

Baseline  QOL  score  was  71  in  both  treatment  groups  (Table  11),  and  both  groups  reported  a deterioration  of  QOL  during  treatment  (i.e.,  until  last  cycle).  The  deterioration  over  time  was statistically  significant  for  TAC  compared  with  FAC  (p  =  0.0007).  The  evolution  over  time  was  also statistically significant (p &lt;0.0001).

The  reduction  in  QOL  was  transient.  The  GHS/QOL  score  reached  a  minimum  at  Cycle  6,  with  an estimated  treatment  difference  of  5.83  points  (TAC:  54.35;  FAC:  60.18).  The  QOL  scores  in  both treatment groups returned to the baseline value as of the second follow-up 2 visit. The GHS scores were comparable between the 2 treatment groups during follow-up visits.

Both groups reported a deterioration of QOL during treatment (i.e., until last cycle). The deterioration over time was statistically  significant  for  TAC  compared  with  FAC  (p  =  0.0007).  The  evolution  over time  was  also  statistically  significant  (p &lt;0.0001).  There  was  no  significant  treatment  by  time interaction (interaction test p=0.1762).

The  reduction  in  QOL  was  transient.  The  GHS/QOL  score  reached  a  minimum  at  Cycle  6,  with  an estimated  treatment  difference  of  5.83  points  (TAC:  54.35;  FAC:  60.18).  The  QOL  scores  in  both treatment groups returned to the baseline value as of the second follow-up 2 visit. The GHS scores were comparable between the 2 treatment groups during follow-up visits.

## Discussion on the Clinical Efficacy

The  international  consensus  panel  meeting  in  St. Gallen  in 1998  defined  women  with  operable node-negative breast cancer to have a high risk of relapse if they met the following criteria:

- -Tumour size greater than 2 cm and/or
- -Negative ER and PR and/or
- -Age less than 35 years.
- -Grade 2 to 3 (histological or nuclear, whichever is greatest) and/or

Considering that, more than 25% of node-negative patients treated with FAC had recurrent disease at 10 years, in June 1999, the GEICAM 9805 trial was initiated to compare FAC with TAC in patients with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer as defined by the 1998 St. Gallen criteria. Tamoxifen therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was  indicated  as  a  post-chemotherapy  intervention  for  all  patients  with  hormone-sensitive  breast cancer.

Meanwhile,  the  adjuvant  treatment  selection  algorithm  for  the  management  of  early  breast  cancer radically changed during the last decade. As a consequence and according to the most recent concepts, the  benefit  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  clear  for  triple  negative  patients  and  for  HER2  positive disease. For the latter chemotherapy is given with or preceding Herceptin. While, for patients with ER positive, HER2 negative disease the decision for adjuvant chemotherapy is most difficult.

TAC dosage and schedule is similar to the one used for patient with node positive breast cancer (study TAX 316). Only the duration infusion for cyclophosphamide was lengthened from 5 to 15 minutes in order  to  improve  tolerance.  Anthracycline  based  regimens  are  viewed  as  standard  therapies  among several other regimens. Therefore, the comparator FAC was considered acceptable.

Based on the efficacy analyses presented, with a median follow-up time of 6 years and 5 months TAC was associated with a 32% relapse risk reduction compared with FAC (HR = 0.676, 95% CI = 0.493-0.926), p=0.014. When components of the composite DFS endpoint are taken into consideration, it appeared that a difference between TAC vs. FAC was observed in terms of secondary primary malignancies (2.4 % vs. 5.0%) and local breast cancer relapse (0.7% vs. 3.3%), but not in terms of distant metastases (7.4% vs. 8.3%).

To  assess  validity  of  the  primary  endpoint  (DFS)  and  the  consistency  of  the  relapse  assessments across treatment  groups,  a  time  to event  analysis was  performed,  including  presentation  of Kaplan-Meier curves. The pattern of follow-up median time from randomization to physical examinations, mammogram, chest imaging, abdominal imaging, and bone imaging, respectively, was comparable between treatment groups (data not shown).

All subgroups analyses of DFS were consistent with the overall result. All estimated HR for subgroups consistently  favoured  TAC  over  FAC.  The  effect  of  TAC  vs.  FAC  appeared  to  be  more  significant  in patients having breast-conserving surgery (HR 0.53, 95%-CI 0.33-0.86) or patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy (HR 0.53, 95%-CI 0.33-0.83). However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions based on the subgroup analyses presented.

The  pivotal  trial  included  patients  corresponding  to  the  standard  definition  of  high-risk  for  relapse (1998 St Gallen criteria) at the time where the trial was initiated (June 1999). Considering the most recent  2009  St  Gallen  consensus  conference,  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  the  mainstay  treatment  of patients with triple negative early breast cancer. In study GEICAM this population is represented by 183 patients. However, in study GEICAM9805, the subgroup analysis on this population is underpowered to draw any firm conclusions.

No difference in OS was observed. The lack of a significant difference may be due to the small number of  events 26 (4.82%) under TAC and 34 (6.53%) under FAC). The MAH committed to submit more mature OS data when available.

Due to the open design of the study, the importance of the observed results in terms of QOL data was considered to be limited.

A total of 4 unplanned interim efficacy analyses were performed. The CHMP was concerned that the single pivotal trial for this application may lack robustness and the final statistical significance of the proposed  conclusion  may  not  be  convincing  (see  Points  to  Consider  on  Application  with  1.  Metaanalyses; 2. One Pivotal study, CPMP/EWP/2330/99). The MAH was requested to provide reassurance on the validity of the reported results. Although the methodological weaknesses were acknowledged, the CHMP concluded that in view of the supportive evidence and the overall coherent results, this did not constitute a major issue.

There are limited data available in patients &gt; 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. This is adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Essential prophylactic anti-emetic treatment was well planned in both arms. The oral dexamethasone premedication regimen is well specified in the protocol and is accordance with the proposed SPC. The protocol  planned  compulsory  prophylactic  antibiotic  therapy  for  the  TAC  arm.  However,  no  similar recommendation is specified in the SPC.

A primary prophylactic administration of G-CSF was introduced through protocol amendment and this is reflected in the SPC (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 1.2.4 Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Of the 1060 patients randomized, 1051 were evaluable for safety, according to the treatment actually received (TAC: 532; FAC: 519).

## Adverse events

All the patients (100%) in both arm experienced at least 1 Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE).

There were more patients with Grade 3-4 TEAEs and SAEs in the TAC group as shown in Table 17 below. Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were also more frequently reported in the TAC group compared to the FAC group.

TEAEs regardless of causal relationship during chemotherapy are presented in table 18 below. For all grades of severity,  the incidence  rates  of  TEAEs  were  higher  by ≥ 10% in the TAC treatment group compared  with  the  FAC  treatment  group  for:  asthenia,  diarrhoea,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  peripheral edema, and febrile neutropenia. The incidence rate of peripheral sensory neuropathy was approximately double in TAC patients compared with FAC group.

The  most  common  Grade  3  to  4  events  in  the  TAC  treatment  group  were:  asthenia,  neutropenia, nausea, stomatitis, and vomiting.

Haematological  TEAEs  were  more  frequent  in  the  TAC  group  (anaemia,  thrombocytopenia  and neutropenia, febrile neutropenia).

After 202 patients had been enrolled in the study, 33 patients had experienced serious haematological TEAEs, with 29.6% of TAC patients experiencing febrile neutropenia versus 0% of FAC patients.

Consequently, an amendment (Amendment No, 3, 18 July 2000) made primary prophylaxis with G-CSF mandatory for TAC patients. Before use of G-CSF became mandatory in the TAC patients, incidence of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was very high (93.7%, 25.2% and 12.6% respectively).  After  protocol  amendment and systematic administration of G-CSF, incidence of these events decreased to 32.1%, 5.5% and 5.0%.

Average incidence of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection remains higher in the TAC  group  compared  to  the  FAC  group  (44.9%  vs.  13.3%;  9.6%  vs.  2.3%  and  6.6%  vs.  2.7% respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding TEAEs related to treatment during chemotherapy for all grades of severity, the incidence rates of the following related TEAEs were higher by ≥ 10% in the TAC treatment group compared to the FAC treatment group: asthenia  (TAC:  71.4%;  FAC:  57.8%),  diarrhoea  (TAC:  26.3%;  FAC:  12.1%), myalgia (TAC: 19.4%; FAC: 2.1%), febrile neutropenia (TAC: 17.9%; FAC: 4.0%), arthralgia (TAC: 16.4%; FAC: 4.2%), and peripheral edema (TAC: 16.4%; FAC: 2.9%). The incidence rate of peripheral sensory neuropathy was more than double in TAC patients compared to FAC patients (TAC: 14.7%; FAC: 6.4%).

TEAEs into the follow-up period included TEAEs which occurred during the chemotherapy period and persisted into the follow-up period and TEAEs that started or worsened during the follow-up period. TEAEs were considered as they 'did not resolve' if the last follow-up entry for that TEAE reported the outcome  as  'TEAE  did  not  resolve'.    TEAEs  were  considered  resolved  only  if  resolution  was documented.  Absence of reporting a previously unresolved TEAE at a subsequent follow-up was not considered documentation of resolution. Patients were considered 'lost to follow-up' when so identified on the CRF 'end of chemotherapy' or 'follow-up' pages.

In total, 33 patients in the FAC arm and 43 patients in the TAC arm had TEAEs that did not resolve in follow-up. TEAEs not resolved in multiple patients during follow-up, with a frequency at least two times greater in one treatment group compared to the other treatment group are summarized as follows:

- -Prevalent in the TAC group: amenorrhea (13 patients in TAC, 5 patients in FAC), alopecia (7 patients in  TAC,  1  patient  in  FAC),  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (6 patients  in  TAC,  2 patients  in  FAC), asthenia (4 patients in TAC, 2 patients in FAC), lymphoedema (4 patients in TAC, 1 patient in FAC), arrhythmia  (3 patients  in  TAC,  no  patients  in  FAC),  and  hyperhydrosis  (2  patients  in  TAC,  no patients in FAC).  One of the 3 TAC patients (patient 00923) who had arrhythmia at the follow up 3 visit  was  also  diagnosed  with  grade  2  goiter  since  her  follow  up  2  visit;  no  other  details  were reported for the other two TAC patients (patients 00319 and 00650) with reported arrhythmia.
- -Prevalent in the FAC group: menstruation irregular (6 patients in FAC, 1 patient in TAC), hot flush (5 patients in FAC, 2 patients in TAC), bone pain (3 patients in FAC, no patients in TAC), and nail disorder (2 patients in FAC, no patients in TAC).

Among TEAEs not resolved at follow-up, there was one serious adverse event (SAE) of Herpes zoster in the TAC group.  In 4 additional cases, assessment of seriousness was not reported (lymphoedema and radiation  skin  injury  in  FAC  group;  amenorrhea  and  biopsy  endometrium  normal  in  TAC  in  TAC patients).  All the other reported TEAEs persisting in follow-up were considered non serious.

All the persisting TEAEs had a severity Grade 1-2 (when reported), except for the following Grade 3 adverse events in TAC patients: arrhythmia, neutropenia, pain, and thrombocytopenia.

A total of 23 and 18 patients were considered lost to follow-up in the TAC and FAC groups respectively. The median duration of follow-up in these patients prior to being lost was greater than 2.5 years.

## Serious adverse events / deaths / other significant events

## Serious Adverse Events

There were significantly more SAEs in the TAC group compared to the FAC group during chemotherapy (22.4%  vs.  4.2%).  Study  drug  related  SAEs  were  also  more  frequently  reported  in  the  TAC  group compared to the FAC group (20.3 vs. 3.3).

| One Grade 3-4 serious TEAE related to study treatment | 2 (0.4)           | 2 (0.4)           |

The most frequent non haematological serious TEAEs reported during chemotherapy in both treatment groups were diarrhoea (1.7% vs. 0.6%), nausea, and vomiting (1.3% vs. 0.2% each).

Serious TEAEs of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were approximately 7 fold more frequent in the TAC group (15.6% vs. 2.7% and 5.3% vs. 0.6% respectively).

After  primary  G-CSF  prophylaxis  became  mandatory  in  the  TAC  group,  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs, decreased from 45% to 16.4% but remains higher than in the FAC group.

CHMP variation assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among the 25 TAC patients who died, 19 died due to complications of breast cancer. Of the remaining 6  deaths,  1  patient  died  from  second  primary  malignancy  (colon  cancer)  and  1  patient  with controlateral breast cancer died from massive pulmonary thromboembolism, 1additional patient died from thromboembolism, 2 died from myocardial infarction, and one 54-year-old patient with a medical history  of  arthrosis,  hypertension  and  thrombosis  of  lower  extremities  (during  study),  died  during sleeping 3 years and 10 months of the last study treatment.

In  the  FAC  group  1  out  of  the  34  reported  deaths  was  assessed  as  study  drug  related.  In  the  TAC group, all the deaths were assessed as not related to study drug

It is to be noted that of the 6 TAC patients who died due to another cause than disease progression, 2 died from myocardial infarction and one 54-year-old patient without any significant cardiac medical history  had  a  sudden  death.  In  the  last  patient,  cardiac  death  cannot  be  excluded.  Overall,  cardiac death can be suspected in 3 of the 6 TAC patients. However, given that cardiotoxicity has not been adequately monitored, no conclusion can be drawn from the provided data

## Other significant TEAEs:

The following significant TEAEs were discussed by the MAH:

##  Neutropenic complications, infection and G-CSF use

After 202 patients had been enrolled in the study, 33 patients had experienced serious TEAEs, with 29.6% of TAC patients experiencing febrile neutropenia versus 0% of FAC patients.

Consequently, an amendment (Amendment No, 3, 18 July 2000) made primary prophylaxis with GCSF  mandatory  for  TAC  patients.  Before  use  of  G-CSF  became  mandatory  in  the  TAC  patients, incidence  of  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  infection  was  very  high  (93.7%, 25.2% and 12.6% respectively). After protocol amendment and systematic administration of G-CSF, incidence of these events decreased to 32.1%, 5.5% and 5.0%

However, these events remains more frequent in the TAC group compared to the FAC group (44.9% vs. 13.3%; 9.6% vs. 2.3% and 6.6% vs. 2.7% respectively).

##  Cardiac TEAEs and hypertensive/hypotensive TEAEs

As a requirement of the protocol, LVEF was measured at baseline only in patients with suspected cardiac dysfunction, and during the study when considered clinically relevant by the Investigator. A total of 13 (2.4%) of patients in the TAC group and 2.7% in the FAC group had their LVEF assessed. Decrease  in  LVEF  below  lower  normal  limit  was  identified  in  2  patients  from  the  TAC  group. Although,  routine  assessments  were  not  performed,  there  were  more  cardiac  events  in  the  TAC group (3.8%) compared to the FAC group 12 (2.2%).

In  particular  regarding  cardiac  TEAEs  in  total,  all-grade  cardiac  failure,  congestive  heart  failure (CHF), or cardiomyopathy were reported in 4 patients in the TAC arm and 5 patients in the FAC arm, while Grade 3-4 cardiac failure, CHF, or cardiomyopathy were reported in 1 patient in the TAC arm and 2 patients in the FAC arm.

To further provide assessment of the long-term risk of cardiotoxicity in patients receiving the TAC regimen, data are presented below from TAX316, a study similar to GEICAM 9805 but in which the adjuvant TAC regimen was compared to FAC in node-positive breast cancer patients. Evaluation of the  long  term  cardiac  risk  with  the  same  TAC  regimen  is  a  post-marketing  commitment  for  the protocol  TAX 316.  Interim  results  from  the  cardiac  monitoring  in  study  TAX 316  demonstrate  the following  data  regarding  cardiovascular  toxicity:  a  total  of  21  TAC-treated  patients  and  14  FACtreated patients had developed Grade 3-4 CHF (Table 23).

As of the first Safety Update Report (SUR) of March 2005, there were 17 cumulative reports of CHF in  the  TAC  arm,  and  7  in  the  FAC  arm,  representing  a  relative  increase  of  0.6%  and  0.5%, respectively, from the April 2003 safety cut off date for the CSR.  Between March 2005 and March 2009, a modest increase in the incidence of CHF (0.5% in the TAC arm, and 0.9% in the FAC arm) was reported in both arms. Table 24 illustrates the time course of the cumulative reports of CHF, with 17 cases in the TAC arm in March 2005, and 4 additional TAC cases from March 2005 through March 2009.  Comparatively, the reports of CHF in the FAC arm increased from 7 to 14 during the same interval.

##  Fluid retention

Despite of compulsory prophylactic premedication for fluid retention with corticosteroid in the TAC group, the incidence of fluid retention events was 4 fold higher in the TAC group (127/532) than in the FAC group (34/519).

##  Gastrointestinal TEAEs

Nausea,  stomatitis,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  and  constipation  were  the  most  common  GI  events reported for both TAC and FAC patients,

The only gastrointestinal TEAE (all grades, regardless of causal relationship) to be reported ≥ 10% more frequently in the TAC treatment group compared with the FAC treatment group was diarrhoea. Serious  gastrointestinal  events  occurring  in  more  than  1  patient  included  diarrhoea  (TAC:  1.7%; FAC: 0.2%), nausea (TAC: 1.3%; FAC: 0.2%), vomiting (TAC: 1.3%; FAC: 0.2%), stomatitis (TAC: 0.4%;  FAC:  0),  dyspepsia  (TAC:  0.4%;  FAC:  0),  constipation  (TAC:  0.2%;  FAC:  0.2%),  and abdominal pain (TAC: 0.2%; FAC: 0.2%). Intestinal obstruction was reported in 1 patient from the TAC group.

##  Neurological TEAEs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were more than double of peripheral neuropathy TEAEs (sensory and motor) in the TAC group (15.6% and 3.4%) compared to the FAC group (7.3% and 0.4%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy is listed as very common AE in the SPC.

a As reported by the investigator.

SPM = second primary malignancies; FAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide b     Patient  00018 continued receiving TAC chemotherapy 49 days after she had been diagnosed with melanoma.

The  malignant  melanoma  and  acute  leukaemia  reported  respectively  in  patients  00018  and  00740 were  recorded  as  serious  TEAEs.  The  melanoma  in  patient  00018  was  also  reported  as  an  efficacy endpoint. Regarding the ' colon cancer ' reported in patient 00693, and assessed by the investigator as not related to chemotherapy, however, a laparotomy was performed to confirm a tentative diagnosis of colon cancer, which was reported as a TEAE (' colon cancer ').  The tentative diagnosis was ultimately not confirmed, and thus the ' colon cancer ' was not reported as an efficacy endpoint in this patient.

##  Renal function

The  incidence  rate  of  renal  and  urinary  TEAEs  and  laboratory  abnormalities  were  comparable between the 2 treatment groups. No serious renal TEAEs or treatment discontinuations because of renal TEAEs were reported.

##  Hepatic function

The  overall  incidence  of  ALT  and  AST  elevations  was  lower  in  the  TAC  group  (45.3%  and  34%) compared with the FAC group (54.1% and 44.9%); however, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 ALT and AST elevations, was slightly higher in the TAC group (1.7 % vs. 1.3% and 1.1% vs. 0.2%).

The overall incidence of total bilirubin elevation was higher in the TAC group (4.1%) compared with the FAC group (2.9%).

There were 2 patients in the TAC treatment group who experienced serious liver/biliary toxicity.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Twenty-five (4.7%) patients in the TAC group had study treatment discontinued because of 44 TEAEs versus  4 (0.8%)  patients  due  to  7  TEAEs  in  the  FAC  group.  Haematological  TEAEs  are  the  most frequently reported causes for treatment withdrawal (14 out of 25): febrile neutropenia (1.5% vs. 0% in the FAC group) and neutropenia/neutrophil count (1.1% vs. 0% in the FAC group). One patient from the TAC group was withdrawn because of cardiomyopathy.

(b) Six (6) patients in the TAC treatment group experienced TEAEs which Investigators indicated led to treatment discontinuation.  In  these  patients,  this  indication  was  inconsistent  with  the  reason  given  for  the  end  of chemotherapy treatment ('consent withdrawn', 'other deviation from protocol', and 'received maximum number of cycles'

(c) Fever in the absence of infection (not a MedDRA PT) was reported on a CRF page for febrile neutropenia. Pyrexia was reported as a TEAE.

(d) Neutropenia reported by the Investigator as a TEAE.

## Safety meta-analysis of trials GEICAM 9805 and TAX 316

During assessment the MAH was requested to present a safety meta-analysis as basis for the update of SPC section 4.8. The clinically important TEAEs from the two studies GEICAM 9805 and TAX 316 were grouped  by  body  system,  presented  side-to-side  and  as  integrated  data  in  the  Table  31  (Clinically important treatment-related TEAEs). The cutoff date for the data from the GEICAM 9805 study was 04 March 2009, and the cut off date for the data from the TAX 316 study was 02 June 2009. TEAEs were consistently coded using the MedDRA version 8.1.

The clinical importance of these TEAEs was determined with respect to the TAC regimen, based upon incidence  (&gt;10%),  severity,  or  clinical  impact  of  the  TEAEs.  The  MAH  outlined  that  apparent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

differences  between  the  safety  data  from  the  study  TAX 316  (adjuvant  TAC  in  node-positive  breast cancer)  compared  to  GEICAM9805  (adjuvant  TAC  in  node-negative  breast  cancer)  should  be interpreted  with  caution,  because  the  two  studies  were  different  regarding  geographical  regions, populations  (e.g.,  overall  post-menopausal  status:  47.5%  in  GEICAM  9805  and  33.4%  in  TAX316; overall  ER+/PR+  status:  49.1%  in  GEICAM  9805  and  60.6%  in  TAX316),  and  study  conduct  (e.g., primary prophylaxis with filgrastim -granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) [G-CSF] was required only in  all  TAC  patients  in  GEICAM  9805  after  the  first  111  TAC  patients,  while  it  was  not  permitted  in TAX316).

The  integrated  safety  data  describe  the  overall  safety  profile  of  the  TAC  regimen  as  adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer (node-positive and node-negative) and the information resulting from this integrated analysis has been translated in table 'Adjuvant therapy with TAXOTERE 75 mg/m² in combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  in  patients  with  node-positive  (TAX  316)  and node-negative (GEICAM 9805) breast cancer - pooled data' in section 4.8 of the SPC.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

In study GEICAM 9805, patients from TAC group, experienced higher frequency of TEAEs. There were significantly more SAEs in the TAC group compared to the FAC group during chemotherapy (22.4% vs. 4.2%). Study drug related SAEs were also more frequently reported in the TAC group compared to the FAC group (20.3 vs. 3.3). Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were also more frequently reported in the TAC group compared to the FAC group.

Haematological toxicity was clearly higher in the TAC arm, but was managed with systematic G-CSF and compulsory prophylactic antibiotiotherapy.

The most frequent non haematological serious TEAEs reported during chemotherapy in both treatment groups were diarrhoea (1.7% vs. 0.6%), nausea, and vomiting (1.3% vs. 0.2% each).

In  particular,  based  on  the  provided  safety  data  from  GEICAM  study,  it  was  not  possible  to  assess cardiac  toxicity  including  asymptomatic  decrease  in  LVEF.  Indeed,  despite  obvious  risk  of  cardiac toxicity  due  to  associated  anthracycline  in  the  TAC  regimen  and  potential  decrease  in  LVEF  with docetaxel, the study protocol was  amended  not  being  able to detect asymptomatic  cardiac dysfunctions.

Due to the lack of data on cardiotoxicity from study GEICAM 9805, data from study TAX 316 were provided. Cardiac toxicity was higher in the TAC group compared to the FAC group in study Tax 316.

In total, all-grade cardiac failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), or cardiomyopathy were reported in 4 patients  in  the  TAC  arm  and  5  patients  in  the  FAC  arm,  while  Grade  3-4  cardiac  failure,  CHF,  or cardiomyopathy were reported in 1 patient in the TAC arm and 2 patients in the FAC arm.

Overall, according to the TAX 316 data, as of the first SUR of March 2005, there were 17 cumulative reports (2.3%) of CHF in the TAC arm, and 7 in the FAC arm (1%). Between March 2005 and March 2009,  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  CHF  was  reported  in  both  arms.  As  of  March  2009,  2.8%  of patients  from  the  TAC  group  (21)  and  1.9%  of  patients  from  the  FAC  group  (14)  had  grade  3  or 4 cardiac heart failure. The risk of cardiac failure is already addressed in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC.

A total of 28 patients in the FAC arm had a diagnosis of SPM as an efficacy endpoint, and 16 patients in  the  TAC  arm  had  a  diagnosis  of  SPM  as  an  efficacy  endpoint  (14  patients).  The  histopathological diagnoses seem to be similar between the two treatment groups. Only 3 SPM were reported as TEAEs in the TAC group (0 in the FAC group):

The risk of delayed myelodysplasia and or myeloid leukaemia in the TAC treated patients is already addressed in the SPC. Given the high hematotoxicity of the TAC regimen requiring the use of G-CSF, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia and or myeloid leukaemia should be monitored.

As of 04 March 2009, 25 (4.7%) TAC patients and 34 (6.6%) FAC patients died, all during the followup period. No patient died within 30 days of the last study treatment. In the FAC group 1 out of the 34 reported  deaths  was  assessed  as  study  drug  related.  In  the  TAC  group,  all  the  deaths  were assessed as not related to study drug.

Overall, docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is more toxic than the FAC regimen particularly regarding haematotoxicity. Overall, the TAC regimen was associated to a higher incidence  of  haematological  (mainly  neutropenic  events),  cardiac,  neurological,  gastrointestinal  and fluid retention events.

The safety profile of docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in node negative breast cancer is not unexpected, but should be put in balance with efficacy data in this indication.

## 1.2.5 Risk Management Plan

As  part  of  the  variation  application  the  MAH  submitted  a  justification  why  for  this  extension  of indication no Risk Management Plan is required. This justification was considered acceptable.

## 2. Benefit-Risk Balance

The  present  application  is  supported  by  one  pivotal,  non-blinded,  randomized,  Phase III  study (GEICAM 9805 /TAX.ES1.301),  designed  to  compare  DFS  (disease-free  survival)  after adjuvant chemotherapy following primary surgery for breast cancer in high-risk node-negative patients receiving one of the following adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimens:

- TAC (Taxotere, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide),
- FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide).

In breast cancer adjuvant setting, surgery could result in a cure of the malignant disease. However, many  patients  will relapse and  can  die  from  their cancer. This is related to silent residual diseases/micrometastases  not  eliminated  by  surgery.  This  silent  disease  in  relation  to  the  removed tumour can be local or distant (metastases).

An adjuvant medical treatment is expected to suppress or eliminate this undetectable residual disease avoiding (or delaying) relapses. This delay in relapses is per se a clinical benefit since it provides a prolonged time free from toxic treatments and major health concerns to the patients.

Nevertheless, the benefit of an adjuvant therapy is directly related to the risk of relapse and patients in whom a relapse is unlikely should not have proposed chemotherapy whereas patients at high risk of relapse may be the ideal target of this treatment.

The  adjuvant  treatment  selection  algorithm  for  the  management  of  early  breast  cancer  radically changed during the last decade. As a consequence, and according to the most recent concepts, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is clear for triple negative patients and for HER2 positive disease. For the latter, chemotherapy is given with or preceding Herceptin. For patients with ER positive, HER2 negative disease, the decision for adjuvant chemotherapy is more difficult.

## Benefits

##  Beneficial effects

Adjuvant  chemotherapy  benefit  should  be  demonstrated  in  terms  of  DFS  translating  ultimately  into beneficial effect on survival. At least, demonstration of the absence of negative effects on survival is expected.

Data from this multicenter open label randomized trial support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment  of  patients  with  operable  node-negative  breast  cancer  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy. 1060 patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  TAXOTERE  75 mg/m 2   administered  1-hour  after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2  and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2  (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node negative breast cancer patients with high risk of relapse according  to  1998  St.  Gallen  criteria  (tumour  size  &gt;2cm  and/or  negative  ER  and  PR  and/or  high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and/or age &lt;35 years). Median duration of follow-up was 77 months.  Significantly  longer  disease-free  survival  for  the  TAC  arm  compared  to  the  FAC  arm  was observed. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). Overall survival (OS) was also longer in the TAC arm with TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard  ratio = 0.76,  95%  CI  (0.46-1.26,  p = 0.29).  However,  the  distribution  of  OS  was  not significantly different between the 2 groups.

##  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

A total of 4 unplanned interim efficacy analyses were performed. The CHMP was concerned that the single pivotal trial for this application may lack robustness and the final statistical significance of the proposed conclusion may  not be convincing. Although the methodological weaknesses were acknowledged, the CHMP concluded that in view of the supportive evidence and the overall coherent results, this did not constitute a major issue.

According to the most recent clinical standards (St Gallen 2009 conference), one part of the population included in study GEICAM 9805 would not be treated at all today with adjuvant chemotherapy. Until further data become available, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy  according  to  internationally  established  criteria  for  primary  therapy  of  early  breast cancer.

OS data are still premature. As a preliminary assessment it can, however, be stated that TAC is a least not worse than FAC in terms of OS. The MAH committed to submit mature OS data as soon as this becomes available.

## Risks

##  Unfavourable effects

TAC regimen was authorised for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node- positive breast cancer in 2004. This indication is based on a single pivotal phase III study, TAX316. The safety profile of docetaxel associated with AC is as expected. However in comparison with FAC, TAC safety profile is expected to be worse in terms of haematotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, colitis, and leukaemia.

Regarding study GEICAM 9805 in the adjuvant treatment of patients with node negative breast cancer, overall, docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is more toxic than the FAC regimen particularly regarding haematotoxicity.

Haematological TEAEs were more frequent in the TAC group (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia).

Systematic  use  of  G-CSF  in  the  group  TAC  reduced  occurrence  of  neutropenic  events.  However, incidence  of  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  infection  remains  higher  in  the  TAC group  compared  to  the  FAC  group  (44.9%  vs.  13.3%;  9.6%  vs.  2.3%  and  6.6%  vs.  2.7% respectively).

##  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Concerning the pre-clinical assessment, several issues regarding the Environmental Risk Assessment, remain. Therefore, a commitment from the MAH to report in due dates the responses to the additional questions, is necessary.

On a clinical view, despite obvious risk of cardiac toxicity due to associated anthracycline in the TAC regimen and potential decrease in LVEF with docetaxel, the study protocol was amended in order to not detect asymptomatic cardiac dysfunctions. This protocol amendment remains not comprehensible and should have been justified. However, the risk of cardiotoxicity is addressed in the proposed SPC for this variation.

When second primary malignancies occurred prior to Breast Cancer Relapse (BCR), they were reported as DFS events. The number of Second Primary Malignancies (SPM) reported as events in terms of the primary  endpoint  was  higher  in  the  FAC  group  in  comparison  to  the  TAC  group.  Given  the  high haematotoxicity of the TAC regimen requiring the use of G-CSF, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia and or myeloid leukaemia should be monitored.

Currently there is a trend to an improved OS, the uncertainties for this endpoint, resulting from the large 95%-CIs and the low number of events observed, however, are large.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

##  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The CHMP questioned whether the selection criteria in this study correspond to a population that could be  expected  to  benefit  from  an  adjuvant  chemotherapy.  Indeed,  according  to  recent  clinical recommendation (Goldhirsch et al., 2009) one part of the population recruited in the pivotal trial would not be treated at all with adjuvant chemotherapy. The adjuvant treatment selection algorithm for the management of early breast cancer radically changed during the last decade. As a consequence and according  to  the  most  recent  concepts,  the  benefit  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  clear  for  triple negative  patients  and  for  HER2  positive  disease.  For  the  latter,  chemotherapy  is  given  with  or preceding Herceptin. Patients with ER positive, HER2 negative disease constitute a group for whom the decision for adjuvant chemotherapy is most difficult. Patients with small primary tumours (pT1a pN0 and  ER  negative)  might  avoid  adjuvant  systemic  therapy.  There  is  no  agreement  on  a  standard chemotherapy  regimen  for  any  disease  subset.  Until  conclusive  data  become  available,  adjuvant treatment  should  be  restricted  to  patients  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy  according  to  the  most recent internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer.

The CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of TAC in the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable  node  negative  breast  cancer  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy  according  to  current  clinical guidance is positive. Until further data become available, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer.
