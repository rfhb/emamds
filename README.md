# EMA EPARs as Markdown documents

This is a repository of markdown files, created from converting PDF files in EPARs at https://www.ema.europa.eu/. 

For conversion, docling was used with rapidocr and otherwise standard settings. 

The sub-directories indicate the type of document of those included in EPARs. 

Markdown files included a YAML header with metadata on the original PDF file, e.g. URL and number of pages, as well as metadata on the conversion, e.g. docling version and processing time.
