Of the 55 patients who achieved CR, 7 patients had SD and 10 had PR at their initial tumour assessment and converted to CR as late as 12 months after YESCARTA infusion. Median duration of response and median overall survival have not been reached. Due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of YESCARTA, a period of B-cell aplasia is expected following treatment. Among 73 patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 40% had detectable B cells; the B cell aplasia observed in the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior therapies. Following YESCARTA treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable B cells decreased: 20% had detectable B cells at Month 3, and 22% had detectable B cells at Month 6. The initiation of B cell recovery was first noted at Month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable B- cells. This trend of B- cell recovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had detectable B- cells at Month 18, and 77% of patients had detectable B- cells at Month 24. It is important to note that patients were not required to be followed after they progressed; thus, the majority of patients with evaluable samples were responders.
