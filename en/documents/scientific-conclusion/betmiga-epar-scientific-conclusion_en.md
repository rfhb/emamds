## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

In post-marketing data, 305 cases of dizziness were reported. Two third had a compatible timeline and half  of  patients  developed  dizziness  within  7  days  of  administering  mirabegron.  Some  cases  had positive dechallenge and rechallenge. Therefore, dizziness should be included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.

An  important  number  of  constipation  cases  were  reported,  showing  disproportionality  criteria  and compatible timelines. Therefore, constipation should be included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Headache is one of the most frequent events reported with a positive timeline. 47.8% of the cases had positive  dechallenge  with  a  2.2%  positive  rechallenge.  Therefore,  headache  should  be  included  in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Several cases of diarrhoea were reported with a compatible timeline. At least 6 cases had a positive rechallenge. Therefore, diarrhoea should be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

In a cumulative review of hypertensive crisis cases, 3 of the 9 evaluable cases were associated with ischemic cardiac events: 2 with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and 1 with coronary syndrome. In  addition,  1  patient  from  the  pre-authorisation  phase  was  hospitalized  due  to  hypertensive  crisis. Therefore, despite of the limited number of cases, hypertensive crisis should be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing mirabegron were warranted.
