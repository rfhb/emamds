## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Unituxin is indicated for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months to 17 years, who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).  It is administered in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and isotretinoin.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Unituxin is restricted to hospital-use only and must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of oncological therapies.  It must be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in an environment where full resuscitation services are immediately available.

## Posology

Unituxin is to be administered by intravenous infusion over five courses at a daily dose of 17.5 mg/m 2 .  It is administered on Days 4-7 during Courses 1, 3, and 5 (each course lasting approximately 24 days) and on Days 8-11 during Courses 2 and 4 (each course lasting approximately 28 days).

The treatment regimen consists of dinutuximab, GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin, administered over six consecutive courses.  The complete dosing regimen is outlined in Table 1 and Table 2.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Unituxin in children aged less than 12 months have not yet been established.

## Method of administration

Unituxin should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. It should be administered by intravenous infusion over 10 hours.  The infusion is started at a dose rate of 0.875 mg/m 2 /h and continued at this rate for 30 minutes; the rate is then increased to 1.75 mg/m 2 /h and continued at this rate for the remainder of the infusion, if tolerated.  The infusion duration may be extended up to 20 hours to help minimise reactions during infusion (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) that do not respond adequately to other supportive measures.  The infusion must be terminated after 20 hours, even if the full dose cannot be delivered within this timeframe.

Pre-medication should always be considered before starting each infusion (see section 4.4). For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity (Grade 4) to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Allergic reactions Antihistamine premedication (e.g. hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine) should be administered by intravenous injection approximately 20 minutes before starting each dinutuximab infusion.  It is recommended that antihistamine medicinal product be repeated every 4-6 hours as required during infusion of Unituxin. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions for 4 hours after the completion of the Unituxin infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Epinephrine (adrenaline) and hydrocortisone for intravenous administration should be immediately available at the bedside during administration of dinutuximab to manage life-threatening allergic reactions.  It is recommended that treatment for such reactions include hydrocortisone administered by intravenous bolus, and epinephrine administered by intravenous bolus once every 3-5 minutes as necessary according to clinical response.

Depending on the severity of the allergic reaction, the rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Capillary leak syndrome

Capillary leak syndrome is more likely when dinutuximab is co-administered with IL-2.  It is recommended to administer oral metolazone or intravenous furosemide every 6-12 hours as required.  Supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, and albumin replacement therapy should be used as necessary according to clinical response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Characteristic symptoms and signs include hypotension, generalized oedema, ascites, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema and acute renal failure associated with hypoalbuminaemia and haemoconcentration.

## Pain

Severe pain (Grade 3 or 4) occurs most frequently during the first 4-day course of dinutuximab, often subsiding over time with subsequent courses.

For severe pain, the Unituxin infusion rate should be decreased to 0.875 mg/m 2 /hour.  Unituxin should be discontinued if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

Paracetamol should be administered orally 20 minutes prior to starting each dinutuximab infusion, and repeated every 4-6 hours as needed.  Regular dosing every 4-6 hours is recommended when IL-2 is coadministered.  If required for persistent pain, ibuprofen should be administered orally every 6 hours between doses of paracetamol.  Ibuprofen should not be administered if there is evidence of thrombocytopenia, bleeding, or renal dysfunction.

An opioid, such as morphine sulphate, is recommended to be administered by intravenous infusion prior to each dinutuximab infusion and continued as an intravenous infusion during and until 2 hours after completion of the treatment.  It is recommended that additional intravenous bolus doses of an opioid are administered as needed for treatment of pain up to once every 2 hours during the dinutuximab infusion.  If morphine is not tolerated, then fentanyl or hydromorphone may be utilised. Lidocaine may be administered as an intravenous infusion (2 mg/kg in 50 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride) over 30 minutes prior to the start of each dinutuximab infusion and continued via intravenous infusion at 1 mg/kg/h up to 2 hours after completion of the treatment.  Lidocaine infusion should be discontinued if the patient develops dizziness, perioral numbness, or tinnitus. Gabapentin may be administered at the time of starting morphine premedication, at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day.  The dose may be subsequently increased (up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day or 3600 mg/day) as needed for pain management. Hypotension Intravenous sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (10 mL/kg) should be administered over one hour just prior to the dinutuximab infusion.  If hypotension occurs, this can be repeated, or intravenous albumin or packed red blood cells can be administered as clinically indicated.  It is recommended that vasopressor therapy is also administered if necessary to restore an adequate perfusion pressure. Neurological disorders of the eye Medicinal product no longer authorised

Eye disorders may occur, especially with repeated courses (see section 4.8).  These changes usually resolve over time.  Patients should have an ophthalmic examination before initiating therapy and be monitored for visual changes.

## Hepatic dysfunction

Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended during dinutuximab immunotherapy.

## Systemic infections

Patients typically have a central venous catheter in situ and as a consequence of prior ASCT are likely to be immunocompromised during therapy, and therefore, at risk of developing systemic infection.  Patients should have no evidence of systemic infection and any identified infection should be under control before beginning therapy.

## Laboratory test abnormalities

Electrolyte abnormalities have been reported in patients who received Unituxin (see section 4.8). Electrolytes should be monitored daily during therapy with Unituxin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, and hypertension has been reported.  Supportive measures should be instituted including control of hydration status, electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, and anaemia.

## Sodium intake

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  This means it is essentially 'sodium free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.  A risk for interactions with concomitantly used medicinal products cannot be excluded.

## Corticosteroids

It is not recommended to use systemic corticosteroid medicinal products due to possible interference with immune activation which is necessary for the therapeutic action of dinutuximab.

## Intravenous immunoglobulin

It is not recommended to use intravenous immunoglobulin after ASCT.  If necessary, its use must be limited to the first 100 days after ASCT, as immunoglobulin may interfere with dinutuximab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.  Immunoglobulin must not be given within two weeks before and one week after completing each course of Unituxin.

## Pharmacokinetic interactions

No interaction studies have been performed.

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

Severe allergic reactions are more likely when dinutuximab is co-administered with IL-2.  Therefore caution should be taken when both medicinal products are combined (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of dinutuximab in pregnant women.

Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Hence, this medicinal product is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  It is recommended that women of childbearing potential use contraception for 6 months after discontinuation of treatment with Unituxin.

## Breast-feeding

Human IgG is known to be secreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the excretion of dinutuximab in human milk.  Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Unituxin.  The recommended interval time between treatment discontinuation and breastfeeding is 6 months.

## Fertility

The effects of dinutuximab on fertility in humans are unknown.  In animals, fertility studies have not been conducted; however in male and female rats, no adverse effects on reproductive organs were observed (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Unituxin has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adverse reactions reported in four clinical studies (ANBL0032, ANBL0931, CCG-0935A, and DIV-NB201) of dinutuximab in patients (N=984) with high-risk neuroblastoma are summarized in Table 5.  Adverse reactions are defined as those adverse events that occurred at a higher frequency in the dinutuximab, GMCSF, IL-2 and isotretinoin-treated group compared with the isotretinoin-treated control group during the ANBL0032 randomised, controlled, pivotal study, and that have a plausible mechanistic relationship to treatment with dinutuximab.  Originally reported terms have been coded to preferred terms (using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]).

Table 5 summarizes adverse drug reactions reported when dinutuximab was administered in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin.  As this medicinal product is used in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin, it is difficult to ascertain the causal relationship of each adverse reaction to a particular medicinal product.

The most frequently occurring (more than 30% of patients) adverse reactions reported during the neuroblastoma studies were hypotension (67 %), pain (66 %), hypersensitivity (56 %), pyrexia (53 %), urticaria (49 %), capillary leak syndrome (45 %), anaemia (45 %), hypokalaemia (41 %), platelet count decreased (40 %), hyponatraemia (37 %), alanine aminotransferase increased (35 %), decreased lymphocyte count (34%) and decreased neutrophil count (31%).  Additional adverse reactions characteristic of an allergic response were also reported - including anaphylactic reaction (18 %) and bronchospasm (4 %). Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions reported for subjects receiving dinutuximab in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin are summarised in Table 5.  These adverse reactions are presented by MedDRA system organ class and frequency.  Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100).  Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Serious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention including blood pressure support, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin included facial and upper airway oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension.  Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin infusion.  Serious anaphylactic/allergic reactions were reported in 14% of patients.  Due to overlapping signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity/allergic reactions in some cases.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Capillary leak syndrome

Capillary leak syndrome was a very common adverse reaction (45 % of patients) that occurred more frequently when Unituxin was co-administered with IL-2; it was severe (&gt; Grade 3) in 14% of patients.

## Pain

Pain typically occurred during the Unituxin infusion and was most commonly reported as abdominal pain, generalized pain, extremity pain, back pain, neuralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and arthralgia; 41% of patients suffered severe pain.  Analgesics including intravenous opioids should be administered prior to each dose of Unituxin and continued until two hours following completion of Unituxin infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 3% of patients and peripheral motor neuropathy in 2% of patients; less than 1% of patients experienced serious peripheral neuropathy.

## Laboratory test abnormalities

Electrolyte abnormalities occurring in at least 25 % of patients who received Unituxin included hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions that occur after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of dinutuximab overdose have been reported.  In clinical trials, scheduled dinutuximab doses of up to 120 mg/m 2 (60 mg/m 2 /day) have been administered with an adverse reaction profile similar to that described in section 4.8.  In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC16 Mechanism of action Dinutuximab is a monoclonal chimeric antibody composed of murine variable heavy and light chain regions and the human constant region for the heavy chain IgG1 and light chain kappa.  Dinutuximab reacts specifically with the ganglioside GD2, which is highly expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells and minimally expressed on the surface of normal human neurons, peripheral pain fibres, and skin melanocytes. Pharmacodynamic effects Dinutuximab has been shown to bind to neuroblastoma cell lines known to express GD2 in vitro.  In addition, it has been shown to induce both antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro.  Specifically, in the presence of human effector cells including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and granulocytes from normal human donors, dinutuximab was found to mediate the lysis of several neuroblastoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.  Granulocytes were found to be more effective than PBMCs in mediating dinutuximab dependent cytotoxicity of neuroblastoma cells, with enhanced cell lysis observed with the addition of GM-CSF.  Additionally, in vivo studies demonstrate that dinutuximab either alone or in combination with IL-2 can partially inhibit tumour growth in mice.  Augmentation of ADCC in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-2 provided the rationale for combining these cytokines with dinutuximab in clinical studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Non-clinical studies demonstrate that dinutuximab-induced neurotoxicity is likely due to the induction of mechanical allodynia that may be mediated by reactivity of dinutuximab with GD2 antigen located on the surface of peripheral nerve fibres and/or myelin.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

ANBL0032 was a randomised, controlled study that evaluated the effects of dinutuximab administered in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin compared with isotretinoin alone in high-risk neuroblastoma subjects.  High-risk neuroblastoma was based on the patient age (greater than 12 months) and tumour stage at diagnosis and / or the presence of biological risk factors, such as MYCN amplification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were aged 11 months to 15 years and had previously achieved at least a partial response to induction chemotherapy, followed by ASCT and radiotherapy.  Following ASCT, 226 subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to either a standard therapy arm (six courses of isotretinoin) or a dinutuximab immunotherapy arm (five courses of dinutuximab in combination with alternating GM-CSF and IL-2; combined with isotretinoin concurrently for six courses).  Dinutuximab was administered at a dose equivalent to 17.5 mg/m 2 /day on four consecutive days (Days 4-7) of Courses 1-5. GM-CSF was administered at a dose of 250 μg/m 2 /day during Courses 1, 3, and 5 and dosed daily for 14 days.  IL-2 was administered concurrently with dinutuximab as a continuous intravenous infusion for four days during Week 1 of Courses 2 and 4 at a dose of 3.0 MIU/m 2 /day, and during Week 2 of Courses 2 and 4 at a dose of 4.5 MIU/m 2 /day. During the last two weeks in each of the six courses, subjects in both the control and the dinutuximab immunotherapy arms were also given oral isotretinoin at a dose of 160 mg/m 2 /day (given as 80 mg/m 2 twice daily).

The primary efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS) defined as time from randomization to the first occurrence of relapse, progressive disease, secondary malignancy, or death. The primary intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis found an improvement in EFS associated with dinutuximab immunotherapy plus isotretinoin, as compared to isotretinoin alone.  The 2-year estimates of EFS were 66 % among subjects receiving dinutuximab immunotherapy plus isotretinoin as compared with 48 % in subjects receiving isotretinoin alone (log-rank test p = 0.033) although this difference did not reach formal statistical significance according to the pre-specified plan for interim analyses.  In addition, overall survival (OS) was evaluated with 3 years of follow-up after the EFS analysis as a secondary endpoint with a significant improvement observed among ITT subjects randomly allocated to receive dinutuximab immunotherapy plus isotretinoin as compared with isotretinoin alone.  The 3-year estimates of OS were 80 % compared with 67 % among subjects receiving dinutuximab immunotherapy plus isotretinoin and isotretinoin alone, respectively (log-rank test p = 0.0165).  Long-term overall survival was evaluated with 5 years of follow up after the EFS analysis and continued to demonstrate a survival advantage for patients who received dinutuximab immunotherapy compared to those who received isotretinoin alone.  The 5 year estimates of OS were 74 % for dinutuximab immunotherapy compared to 57 % for isotretinoin alone (log-rank test p = 0.030). Subgroup analyses of EFS and OS response indicated that patients with minimal residual disease, DNA hyperploidy, and those having received a purged bone marrow may not have benefited from dinutuximab immunotherapy. Immunogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  Data from 409 subjects participating in several neuroblastoma studies and having samples available for the determination of human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACA) demonstrated that 71 (17%) developed binding antibodies and 15 (4%) developed a neutralising antibody response.  Plasma concentrations of dinutuximab, especially trough levels, tended to be lower in patients with HACA.  There was no apparent correlation between the development of these antibodies and allergic reactions.

The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay and for these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dinutuximab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Unituxin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in neuroblastoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Distribution

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab were evaluated in a clinical study of Unituxin in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin.  In this study, 27 children with high-risk neuroblastoma (age: 3.9 ± 1.9 years) received up to 5 cycles of Unituxin at 17.5 mg/m 2 /day as an intravenous infusion over 10 to 20 hours for 4 consecutive days every 28 days.  The mean (± standard deviation) maximum plasma concentration observed after the 4 th infusion was 11.5 (± 2.3) mcg/mL.  In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state was estimated at 5.2 L.

## Biotransformation

Dinutuximab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes.  Classical biotransformation studies have not been performed.

## Elimination

The geometric mean clearance was estimated at 0.025 L/hr and increased with body size.  The terminal halflife was estimated at 10 (+ 6) days.

Dinutuximab was administered to cynomolgous monkeys resulting in effects on the cardiovascular system, which consisted of moderate increases in blood pressure (one of three animals) and heart rate (two of three animals).  No direct effects on electrocardiogram parameters or on the respiratory system were observed.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis conducted on all clinical data available suggests that the disposition of dinutuximab is not altered by age, race, gender, concomitant medications (IL-2, GM-CSF) and the presence of capillary leak syndrome, renal or hepatic impairment. However, the presence of HACA appears to increase the clearance of dinutuximab by approximately 60%. 5.3 Preclinical safety data General toxicology Dinutuximab (or the murine monoclonal antibody 14.18) has been administered to mice, rabbits, rats, and dogs in single- or repeat-dose regimens that exceed the dose that is used clinically.  Findings of note included treatment related adverse reactions of the liver in rats (characterized by centrilobular congestion, abnormal cell division, hepatocellular necrosis and pericentral vein/interlobular fibrosis) which may be related to circulatory disturbances and changes indicative of increased haematopoiesis (high reticulocyte ratio and/or platelet count, increased cellularity of the haematopoietic cells in the femoral and sternal bone marrow, and/or extramedullary haematopoiesis in the liver and spleen).  These changes were noted to be very slight to slight in severity and recovered or tended to recover following the cessation of dosing.  No clinical signs of CNS toxicity were observed. Safety pharmacology Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Other

No non-clinical studies to evaluate the potential of dinutuximab to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or developmental and reproductive toxicity  have been conducted.  In male and female rats, administration of dinutuximab resulted in no adverse effects on reproductive organs at exposures that were at least 60-fold higher than those observed clinically.

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies conducted to date. These studies support the current dinutuximab dosing regimen of 17.5 mg/m 2 /day administered for four consecutive days during five monthly courses.

## 1. What Unituxin is and what it is used for

## What Unituxin is

Unituxin is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance dinutuximab.  It belongs to a group of medicines called 'monoclonal antibodies'.  These work like the antibodies produced naturally by the body. They help the immune system to target certain cells, such as cancer cells, by 'sticking' to them.

## What Unituxin is used for

Unituxin is used to treat 'high-risk neuroblastoma' in babies, children and adolescents aged 12 months to 17 years old.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that grows from abnormal nerve cells in the body. Some neuroblastomas are classed as 'high risk' if the cancer has spread to various parts of the body and contains certain types of cells. High-risk neuroblastomas are more likely to come back again after treatment.

To reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, Unituxin is given at the last stage of the treatment to eliminate small amounts of disease which may still be present after the cancer has responded to chemotherapy, surgery, and an autologous (self-donating) blood cell transplant.

## How Unituxin works

Unituxin recognises and attaches to a cell surface target called 'GD2'.  GD2 is found on the surface of neuroblastoma cells.  When Unituxin attaches to the GD2 on the cancer cells, the patient's immune system starts to attack these cells and kill them.

Unituxin has been shown to delay the progression or relapse of the disease and to increase survival.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Unituxin

## Do not take Unituxin if

- -you are allergic to dinutuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given dinutuximab.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Unituxin if:

- -you have ever had fits (convulsions)
- -you have liver problems
- -you have a low number of white blood cells or platelets in your blood - shown in tests
- -you have breathing problems such as shortness of breath when resting
- -you have kidney problems
- -you have any infections.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before being given Unituxin.

<!-- image -->

- Problems with your eyes - tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any problems with your eyes or changes to your vision.
- You might notice the following when you first receive Unituxin and during the course of treatment: · Allergic reactions, which may be severe (anaphylactic reactions), or other reactions to the infusion - Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any kind of reaction during or after the infusion.  These are very common (affecting more than 1 in 10 people).  Signs of an allergic reaction may include skin rash, hives, swelling in the face or throat, dizziness, a rapid heart beat or palpitations, being short of breath and difficulty breathing, fever, feeling sick, aches and pains in your joints.  You will be closely monitored for these signs while being given the medicine.  You will be given an anti-histamine medicine which helps to prevent allergic reactions. · Capillary Leak Syndrome due to leakage of blood components through small blood vessel walls this may cause rapid swelling to arms, legs and other parts of your body, rapid drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness and breathing difficulties · Pain - tell your doctor or nurse if you get any pain.  This is very common during treatment (affecting more than 1 in 10 people).  You will be given pain relieving medicines (such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and morphine) to help prevent and reduce the pain.  See section 4 for more information about pain side effects. · Low blood pressure - this may make you feel dizzy or faint. Medicinal product no longer authorised
- Infections of the blood - tell your doctor if you notice fever, shaking chills, or feel faint or dizzy.
- Problems with your nerves - you may notice numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet, legs or arms, reduced sensation or weakness with movement (peripheral neuropathy).

See section 4 for a full list of known side effects.

## Tests and checks

Your doctor will do blood tests and may do eye tests while you are taking this medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Unituxin

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.

In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you have recently received:

- -medicines called 'corticosteroids' - these can affect the activity of your immune system which is important for Unituxin to work.
- -'intravenous immunoglobulin' - you should not have this type of medicine in the two weeks before Unituxin treatment and for at least one week after treatment has finished.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Unituxin.

## Pregnancy

- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for advice before being given this medicine.
- If it is possible for you to become pregnant and you are not using contraception, talk to your doctor before being given this medicine.
- It is recommended to use contraception for 6 months after discontinuation of this medicine.

## Breast-feeding

- If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor or nurse before being given this medicine.
- You should not breastfeed during treatment with this medicine.  This is because it is not known if the medicine can pass into breast-milk.  The recommended interval time between treatment discontinuation and breastfeeding is 6 months.

## Driving and using machines

Unituxin has many side effects, and this will affect your ability to drive and use machines

## Unituxin contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  This means it is essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## 3. How Unituxin will be given

Unituxin will be given to you by a doctor or nurse while you are in hospital.  It is given as a drip into one of your veins (intravenous infusion).

Unituxin is used with three other medicines:

- -Isotretinoin
- -GM-CSF
- -IL-2

Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Unituxin in children aged less than 12 months have not yet been established.

## Method of administration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Unituxin should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. It should be administered by intravenous infusion over 10 hours.  The infusion is started at a dose rate of 0.875 mg/m 2 /h and continued at this rate for 30 minutes; the rate is then increased to 1.75 mg/m 2 /h and continued at this rate for the remainder of the infusion, if tolerated.  The infusion duration may be extended up to 20 hours to help minimise reactions during infusion that do not respond adequately to other supportive measures.  The infusion must be terminated after 20 hours, even if the full dose cannot be delivered within this timeframe.

Pre-medication should always be considered before starting each infusion.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6 of the SmPC.

## Contraindications

Hypersensitivity (Grade 4) to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC.

## Special warnings and precautions for use

Allergic reactions Antihistamine premedication (e.g. hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine) should be administered by intravenous injection approximately 20 minutes before starting each dinutuximab infusion.  It is recommended that antihistamine medicinal product be repeated every 4-6 hours as required during infusion of Unituxin. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions for 4 hours after the completion of the Unituxin infusion. Epinephrine (adrenaline) and hydrocortisone for intravenous administration should be immediately available at the bedside during administration of dinutuximab to manage life-threatening allergic reactions.  It is recommended that treatment for such reactions include hydrocortisone administered by intravenous bolus, and epinephrine administered by intravenous bolus once every 3-5 minutes as necessary according to clinical response. Depending on the severity of the allergic reaction, the rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment discontinued. Capillary leak syndrome Capillary leak syndrome is more likely when dinutuximab is co-administered with IL-2.  It is recommended to administer oral metolazone or intravenous furosemide every 6-12 hours as required.  Supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, and albumin replacement therapy should be used as necessary according to clinical response. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Characteristic symptoms and signs include hypotension, generalized oedema, ascites, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema and acute renal failure associated with hypoalbuminaemia and haemoconcentration.

## Pain

Severe pain (Grade 3 or 4) occurs most frequently during the first 4-day course of dinutuximab, often subsiding over time with subsequent courses.

For severe pain, the Unituxin infusion rate should be decreased to 0.875 mg/m 2 /hour.  Unituxin should be discontinued if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures.

Paracetamol should be administered orally 20 minutes prior to starting each dinutuximab infusion, and repeated every 4-6 hours as needed.  Regular dosing every 4-6 hours is recommended when IL-2 is coadministered.  If required for persistent pain, ibuprofen should be administered orally every 6 hours between doses of paracetamol.  Ibuprofen should not be administered if there is evidence of thrombocytopenia, bleeding, or renal dysfunction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An opioid, such as morphine sulphate, is recommended to be administered by intravenous infusion prior to each dinutuximab infusion and continued as an intravenous infusion during and until 2 hours after completion of the treatment.  It is recommended that additional intravenous bolus doses of an opioid are administered as needed for treatment of pain up to once every 2 hours during the dinutuximab infusion.  If morphine is not tolerated, then fentanyl or hydromorphone may be utilised.

Lidocaine may be administered as an intravenous infusion (2 mg/kg in 50 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride) over 30 minutes prior to the start of each dinutuximab infusion and continued via intravenous infusion at 1 mg/kg/h up to 2 hours after completion of the treatment.  Lidocaine infusion should be discontinued if the patient develops dizziness, perioral numbness, or tinnitus.

Gabapentin may be administered at the time of starting morphine premedication, at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day.  The dose may be subsequently increased (up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day or 3600 mg/day) as needed for pain management.

## Hypotension

Intravenous sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (10 mL/kg) should be administered over one hour just prior to the dinutuximab infusion.  If hypotension occurs, this can be repeated, or intravenous albumin or packed red blood cells can be administered as clinically indicated.  It is recommended that vasopressor therapy is also administered if necessary to restore an adequate perfusion pressure.

## Neurological disorders of the eye

Eye disorders may occur, especially with repeated courses.  These changes usually resolve over time. Patients should have an ophthalmic examination before initiating therapy and be monitored for visual changes.

## Hepatic dysfunction

Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended during dinutuximab immunotherapy.

## Systemic infections

Patients typically have a central venous catheter in situ and as a consequence of prior ASCT are likely to be immunocompromised during therapy, and therefore, at risk of developing systemic infection.  Patients should have no evidence of systemic infection and any identified infection should be under control before beginning therapy.

## Laboratory test abnormalities

Electrolyte abnormalities have been reported in patients who received Unituxin. Electrolytes should be monitored daily during therapy with Unituxin.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, and hypertension has been reported.  Supportive measures should be instituted including control of hydration status, electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, and anaemia.

## Sodium intake

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  This means it is essentially 'sodium free'.
