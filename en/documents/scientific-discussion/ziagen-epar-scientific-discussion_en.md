## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the  approval  of Ziagen. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 September 2000. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).

The approved indication is: Ziagen is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults.

The demonstration of benefit of Ziagen is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatmentnaïve patients on combination therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine.

Two oral formulations are available: tablet (each contains 300 mg of abacavir) and solution (each ml of solution contains 20 mg of abacavir).

There  are  currently  10  approved  antiretroviral  drugs  including  5  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase inhibitors  (NRTIs):  zidovudine  (ZDV),  didanosine  (ddI),  zalcitabine  (ddC),  lamivudine  (3TC)  and stavudine (d4T); one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI): nevirapine (NVP); and 4 protease inhibitors (PIs): ritonavir (RTV), saquinavir (SQV), indinavir (IDV) and nelfinavir (NFV).

In principle, there is a recognised need for new therapeutic agents in this area; the long-term use of these drugs is limited by emergence of resistance and also by toxicity and inconvenient drug dosing schedules/formulations.

## 2. Chemical and pharmaceutical aspects

## Composition

Ziagen is presented in two pharmaceutical forms - a film-coated tablet 300 mg, and an oral solution 20 mg/ml.

Standard  pharmacopoeial  grade  excipients  have  been  used  in  the  preparation  of  both  forms,  where appropriate.

## Tablets

Various formulations have been used in the clinical program. Clinical trials were originally performed using  abacavir  succinate  'caplets'  100  mg,  and  abacavir  sulfate  tablets  300  mg.  Bioequivalence between these two tablet formulations has been demonstrated at equivalent doses.

## Oral Solution

The oral  solution  was  also  modified  during  development,  in  order  to  improve  physical  stability  on storage. It is packed in HDPE bottles with polypropylene childproof closures. Bioequivalence between the  marketed tablet formulation and the marketed oral solution has been demonstrated at equivalent doses.

## Active substance

Abacavir sulfate is a new chemical entity. It is a carbocyclic nucleoside derivative synthesised via a well-controlled, reproducible, high yielding process, which has been adequately described. The active substance specification has been justified with regard to satisfactory purity (assay &amp; impurity levels) and the test methods and qualitative limits applied are considered to provide adequate control of the quality  of  the  active  substance.  The  batch  analytical  data  presented  confirm  reproducible  and consistent synthesis, and the data are in agreement with the proposed specification. Control methods have been adequately described and are well validated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The stability data provided for the active substance are sufficient to confirm the proposed re-test period.Other ingredients

The excipients are well established as suitable for use in pharmaceutical products and are described in Pharmacopoeias.

## Finished product and product development

## Tablets

Abacavir  tablets  are  manufactured  using  a  direct  compression  process:  all  ingredients  excluding magnesium stearate are blended after sieving. The lubricated blend is compressed and the cores are then coated. The tablets are packaged into blister packs (PVC/Al). The process validation studies have demonstrated that the  manufacturing  process is  capable  of  producing  a  product  of  constant  quality. Tests at release are standard and include limits for assay, related impurities, disintegration, dissolution, uniformity of content etc. These tests and limits should ensure consistent clinical performance of the product. Stability studies have been carried out using validated methods and the results indicate good chemical and physical stability at all storage conditions. Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

.

## Oral Solution

The  manufacturing  process  for  the  oral  solution  consists  of  conventional  solubilisation,  mixing, filtration and filling; it is well described, as are the in-process controls (pH, fill volume). Satisfactory batch release and shelf life specifications have been proposed and justified. Stability studies have been carried  out  using  validated  methods.  Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

Abacavir solid dosage forms and abacavir solution formulations are almost completely bioavailable (Cmax slightly lower and Tmax slightly later for tablet).

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue with reverse transcriptase inhibition activity. Antiviral efficacy has been  assessed  in  primary  cell  cultures  (mononuclear  cells,  macrophages)  and  in  cell  lines  that  are susceptible  to  HIV-1  and  HIV-2.  Tested  viruses  included  T-cell  line  adapted  viruses  and  primary isolates.  These in  vitro studies  in  experimental  models included  combinations with ZDV, ddI, ddC, amprenavir  and  nevirapine.  A  significant  antiviral  effect  of  abacavir  in  HIV-1  and  HIV-2  was supported but the combination studies were not performed with primary isolates. Published data have reported on an in vitro synergy of amprenavir and abacavir.

The mechanism of action of abacavir is partly known as described in the SPC. One of the enzymes that ensure its phosphorylation is unknown. The in vivo anti-HIV activity of abacavir is described in the clinical part of this assessment report.

A range of in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies showed no adverse effects of abacavir on central and autonomic nervous system, or respiratory and cardiovascular systems, at doses exceeding the maximum proposed therapeutic dose 300 mg (base) bid, equivalent to 12 mg (base)/kg/day based on a 50 kg person. These studies involved mouse, rat and dog.

The  effect  of  abacavir  at  the  following  receptors  was  assessed  in  isolated  tissue  preparations: cholinergic (guinea-pig ileum), adrenergic (rabbit aorta, guinea-pig atria and trachea), histaminergic (guinea-pig  atria)  and  serotonergic  (rat  fundus).  In  addition,  the  ability  of  abacavir  to  affect  tissue responsiveness  to  arachidonic  acid  (rat  fundus),  bradykinin  (guinea-pig  ileum)  and  angiotensin  II (rabbit aorta) was determined.

There were no direct effects of abacavir on any of the isolated tissue preparations, and no significant effects on contractile responses to any of the substances studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Abacavir  is  rapidly  absorbed  in  mice,  rats,  and  monkeys  following  oral  administration  and  the exposure is generally proportional to the dose; bioavailability is greater than 76% in both mice and monkeys.

The  binding  of  abacavir  to  plasma  proteins  is  low  to  moderate  in  mice,  monkeys,  and  humans. Abacavir  is  extensively  bound  to  melanin-containing  tissues.  Abacavir  was  extensively  distributed with higher concentrations in gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, nasal turbinates, uveal tissue of the eyes than in plasma.

Hepatic  clearance  is  the  principal  route  of  excretion  for  abacavir.  The  routes  of  metabolism  are qualitatively  similar  in  mice,  monkeys  and  humans.  Quantitatively,  the  two  main  metabolites  in monkeys and humans are a 5'-glucuronide and a 5'-carboxylic acid.

There is currently a lack of information on the accumulation of the two metabolites in man. However, pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that these metabolites are inactive. The results demonstrate that no accumulation  of  abacavir  occurs  and  the  two  major  metabolites  are  inactive  both  for  anti-HIV-1 activity and cytotoxicity in PBL and MT4 cell lines based on results from in vitro studies.

## Toxicology

The toxicology profile of abacavir was well described.

Abacavir showed a low order of toxicity following acute administration in mice and rats.

Repeated  dose-toxicity  studies  were  conducted  using  the  oral  route  in  CD1  mice  (one  month  and 3 months at dosages up to 708 mg/kg, 6 months at dosages up to 234 mg/kg) CD and Wistar rats (one month at dosages up to 400 mg/kg, 3 months at dosages up to 375 mg/kg) and cynomolgus monkeys (one month and 3 months at dosages up to 297 mg/kg, one year at dosages up to 297/212 mg/kg). The main target organ found following repeated administration of abacavir is the liver with augmentation of  the  weight  and  hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  Other  signs  of  liver  toxicity  such  as  necrosis  or cholestasis were not observed in the species tested. Hepatic effects were reversible.

Animal exposure resulted in safety margin between 1 and 10 according to the species evaluated. But in general toxicity observed at higher dosages was not very high and did not induce overt toxicity.

Abacavir has a weak mutagenic potential as previously observed with other nucleoside analogues.

The carcinogenic potential has not been evaluated so far.

The toxicity profile of abacavir is generally similar in juvenile and adult rats. However there was a reduction in brain weight in juvenile rats associated with reductions in body weight.

Abacavir is  toxic  in  rats  for  reproductive  functions  with:  augmentation  of  early  intra-uterine  death, reduced foetus and offspring (during the duration of the post-natal life) weights and augmentation in the percentage of malformations/variations. These observations could not be associated with maternal toxicity  since  reduced  body  weight  of  F0  animals  was  minimal.  The  foetotoxic  and  malformative effects of abacavir observed in rats are reflected in the SPC. In rabbits, no foetotoxicity or increase in malformations was observed.

## Fertility was not affected.

High dose combination of abacavir and amprenavir (up to 530 and 750 mg/kg/day, respectively) in rats significantly increased the heart weight. This effect was not accompanied with significant changes in  histopathology  but  was  still  present  in  females  after  the  recovery  period  showing  that  this  effect seems to be irreversible. This effect was not achieved with either of the products administered alone. The applicant will further address the finding.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

Data from 327 adults (299 receiving abacavir) were used to define pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,  and  safety  and  dose  range.  In  addition  pharmacokinetic  data  in  children  from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3 months to 13 years of age were derived from two studies with the 4 and 8 mg/kg dosage regimens; one single dose study (n=22) and one study on the steady state pharmacokinetics (n=47).

## Pharmacodynamics

Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue with reverse transcriptase inhibition activity. Antiviral efficacy has been confirmed in primary cell cultures (mononuclear cells, macrophages) and in cell lines that are susceptibility to HIV-1 and HIV-2 as further described in part III of this report.

As mentioned in part III, anti-HIV activity of abacavir was evaluated in the presence of some other drugs that are currently used in HIV-disease therapy implying synergistic and no antagonistic effects. The applicant's data implied synergism in vitro with ZDV, ddI and ddC and no observed antagonism with the other drugs tested (3TC, amprenavir, nevirapine).

Mutations associated with abacavir resistance selected during in vitro passage (K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V) have also been detected among isolates from subjects participating in clinical studies, with M184V and L74V being the most common. Treatment emergent mutations were less frequent when abacavir was given in combination with other antiretrovirals.

In general, subjects harbouring virus with wild-type RT genotype or 1-2 NRTI-associated mutations at baseline responded to abacavir with substantial decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA while subjects with ≥ 3  NRTI-associated  mutations  had  attenuated  or  no  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  response  to  abacavir.  The most common single RT mutation seen at baseline in these trials was the M184V, which has been associated with resistance to 3TC. As described in the clinical part (study CNAB 3002, CNAAB 3003, CNAA 3006),  abacavir  as  add  on  to  ART-experienced  patients  offers  added  antiretroviral  activity irrespective  of  prior  3TC  therapy.  For  example  plasma  HIV-RNA  response  at  week  16  by  viral genotype in study CNAB 3002 (therapy experienced patients) were:

| RT mutations                | Proportion of patients with VL decrease >0.5 log 10 or <400 copies/ml   | Proportion of patients with VL decrease >0.5 log 10 or <400 copies/ml   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RT mutations                | ABC + SBG                                                               | PBO + SBG                                                               |
| M184V alone                 | 20/26 (77%)                                                             | 1/30 (3.3%)                                                             |
| 1 ZDV codons without M184V* | 13/18 (72%)                                                             | 3/16 (18.8%)                                                            |
| 1 ZDV codons** + M184V      | 12/24 (50%)                                                             | 3/21 (14.3%)                                                            |

SBG = Stable background therapy

* +/- any other codon changes

** ZDV codon changes: 41L, 67N, 70R, 210W, 215F/Y and/or 219Q

One possible explanation for the slightly better response in the 3TC experienced group (see clinical efficacy) is that the M184V mutation delays the emergence of resistance conferring mutations and can re-sensitise resistant variants to ZDV. However, in this study an increase in phenotypic resistance has been observed in the abacavir group patients previously exposed to 3TC (25% of baseline patients and 41% after 16 weeks. More information on phenotypic/genotype resistance is available in the report on CNAB 3002, below).

Phenotypic susceptibility of primary isolates were tested throughout the clinical studies and involved the RVA as run by Virco nv, Belgium, but the information on phenotypic resistance in the dossier will need to be supplemented. Most of these genetic studies were done after 12 and 16 weeks of treatment. The  applicant  is  committed  to  report  on  resistance  data  after  longer  periods  of  follow-up.  Viral genotype  and  phenotypic  resistance  to  all  approved  antiretrovirals  will  be  assessed  to  week  48  for approximately  200-400  patients.  In  addition,  results  of  currently  ongoing  phenotypic  resistance analysis  will  be  submitted  as  soon  as  they  are  available.  Isolates  known  to  be  resistant  to  protease inhibitors did not disclose resistance to abacavir.

Dose finding studies will be further described under 'clinical efficacy'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir are adequately established (validated HPLC methods) in adults with the tablet formulation and in children with the solution formulation.

## ADME

The  absolute bioavailability of abacavir is high (average of 83%).  Regarding  the proposed formulations, tablet (300 mg) and solution (20 mg), these formulations lead to comparable systemic exposure.

Food does not affect the overall exposure (single dose study of 300 mg, n=18).

Plasma protein binding to human plasma is low to moderate (approximately 49% at therapeutic range).

It  has  been  shown  that  abacavir  penetrates  the  cerebrospinal  fluid.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this finding is however not established (see study CNAB 3001 in AIDS dementia).

Abacavir  is  extensively  metabolised  (alcohol  dehydrogenase,  UDP-glucuronyl  transferase).  Two major metabolites were identified (5'-carboxylate and glucuronide). The metabolites and unchanged abacavir  account  for  83%  of  the  administered  abacavir  dose  in  the  urine  and  the  remainder  is eliminated in the faeces.

Abacavir is neither a major substrate nor an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, potent interactions are unlikely  to  occur  with  drugs  that  are  substrates,  inducers  or  inhibitors  of  this  enzyme,  which  are numerous  among  concomitant  medications  commonly  used  by  AIDS  patients.  There  were  2 interaction studies: one with zidovudine and lamivudine and the second with alcohol. The results of those studies did not justify any specific dose recommendations. Products such as rifampicin, rifabutin and ritonavir that may induce UDP-glucoronyl transferase are not expected to clinically impact on the exposure  levels  of  abacavir.  In  an  interaction  study  with  ethanol  exposure  levels  of  abacavir  were increased  by  about  41%,  (clinically  insignificant).  Abacavir  has  no  effect  on  the  metabolism  of ethanol. Retinoid compounds are eliminated via alcohol dehydrogenase and interaction with abacavir is possible but has not been studied.

## Children

The overall pharmacokinetic parameters in children are comparable to adults with greater variability in plasma concentrations (studies CNAA  1001 and ACTG  330). In the single dose study, pharmacokinetics are not  linear  (probably  due  to  the  small  number  of  enrolled  children  in  any  age group), between the two doses tested, 4 and 8 mg/kg bid. Exposures after administration of 4 mg/kg bid  are  somewhat  lower  than  those  in  adult  patients  while  they  are  higher  after  8  mg/kg  bid.  The applicant has based the choice of the recommended 8-mg/kg doses on this consideration . The choice of the dose in children is further discussed under \"efficacy\".

## Other Special populations

Limited  data  (6  patients)  are  available  on  pharmacokinetics  from  patients  with  end-stage  renal dysfunction  indicating  unaltered  abacavir  pharmacokinetics.  Based  on  limited  experience,  abacavir should be avoided in patients with end stage renal disease. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC to reflect this concern.

In addition, no data on patients with hepatic failure are available but a clinical trial in these patients is ongoing.  Results  will  be  made  available  as  follow-up  measure . In  the  absence  of  data,  the  use  of abacavir  should  be  avoided  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  In  addition,  there  is  no information on the disposition of abacavir in patients with severe hepatic disease. This information has been reflected in the SPC (Contraindications and Warning sections).

The pharmacokinetics of abacavir has not been studied in elderly patients (&gt;65 years). Since there is no  effect  of  ageing  on  alcohol  dehydrogenase  activity,  it  appears  unlikely  that  ageing  will  affect abacavir  pharmacokinetics.  The  clinical  data,  although  limited  (31  patients  over  50  years  of  age) provided further reassurance that elderly patients are unlikely to have clinically significant pharmacokinetic  alterations.  The  genetic  polymorphism  exhibited  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase,  which may  result  in  interindividual  variability,  is  expected  to  have  little  impact  on  the  clinical  usage  of abacavir  based  on  the  current  dose  recommendation  (300  mg  bid)  and  the  relatively  safe  use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experienced  in  study  CNAB  3001  (600  mg  bid  for  up  to  a  year).  In  poor  metabolisers  (2-4%  in  a Caucasian population), exposure would likely be increased by about 40% (based on the interaction study with ethanol).

Thus, the expected variability due to genetic difference in alcohol dehydrogenase activity in different ethnic groups and in women is not considered clinically relevant given the current knowledge of the safety profile for abacavir.

## Clinical efficacy

The pivotal database comprised 1059 adult patients (4 patients &gt;65 years). Data from 253 children (&lt;13 years of age) made the major contributions to substantiate dose/dose regimen and efficacy. This is displayed in the tabular overview of clinical studies in adults and children (supportive studies not included):

## ADULTS

## Dose response studies:

Two dose-response studies have been performed in antiretroviral naive patients.

In the first study (CNAA 2001, n=79) a strong antiviral effect is observed with abacavir (-1 to -2 log10 copies/ml at 12 weeks). It was not possible to conclude on any dose related antiviral effects, but for tolerance  a  possible  trend  of  increased  incidence  of  nausea,  headache  and  dizziness  with  increased dose was noted.

Study  CNAB  2002  (randomised,  double-blind,  n=60)  which  is  the  main  dose  justification  study, clearly demonstrates the superiority, in terms of reduction of viral load, of the 300 mg and 600 mg bid doses  of  abacavir  monotherapy  compared  to  the  100  mg  bid  dose  at  week  4,  with  no  difference between  these  two  higher  dosages.  Moreover,  taking  into  account  a  possible  trend  of  increasing adverse events with dose (mainly nausea), the choice of the recommended dose of abacavir (300 mg bid) was established.

The median HIV-1 RNA changes from baseline are summarised below:

|                     | Median HIV-1 RNA log 10 copies/ml by treatment group   | Median HIV-1 RNA log 10 copies/ml by treatment group   | Median HIV-1 RNA log 10 copies/ml by treatment group   |

*The last measurement on randomised monotherapy carried forward through 24 weeks, if treatment switches prior to week 24.

After  24  weeks  all  patients  received  abacavir/3TC/ZDV.  At  week  72,  31/42  (74%)  of  patients  had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml, and 21/42 (50%) had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml.

CD4+ cell  counts  increased  during  both  the  monotherapy  phase  with  abacavir  and  also  during  the combination phase, with a median increase at week 72 of 163 cells/mm 3 .

## Antiretroviral naive adult patients

## Main studies

## CNAAB 3003

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  changed  (amendment  of  the  protocol)  from  comparing  the durability of the plasma HIV-1 RNA response following 48 weeks of treatment with ABC/ZDV/3TC versus 3TC/ZDV to comparing antiviral activity following 16 weeks treatment.

173 patients (&gt;13 years of age) were randomised into the initial double blind 16-week phase (Group A) and a second cohort was added (Group B) that allowed patients to enrol into an open-label arm with ABC/ZDV/3TC. In Group A, at week 16 and thereafter, if the switch criterion of plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;400 copies/ml was met, patients could remain on randomised therapy, discontinue study drug or  receive  open-label  abacavir  in  combination  with  other  ART.  Patients  with  &lt;400 copies/ml  could switch  to  open-label  abacavir  only.  The  primary  endpoints  were  the  proportions  of  subjects  with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml, plasma HIV-1 RNA profiles and CD4 lymphocytes profiles.

## Results

## Accountability

152 patients completed the 16 week study (withdrawals evenly distributed between groups). Sixty two (71%) of patients from the triple therapy group with abacavir remained on randomised therapy at week 48  compare  with  only  8  (9%)  from  the  3TC/ZDV  group.  There  were  only  4  patients  in  the  triple therapy group who switched therapy after week 16:

## Plasma HIV-1 RNA

Plasma HIV response up to 48 weeks were analysed by ITT (i.e. missing patients were regarded as failures or data were carried forward) or ITT (Switch = Failure). The proportions of patients with HIV1 RNA assay threshold values &lt;400 copies/ml were:

|          | Number of patients with HIV-1 RNA<400copies/ml per treatment group   | Number of patients with HIV-1 RNA<400copies/ml per treatment group   | Number of patients with HIV-1 RNA<400copies/ml per treatment group   | Number of patients with HIV-1 RNA<400copies/ml per treatment group   |

A  post  hoc  analysis  with  the  more  sensitive  Roche  Amplicor  Ultra  Sensitive  HIV-1  RNA  assay allowed a limit of detection of 50 copies/ml confirmed the superiority of the triple therapy regimen showing  that  54%  and  15%  of  had  undetectable  levels  in  the  triple  and  double  therapy  group, respectively in the ITT switch equals failure population at week 16.

## CD4 cell count

Notably, there were no relative benefits in terms of CD4 cell counts for the triple therapy group. The median changes from baseline were 47 (16 weeks) and 150 cells/mm 3 (48 weeks) in the triple therapy group with abacavir and 113 (16 weeks) and 158 cells/mm 3 with the double combination group.

## CNAAB 3005

This  randomised,  double  blind  study  evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  abacavir/3TC/ZDV  and indinavir/3TC/ZDV  in  ART  naive  adult  patients.  A  total  of  562  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA &gt;10000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell counts ≥ 100 cells/mm 3 were enrolled in the study. Preliminary data are now available for all patients at week 16 and for almost all patients at week 24.

## Plasma HIV-1 RNA

The ITT analysis up to week 16 accounts for all patients (week 12 values are carried forward to week 16  as  appropriate.).  If  a  patient  is  switched  into  open  label  treatment  per-protocol  or  prematurely discontinued  study  medication  prior  to  week  16  the  outcome  was  classified  as  a  failure.  The proportions given on patients having plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml at week 24 are based on the patients that reached at least 24 weeks on study; these sample sizes are noted in the table below. The proportion of patients with undetectable viral load is given in the table and preliminary results indicate equivalence between the abacavir and indinavir containing regimens:

| Study Week              | ABC/3TC/ZDV             | IDV/3TC/ZDV             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Baseline ITT as treated | 0% (n=280) 0% (n=262)   | 0% (n=282) 0% (n=266)   |
| Week 8 ITT as treated   | 58% 68% (n=209)         | 54% 63% (n=214)         |
| Week 16 ITT as treated  | 67% 83% (n=192)         | 66% 83% (n=190)         |
| Week 24 ITT as treated  | 66% (n=270) 85% (n=151) | 65% (n=268) 86% (n=157) |

## CD4 cell count

The median change of CD4 cell count from baseline was of 86 and 105/mm 3 for the ABC/3TC/ZDV group and 103 and 102/mm 3 for the IDV/3TC/ZDV group at week 16 and week 24, respectively.

## Antiretroviral experienced adult patients

## CNAB 3002

The aim of this randomised double-blind, parallel-group multicentre study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABC versus placebo as add on therapy in combination with stable background therapy (SBG) in ART experienced patients.

Patients could enter the study if they had received unchanged SBG for at least 12 weeks (which could include any combination of NRTI, NNRTI and PIs provided the patient had less than 36 months NRTI experience)  and  were  expected  to  continue  to  derive  benefit  from  their  current  SBG  for  at  least 16 weeks. In addition patients had a CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cell/mm 3 and plasma HIV-1 RNA between 400 - 50000 copies/ml. Randomisation was stratified according to whether patients were 3TC naive or experienced  and  the  duration  of  prior  NRTI  therapy.  A  total  of  185  patients  were  randomised  to receive either abacavir 300 mg bid in combination with SBG (92 patients) or placebo in combination with SBG (93 patients).

Eligible patients were to continue on randomised treatment until the last patient completed 48 weeks of  treatment  unless  they  met  a  protocol-defined  switch  criterion,  based  upon  viral  load    (at  week  8 ≥ 0.5 log increase in plasma HIV-1  RNA  from  baseline  value  and/or  plasma  HIV-1  RNA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

≥ 50000 copies/ml, at week 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter if plasma HIV-1  RNA  was ≥ 400 copies/ml) or new AIDS (CDC C) defining events. If a patient met a switch criterion, they could receive  open-label  abacavir  at  the  next  scheduled  visit  or  continue  on  randomised  therapy  (in  both cases with or without changes to their background antiretroviral therapy).

Full  week  16  data  are  available  for  study  CNAB  3002.  Baseline  characteristics  for  the  patients  are summarised in the table:

| Treatment Group                                            | ABC + SBG                           | PBO + SBG                           |

*The most common baseline SBG therapies were 3TC/ZDV (36%), 2NRTIs + PI +/- NNRTI (21%) and d4T/3TC (19%).

SBG = stable background therapy

## Viral load response

At week 16, a decrease in median plasma HIV-1 RNA from baseline of 0.44 log10 copies/ml for the abacavir/SBG  group  was  observed  compared  to  an  increase  of  0.12  log10  copies/ml  for  the placebo/SBG group, ITT population.

Proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 &lt;400 copies/ml at week 16:

| Population                      | ABC+SBG     | PBO+SBG    | Treatment comparison   |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| ITT population, all patients    | 36/92 (39%) | 7/93 (8%)  | P<0.001                |
| Subgroup: 3TC experienced       | 28/67 (42%) | 5/67 (7%)  | P<0.001                |
| Subgroup: 3TC naive             | 8/25 (32%)  | 2/26 (8%)  | P=0.038                |
| Subgroup: 3-9 months prior ART  | 9/20 (45%)  | 4/44 (18%) | P=0.096                |
| Subgroup: 9-18 months prior ART | 27/67 (40%) | 1/64 (2%)  | p<0.001                |

Results for the As Treated analyses were similar to those for the ITT population.

## CD4+ cell count response

The abacavir/background group had a median increase in CD4+ cell count at week 16 of 30 cells/mm 3 compared to a median increase of 1 cells/mm 3 in the placebo/background group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Genotypic and phenotypic data

The  baseline  genotypic  and  phenotypic  characteristics  of  the  patients'  isolates  were  very  similar  in both treatment arms. Over 95% of the baseline isolates from the 3TC experienced population had the M184V mutation and 49% had ZDV associated mutations. The baseline isolates from the 3TC naive patients did not, with one exception, have the M184V mutation but had a higher incidence of ZDV associated mutations than the 3TC experienced patients (81%), suggesting, as other studies have, that a 3TC containing regimen may delay the emergence of ZDV mutations.

Of  the  26  abacavir  treated  patients  with  the  M184V  mutation  alone  at  baseline,  nineteen  (73%) experienced ≥ 1 log10 copies/ml reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA or had a value &lt;400 copies/ml by week 16.

The presence of ≥ 3 ZDV resistance mutations with or without the M184 was associated with a lesser response  to  the  abacavir-containing  regimen.  No  mutation  known  to  be  associated  with  reduced susceptibility to abacavir had developed following 16 weeks of therapy with abacavir in combination with stable background therapy in either 3TC naive or experienced patients. Although no new abacavir associated  mutations  were  detected  a  slight  increase  in  the  incidence  of  isolates  with  reduced phenotypic susceptibility to abacavir was observed at week 16 in this group as previously described.

Baseline phenotypes from the 3TC-experienced  patients in the abacavir treated group were phenotypically resistant to 3TC (97%), but the majority remained fully sensitive to abacavir (75%).

## Supportive data

## Therapy naïve patients

Supportive data were provided in study CNAB 2002 described above which provided data up until week 72.

An open, randomised study, CNAA 2004 investigated abacavir in dual therapy with different protease inhibitors:

## Plasma HIV-1 RNA response at week 48

|------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml ITT | 9/17 (53%) | 8/16 (50%) | 8/16 (50%) | 7/17 (41%) | 9/16 (56%) |
| As treated                   | 9/10 (90%) | 8/10 (80%) | 8/8 (100%) | 7/9 (78%)  | 9/10 (90%) |

## CD-4 cell count:

In the as treated analysis the overall change from baseline at week 4 was 88 cells/mm 3 , at week 16 was 157 cells/mm 3 and  at  week  48  was  159  cells/mm 3 showing  durability  of  effect  across  all  treatment groups.

## Therapy experienced patients

Week 16 data is available for study CNAB 3009 , together with preliminary week 48 efficacy data. The aim  of  this  open-label  single-arm  multicentre  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  antiretroviral activity  of  abacavir  as  an  add-on  therapy  in  previously  antiretroviral  naive  patients  treated  with  the 3TC/ZDV combination for at least 12 weeks (in study NUCB 3027).

## CNAA 2007

The  aim  of  this  open  label,  single  arm  multicentre  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  antiviral activity of abacavir in combination with amprenavir (APV, 1200 mg bid) and efavirenz (EFV, 600 mg QD) in patients with a screening plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;500 copies/ml despite at least 20 weeks prior therapy with indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and/or nelfinavir. A total of 99 patients were enrolled and treated  in  the  study;  87%  of  the  exposed  patients  had  &gt;2  years  of  prior  antiretroviral  therapy  and approximately one third were NNRTI experienced.

Overall 19/74 (26%) patients had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml at week 16.

As previously described, the M184V mutation alone or in combination with ≤ 2 ZDV mutations was not associated with reduced susceptibility to ABC. Isolates containing ≥ 3 ZDV + M184V mutations were  more  likely  to  show  decreased  susceptibility  to  ABC.  Overall,  the  presence  of  multi-drug resistant viral isolates, NNRTI-associated mutations, ≥ 3 ZDV mutations or the T69D insertion were more frequently associated with an antiviral response &lt;1 log10 HIV-1 RNA by week 16.

In  addition  the  applicant  provided  information  from  rollover  studies  following  on  from  ACTG  320 (IDV/3TC/ZDV);  conclusive  results  from  studies  ACTG  368  (combination  with  indinavir  and efavirenz) and ACTG 372 (efavirenz and adefovir ± nelfinavir) are pending.

One, open, expanded access study ( CNAA 3008 )  addressed the addition of abacavir to heavily pretreated patients. No conclusions on efficacy can be drawn from this study.

## CNAB 3001

In 105 previously treated patients suffering from AIDS Dementia Complex a 12 week, randomised, double-blind  placebo  controlled  study  was  conducted  to  assess  changes  in  neuropsychological performance using abacavir 600 mg bid. This study has not demonstrated any further benefit with the addition  of  abacavir  compared  to  placebo  to  current  antiretroviral  therapy  in  terms  of  neurological performance. This is despite consistent drug penetration into CSF, attaining antiviral levels. This study demonstrates a benefit of adding abacavir to current anti-retroviral therapy as measured by proportion of  patients  with  undetectable  plasma  viral  load  (46%  versus  13%,  p=0.002).  However,  no  formal conclusion can be drawn, as the median baseline viral load was lower in the ABC treatment group (3.7 versus 4.5 log10 copies/ml).

## CHILDREN

Three  studies  have  been  performed  with  abacavir  as  oral  solution,  which  represents  an  adequate formulation for paediatric use.

Based  on  the  two  pharmacokinetic  studies  (CNAA  1001  and  ACTG  330),  where  two  doses  were tested, 4 and 8 mg/kg bid, exposures after administration of 4 mg/kg bid are in the same range as those in adult patients whereas they are higher after 8 mg/kg bid.

The 8 mg/kg dose was justified based on the high variability in exposure and the risk of under-treatment of some children.

## CNAA 3006

Ongoing randomised, double-blind 48-week study in anti-retroviral experienced (&gt;12 weeks previous therapy;  ZDV (79%), 3TC (55%) or other therapy in the last 6 months) children aged &gt;90 days and &lt;12 years old. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;10000 copies/ml. Drugs  were  administered  as  follows:  placebo  or  abacavir  solution  (20  mg/ml,  8 mg/kg)  added  on  to ZDV (180 mg/m 3 bid) + 3TC (4 mg/kg bid). The switch criterion was viral load ≥ 10000 copies/ml and thereafter  patients  either  received  open  label  triple  therapy  or  abacavir  in  other  combinations  or continued blinded treatment or withdrew from the trial. Full 16 week and preliminary 24-week data are reported here. Median age in these children was 5.7 (0.6 - 13 y) years with no patients under 5 months and 34 under 30 months of age. Other baseline characteristics were:

## Results at 16 weeks

A total  of  191  of  205  patients  completed  16  weeks,  91  in  the  triple  therapy  and  100  in  the  double therapy group. Between weeks 16 and 24, 7 patients in the triple therapy group added additional antiretroviral  therapy  and  in  the  double  therapy  group  20  patients  switched  to  open  label  treatment (11 with added antiretroviral therapy). Overall, 7% of subjects withdrew by week 16, predominantly due to adverse events in the abacavir group.

The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV-1  RNA  &lt;10000  copies/ml  at  Week  16  (primary  endpoint)  is described  in  the  following  table  which  controls  for  randomisation  stratum  (by  age  and  previous treatment) and baseline plasma HIV-RNA category (using the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel Test (CMH):

| Analysis Population   | ABC          | PBO          |

| No prior ZDV/3TC      | 29/52 (56%)  | 15/52 (29%)  |
| Total population      | 50/102 (49%) | 36/103 (35%) |
|                       | p = 0.006    | p = 0.006    |
| As treated            |              |              |
| Prior ZDV/3TC         | 21/45 (47%)  | 20/49 (41%)  |
| No prior ZDV/3TC      | 29/47 (62%)  | 14/47 (30%)  |

|                       | p <0.001     | p <0.001     |

The percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA level below 10000 copies/ml is significantly greater in the  triple  therapy  group  with  abacavir  as  compared  with  the  double  therapy  ZDV/3TC  (ITT:  49% versus 35%, p=0.006). Data seem to suggest that benefits are more prominent in patients with high baseline HIV-1 RNA levels (but the number of patients with low virus levels is relatively small) and in patients  without  prior  ZDV/3TC experience. Moreover, the proportion of patients achieving plasma HIV-1 RNA below the level of detection (400 copies/ml) at week 16 was significantly greater with ABC/ZDV/3TC  therapy  than  with  ZDV/3TC  (ITT:  13%  (13/102)  versus  2%  (2/103),  p=0.003). Overall  the  change  from  baseline  was  approximately  -  0.5 log10  copies/ml  for  HIV-1  RNA  in  the abacavir group and approximately - 0.20 log10 copies/ml in the placebo group.

The median increase from baseline in CD4 cell count was 60 and 11 cells/mm in the abacavir and placebo group, respectively.

## Results at 24 weeks

Analysis at this timepoint was performed by ITT (all patients irrespective of switch) and modified ITT (assigning switched patients as failures) and as treated patients (patients on randomised treatment). At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;10000 copies/ml was greater in the ABC/3TC/ZDV  treatment  group  than  for  the  3TC/ZDV  group  for  all  populations  analysed.  Since approximately one-fifth of study patients entered the trial with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;10000 copies/ml, additional analyses were completed using the CMH test controlling for baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA as well as randomisation stratum at week 24. These analyses demonstrated, as shown at 16 weeks, a significant treatment difference in both the ITT (switch included) and the As Treated populations.

There was very little change from week 16 in the proportion of patients with HIV-1 &lt;400 copies/ml and the  median  changes from baseline (ITT) also remained similar to week 16. The CD4 response described at 16 weeks was sustained at 24 weeks.

## CNAAB 3007

This  is  an  ongoing,  open  label,  compassionate  study.  Data  are  available  on  74  enrolled  patients between 6 months and 13 years of age failing or intolerant to standard therapy.  Baseline  CD4  cell count  was  150  cells/mm 3 and  viral  load  was  about  450000  copies/ml.  Data  indicated  that  18%  of patients had a reduction to &lt;10000 copies/ml (9% &lt;400 copies/ml) after 2 months.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Safety of abacavir sulfate has been evaluated in a series of controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. Approximately 4400 HIV-1 infected patients had received abacavir therapy within clinical trials up to 18 March 1998 and were included in the original submission. Of these, about 4100 were adults and over 200 were children. This number of exposed patients is subject to inaccuracies due to incomplete databases for ongoing and blinded clinical studies.

Provided  up  to  the  time  of  the  CPMP  opinion  were  safety  data  from  over  191  children  older  than 30 months who had received multiple doses of abacavir. In children younger than 30 months data are derived from approximately 45 patients who had received multiple doses of abacavir.

## Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths

The main point of concern is the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions, which may be fatal with hypotension and with risk of multi-organ involvement.

Based on information received by Glaxo Wellcome up until 30 September 1998, an incidence of 3% has been reported, i.e. 406 cases in 13000 exposed patients. The most common symptoms are fever and rash. Notably those events were less frequent in patients with a positive  rechallenge (67% and 52%, respectively/n=33) than in those with  no re-challenge (87% and 73% respectively). Thus, the absence of rash or fever may potentially delay the diagnosis of a hypersensitivity reaction and increase the risk of reintroducing abacavir inappropriately. Almost all hypersensitivity reactions will have fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.  Other  frequently  observed  signs  or  symptoms  of  the hypersensitivity  reaction  include  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  or abdominal  pain,  lethargy  and  malaise.  Some  patients  with  hypersensitivity  reaction  were  initially thought to have a viral infection such as flu-like syndrome, gastroenteritis or respiratory syndrome.

- The median time to onset of symptoms was 11 days (mean time: 15.7 days). In 376 patients (94%), the reaction occured within the first 6 weeks. For 25 other cases, the time to onset was over 6 weeks.
- 98% of patients with hypersensitivity reaction had fever or rash or both.
- Life  threatening  reactions  were  more  frequently  reported  in  patients  who  were  rechallenged with abacavir following an initial hypersensitivity reaction. Of the 406 cases, 8% (34/406) were rated as life threatening by the investigator: of the 49 rechallenges, 35% (17/49) were rated as life threatening, including one fatal outcome, compared to 5% (18/357) in patients who did not undergo rechallenge.

In an update of hypersensitivity reactions performed on cases reported between 1 October 1998 and 31 December  1998  230  of  8000  patients  receiving  abacavir  experienced  hypersensitivity  reactions confirming  the  3%  overall  risk  of  hypersensitivity  reactions.  It  was  noted  that  the  incidence  of rechallenge  decreased  from  13%  (before  1  October  1998,  49/406)  to  6%  in  the  4Q  1998  (14/230). Two deaths were related to hypersensitivity reaction during this period of time. Dear doctor letters, patient alert cards and modified consent forms began to be instituted early in 1998.

Currently the mechanism of the hypersensitivity reaction is unknown. A programme to investigate this is  underway but results are not yet available. In  addition no risk factors have been identified which may predict the occurrence or severity of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir but intermittent therapy with abacavir may increase the risk of developing a state of hypersensitivity. The SPC reflects this concern.

In adults, nausea was the most frequently reported adverse event (AE) in both phase II and III studies. It  was significantly more common in patients receiving abacavir-containing regimens. The available

data (table below) did not suggest a dose-related impact on the risk of AE although this was mentioned as  a  concern  during  dose-finding  studies.  Seven  %  of  adults  withdrew  due  to  AE  (3%  due  to hypersensitivity reactions).

During the post marketing phase respiratory symptoms have been recognised as an important part of the  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  approximately  20%  of  HSR-patients.  These  symptoms  may  include dyspnoea,  pharyngitis  or  cough  in  the  initial  presentation.  Deaths  have  occurred  among  patients initially  thought  to  have  acute  respiratory  diseases  (pneumonia,  bronchitis,  or  flu-like  illness)  who were only later recognised to have had a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir that included respiratory symptoms.  In  cases  where  there  was  a  fatal  outcome  respiratory  symptoms  were  present  in approximately 80% of the patients. A delay in diagnosis of hypersensitivity can result in Ziagen being continued or re-introduced, leading to more severe hypersensitivity reactions or to death.

To  avoid  a  delay  in  diagnosis  and  minimise  the  risk  of  a  life-threatening  hypersensitivity  reaction, Abacavir must be discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g. respiratory diseases, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis, or reactions to other medications). If reintroduction is judged necessary it must be done in a hospital setting.

Hypersensitivity  reactions  with  rapid  onset,  including  life-threatening  reactions,  have  occurred  after re-starting  abacavir  in  patients  who  had  only  one  of  the  key  symptoms  of  hypersensitivity  reaction (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior  to  stopping  abacavir.  On  very  rare  occasions  hypersensitivity  reactions  have  been  reported  in patients  who  have  re-started  therapy,  and  who  had  no  preceding  symptoms  of  a  hypersensitivity reaction.

Consequently,  if  a  decision  is  made  to  re-start  abacavir  in  patients  who  had  only  one  of  the  key symptoms  of  hypersensitivity  or  no  symptoms  prior  to  stopping  abacavir,  this  must  be  done  in  a setting  where  medical  assistance  is  readily  available.  This  information  has  been  included  in  the relevant parts of the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and labelling (alert card).

## Children

In children the adverse event profile was similar to adults. Vomiting was more frequent (38%) than in adults and led to discontinuation in 4% of children.

Also  in  children,  the  major  point  of  concern  is  the  hypersensitivity  reaction  which  appears  with  a higher frequency than in adults (5.2%, p=0.04).

This  serious  adverse  event  is  difficult  to  monitor  and  especially  so  in  young  children.  In  this  age group, the difficulty to capture subjective adverse events such as nausea, malaise raises great concerns. Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms are more frequent in children and could be misunderstood.

## Laboratory findings

Neutropenia and anaemia were the most frequent grade 3 or 4 haematological abnormalities (4% and 2%,  respectively),  but  there  appears  to  be  no  association  between  abacavir  and  haematological toxicity.  Changes  in  ALT,  AST,  CPK,  triglycerides,  amylase  and  lipase  appeared  at  similar frequencies in treatment groups.

## 5. Overall Conclusions and Benefit Risk Assessment

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC.  Physiochemical  and  biological aspects relevant to the  uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated, and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

- Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that abacavir exerts a significant antiviral effect on HIV-1 and HIV-2. The general pharmacology studies in mouse, rat and dog showed no adverse effects on nervous, respiratory or cardiovascular systems.
- From the pharmacokinetic point of view it was noted that hepatic clearance is the principal route of excretion for abacavir. The routes of metabolism are qualitatively similar in mice, monkeys and  humans.  Quantitatively,  the  two  main  metabolites  in  monkeys  and  humans  are  a  5'glucuronide and a 5'-carboxylic acid.
- Overall,  the  toxicology  programme  revealed  the  liver  to  be  the  main  target  organ  following repeated  administration  with  weight  increases  and  hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  These  effects were  reversible.  As  for  other  nucleoside  analogues  abacavir  has  a  weak  mutagenic  potential. Abacavir is toxic for reproductive functions with reductions in foetus and offspring weights and increased intra-uterine death and malformation. This information has been included in the SPC.

There was a finding related to the high dose combination of abacavir and amprenavir indicating increased heart weights in rats. The applicant will further investigate this finding.

The carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice are in progress and results will be available by the end of June 2001.

## Efficacy

- Due to the twice daily dosing and the absence of significant interaction with food, compliance with abacavir treatment in the clinical setting might be favourable.
- The  resistance  pattern  of  abacavir  appeared  favourable  since,  in  general,  subjects  harbouring virus with wild-type RT genotype or 1-2 NRTI-associated mutations at baseline responded to abacavir with substantial decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA. However, subjects with ≥ 3 NRTIassociated mutations had attenuated or no plasma HIV-1 RNA response to abacavir. The most common single RT mutation at baseline in these trials in experienced patients was the M184V, which has been associated with resistance to 3TC but not abacavir . Subjects harbouring virus with the M184V alone have comparable HIV-1 RNA response to those with wild-type virus. The applicant will submit further data on resistance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The dose rational for adults has been sufficiently substantiated.
- In therapy naive patients, the durability of the antiviral effect of abacavir is mainly corroborated by long term results in study CNAAB 3003. The virological response observed at week 16 in the  ABC  arm  is  sustained  at  week  48  (proportion  of  patients  with  undetectable  viral  load (400 copies/ml)  is  77%  and  71%  respectively  at  week  16  and  48).  The  limited  proportion  of switches in the ABC arm confirms the virological impact of ABC. At week 48, 71% of patients remained on treatment with abacavir. It should be emphasised that other studies such as CNAB 2002, CNAA 2004 and CNAB 3009 (therapy experienced) underscored this durable impact on the viral load, but their interpretation is much more limited since there are open label studies and/or performed in few patients. No additional benefit has been demonstrated in terms of CD4 cell counts.
- In  therapy-experienced  patients,  short-term  data  (16w)  from  (CNAB  3002)  185  patients moderately exposed to previous antiretroviral therapy and moderately advanced (CD4 409 cells) provided  most  information.  Abacavir  demonstrated  a  slight  impact  on  the  viral  load  (median change of viral load -0,44 log10 copies/ml). These results are in accordance with genotypic and phenotypic analyses, which demonstrate that ≥ 3NRTI mutations at baseline are not favourable for  a  response  to  ABC.  Information  provided  by  other  studies  such  as  CNAB  3009,  CNAA 2007, ACTG 368 and ACTG 372 are limited since there are mainly open label studies and/or performed in few patients and/or need to be completed since only preliminary data are currently available. Final reports from studies currently ongoing (CNAB 3002, CNAB 3009, ACTG 368 and  ACTG  372)  are  requested  as  follow-up  measures.  No  additional  benefit  has  been demonstrated in terms of CD4 cell counts.
- Study  CNAAB  3005  is  particularly  interesting  in  terms  of  antiviral  strategy,  because  it demonstrates equivalence of a NRTI triple therapy with a PI containing triple therapy. However, the  applicant  only  provided  short-term  data  with  results  at  week  16  supplemented  with preliminary results at week 24 and 48 indicating similar immuno-virological effects between the abacavir  triple  combination  and  the  indinavir-containing  regimen.  In  the  context  of  protease inhibitors  sparing  strategy  these  data  are  particularly  important  and  final  results  from  this ongoing study has been requested.

In  response  to  a  CPMP  request  to  provide  complementary data  in  combination  with  protease inhibitors  and  non-nucleoside  analogues,  information  was  made  available  from  ACTG368 (indinavir/efavirenz)  and  ACTG372  (efavirenz/adefovir ± nelfinavir);  48  week  data  from CNAA 2004 (above); 16 week data from CNAB 3002 (above); CNAA 2007 (above). Taken together  these  studies  provide  preliminary  information  from  over  500  patients  but  are  as  yet insufficient to allow any definitive conclusions. Final reports from studies CNAB 3002, ACTG 368 and ACTG 372 are awaited as follow-up measures.

There is no information available on therapy after treatment with abacavir has failed. Ongoing studies  (e.g.  CNAA  3005)  will  address  this  issue  although  cross-resistance  to  non-nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors may not be expected.

- The dose rational for children has been sufficiently substantiated. The pivotal placebo controlled trial performed in 205 children, CNAA 3006, demonstrated a superior effect (antiviral and on CD4 cells) of abacavir/3TC/ZDV over 3TC/ZDV that seemed sustained over 24 weeks. A final report from this study is awaited. In addition a final report from the MRC-run study, Penta 5 (a study with factorial design and including nelfinavir), will be submitted.

## Safety

- The  main  concern  relates  to  the  3%  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  which  have  been evaluated up until 31 December 1998 and described in 636 patients. This is a potentially life threatening condition with hypotension and multi organ involvement. The mortality rate from hypersensitivity reactions is 0.014% (3/21000). A majority of cases of hypersensitivity reaction (94%)  appear  within  the  first  6  weeks  of  abacavir  treatment  but  6%  of  cases  appear  after 6 weeks of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Rechallenge  confers  a  35%  risk  of  life  threatening  consequences.  Of  the  636  patients  with hypersensitivity  reactions,  63  (10%)  were  rechallenged  with  abacavir  in  the  overall  database. Although various precautionary measures have reduced the risk of rechallenge with abacavir, the risk of rechallenge remains at about 6% for the period 1 October to 31 December 1998.
- In children, the major concern is the hypersensitivity reaction. In this population, hypersensitivity  reactions  are  particularly  difficult  to  identify  particularly  in  young  children. Insufficient data are available to recommend the use of abacavir in children.

## Benefit/risk assessment

The data demonstrates the efficacy of abacavir treatment, particularly in combination with lamivudine and  zidovudine  in  treatment  naïve  patients  where  the  antiviral  effect  appears  sustained  to  at  least 48 weeks and non-inferior to a combination with indinavir.

A major point for discussion in the CPMP pertained to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which might  have  a  fatal  outcome.  There  were  concerns  that  hypersensitivity  reactions  appeared  in  wellmonitored  patients  and  that  rechallenges  had  occurred  despite  recommendations  not  to  reintroduce abacavir after primary symptoms compatible with a hypersensitivity reaction.

Despite  the  urgent  need  for  paediatric  formulations  of  antiretroviral  medicinal  products,  major concerns  are  raised  regarding  the  safety  profile  in  children  rendering  the  benefit  risk  assessment negative in children at the present time. This position could be re-evaluated with additional clinical experience.

The applicant discussed issues on efficacy (duration of antiviral effect, PIs sparing treatment effects, advanced  patient  populations)  and  safety  (hypersensitivity  reaction)  raised  by  the  CPMP  during  a hearing before the Committee:

During  their  presentation  the  applicant  provided  results  from  study  CNAAB  3005  indicating  a sustained  antiviral  response  up  to  48  weeks  with  abacavir  in  combination  with  zidovudine  and lamivudine, similar to the control arm with the triple combination with indinavir.

The CPMP made the following points in relation to the concerns over hypersensitivity reaction:

- Conditions of prescription should be restricted as indicated in section 4.2 of the SPC.
- Patients should be clinically evaluated every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment.
- The  alert  card  for  patients  could  help  to  emphasise  the  major  concerns  of  hypersensitivity reaction and to prevent re-challenge.
- Intensive  surveillance  safety  reviews  to  be  carried  out  post  opinion.  Monthly  safety  updates taking into consideration the US experience in particular. If necessary to introduce revisions in the SPC.
- To present monthly line-listings of all hypersensitivity reactions and deaths during the first year after marketing.
- Quarterly PSURs to be requested during the first year of marketing.
- A development program of tests aimed at confirming the diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction.

In addition, complimentary information and analyses of safety issues were requested as commitments and were detailed in the letter of undertaking signed by the applicant on 25 March 1999, appended to the CPMP opinion.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit risk profile of Ziagen in the combination treatment of HIV infection was favourable and issued a positive opinion on the following indication:

\"Ziagen is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults.

The demonstration of benefit of Ziagen is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatmentnaïve patients on combination therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine.\"
