## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for perampanel, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In  view  of  the  18  cases  of  psychotic  disorders  from  clinical  trials  including  10  cases  with  positive dechallenge, the literature (2 case reports), spontaneous reports including in 10 cases a close temporal relationship,  a  positive  dechallenge  in  6  cases  and  rechallenge  in  1  case,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal relationship  between  perampanel  and  psychotic  disorder  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing perampanel should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for perampanel the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing perampanel is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
