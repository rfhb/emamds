## 1. Background information on the procedure

Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  (tenofovir  DF,  TDF)  is  a  nucleotide  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor (NtRTI). Viread tablets (containing 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil as fumarate, equivalent to 300 mg tenofovir  DF  or  136  mg  of  tenofovir)  was  first  approved  in  United  States  (US)  (26  October  2001), European Union (EU)(5 February 2002), and other countries worldwide for the treatment of human immunodeficiency  virus  type  1  (HIV-1)  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  (ARV)  medicinal products  in  infected  adults  age  18  years  and  older.  Viread  was  subsequently  approved  for  the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in EU (23 April 2008) and US.

In the US, Viread tablets were approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg on 25 March 2010.

This  type  II  variation  for  Viread  245  mg  film-coated  tablets  sought  to  extend  the  indication  for  the treatment of HIV-1 to include treatment-experienced adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg.

This  submission presented pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy, and safety data for tenofovir DF that are pertinent  to  the  assessment  of  the  tenofovir  DF  300-mg  tablet  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infected subjects in the EU who are 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg.

The principal PK, efficacy, and safety data for tenofovir DF in HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age are from an ongoing, long-term, Phase 3 clinical study sponsored by Gilead Sciences, GS-US104-0321.

This  application  was  further  supported  by  final  clinical  study  reports  from  earlier  PK  and  safety paediatric  studies  of  tenofovir  DF:  GS-01-926  (96  weeks),  GS-01-927  (96  weeks),  and  GS-02-983 (single dose). Data from these studies supported Viread dose selection in Study GS-US-104-0321, and the  overall  safety  and  activity  profile  of  Viread  for  paediatric  use.  This  application  also  included cumulative assessments of paediatric safety and efficacy data for tenofovir DF from the Gilead Drug Safety and Public Health's database and from published and unpublished literature.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/18/2010 for the following conditions:

-  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease resulting in other conditions.
-  Chronic viral hepatitis B

The PIP is not yet completed.

The  paediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  for  Viread  was  agreed  on  08  February  2010  (EMEA-000533PIP01-08. It has to be noted that the PIP for Viread was submitted at a late stage regarding the HIV indication since the proposed studies for the paediatric development had been almost completed. The pivotal studies presented in the setting of the PIP were the currently analyzed study GS-US-104-0321

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(in  adolescents  aged  12-&lt;18  years)  and  study  GS-US-104-0352  (in  children  aged  2-&lt;12  years). Although  the  PDCO  could  agree  upon  the  MAH's  approach,  concerns  were  raised  as  regards  bone toxicity and maturation.

## 2. Scientific overview and discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

The pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and the general virologic and immunologic principles underlying the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are similar between HIV-1 infected adults and HIV-1 infected paediatric  patients.  However,  there  are  some  important  and  unique  issues  for  infants,  children,  and adolescents, including the following:

- Acquisition of infection through perinatal exposure for many infected children
-  In  utero,  intrapartum,  and/or  postpartum  neonatal  exposure  to  zidovudine  and  other  ARV medications in most perinatally infected children
- Age-specific differences in CD4 cell counts
- Changes in PK parameters with age caused by the continuing development and maturation of organ systems involved in drug metabolism and clearance
- Special considerations associated with adherence to ART for infants, children, and adolescents.

As was specified in the PIP report, few direct HIV surveillance data are available for children. Estimates for  the  prevalence of HIV in children are obtained through modelling that is based primarily on HIV prevalence estimates in adult women (ages 15 to 49 years), fertility rates, and assumptions about the survival of HIV 1 infected children. Such estimates show that the number of children living with HIV globally continues to increase steadily; however, new HIV infections in children appear to have peaked between 2000 and 2002. Globally, an estimated 370,000 children aged up to 14 years became infected with HIV in 2007 (UNAIDS report on the Global AIDS epidemic, 2008, accessed at www.unaids.org, 13 February 2009).

Currently, highly active combination regimens including at least three drugs are recommended; such regimens have been associated with enhanced survival, reduction in opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, improved growth and neurocognitive function, and improved quality of life in children. At present, in EU, the treatment of choice for HIV-infected children comprises 2 NRTIs with either a NNRTI or a ritonavir-boosted PI.

International treatment guidelines list tenofovir DF as a preferred NRTI/NtRTI in an ARV regimen for initial therapy in HIV-1 infected adults. US guidelines listed tenofovir DF as a preferred NRTI/NtRTI in an ARV regimen for initial therapy in HIV-1 infected postpubertal or Tanner stage 4 adolescents only. TDF is not recommended in children in Tanner stages 1 to 3 due to lack of paediatric dosing data, an age-appropriate formulation, and concerns related to bone toxicity (Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy  and  Medical  Management  of  HIV  Infected  Children.  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Antiretroviral Agents in Paediatric HIV Infection: February 23, 2009).

In Europe, 2009 treatment guidelines indicate that tenofovir DF is not licensed for use in patients &lt; 18 years  of  age,  and  that  data  on  safe  long-term  use  from  a  young  age  are  lacking;  however,  the guidelines suggest that tenofovir DF can be used as first-line therapy in adolescents, particularly as part  of  a  fixed-dose  combination,  i.e.,  Truvada  or  Atripla  (PENTA  2009  guidelines  for  the  use  of antiretroviral therapy in paediatric HIV-1 infection. HIV Med 2009).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Non clinical aspects

The  (Marketing  authorisation  holder)  MAH  provided  a  comprehensive  programme  of  pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies with tenofovir DF in nonadult animals that was undertaken in support of the Marketing Authorization Application. The preclinical studies were conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys in order to characterize the potential toxicity of tenofovir in nonadult animals, especially bone and renal toxicity, to assess the reversibility in newborn and juvenile animals, to determine the safety margins from exposure data, and to compare effects between juvenile and adult animals.

Given that the toxicological profile of Tenofovir DF is characterized in multiple juvenile animals and the long-term  effects  of  tenofovir  DF  on  growth  have  been  identified  in  those  species,  no  additional juvenile  animal  studies  are  requested  to  support  the  use  of  tenofovir  DF  for  the  treatment  of  HIVinfected treatment-experienced adolescent patients. As a result of those studies, bone toxicity findings in  juvenile  animals  are  known  and  included  in  section  5.3  of  the  SmPC.  This  section  was  further reworded (see section 3.5).

Finally, findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in bone mineral density. For this reason, the MAH plans to conduct in vitro nonclinical studies to evaluate a potential inhibitory effect of tenofovir DF on absorption of phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract. This study is reflected in the last submitted RMP version 9 (under evaluation).

## 2.2.1. Environmental risk assessment

In the context of this variation, the MAH has provided a new environmental risk assessment with an updated analysis regarding the outcome of tier A and effects analysis.

The outcome of Tier A Fate and effects analysis calculations (Predicted Environmental Concentration/Predicted  No  Effect  Concentration  ratios)  have  been  reviewed,  and  the  values  for tenofovir DF remain substantially less than 1 based on use for all indications.

Based  on  the  above  results,  there  should  be  no  significant  increase  in  the  risk  to  the  environment arising  from  the  introduction  of  Viread  film-coated  tablets  for  treatment  of  HIV-1  treatmentexperienced adolescents from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Clinical pharmacology

## 2.3.1.1. Clinical pharmacokinetics

Age-related differences in pharmacology may occur due to increased apparent clearance and/or lower bioavailability in children relative to adults. These factors were taken into account with dose selection for paediatric subjects, with the aim of targeting tenofovir systemic exposure similar to that seen in adults receiving the tenofovir DF 300-mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH provided a summary of the available pharmacokinetic data for tenofovir that are pertinent to the assessment of tenofovir DF for the treatment of HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age. Results from 4 clinical studies were presented:

Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects

| Study          | Study Design         | Age Group (years)   |   NumberofSubjects Evaluated |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| GS-US-104-0321 | Multidose,Phase3     | 12 -<18             |                            8 |
| GS-01-926      | Multidose,Phase1     | 6-16inclusive       |                           18 |
| GS-01-927      | Multidose,Phase1/2   | 9-16inclusive       |                            7 |
| GS-02-983      | Single-dose, Phase 1 | 2-8inclusive        |                           12 |

Initial  clinical  studies  were  undertaken  using  an  oral  suspension  formulation  (GS-02-983  in  HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to 8 years of age) and 75-mg tablets of tenofovir DF (GS-01-926 and GS-01-927 in HIV-1  infected  subjects  6  to  16  years  of  age).  Each  of  these  studies  included  pharmacokinetic assessments for all subjects. Based on data from these studies, the dose of tenofovir DF selected for investigation  in  study  GS-US-104-0321  was  8  mg/kg  of  actual  body  weight  to  a  maximum  of  300 mg/day.

## 2.3.1.1.1. Initial PK studies

##  study GS-01-926

Pharmacokinetic evaluations were conducted for all 18 treated paediatric subjects after the first dose of tenofovir DF 175 mg/m2, and for 16 subjects for whom data were available at the Week 4 time point.

On Day 1 (n = 18), the median doses of tenofovir DF adjusted for body weight and BSA were 7.07 mg/kg  (range,  3.74  to  10.04  mg/kg)  and  208.03  mg/m2  (range,  160.52  to  255.14  mg/m2), respectively.

At Week 4 (n = 15), the median doses of tenofovir DF adjusted for body weight and BSA were 7.03 mg/kg  (range,  3.63  to  9.78  mg/kg)  and  207.47  mg/m2  (range,  158.31  to  250.96  mg/m2), respectively.

Following  a  single  dose  of  tenofovir  DF,  mean  maximum  observed  concentration  of  drug  in  serum, plasma, or peripheral (Cmax) and AUCinf were lower than target exposures. At steady state, mean Cmax and area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero (predose) over the blood mononuclear  cells  (AUCtau)  in  subjects  receiving  multiple  doses  of  tenofovir  DF  with  other  ARVs, including  those  known  to  increase  tenofovir  concentrations,  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in adults receiving tenofovir DF at 300 mg/day.

This study has been previously assessed by the CHMP in the setting of FUM56 in 2006. On the basis of the limited data available and in view of the marked inter- variability observed, it was concluded that the 8mg/kg dose for paediatric patients would need to be further substantiated in future studies.

##  Study GS-01-927

The mean tenofovir DF daily dose was 5.7 mg/kg (range 4.7-6.8 mg/kg).

Following  a  single  dose  of  tenofovir  DF,  mean  Cmax  and  AUCinf  were  lower  than  target  exposures. Mean Cmax and AUCtau in subjects receiving multiple doses of tenofovir DF with other ARVs, including those  known  to  increase  tenofovir  concentrations,  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in  adults receiving tenofovir DF at 300 mg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This study has been previously assessed by the CHMP in the setting of FUM OTH57 in 2006, where it was concluded that the study was too limited to support any TDF target dose in children.

##  Study GS-02-983

Administration of tenofovir DF oral suspension with food at a dose of 8 mg/kg of body weight to HIV-1 infected  subjects  2  to  8  years  of  age  resulted  in  systemic  exposures  that  were  similar  to  those observed in HIV-1 infected adults  administered  a  single  dose  of  the  commercially  available  300-mg tablet with food (Study GS-97-901). The median T½ was also similar between paediatric subjects and adults.

This study has been previously assessed by the CHMP in the setting of FUM 193 in 2006. The similarity of  exposures between adults (historical data) and children aged 2-8 years of age who received TDF oral  suspension  at  a  dose  of  8mg/kg  was  endorsed.  However,  considering  the  apparent  lack  of  a bioequivalence study between the approved TDF 300 mg tablets and TDF (20 mg/mL) oral suspension, it  was  questioned whether the data collected in study GS-02-983 with the oral suspension could be extrapolated to carry out the paediatric development with an alternative formulation.

## 2.3.1.1.2. Study GS-US-104-0321 (also named -0321)

All subjects in the tenofovir DF group in the pivotal Phase 3 study, GS-US-104-0321, were 12 to &lt; 18 years of age at enrolment and received the tenofovir 300 mg tablet once daily. A substudy (n = 8) was included to assess tenofovir PK parameters following administration of the tenofovir DF tablet for at least  4  weeks  in  order  to  confirm  the  appropriateness  of  the  300  mg  dose  in  this  population.  Mean (± SD) Cmax and AUCtau are 0.38 ± 0.13 μ g/ml and 3.39 ± 1.22 μ g·h/ml, respectively.

Steady-state tenofovir exposures achieved in subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving tenofovir DF 300 mg/day were similar to those observed in adults receiving tenofovir DF 300 mg/day (Studies GS97-901 and GS-99-907). These data confirm the appropriateness of the 300 mg once-daily dose of tenofovir DF for subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age.

a Measured after a minimum of 4 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF; PK samples collected up to 12 hours postdose.

b Parameter was estimated using predose concentration as a surrogate for the concentration at the 24-hour time point.

## 2.3.1.1.3. Renal Impairment

Tenofovir  DF  dose-interval  adjustment  is  required  for  adult  patients  with  calculated  creatinine clearance  &lt;  50  mL/min.  No  data  are  available  to  make  recommendations  for  dose  adjustment  in patients 12 to &lt; 18 years of age with renal impairment.

## 2.3.1.1.4. Potential for Drug Interactions

The  PK  drug-drug  interaction  potential  of  tenofovir  DF  and  various  ARVs  have  been  extensively evaluated in adults, and results from these studies are considered appropriate for extrapolation to the paediatric population.

## 2.3.1.1.5. Discussion

Although the 3 Phase I-I/II studies in HIV-infected children provided some grounds in favour of the 8mg/kg dose, some doubts on the appropriateness of this dose were raised by the CHMP at the time of their assessment in 2006. Furthermore, two of these studies were conducted with a 75mg tablet and the remaining study with an oral suspension, all 3 formulations had been abandoned by the MAH.

The overall PK data available, including the PK data in adolescent from the study -921, show an almost similar exposure in adolescents and adults dosed with the 300mg tablet. The proposed 300mg dose (equivalent to a 8mg/kg dose for patient with 37.5kg weight) in adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 years and weighting ≥ 35kg is  therefore  supported. Therefore, extrapolation of interaction data from adults to the adolescent population can be acknowledged.

Of note, to be eligible in the pivotal adolescent study -321, patients should have estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73m2 (Estimated by Schwartz Formula).

No data are available to make recommendations for dose adjustment in patients 12 to &lt; 18 years of age with renal impairment.

Results  from  PK  drug-drug  interaction  in  adults  are  considered  appropriate  for  extrapolation  to  the paediatric population.

| Criteria for evaluation   | Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was time-weighted average change from baseline through Week 24 (DAVG24) in plasma HIV-1 RNA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Dosing regimen            | Adolescent (weighing ≥ 35 kg) received the 300mg dose of TDF (i.e. approved adult dose). All subjects were instructed to take their assigned tenofovir DF dose orally, once daily, without regard to meals. The tenofovir DF tablets were film-coated to mask taste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Study design              | This was a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi- center study of the safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF as part of an optimized antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1 infected adolescents (12 years to < 18 years of age) who were failing their current antiretroviral regimen and had HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 1000 copies/mL at screening. Two consecutive 96-week study extensions (ongoing) will evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of open-label tenofovir DF as part of an optimized antiviral regimen, providing data for up to 240 weeks of total drug exposure. |

## Disposition of patients

Of  the  123  subjects  screened,  90  were  randomized  at  17  sites  in  Brazil  (n  =  86)  and  one  site  in Panama (n = 4): 46 in TDF arm and 44 in placbo arm.

Of the 87 randomized and treated subjects, 56 completed the 48-week double-blind treatment period (27 subjects [60.0%] in the tenofovir DF group and 29 subjects [69.0%] in the placebo group).

The most common reason for discontinuation of study drug was virologic failure (14 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 11 subjects in the placebo group).

## Demographic and baseline characteristics

Overall,  demographic  and  general  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  between  the  two  treatment groups.

Subjects in the RAT analysis set in the randomized phase were 56.3% female, with a mean age of 14 years (range, 12 to 17 years). All were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and most were white (51.7%) or black (28.7%). The mean value for BMI at screening was 19.33 kg/m2.

Overall, the mean (SD) baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.64 (0.734) log10 copies/mL, CD4 cell count was 374 (223.5) cells/mm3, and CD4% was 17.7 (9.00).

The disease characteristics reflect a patient population with advanced HIV infection.

The route of contamination (vertical or horizontal) was not available in the report.

## Treatment characteristics

Prior  antiretroviral  experience  was  similar  in  the  tenofovir  DF  and  placebo  groups.  The  majority  of subjects in this study had prior experience with medications from all three of the major antiretroviral drug classes (100.0% with nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs], 82.8% with protease inhibitors [PIs], and  64.4%  with  nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]). The most frequently used NRTIs were zidovudine and lamivudine (including the fixed dose combination  of  these  products),  didanosine  and  stavudine.  The  most  frequently  used  PIs  were nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. The most frequently used NNRTI was efavirenz.

Of note, higher proportions of subjects in the tenofovir DF group compared to the placebo group had baseline genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) for OBR ≤ 1 (40.0% vs 23.8% [French National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS) rules]), indicating that the tenofovir DF group had less active concomitant antiretroviral drugs, and baseline GSS for tenofovir DF &lt; 1 (55.6% vs. 40.5%); these subjects would not be expected to respond to tenofovir DF treatment).

## Measurement of treatment adherence

Adherence  to  study  drug  in  the  double-blind  treatment  period  was  similar  in  the  tenofovir  DF  and placebo groups (median 93.1% in the tenofovir DF group and 93.8% in the placebo group); however, only 39.1% of subjects overall (TDF: 37.8%, Pbo: 40.5%) maintained an adherence rate to study drug of ≥ 95%.

## 2.3.2.2. Results

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  time-weighted  average  change  from  baseline  through  Week  24 (DAVG24) in plasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL).

Both treatment groups exhibited clinically relevant decreases from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA; the median DAVG24 in plasma HIV-1 RNA was -1.580 log10 copies/mL in the tenofovir DF group (n = 44) and -1.549 log10 copies/mL in the placebo group (n = 41) (p = 0.55, Van Elteren test). However, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the DAVG24 in plasma HIV-1 RNA or for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints at any of the timepoints analysed.

In  subjects  with  an  ANRS  OBR  GSS ≤ 1.0,  the  difference  in  median  DAVG24  in  plasma  HIV-1  RNA between treatment groups (tenofovir DF minus placebo) was -0.518 log10 copies/mL ( -1.658 log10 copies/mL in the tenofovir DF group [n = 18] and -1.140 log10 copies/mL in the placebo group [n = 10]).  Differences  between  tenofovir  DF  and  placebo  in  this  subgroup  were  maintained  at  Week  48 (difference in median DAVG48 in plasma HIV-1 RNA was -0.570 log10 copies/mL). These results were confirmed using the genotypic resistance interpretation rules of the Stanford HIV database.

No significant differences were seen between treatment groups for any subgroup analyses (sex, race, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level at baseline, and baseline GSS) of DAVG24 in plasma HIV-1 RNA.

No significant differences were seen between treatment groups for secondary virologic endpoints in the intent-to-treat (population) (ITT) analysis set. The median change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 48 (last observation carried forward (LOCF)) was -0.97 log10 copies/mL in the tenofovir DF group (n = 44) and -1.53 log10 copies/mL in the placebo group (n = 41). The proportion of subjects who had an HIV-1 RNA decrease from  baseline  of ≥ 1.0  log10  copies/mL  at  Week  48  (LOCF)  was 47.7% in the tenofovir DF group (n = 44) and 53.7% in the placebo group (n = 41). The proportion of subjects  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  &lt;  400  copies/mL  at  Week  48  (M  =  F)  was  34.1%  (15/44)  in  the tenofovir DF group and 43.9% (18/41) in the placebo group. The proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (M = F) was 27.3% (12/44) in the tenofovir DF group and 36.6% (15/41) in the placebo group.

Results of post-hoc subgroup analyses for subjects with baseline ANRS OBR GSS ≤ 1 showed clinically relevant differences (in favour of TDF) between tenofovir DF (n = 18) and placebo (n = 10) groups in the  median  change  from  baseline  in  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  concentration  (median  of -1.24  log10 copies/mL  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group  vs. -0.63  log10  copies/mL  in  the  placebo  group  at  Week  48, LOCF)  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  an  HIV-1  RNA  decrease  from  baseline  of ≥ 1.0  log10 copies/mL (55.6% in the tenofovir DF group vs. 40.0% in the placebo group at Week 48, LOCF). There

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between  tenofovir  DF  and  placebo  for  the  number  and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL and &lt; 50 copies/mL in the subgroup analyses.

Although  an  immunologic  recovery  was  seen  in  both  treatment  groups,  there  was  no  significant difference between treatment groups at baseline or for the change from baseline in CD4 cell count or CD4 percentage at any postbaseline timepoint up to Week 48 (missing = excluded (M = E analysis)). The median change at Week 48 was 152 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir DF group and 148 cells/mm3 in the placebo group (p = 0.47).

## Virology results

Ninety subjects randomized to either the tenofovir DF or placebo groups were genotyped for their HIV1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes at screening.

Postbaseline HIV genotypes were performed on subjects who had virologic failure, or had HIV-1 viral load ≥ 400 copies/mL at Week 24, Week 48, Week 96, Early Discontinuation, or their last available plasma  sample  prior  to  the  Week  48  analysis  data  cutoff  dates.  However,  a  genotypic  assay  at  an earlier time point was not always performed if a later genotype was available.

## Screening HIV Genotypic Analysis

The study population had evidence of extensive prior antiretroviral therapy experience at screening, with  90% of  subjects  having  HIV  that  contained  one  or  more  NRTI-associated  resistance  mutations (NAMs).  The  mean  number  of  NAMs  was  4.8  and  3.9  in  the  tenofovir  DF  and  placebo  groups, respectively. Similarly, 80% of subjects had HIV with thymidine-analog associated mutations (TAMs) at screening (mean 3.0 and 2.2 TAMs in the tenofovir DF and placebo groups, respectively). TAMs were reported in 84% of patients in the tenofovir arm versos 76% in the placebo arm.  In the tenofovir DF and placebo groups, 49% and 33% of subjects, respectively, had HIV containing three or more TAMs that included M41L and/or L210W mutations. This pattern of resistance mutations has been associated with poor response to tenofovir DF in previous studies of treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected adults.

In addition, 53% of subjects in the study had HIV containing an NNRTI-associated resistance mutation, 61% contained major protease resistance mutations, and all subjects had HIV containing at least one secondary protease resistance mutation.

## HIV-1 Subtype Distribution at Screening

HIV-1 subtype analyses showed the majority of subjects were infected with subtype B (67%) followed by subtype C (17%).

## Emerging Resistance Mutations

During the study, treatment with tenofovir DF or placebo in combination with other antiretroviral drugs resulted  in  the  development  of  additional  NRTI-associated  resistance  mutations  in  24%  (11/46)  of subjects in the overall resistance analysis population. Numerically, more subjects developed NAMs in the tenofovir DF group 9/29 (31%) than in the placebo group 2/17 (12%). This difference is due to more subjects developing K65R (n = 1), M184V (n = 4), and TAMs (n = 4) in the tenofovir DF group as compared to the placebo group (n = 0, n = 2, and n = 1, respectively). Of note, RAP subjects from the  tenofovir  DF  group  were  analyzed  for  resistance  development  following  a  longer  period  of  drug exposure  than  subjects  from  the  placebo  group  due  to  the  inclusion  of  the  open-label  tenofovir  DF period for subjects in the tenofovir DF group (mean time from baseline to analysis was 345 days for the tenofovir DF group vs. 275 days for the placebo group).

One subject in the tenofovir DF group developed K65R. This subject had HIV-1 subtype C. No subject developed HIV with K70E, a T69 insertion mutation, or Q151M in RT. TAMs and M184V emerged in HIV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from  subjects  treated  in  both  arms  of  the  study.  These  results  are  similar  to  the  observations  of resistance development in treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected adults.

Data from large genotypic databases have shown the K65R mutation to be generally infrequent. One study 1 has described that HIV-1 subtype C viruses rapidly develop K65R resistance in vitro, and it is concluded  that  tenofovir  based  regimens  will  need  close  monitoring  in  subtype  C  infections  by  the possibility of selection of K65R. The MAH committed to monitor the literature and clinical trials for the occurrence  of  K65R  among  patients  infected  with  subtype  C  HIV-1.    Results  of  monitoring  to  be summarized in future PSURs for Viread and other tenofovir DF containing products, as appropriate (see letter of undertaking).

Thirty-six subjects originally randomized to the placebo group entered the open-label extension phase and received tenofovir DF. Sixteen of these subjects (44%) were evaluated for resistance development during  the  extension  phase;  HIV  genotypic  data  were  available  for  14  subjects.  NRTI  resistance mutations developed in the HIV from 5/14 subjects (36%) and consisted of one TAM (2 subjects with T215F and 1 subject with L210W), A62V+M184V+T215Y (1 subject), or V75I (1 subject). Four of these 5 subjects had HIV with extensive NRTI resistance that included multiple TAMs at screening. Of the 14 subjects in this group, additional NNRTI resistance developed in HIV from 5 subjects and primary PI resistance  developed  in  HIV  from  4  subjects.  Seven  of  these  14  subjects  did  not  have  further development of NRTI, NNRTI, or primary PI mutations in their HIV. No subject in this group developed K65R.

In  Study  GS-US-104-0321,  efficacy  outcomes  at  Week  96  (n  =  12)  were  as  follows:  the  median change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA was -1.97 log10 copies/mL, 58.3% of subjects had plasma HIV-1  RNA  &lt;  400  copies/mL,  41.7%  of  subjects  had  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  &lt;  50  copies/mL,  and  the median change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 216 cells/mm3.

In Study GS-01-926, despite extensive prior ART experience, some children and adolescents were able to  achieve  and  maintain  virologic  suppression  and  immunologic  responses  through  96  weeks  of treatment with tenofovir DF as part of the ARV regimen.

In Study GS-01-927, treatment with tenofovir DF as part of the ARV regimen resulted in a decline in median plasma HIV-1 RNA from baseline to Week 108. This overall decline was seen despite high prior exposure and virologic failure/intolerance  to  multiple  ARVs in all  subjects.  Similarly,  the  majority  of subjects showed modest increases in CD4% during the study.

A  review  of  paediatric  efficacy  data  from  published  and  unpublished  literature  (to  31  March  2010) describing  non-Gilead-sponsored  prospective  and  retrospective  clinical  studies  was  performed  in support  of  this  submission.  Approximately  600  subjects  received  tenofovir  DF  in  these  studies presented in these literature articles. Clinically and immunologically stable subjects who switched to a tenofovir DF-containing regimen maintained virologic suppression and stable CD4 counts/percentages (e.g.,  Vigano  et  al.,  Rosso).  Long-term  (up  to  5  years)  maintenance  of  virologic  suppression  and immunologic control was demonstrated in subjects receiving tenofovir DF-containing regimens (Cerini).

## 2.3.2.3. Discussion

To  support  the  extension  of  the  indication  for  Viread  in  treatment-experienced  adolescents  infected with HIV, the MAH submitted the 48 weeks results of an ongoing study, GS-US-104-0321. This study is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the Safety and Efficacy of Tenofovir

DF as part of an Optimized Antiretroviral Regimen in HIV-1 Infected Adolescents. The study initiated in 2006 is characterized by an outdated design and was conducted exclusively in Brazil and Panama. No EU  adolescents  were  included  in  the  pivotal  study  and  few  data  from  EU  children  are  available  to support the application. The study population consists in highly treatment experienced adolescents.

The study failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. No significant differences were found in virologic response between patients treated with TDF or placebo (+OBR). When considering that 300mg TDF yielded similar exposure in adolescents as compared to adult patients, there is no reason to think that Viread would have different viral efficacy in these populations. The poor efficacy reported in the TDF arm is more likely the reflection of pejorative baseline characteristics (in terms of OBR susceptibility and TDF resistance) in adolescent included in the TDF arm. In the subgroup analysis for subjects with OBR GSS ≤ 1 (TDF n=18, placebo n=10) it was found that TDF exhibited some activity in this highly pretreated patients contrarily to placebo which favours this hypothesis.

Even  though  the  lack  of  statistical  difference  between  tenofovir  and  placebo  could  translate  the inability of tenofovir to express its antiviral activity due to the extensive baseline NRTI resistance and the efficacy of the OBR, it is not considered acceptable to judge the benefit of a drug in adolescents on a basis of a 'negative' study on virologic endpoints. This raised a major objection.

Due  to  the  major  objections  raised  the  MAH  has  not  pursued  anymore  the  request  to  extend  the therapeutic indication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg. The SmPC was updated to reflect the 48-week results of study GS-US-104-0321 (see section 3.5).

## 2.3.3. Clinical safety

The safety profile of tenofovir DF has been studied in 118 subjects (including 36 patients that switched from placebo to TDF in the phase 3 study), regardless of the dose and treatment duration. A total of 81 patients aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years old, as requested in the indication, have been treated during 48 weeks with the proposed dose of 300mg once daily in the pivotal study. This study is ongoing and the data are only available for completed randomized period of 48 weeks.

The  number  of  patients  with  any  AE,  serious  AE,  grade ≥ 3  AE,  and  withdrawal  due  to  any  AE  was significantly  higher  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  No  death  has  been reported during the phase 3 study. One death occurred during paediatric development programme in 11-year old boy affected by subarachnoid haemorrhage leading to cardiac arrest and death, previously treated  for  an  episode  of  staphylococcal  infection.  No  other  information  on  infection  status  of  this patient was given.

The  most  frequently  represented  SOCs  with  tenofovir  DF  were:  Infections  And  Infestations  in  more than  90%  of  subjects,  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  with  64.4%  AEs,  and  Mediastinal,  thoracic  and respiratory disorders with 35.6% of affected children. A significantly higher rate of AEs for these SOCs was reported in tenofovir-treated subjects compared with placebo group. Vomiting and nausea were reported  more  than  3-fold.  In  addition,  twice  as  much  of  patients  experienced  sinusitis,  upper respiratory infection and diarrhoea in the tenofovir group compared to placebo.

A statistically  significant  higher  number  of  severe  AEs  was  reported  in  tenofovir  group  compared  to placebo  arm  (22.2%  vs  7.1%),  including  8  cases  of  infections,  3  pneumonia,  2  sinusitis  and  2 pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and 1 case of cryptococcosis infection. In addition, one severe case of proteinuria has been reported and is of concern.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One discontinuation due to vomiting, considered to be related to study drug, occurred in tenofovir arm while no discontinuation was reported in placebo arm.

The  gastrointestinal  disorders,  and  notably  vomiting,  were  of  particularly  high  frequency  in  the tenofovir  group  (64,4%  including  35,6%  of  vomiting)  compared  to  placebo  group  (38,1%  including 11,9% of vomiting). Given this high percentage of vomiting, the long-term tolerance of tenofovir DF is questionable  in  real  life.  Additionally,  more  discontinuations  could  be  expected,  which  could  lead  to resistance emergence.

Regarding renal toxicity, renal TEAEs were more frequent in tenofovir group (13,3%) compared to the placebo group (10%). Seven cases of grade 1 proteinuria have been reported in the tenofovir group compared  to  2  cases  in  the  placebo  group.  One  case  of  proteinuria  was  reported  as  serious  AE. Estimated  Creatinine  Clearance  decreased  during  the  blinding  period  in  both  groups  but  more significantly  in  tenofovir  group  (-11  mL/min/1.73  vs  -5,35  mL/min/1.73).  When  considering  the updated  (from  the  cut  off)  safety  data  from  study  0321  where  35  patients  are  still  ongoing  in  the study,  no  new  AEs  were  reported  related  to  renal  safety.  However,  treatment-emergent  grade  1 hypophosphatemia in 2 patients, 11 grade 1 proteinuria and 1 more case of grade 3 proteinuria are to be noted.

With regard to bone toxicity, 5 cases of osteopenia, of which 2 cases in patients previously treated by placebo, were considered to be related to study drug in the tenofovir group compared to only one case in the placebo group.

In addition, 2 cases of fracture have been reported including a case of 15-year old girl noted to have osteopenia at baseline. Although this fracture was not considered to be related to study drug, subject's bone frailty due to osteopenia could be a risk factor facilitating the occurrence of the fracture.

Regarding bone parameters, although there was no significant difference in the percent change from the baseline to week 24 and 48 in spine BMD and total BMD, a trend of lower increase was noted for tenofovir group compared to placebo as well as the decrease of total body BMD Z-score. Week 96 data available showed for 28 subjects decrease in BMD Z-scores for both spine (mean change of -0.341, median change of -0.353) and total body (mean change of -0.458, median change of -0.407). In addition, 6 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 1 subject in the placebo group had decreases from baseline in spine BMD of &gt; 4% at Week 48.

A  placebo-controlled  study  in  hepatitis  B  virus  in  106  adolescents  that  could  provide  further information on safety is ongoing and data are not yet available. A total of 19 SAEs have been reported, including  one  hand  fracture  and  1  nephrectomy,  but  taking  into  account  that  treatment  assignment remains blinded, it is not known whether it is related to the active treatment.

Furthermore, safety data from Study 0352 in patients 2 to &lt;12 years-old was presented. In this study no fractures were reported. The percentage increases from baseline in total body BMD were smaller in the  tenofovir  DF  group  than  in  the  stavudine  or  zidovudine  group  (median  changes  at  Week  48: 1.220% versus 2.679%, p = 0.043), and there was a modest reduction in total body BMD Z-score in the tenofovir DF group (median change at Week 48: -0.215) compared to no change in the stavudine or  zidovudine  group.  In  the  All  TDF  group,  the  median  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  96  were statistically significant (median change at Week 96: -0.267). From baseline to Week 96, the clinical status category for total body BMD Z-score worsened for 11 subjects (n = 64).

According to a Guidelines for the use of ART agents in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents, 'youth who are in their growth spurt period (i.e., Tanner Stage III in females and Tanner Stage IV in males) and who are using adult or paediatric dosing guidelines and those adolescents whose doses have been transitioned  from  paediatric  to  adult  doses  should  be  closely  monitored  for  medication  efficacy  and toxicity'. In study GS-US-104-0321, the information on Tanner stage at baseline was available in only

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

30 out of 87 patients (information on Tanner stage was requested post-hoc in response to the query from PDCO at the time of the assessment of the Viread PIP): 17 subjects in tenofovir DF group, and 13 subjects  in  placebo  group  (All  TDF  group  contained  25  subjects).  Following  CHMP  request  the  MAH performed an analysis by Tanner strata, e.g. Tanner ≤ 3 vs. Tanner ≥ 4. Data on subjects according to Tanner stage are too limited to allow any firm conclusion regarding bone toxicity. However, a decrease in spine BMD, spine BMD Z-score, total body BMD and total body BMD Z-score has been reported in subjects  with  Tanner  stage ≤ 3.  These  results  may  indicate  that  the  bone  toxicity  may  be  more pronounced in younger adolescents with the use of tenofovir DF.

The MAH was requested to further discuss the results of bone markers in the context of values seen in a normal adolescent population. Overall, the MAH response was merely descriptive. Available evidence suggests  that  HIV-infected  children  are  at  risk  of  poorly  mineralized  bones.  The  mechanisms responsible for these alterations are believed to be multifactorial, involving both nutritional, disease related processes and antiretroviral treatment. The design of study 321 does not permit to address the ability  of  treatment  interventions  (e.g.  ensuring  adequate  vitamin  D  and  calcium  intake,  and supplementing these nutrients when necessary) to ameliorate some of the bone density effects of the disease  and  certain  treatments.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  review  available  data  and  to  provide treatment recommendations on treatment interventions (threshold level for initiating supplementation with vitamin D and calcium and dosing recommendation) for patients receiving tenofovir DF (see letter of undertaking).

Loss of bone mineral density seems higher in the tenofovir DF arm than in the placebo arm. The degree of bone mass loss is also higher in female patients than in males. Overall, the interpretation of DEXA results in the paediatric population should be done with caution due to limitations of DEXA measurements in children. Therefore, a child may most appropriately act as his or her own control, with serial scans to monitor progress. Scan intervals of less than six months should only be considered in special situations such as monitoring the response to a pharmacological intervention, and for most patients annual scans should suffice (Fewtrell MS, 2003). For patients receiving tenofovir, yearly radiologic assessment of bone mineral density by DEXA is indicated (Kim RJ et al, 2010).

Moreover, post-marketing data on tenofovir DF use in children, including 31 renal disorders out of 77 paediatric cases, four reports of rickets, and 6 cases of severe BMD decrease are not reassuring.

In conclusion, the main safety concern of tenofovir DF in adult population is related to renal and bone toxicity. Similar findings have been observed in the current application for the paediatric population. Although the medical need for additional backbone for paediatric use is acknowledged the safety profile of tenofovir is a concern. Therefore, the CHMP raised the following major objection: The bone toxicity of this drug makes it 'a priori' a non optimal candidate for the adolescent population as impairment of peak bone mass acquisition is of particular concern for this population. The observed trend for a lower increase of total BMD in the tenofovir group compared to the placebo group as well as the occurrence of  osteopenia after a medium term duration reinforce this concern, especially because only medium term data are available.

The  CHMP  considers  that  these  data  are  not  reassuring  to  allow  the  approval  of  the  indication  in children from 12-17 year-old, all the more that only limited data are available in term of exposure and duration.

Due  to  the  major  objections  raised  the  MAH  has  not  pursued  anymore  the  request  to  extend  the therapeutic indication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg. The SmPC was updated to reflect the 48-week safety results of study GS-US104-0321 (see section 3.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Pharmacovigilance system

## 2.4.1. Risk management plan

The  degree  to  which  tenofovir  causes  bone  changes  by  direct  osteoclast/osteoblast  toxicity  and/or affects proximal renal tubuli is unknown.  The MAH was asked to discuss whether bone safety should be considered as an identified risk and to update pharmacovigilance plan and minimisation activities accordingly.

The  MAH  acknowledged  the  inclusion  of  bone  events/loss  of  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  as  an important identified risk to the Viread RMP.

Additional pharmacovigilance actions associated with the risk of bone events/loss of BMD will include ongoing  long-term  studies  in  which  BMD  is  being  measured  by  dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA)  in  adult  and  pediatric  subjects  for  both  HIV-1  and  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  indications.  The planned, randomized, controlled clinical study of HBV infected subjects 2 to &lt; 12 years of age (Study GS-US-174-0144) will be used to elucidate the relationship between BMD changes and proximal renal tubulopathy, in order to contribute to the understanding of the mechanism(s) leading to decreases in BMD, and potentially support the development of appropriate management recommendations. In vitro non-clinical  studies  to  be  conducted  to  evaluate  a  potential  inhibitory  effect  of  tenofovir  DF  on absorption of phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract.

The routine risk minimization activities include an additional warning and description of data on BMD in the Viread SmPC, as described below:

## Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use

Paediatric population: Viread may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1).

## Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Paediatric population: (…)  In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as &gt; 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body.

The efficacy and safety data derived from this study do not support the use of Viread in adolescents.

An ongoing RMP update and evaluation is currently being performed (submission in parallel with the PSUR). Following the assessment of the clinical data submitted during this variation procedure, further updates in the RMP as mentioned above are required regarding bone toxicity risk. These updates on the RMP should be submitted at the time of the next PSUR submission.

## 2.5. Changes to the product information

## Section 4.1 'Therapeutic indication'

This section was not updated. The MAH's initially proposed to extend the approved indication to include treatment experienced adolescents from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg. Due to the  major  objections  raised  by  the  CHMP  (no  statistical  difference  observed  between  tenofovir  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo treatment and concerns on bone toxicity) the claim of the MAH was not accepted. The MAH not pursued anymore the request to extend the therapeutic indication.

## Section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration'

This section was updated to reflect the clinical data available in HIV-1 infected adolescents. These data are inadequate to support the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in this population. A reference was included to sections 4.4 and 5.1.

A further sentence was included to mention that no data are currently available in paediatric patients infected with chronic hepatitis B.

## Section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use'

A warning was included concerning bone toxicity. Viread may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1).

## Section  4.6 'Pregnancy and lactation'

This section was updated on CHMP request to comply with the latest available QRD templates version 7.3.1 .

## Section 4.8 'Undesirable effects'

This section was updated to reflect the study on paediatric population.

## Section 5.1 'Pharmacological properties'

This section was updated to reflect the results of study GS-US-104-032. Furthermore, data on the BMD loss observed in this study was included.

This  section  was  further  updated  to  include  a  sentence  concerning  the  deferral  of  the  obligation  to submit the results of studies with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HIV and chronic hepatitis B.

## Section 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties'

This section was updated with pharmacokinetic data.

A further statement was included to mention that pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under 12 years or with renal impairment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

This section was updated with bone toxicity data in young adult rats and dogs and in juvenile infected monkeys.

## Annex IIB Conditions of the marketing authorisation

The sentence on pharmacovigilance system was updated according to QRD templates.

The  PSUR  cycle  was  corrected  to  reflect  the  6  month  PSUR  cycle.  Following  evaluation  of  PSUR  13 (period covered: 01.04.09 - 31.03.10) the CHMP considered that due to the extension of indication of Viread in HBV patients with decompensated liver disease, the PSUR should follow a 6 month cycle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Benefit risk assessment

To  support  the  extension  of  the  indication  for  Viread  in  treatment-experienced  adolescents  infected with HIV, the MAH submitted the 48 weeks results of an ongoing study, GS-US-104-0321. This study is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the Safety and Efficacy of Tenofovir DF as Part of an Optimized Antiretroviral Regimen in HIV-1 Infected Adolescents. The study initiated in 2006 is characterized by an outdated design and was conducted exclusively in Brazil and Panama. No EU  adolescents  were  included  in  the  pivotal  study  and  few  data  from  EU  children  are  available  to support the application. The study population consists of highly treatment experienced adolescents.

The study failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. No significant differences were found in virologic response  between  patients  treated  with  TDF  or  placebo  (+OBR).  The  300mg  TDF  yielded  to  similar exposure in adolescents as compared to adult patients.  The poor efficacy reported in the TDF arm could reflect the pejorative baseline characteristics (in terms of OBR susceptibility and TDF resistance) in  adolescent included in the TDF arm. However, concerns remain to judge the benefit of a drug in adolescents on a basis of a 'negative' study on virologic endpoints.

As regards the safety, the bone toxicity of this drug makes it 'a priori' a non optimal candidate for the paediatric population. The trend for a lower increase of total BMD in the tenofovir group compared to the  placebo  group  as  well  as  the  occurrence  of  osteopenia  after  a  medium  term  duration  raises concerns on bone toxicity. Furthermore, no long term data are available in this population.

Overall, the study submitted raised concerns on the safety and efficacy of Viread in adolescents and cannot  be  regarded  as  an  adequate  basis  for  the  extension  of  indication  of  Viread  in  this  target population and the CHMP raised major objections.

Following the major objections raised by the CHMP the MAH has not pursued anymore the request to extend the therapeutic indication to include treatment-experienced adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg. The results of this study are reflected in the SmPC as detailed in section 3.5.

## 4. Recommendation on PIP

## PIP partly completed

The CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of study GS-US-104-0321 in adolescents subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan and the results of this study are reflected in the SmPC.

## 5. Conclusion

The MAH has submitted an extension of the therapeutic indication for the treatment of HIV-1 to include treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old and with body weight ≥ 35 kg.

Due to the major objections raised by the CHMP the MAH has not pursued anymore an extension of indication.

On 17 February 2011 the CHMP considered the variation:

'Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 based on the 48-week results of a safety and efficacy study GS-US-104-0321 in treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old. Annex II was updated to reflect the 6 month PSUR cycle and to be in line with QRD templates'

to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Annex II.
