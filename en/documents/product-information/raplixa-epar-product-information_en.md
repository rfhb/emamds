## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Raplixa sealant powder

## Posology

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each gram of powder contains 79 mg human fibrinogen and 726 IU human thrombin. Raplixa is supplied in three different presentations 0.5 grams (39.5 mg human fibrinogen and 363 IU human thrombin), 1 gram (79 mg human fibrinogen and 726 IU human thrombin) and 2 grams (158 mg human fibrinogen and 1452 IU human thrombin). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Sealant powder Dry white powder. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Supportive treatment where standard surgical techniques are insufficient for improvement of haemostasis. Raplixa must be used in combination with an approved gelatin sponge (see section 5.1). Raplixa is indicated in adults over 18 years of age. 4.2 Posology and method of administration The use of Raplixa is restricted to experienced surgeons. Gelatin sponges must be used in combination with Raplixa. Gelatin sponges are CE marked and separately supplied and packed (see instructions for use for the specific gelatin sponge selected for use). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The amount of Raplixa to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented towards the underlying clinical needs for the patient. The dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgery, the size of the bleeding surface area, the severity of bleeding, the mode of application selected by the surgeon, and the number of applications.

Application of the product must be individualised by the treating surgeon. In clinical trials a thin layer of Raplixa produced doses that typically ranged from 0.3 to 2 g. For some procedures eg. liver resection, larger amounts may be required. The initial amount of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should be sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area with a thin layer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of Raplixa which is then covered by an absorbable gelatin sponge (saline-wetted). The application can be repeated, if necessary.

The required dose of Raplixa, can vary based on the size of the area to be treated. In clinical trials, smaller bleeding sites (&lt; 10 cm²) used 0.5 g to 1 g on average. Larger bleeding sites used 1 to 2 grams (10-100 cm²). It is known from in vitro testing that 1 g can cover 100 cm² using the RaplixaSpray device. Maximum amount of Raplixa recommended is 3 gram.

The required dose of Raplixa based on the size of the bleeding surface area to be treated is shown in the table below:

| Maximum Surface Area Direct Application from Vial   | Maximum Surface Area Application Using RaplixaSpray   | Raplixa Package Size   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 25 cm²                                              | 50 cm²                                                | 0.5 g                  |
| 50 cm²                                              | 100 cm²                                               | 1.0 g                  |

The vial and RaplixaSpray device are taken out of their respective pouches maintaining sterility. Connect the RaplixaSpray device to the RaplixaReg pressure regulator and thereby to the medical CO2 gas supply (CO2 is recommended; Raplixa may be also used with medical grade air) set to a pressure setting of 1.5 bar (22 psi).

Table 1: Required Dose of Raplixa Paediatric Population The safety and efficacy of Raplixa in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available, Raplixa is therefore not recommended for use in children and adolescents. Elderly Dose adjustment not required. Method and route of administration For epilesional use only. For instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. One of the following methods of application of Raplixa may be used based on the type of surgery, location and size and severity of the bleeding: Direct application followed by gelatin sponge Powder is applied directly from the vial onto the bleeding surface and then applied to a CE marked gelatin sponge cut to the appropriate size and apply manual pressure with sterile gauze. Apply first to gelatin sponge Powder is applied directly from the vial onto a saline-wetted CE marked gelatin sponge and then applied to the bleeding site. When using a moistened gelatin sponge, a thin layer of Raplixa should be applied to the sponge immediately prior to application to the bleeding site. Spray application using RaplixaSpray device followed by gelatin sponge Medicinal product no longer authorised

The vial should be held upright, shaken gently and the aluminium cap and rubber stopper should be removed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The vial with powder is attached to the RaplixaSpray device by inverting the device over the upright vial and pushing the vial into place.

The RaplixaSpray device is used to spray the powder on to the bleeding site and then the gelatin sponge is applied (see Instructions For Use for RaplixaSpray device and gelatin sponge).

Application must be within 2 hours after connecting the vial to the device.

The RaplixaSpray device comes with the rigid nozzle attached. This may be removed and the flexible nozzle can be attached depending on the intended use and surgeon preference.

To avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air embolism Raplixa is recommended to be sprayed using pressurised CO2. Raplixa may also be used with medical air (see sections 4.4 and 6.6). 4.3 Contraindications Known hypersensitivity to the Raplixa active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Raplixa must not be applied intravascularly. Spray application of Raplixa must not be used in endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures . Raplixa must not be used as a glue for the fixation of patches. Raplixa must not be used as a glue for intestines (gastrointestinal anastomoses). Do not use Raplixa for treatment of severe arterial bleeding. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Use and Application For epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly. Follow specific instructions for use of the absorbable gelatin sponge. Do not use Raplixa (and gelatin sponge) in contaminated areas of the body, or in the presence of active infection. Intravascular application Life threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied intravascularly. Air or gas emboli Life threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing a pressure regulator to administer fibrin sealant/haemostatic products. This event appears to be related to the use of spray devices at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The risk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared to CO2 and therefore cannot be excluded with Raplixa . Before administration of Raplixa care is to be taken that parts of the body outside the desired application area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites. Spray application of Raplixa should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. Spray distance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer (see table in section 6.6 for pressure and distance). Medicinal product no longer authorised

When spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism.

When using accessory nozzles with this product, the instructions for use of the nozzles should be followed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity reactions

As with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity reactions may include hives, generalized urticarial, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration should be discontinued immediately. In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.

## Transmissible infectious agents

Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.

The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The measures may be of limited value against non- enveloped viruses such as HAV and parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and of individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. Haemolytic anaemia). Other Raplixa has been studied in patients undergoing spinal surgery, vascular surgery, soft tissue surgery and hepatic resection. There is limited experience of use of Raplixa in vascular surgery when applied with the RaplixaSpray device. Data are not available to support the use of this product in tissue gluing, neurosurgery, application through a flexible endoscope for treatment of bleeding or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. It is strongly recommended that every time Raplixa is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies have been performed. Raplixa may be denatured after exposure to solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. antiseptic solutions). Such substances should be removed as much as possible before applying the product. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy and Breast-feeding Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Raplixa. The safety of Raplixa for use in human pregnancy or during breast-feeding has not been established in controlled clinical trials. The product should not be administered to pregnant and breast-feeding women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Fertility

Fertility studies have not been conducted.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Not relevant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the application site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur in isolated cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants / haemostatics: these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product.

Antibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely. Inadvertent intravascular injection could lead to thromboembolic event and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and there is also a risk of anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4). Life threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulators to administer the fibrin sealant. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The risk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared to CO2 and therefore cannot be excluded with Raplixa.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: local haemostatics, other haemostatics ATC code: B02BC30

Mechanism of Action The fibrin adhesion system initiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin occurs by the splitting of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and fibrinopeptides. The fibrin monomers aggregate and form a fibrin clot. Factor XIIIa, which is activated from factor XIII by thrombin, crosslinks fibrin. Calcium ions are required for both, the conversion of fibrinogen and the crosslinkage of fibrin. As wound healing progresses, increased fibrinolytic activity is induced by plasmin and decomposition of fibrin to fibrin degradation products is initiated. Clinical studies with Raplixa demonstrating haemostasis were conducted in patients undergoing spinal (n=146), vascular (n=137), liver (n=158) and soft tissue surgery (n=125). Clinical studies in the EU were done with the CE marked Spongostan gelatin sponge. Bleeding at target sites was mild or moderate. Conventional surgical techniques such as suture, ligature and cautery were ineffective or impractical. The combination of Raplixa and a gelatin sponge reduced the median time to haemostasis at target sites by up to 2 minutes compared to a gelatin sponge alone. The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Raplixa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of haemorrhage resulting from surgical procedure as per Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) decision, for the granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Raplixa is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. As a consequence, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man. Fibrin Sealants/haemostatics are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin by fibrinolysis and phagocytosis. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.

## Warnings and precautions

-  When Raplixa is applied during surgery, the surgeon must ensure that it is only applied onto the surface of tissue. Raplixa must not be injected into blood vessels because it would cause clots which could be fatal.
-  Use of Raplixa has only been shown to arrest bleeding in surgery visualized through the incision (open surgery).
-  Raplixa will be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the product's efficacy and the wound healing process.
- Life-threatening events have occurred with the use of other spray devices employing a pressure regulator to administer other fibrin sealants. This event occurs when an air or gas bubble or bubbles enter a vein or artery and block it. It is called an air or gas embolism. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The risk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air as compared to CO2 and therefore cannot be excluded with Raplixa. The Raplixa spray device (RaplixaSpray) should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. When applying Raplixa using a spray device, a defined pressure within the range recommended by the spray device manufacturer is to be used. In addition, the spray device should not be used closer than the recommended distances. When spraying Raplixa, safety will be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. The spray device and the accessory nozzle are provided with instructions for use, which should be carefully followed.  Nearby areas should be protected to make sure that Raplixa is only applied onto the surface which is to be treated.  When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses, or other types of infections. The measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for lipid coated viruses such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses as hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19 (causing fifth disease). Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (for example sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Raplixa the name and batch number of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.

## Other medicines and Raplixa

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Raplixa should not be administered during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of Raplixa during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

## 3. How to Use Raplixa

The use of Raplixa is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of Raplixa. The surgeon treating you will administer Raplixa during surgery. Prior to applying Raplixa the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). There are three methods of administration of Raplixa: -Application of Raplixa straight from the vial to the bleeding site followed by the application of the gelatin sponge. -Application from the vial onto a wetted gelatin sponge and then applied to the bleeding site. -The third method is application of Raplixa onto the bleeding site using the recommended spray device followed by the application of the gelatin sponge. The amount of Raplixa that will be applied depends on the surface area to be treated during the operation and the severity of the blood loss. When Raplixa is applied directly to the surgical bleeding site, a thin layer should be used to cover the bleeding/oozing area completely. If application of a single layer of Raplixa does not completely stop the bleeding, more may be applied. When applying Raplixa using the recommended spray device, your surgeon must be sure to use a pressure and a distance from tissue within the range recommended by the manufacturer as follows: When spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. 4.

Higher dosages up to 4g (including re-application and treatment of more than a single bleeding site) may be needed.

One of the following methods of application of Raplixa may be used based on the type of surgery, location and size and severity of the bleeding:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Direct application followed by gelatin sponge

Powder is applied directly from the vial onto the bleeding surface and then applied to a CE marked gelatin sponge cut to the appropriate size and apply manual pressure with sterile gauze.

## Apply first to gelatin sponge

Powder is applied directly from the vial onto a saline-wetted CE marked gelatin sponge and then applied to the bleeding site. When using a moistened gelatin sponge, a thin layer of Raplixa should be applied to the sponge immediately prior to application to the bleeding site.

The vial should be held upright, shake gently and the aluminium cap and rubber stopper should be removed.

When applying Raplixa using the Raplixa spray device, the pressure should be within the range recommended by ProFibrix. Spray application of Raplixa should only be done using the provided spray application accessories and the pressure should not exceed 1.5 bars (22 psi). Raplixa should not be sprayed at a distance closer than that recommended by the spray device manufacturer and in no case closer than 5 cm from the tissue surface.

Spray application using Raplixa spray device followed by gelatin sponge Use Raplixa with the Raplixa spray device. The vial and Raplixa spray device should be taken out of their respective pouches maintaining sterility. The Raplixa spray device is connected to the RaplixaReg pressure regulator and thereby to the medical gas supply set to a pressure setting of 1.5 bar (22 psi). The vial with powder is attached to the Raplixa spray device by inverting the device over the upright vial and pushing the vial into place. The Raplixa spray device is used to spray the powder on to the bleeding site and then the gelatin sheet is applied (see Instructions For Use for Raplixa spray device and gelatin sponge). Application must be within 2 hours after connecting the vial to the device. The Raplixa spray device comes with the rigid nozzle attached. This may be removed and the flexible nozzle attached depending on the intended use and surgeon preference. Life threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulators to administer the fibrin sealant. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. The risk appears to be higher when fibrin sealants are sprayed with air, as compared to CO2 and therefore cannot be excluded with Raplixa. To avoid the risk of potentially life-threatening air embolism Raplixa is recommended to be sprayed using pressurised CO2. Raplixa may also be used with medical air. When spraying Raplixa, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and end tidal CO2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism.
