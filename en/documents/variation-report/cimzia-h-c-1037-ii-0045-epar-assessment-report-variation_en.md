## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, UCB Pharma SA submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 4 February 2015 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I                  |

Extension of indication to include treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not treated previously with methotrexate or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were proposed to be revised in order to update the efficacy and safety information.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0295/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and on the granting of a class waiver.

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-C1-001071-PIP02-12-M01 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Cimzia (certolizumab pegol (CZP)), is a monoclonal antibody and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD). It consists of a recombinant, humanized antibody Fab' fragment expressed in Escherichia coli and is conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). In contrast to other members of the class it does not contain an immunoglobulin G (IgG) fragment crystallisable (Fc) region.

CZP selectively neutralises human TNFα, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine contributing to the pathogenesis of RA.

In the EU, Cimzia, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate, has been inadequate. Cimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Cimiza has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with MTX.

It is now accepted that during early stages of RA, there is a therapeutic opportunity to maximize control of signs and symptoms, limit joint damage, and improve physical function (Sesin and Bingham, 2005; Cush, 2007). In this context, besides MTX and/or other conventional DMARDs, which are recommended as first line therapies, some patients may need to start with a combination of a MTX plus a biologic DMARD. Three TNF-inhibitors are currently approved in the EU for patients with severe, active, and progressive RA not previously treated with MTX (adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab) and 1 for patients not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs (infliximab).

The current type II variation application was to extend the current indication for CZP to include adult patients with severe, active, and progressive RA not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Certolizumab pegol is a recombinant, humanized antibody Fab' fragment against tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and in accordance with the CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is exempted from testing because of its chemical structure.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic profile of CZP has been described previously in healthy subjects and RA patients. Following subcutaneous administration, Tmax is 54 to 171 hours and bioavailability is approximately 80% (range 76% to 88%). The terminal elimination phase half-life is approximately 14 days.

There were no new clinical pharmacology data except for the CZP plasma concentration data and the immunogenicity data from study RA0055 (the study is described in detail under Clinical efficacy).

The PK variable for this study included pre-dose CZP plasma concentration at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, 40, and 52/Withdrawal Visit. The observed CZP concentrations are summarised in Table 1 .

Anti-CZP antibodies were assessed at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, 40, and 52/Withdrawal Visit. Subjects who were positive for anti-CZP antibodies (63 subjects [9.6%]) had lower mean (geometric) plasma CZP concentrations at Weeks 8 through 52 compared with subjects who were negative for anti-CZP antibodies. The immunogenicity in DMARD-naïve patients was similar to that reported for previous RA placebo-controlled studies (9.6% Section 5.1, SmPC). The trend and magnitude of effect on CZP plasma concentration in anti-CZP antibody positive subjects was consistent with previous experience with CZP.

## 2.3.3. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

There were no new clinical pharmacology data except for CZP plasma concentration data and the immunogenicity data from study RA0055. This was acceptable given the available data from previous studies in healthy subjects and RA patients. The PK profile appeared to be consistent with expectations based on previous studies of CZP in RA patients. The effect of anti-CZP antibody formation on CZP plasma

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentration was shown to be consistent with previous experience and thus adequately addressed in the current SmPC text.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

The clinical program to support the expansion of the indication consists of a single study, RA0055 (Period 1) and supportive data from the following sources:

- Japanese study RA0096 in early RA patients who were naïve to MTX, leflunomide, and biological DMARDs.

## 2.4.1. Main study

## RA0055

A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol in combination with methotrexate for inducing and sustaining clinical response in the treatment of DMARD-naïve adults with early active rheumatoid arthritis (C-Early).

## Methods

5. Subjects must not have had a secondary, noninflammatory type of musculoskeletal condition (eg, osteoarthritis  or  fibromyalgia)  that  in  the  Investigator's  opinion  was  symptomatic  enough  to interfere with evaluation of the effect of study medication on the subject's primary diagnosis of RA.
6. Subjects must not have had a diagnosis of any other inflammatory arthritis (eg, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis) nor have had a Steinbrocker IV functional capacity.

## Treatments

The study comprised of 2 periods: Period 1 (Week 0 to Week 52) and Period 2 (Week 52 to Week 104) which was ongoing at the time of submission.

The study design is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Study design of RA0055

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Randomisation was performed centrally and eligible subjects were stratified by the time since diagnosis of RA at Baseline (≤4 months and &gt;4 months). Subjects in each stratum were then randomly assigned to the CZP+MTX or placebo (PBO)+MTX treatment arms in a 3:1 ratio. The treatments and treatment regimens in each arm were as follows:

## CZP+MTX treatment arm

- CZP 400mg subcutaneously (sc) at Weeks 0, 2, and 4
- CZP 200mg sc every 2 weeks [Q2W]) from Week 6 until Week 50
- MTX per os (po) once weekly from Week 0 until Week 51

## PBO+MTX treatment arm

- Placebo sc Q2W from Week 0 until Week 50
- MTX po once weekly from Week 0 until Week 51

Subjects were to receive CZP or PBO injections at their clinic visits from qualified study personnel at the first 3 visits (Weeks 0, 2, and 4) and were to receive training on how to perform the injections to ensure proper and safe administration of the study drug at home. Subjects who were unable to self -administer CZP or those without a family member/friend/caregiver who could help were not to be discontinued but could continue to visit the site for only study treatment administration.

Subjects were to initiate MTX at 10mg/week and rapidly escalate the dose by 5mg Q2W to a maximum of 25mg/week by Week 6 to 8. Subjects who did not tolerate at least 15mg/week were withdrawn. Subjects maintained the maximum tolerated dose of MTX reached by Week 8 during the remaining study period. The protocol strongly recommended the use of a medicinal formulation of folic acid or leucovorin or antiemetics to control MTX side effects.

## Rescue medication

The use of rescue medication was allowed in this study under the conditions described in Table 2 .

## Objectives

The primary objective was to demonstrate that the combination of CZP+MTX was superior to PBO+MTX in achieving sustained remission by Week 52.

The key secondary objective was to demonstrate that in DMARD-naïve subjects with adult-onset, early, active RA present for less than 1 year that the combination therapy of CZP+MTX was superior to PBO+MTX in achieving sustained LDA at Week 52.

Other secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of CZP+MTX to PBO+MTX based on the following measures:

- Radiographic progression
- Clinical response
- Patient-reported outcomes
- Productivity within and outside home

The PK and immunological objectives were as follows:

- To evaluate the CZP and anti-CZP antibody concentrations during Period 1
- To evaluate the autoantibody (antinuclear antibody [ANA]) levels and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid [anti-dsDNA] antibodies) levels

The safety objectives were as follows:

- To evaluate the tolerability and safety of the CZP+MTX combination therapy and PBO+MTX monotherapy

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint for Period 1 of the study was sustained remission (defined as a disease activity score based on evaluation of 28 joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28 [ESR]) &lt;2.6 at Week 40 and Week 52 Visits) at Week 52.

Key secondary endpoint was sustained low disease activity (DAS28 [ESR]) ≤3.2at Week 40 and Week 52 Visits) at week 52.

## Sample size

A total of 800 subjects were planned to be enrolled in this study. Approximately 1067 subjects were planned to be screened in order to enrol 800.

The sample size calculation was based on the period 1 primary efficacy variable, and, was calculated using a two-group continuity-corrected chi-square test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. The calculation was based on an expected proportion of subjects in sustained remission of 50% and 30% in the CZP+MTX treatment group and, the PBO+MTX treatment group, respectively. Given a 3:1 randomization, 600 subjects in the CZP+MTX arm and 200 subjects in the PBO+MTX treatment group, a power of 99% was achieved.

## Randomisation

For Period 1, subjects were randomized at Week 0. The randomization schedule was produced by a biostatistician not otherwise involved in this study. Randomisation was performed centrally using an interactive voice/web response system and was stratified by the time since RA diagnosis at Baseline (≤4 months and &gt;4 months). Subjects in each stratum were then randomly assigned to the CZP+MTX or PBO+MTX treatment arms in a 3:1 ratio.

## Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study.

## Statistical methods

For the analysis of Period 1, data were locked and un-blinded after the last subject had completed the Week 52 Visit or the Safety Follow-up phone call (if the subject was withdrawn). The Full Analysis Set Period 1 (FAS1) was used to summarise and analyze all efficacy data except for the radiographic analyses which  were  based  on  the  Radiographic  Set  (RAD1).  In  addition,  a  per-protocol  set  (PPS1)  and,  a Completer Set (CS1) was defined and used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and the key secondary endpoint. For definition of analysis sets, see 'Numbers analysed' Section of this Report.

The primary and the key secondary endpoints were analysed using a logistic regression model including terms for treatment, region (Europe/Australia or Latin/North America), and stratification factor (≤4 months or &gt;4 months since RA diagnosis at Baseline). The same model was used also for the analysis of other/secondary dichotomous efficacy endpoints including ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response relative to Baseline at Weeks 12, 24, and 52.

For dichotomous efficacy variables including all analyses on sustained remission and LDA rates, missing data was handled using a non-responder imputation (NRI), i.e. a subject having missing data for the time point assessed was counted as a non-remitter or non-responder. This was to be done whether the data were missing, the subject discontinued the study prior to the time point assessed, or the data were considered missing due to use of prohibited or rescue medication. Initially, if a subject met the withdrawal criteria specified in the protocol and was not withdrawn, all efficacy data collected at assessments after the specified time of withdrawal were to be treated as missing. This rule was however changed prior to CRF lock and unblinding, instead, such subjects were considered as having important protocol deviations and excluded from the PPS1, but the assessments were not treated as missing.

The change from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 was analysed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with terms for treatment, region, and time since RA diagnosis at Baseline as factors

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Baseline value as a covariate. The difference in least squares (LS) Means was presented with a 95% 2-sided CI.

The Week 52 change from Baseline for mTSS, joint erosion score and the JSN score respectively was analyzed using an ANCOVA model on the ranks with the terms for treatment, region, and time since RA diagnosis at Baseline as factors and rank Baseline value as a covariate. The treatment effect was estimated by the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate of shift and corresponding asymptotic (Moses) 95% CI. It was planned that the mTSS at Week 52 for early withdrawal subjects would be estimated by linear extrapolation of the scores from the radiographs taken from the Withdrawal Visit. This was changed (after SAP amendment 1) so that, the same methodology was applied to all subjects (not just to those who withdrew early), in order to have a consistent 52-week (364 day) score for every subject and minimize the impact of the differences in follow-up time.

For other secondary endpoints, e.g. HAQ-DI, TJC, SJC and, ETC, missing data was handled using lastobservation-carried-forward (LOCF).

In addition to the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, statistical analyses accounting for multiplicity were also performed for selected secondary endpoints. A hierarchical test procedure was applied to protect the overall significance level for the multiplicity of endpoints. Hypothesis testing was performed in the following predefined order, each at a 2-sided 5% alpha level.

1. Primary: sustained DAS28 (ESR) remission at Week 52
2. Key secondary: sustained DAS28 (ESR) LDA at Week 52
3. ACR50 response at Week 52 in relation to Baseline
4. Change from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 52
5. Change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52

No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made for the remaining endpoints outside the hierarchical test procedure. Significance testing was performed for these endpoints and is presented for descriptive purposes only.

The primary efficacy variable was further analysed to investigate the consistency of treatment effect across regions using the primary logistic regression model including also the treatment by region interaction term. The Period 1 primary endpoint was examined by a number of pre-defined subgroups including e.g. time since RA diagnosis at Baseline (≤4 months and &gt;4 months), gender, region and, age group (&lt;65 years old, ≥65 years old).

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 1377 subjects were enrolled, of which 880 subjects were randomized. Three subjects which were randomised in error, were not dosed, and withdrawn shortly afterwards as screen failures. Due to limited data in the database for these subjects, two subjects were included in the Randomized Set 1(RS1) only and one subject, who did not have complete data on informed consent in the database, was conservatively excluded from any output. Therefore, the flowchart of subject disposition ( Figure 2 ) reported 879 subjects as being randomised; 660 subjects were randomised to receive CZP+MTX, and 219 subjects were randomised to receive PBO+MTX.

Notes: Subjects completed Week 52 if they had a Week 52 Visit. Subjects completed Period 1 if they had a Week 52 Visit and were eligible for Period 2 (i.e., in sustained LDA). Two subjects which were randomized in error, were not dosed, and withdrawn shortly afterwards as screen failures. These 2 subjects were included in the RS1.

Per the protocol, subjects were evaluated at Weeks 20, 24, 36 (in Sweden only), and 52. Subjects who had no improvement at Week 20 (i.e. DAS28 (ESR) ≤ 0) were withdrawn from the study. Those with insufficient improvement were re-evaluated at Week 24 (and also Week 36 for Sweden only) and Week 52. Those subjects who did not have sufficient improvement in their disease activity at Weeks 24, 36, or 52 were withdrawn from the study as summarised in Table 3.

CZP=certolizumab pegol; IXRS=Interactive Voice/Web Response System; MTX=methotrexate; PBO=placebo a  Fifteen subjects were randomided in Sweden.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted at 181 centres located in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Australia. By geographic region, 53.0% of all subjects came from Europe/Australia and 47.0% of all subjects came from Latin/North America.  In the CZP+MTX group, there was a higher proportion of subjects from Europe/Australia compared with Latin/North America (54.0% vs 46.0%). In the PBO+MTX group, a similar proportion of subjects came from each region.

## Conduct of the study

The original SAP, dated 31 Jan 2014, was revised. The main changes from the original SAP were:

- The number of regions was reduced due to statistical concerns for the possibility of low cell counts in the logistic regression model, which could result in complete or quasi-complete separation and problems fitting the model.
- Calculated time since diagnosis was specified for use given a discrepancy between the IXRS value and the calculated value, since calculated values are more compatible with model-based analyses.

Post-hoc analyses with the initially 2 regions further divided into sub regions due to that the treatment by region interaction was found to be statistically significant.

Important protocol deviations were identified in 16.8% of subjects, as summarised in ( Table 4 ).

The Study Protocol required that subjects were either RF positive or ACPA positive at Screening. Overall, 96.8% of subjects were RF positive, and 84.0% of subjects were ACPA positive.

Overall, the Baseline characteristics of RA demonstrated that the study population suffered from severe active RA and overall high disease burden. A total of 3.5% were in moderate disease activity, whereas 96.5% were in high disease activity as measured by DAS28 (ESR). More than three-quarters of subjects (77.8%) had erosions present at Baseline.

The treatment groups were also well-balanced with respect to RA history ( Table 6 ). Overall, the mean and median (calculated) times since diagnosis for all subjects were 2.87 months and 1.63 months, respectively, with 75.9% of subjects having a (calculated) time since diagnosis of ≤4 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean and median (calculated) times since first symptoms of RA for all subjects were 11.7 months and 6.0 months, respectively. Time since first symptoms of RA was collected retroactively and was not available for all subjects; this information is highly subjective, so should be interpreted with caution.

A total of 6.1% of subjects had a history of extra-articular feature(s) and 6.7% of subjects had at least 1 extra-articular feature at Screening.

## Numbers analysed

Analysis sets in addition to the Randomized Set 1 (RS1) included:

- Safety Set 1 (SS1): This set included subjects in the RS1 who received at least 1 dose of study medication (CZP/PBO) and was used to summarize demographic, baseline and safety data.
- Full Analysis Set Period 1 (FAS1): This set included subjects in the RS1 who had valid Baseline and post-Baseline efficacy measurement for the primary efficacy assessment of DAS28(ESR) and was used to summarize and analyse all efficacy data.
- Radiographic Set Period 1 (RAD1): This set included subjects in the FAS1 who had provided valid radiographs (ie, radiographs resulting in a non-missing mTSS score) at Baseline and at Week 52 or the Withdrawal Visit and was used for the radiographic analyses.
- Per-Protocol Set Period 1 (PPS1): This set included subjects in the FAS1 who did not have any important protocol deviations that would have influenced the validity of the data and was used for sensitivity analysis on the Period 1 primary endpoint only.
- Completer Set Period 1 (CS1): This set included subjects in the FAS1 who completed to Week 52 and was used for sensitivity analyses of the Period 1 primary and key secondary endpoints only
- Pharmacokinetic Set 1 (PKS1): This included subjects who received at least 1 dose of CZP and provided at least 1 PK sample.

## Outcomes and  estimation

Primary efficacy variable: Sustained remission at Week 52

The Period 1 primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects in sustained remission (defined as DAS28 [ESR] &lt;2.6 at both Week 40 and Week 52 Visits) at Week 52.

Table 8. Summary of subjects in sustained remission (FAS1, with NRI, Study RA0055)

a  Odds ratio: CZP+MTX/PBO+MTX (and corresponding p-value) from a logistic regression model with factors form treatment, region, and time since RA diagnosis at Baseline (≤4 months vs &gt;4 months).

Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable performed using the PPS1 and the CS1 ( Table 9 ) confirmed the primary analysis. Although the sensitivity analysis using the PPS1 was not required since &lt;15% of subjects were excluded from the PPS1, these results (odds ratio favouring CZP+MTX: 2.289; 95% CI: 1.494, 3.509; p-value&lt; 0.001) were similar to those using the FAS1, indicating that subjects with protocol violations did not bias the results. The results using the CS1 were also consistent with those using the FAS1, indicating that the impact of dropouts is similar in both groups.

## Analyses of the primary efficacy variable by subgroups

Treatment with CZP+MTX provided an increase in the proportion of subjects in sustained remission compared with PBO+MTX regardless of gender, age group, RF status, albumin level, or presence of erosions at Baseline ( Table 10 ).

## Key secondary efficacy variable: sustained LDA at Week 52

Sustained low disease activity (LDA) was defined as subjects with DAS28 [ESR] ≤ 3.2 at both the Week 40 and Week 52 Visits. A statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.001) in LDA at Week 52 was observed between the CZP+MTX and the PBO+MTX group ( Table 11 ). Subjects treated with CZP+MTX were 2.0 times (95% CI: 1.384, 2.767) more likely to achieve sustained LDA (LDA at both Weeks 40 and 52) after 52 weeks of treatment compared with subjects treated with PBO+MTX.

A sensitivity analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable was performed using the CS1 to assess the impact of missing data. The results using the CS1 were consistent with those using the FAS1, indicating that the impact of dropouts is similar in both groups (data not shown).

## Inhibition of progression of structural damage

All radiographic efficacy variables were analysed using the RAD1, which consisted of subjects in the FAS1 who had provided valid radiographs (i.e. radiographs resulting in a non-missing mTSS score) at Baseline and at Week 52 or the Withdrawal Visit (mTSS at Withdrawal Visit linearly extrapolated to Week 52). Radiographs were read centrally and independently by at least 2 experienced readers with a third reader for adjudication, if necessary.

At Baseline, the mean mTSS for subjects in the RAD1 was 6.6 and 9.1 in the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups, respectively and the median Baseline values were 2.5 for each group. Mean changes at Week 52 between the two treatment arms and the difference between the two are presented in Table 12 .

CI=confidence interval; CZP=certolizumab pegol; mTSS=modified total Sharp score; MTX=methotrexate; PBO=placebo; RA=rheumatoid arthritis; RAD1=Radiographic Set Period 1 Note: Radiographic nonprogression was defined as a change from Baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5 (based on linearly extrapolated scores).

a Odds ratio: CZP+MTX/PBO+MTX (and corresponding p-value) from a logistic regression model with factors for treatment, region, and time since RA diagnosis at Baseline (≤4 months vs &gt;4 months).

At Baseline, the mean joint erosion score for subjects in the RAD1 was 3.9 and 4.8 in the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups, respectively and the median Baseline values were 1.5 for each group. Mean changes at Week 52 between the two treatment arms and the difference between the two are presented in Table 14 .

Additional post-hoc sensitivity analyses were submitted for the changes from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52 using all subjects in the FAS1 with a non-missing baseline mTSS (651 and 212 subjects in the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX arm, respectively). In all 3 post-hoc sensitivity analyses, for subjects with a valid Withdrawal Visit mTSS, the Week 52 mTSS was imputed by linear extrapolation of the Withdrawal Visit mTSS (as in the predefined primary analysis).

The sensitivity analyses differed with respect to the method of imputation for subjects without a valid Withdrawal Visit mTSS. These were performed as follows:

## Sensitivity Analysis 1

- The missing Week 52 mTSS was imputed (for both treatment arms) from the slope estimates obtained from the ANCOVA model on the Week 52 mTSS score for PBO+MTX subjects.

## Sensitivity Analysis 2

- The missing change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52 was imputed using the mean change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52 for all patients with observed values.

## Sensitivity Analysis 3

- The missing change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52 was imputed using the median change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52 for all patients with observed values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As summarized in Table 14, all 3 sensitivity analyses resulted in CZP+MTX - PBO+MTX differences which were still significant (p &lt;0.001).

## Change from baseline in HAQ-DI

At Baseline, the mean HAQ-DI scores were similar between the CZP+MTX (1.6 points) and PBO+MTX (1.7 points) groups. The LS Mean change from Baseline in HAQ-DI improved over time in the CZP+MTX through Week 52; a similar trend was observed in the PBO+MTX group but with a consistently smaller change from Baseline at each time point ( Table 17 ).

A greater proportion of subjects reaching normative physical function (HAQ-DI score ≤0.5) was observed in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group as early as Week 2. At Week 52, 48.1% of subjects in the CZP+MTX group had reached normative physical function compared with 35.7% of subjects in the PBO+MTX group (p=0.002); subjects treated with CZP+MTX were 1.7 times (95% CI: 1.207, 2.305) more likely to reach normative physical function after 52 weeks of treatment compared with subjects treated with PBO+MTX.

## ACR20, ACR 50 and ACR70 response by visit

The ACR20 ( Figure 3 ), ACR 50 ( Figure 4 ) and ACR70 ( Figure 5 ) responses with CZP+MTX treatment, showed a separation from PBO+MTX as early as Week 2.

Note: p-value was ≤ 0.05 at Weeks 2, 4, and 40.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The target treatment responses for clinical practice of 60%, 40%, and 20% for the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, respectively, (McInnes and O'Dell, 2010; Kavanaugh et al, 2004) were achieved by at least Week 6 (Week 4 for ACR20) in this study and maintained through Week 52 with CZP+MTX treatment. Both treatment groups achieved these targets by Week 52; however, the proportion of subjects reaching ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 at Week 52 was greater in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX.

The proportion of ACR50 responders increased over time in both groups; however, the proportion was greater in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group beginning at Week 2 and continuing through Week 52. At each visit, the p-value for the difference from PBO+MTX was ≤0.05 with the exception of Weeks 24 and 36.

Note: p-value was ≤0.05 at all assessment time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, 40, and 52). Note: Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals.

Note: p-value was ≤0.05 at all assessment time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, 40, and 52). Note: Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals.

## ACR components by visit

The changes from Baseline in individual components of the ACR criteria were defined as secondary efficacy variables at Weeks 12, 24, and 52/Withdrawal Visit and as other efficacy variables at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 36, and 40. For each ACR component, a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement such that the larger the negative value, the greater the improvement. Changes in CRP and ESR were assessed as a ratio to Baseline; the smaller the ratio, the greater the reduction and improvement in CRP and ESR. Although ESR was not used in the calculation of ACR scores in this study, ESR was considered an ACR component for the efficacy endpoint.

At Baseline, the mean scores for ACR components were similar between the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups. Mean changes from Baseline in ACR components at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 are summarised in Table 18 .

## MCID from Baseline in PtGADA

The proportion of subjects who achieved an MCID from Baseline (an improvement of ≥10mm from Baseline) in PtGADA in the CZP+MTX group ranged from 68.2% to 76.6%. The proportion of subjects in the PBO+MTX group was generally similar to the CZP+MTX group, with smaller proportions at the early visits (Weeks 2 and 4) and at Weeks 40 and 52. No difference between groups was seen at Week 12 (76.1% vs 76.6% in the placebo group and the Cimzia treated group respectively). At week 52, the proportions were 59.6% and 68.2% respectively.

## LDA by visit

The proportion of subjects achieving LDA based on DAS28(ESR) ≤3.2 was defined as a secondary efficacy variable at Weeks 12, 24, and 52/Withdrawal Visit and as another efficacy variable at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 36, and 40.

A summary of these results at weeks 12, 24 and 52 are summarised in Table 19 .

## Change from Baseline in DAS28 (ESR), CDAI and SDAI by visit

At Baseline, the mean DAS28 (ESR) was similar between the CZP+MTX group and the PBO+MTX group. Subjects in the CZP+MTX group had a greater decrease in DAS28 (ESR) compared with the PBO+MTX group which was observed as early as Week 2 and continued through Week 52. At Week 52, the CZP+MTX group had a greater mean decrease from Baseline in DAS28(ESR) compared with the PBO+MTX group (-3.6 vs -3.0 points).

Remission status as determined by CDAI and SDAI showed also similar trends to the results observed with the DAS28(ESR) criteria in that a greater proportion of subjects in the CZP+MTX group were in remission compared with the PBO+MTX group beginning at Week 2 and continuing through Week 52 for CDAI and SDAI.

The results were consistent across all definitions of remission. For most remission criteria analyses, the difference between treatment groups was less at Week 12 than at other visits. At Week 24, however, maxima could be experienced in odds ratios for all remission criteria. Of note, there was a consistent and clear superiority of the CZP+MTX group over the PBO+MTX group from Week 20 onwards.

## EULAR response by visit

A EULAR response of good was defined as an improvement in DAS28 (ESR) of &gt;1.2 and a present score of ≤ 3.2. A EULAR response of moderate was defined as an improvement in DAS28 (ESR) of &gt;0.6 to ≤1.2 and a present score of ≤ 5.1 or an improvement in DAS28 (ESR) of &gt;1.2 and a present score of &gt;3.2. A subject was considered a EULAR responder if their EULAR response was good or moderate.

The proportion of EULAR responders increased over time in the CZP+MTX group from Week 2 (65.2%) through Week 20 (87.2%) reaching a plateau at Week 20 that continued through Week 52; the PBO+MTX group showed the same trend but with a consistently smaller proportion of responders at each time point. At  Week  52,  the  proportion  of  EULAR  responders  was  89.9%  in  the  CZP+MTX  group  compared  with 82.2% in the PBO+MTX group.

## Supportive study

## Methods

RA0096 is an ongoing, Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup comparison study in adult subjects with early RA who were MTX-naïve and had poor prognostic factors. After an up to 4-week Screening Period subjects received CZP+MTX or placebo (PBO)+MTX during a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled Treatment Period. Subjects completing the Treatment Period were eligible to enroll in the 52-week Follow-Up Observation Period providing MTX monotherapy. Rescue treatment was available to subjects meeting predefined criteria.

The most notable differences in design between RA0096 and RA0055 were as follows:

- RA onset is defined as the time when continuous symptoms of RA started in RA0096 (versus the time of diagnosis in RA0055);
- RA0096 required no minimum TJC, SJC, CRP, or ESR;
- MTX dosing started at 8mg/week (versus 10mg/week in RA0055) and was escalated to a maximum of 16mg/week by Week 8 (versus a maximum of 25mg/week in RA0055). The minimum MTX dose was 8mg/week (versus a minimum of 15mg/week in RA0055);
- RA0096 excluded for any previous use of MTX, leflunomide or biological DMARD (versus any prior use of all DMARDs except anti-malarials in RA0055);
- The primary endpoint in RA0096 was the change in mTSS at Week 52 (versus sustained remission in RA0055).

## Study participants

RA0096 included Japanese adult male and female subjects ≥20 years and &lt;65 years of age who were within their first year of RA since onset (defined as the time when continuous symptoms of arthritis started). Subjects were naïve to MTX and were required to have active disease in a moderate or higher degree of their DAS28[ESR]) ≥3.2. Subjects were to have a high anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody titer (see below) and must have met at least 1 of the other 2 criteria for poor prognostic factors.

- High anti-CCP antibody titer: ≥13.5U/mL (3 times the standard range);
- Positive rheumatoid factor: &gt;20IU/mL (standard range);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Presence of bone erosion (evidenced by the x-ray examination of hands and feet).

## Treatments

Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were allocated to 1 of the following treatment groups:

- Certolizumab pegol administered subcutaneously (sc) at a loading dose of CZP 400mg every second week (Q2W) at Weeks 0, 2, and 4; followed by a dose of CZP 200mg Q2W sc from Week 6 to Week 50 and an oral dose of MTX administered from Week 0 onwards;
- Placebo administered sc Q2W at Weeks 0, 2, and 4; followed by placebo Q2W sc from Week 6 to Week 50 and an oral dose of MTX administered from Week 0 onwards

Rescue treatment was available to subjects who did not achieve an improvement of symptoms at and after Week 24 (Visit 16). The Rescue Treatment Period started after the subject's dropout from the original study schedule and lasted up to Week 104.

## Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in combination with MTX in subjects with early RA, who were MTX-naïve and had poor prognostic factors, to that of MTX monotherapy with inhibition of joint damage progression after 1 year of treatment as the primary endpoint. In addition, maintenance of the efficacy of CZP is being investigated explorative in a Follow-Up Observation Period for 1 year with MTX monotherapy after CZP withdrawal. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity were also investigated.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 52 was the primary endpoint. The DAS28(ESR) and ACR/EULAR remission rates at Week 24 and Week 52 were secondary endpoints.

## Results

## Baseline data

The mean DAS28(ESR) score was 5.45, and scores were comparable in both treatment groups. Approximately 60% of subjects had high disease activity (DAS28[ESR] score &gt;5.1) and approximately 35% had moderate disease activity (DAS[ESR] score 3.2 to 5.1). Five subjects (3.1%) in the CZP+MTX group and 3 subjects (1.9%) in the PBO+MTX group had a DAS28(ESR) score of &lt;3.2 at Baseline.

No subject had received MTX, leflunomide, or biological products; however, 19% of subjects had received a prior DMARD.

The most notable differences between the RA0055 and RA0096 populations at Baseline were as follows:

- RA0096 included Japanese subjects exclusively.
- RA0096 included a higher proportion of subjects with moderate disease activity.
- RA0096 included subjects (19%) who were not DMARD-naïve; however, all were MTX naïve.

## Numbers analysed

A total of 319 subjects were randomized (161 subjects to CZP+MTX and 158 to PBO+MTX).

Two subjects in the CZP+MTX group and 1 subject in the PBO+MTX group did not receive the study drug due to violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria or investigator decision. The percentage of subjects who

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

completed the Treatment Period was higher in the CZP+MTX group (68.9%) as compared with the PBO+MTX group (46.2%). Lack of efficacy was the major reason for discontinuation, accounting for 22.4% and 44.9% of subjects in the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups.

## Outcomes and estimation

The result of the primary analysis of the mTSS at Week 52 for the FAS was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001, Table 21 ).

At Week 24, the percentage of subjects meeting DAS28 (ESR) remission criteria was 52.8% in the CZP+MTX group compared with 30.6% in the PBO+MTX group. This difference between the treatment groups was maintained at Week 52 (57.2% versus 36.9%), and statistical significance (p&lt;0.001) was achieved at both time-points.

At Week 24, the percentage of subjects meeting SDAI-based ACR/EULAR remission criteria in the CZP+MTX group was 48.4% compared with 29.3% in the PBO+MTX group. This difference between the treatment groups was maintained at Week 52 (57.9% versus 33.8%). Statistical significance (p&lt;0.001) was achieved at both time-points.

At Week 24, the percentage of subjects meeting Boolean-based ACR/EULAR remission criteria in the CZP+MTX group was 36.5% compared with 22.3% the PBO+MTX group. This difference between the treatment groups was maintained at Week 52 (45.3% versus 28.0%). Statistical significance (p=0.007 at Week 24 and p=0.002 at Week 52) was achieved at both time-points.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Cimzia is currently approved for the treatment of the following conditions: axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and moderate to severe Rheumatoid arthritis when the response to disease -modifying DMARDs including MTX has been inadequate.

The MAH submitted an application to register an extended indication in severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs. The proposed wording for this indication was in line with other TNF-blockers who have achieved approval for this indication. To support the application, efficacy data from a pivotal globally conducted study (RA0055) and a supportive Japanese study (RA0096) were provided. Both studies compared MTX-treatment to MTX in combination with Cimzia. Study RA0055 primarily aimed to show higher proportion of sustained remission in the Cimziatreated group at week 52, whereas study RA0096 was designed to show a difference in change from baseline in mTSS at week 52 between groups.

Study RA0055 was a 24-month (104 week) randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CZP in combination with MTX for inducing and sustaining clinical response in the treatment of DMARD-naïve adults with early active RA. The study consisted of 2 consecutive periods of 52 weeks each. The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects in sustained remission (defined as DAS28 (ESR) &lt;2.6 at both Week 40 and Week 52 Visits) at Week 52. Key secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in sustained LDA (defined as DAS28 (ESR) ≤3.2 at Week 40 and Week 52 Visits) at Week 52. Thus, subjects in sustained remission were included among subjects in sustained LDA.

The study design employed a fast titration of MTX (within 8 weeks, with a starting dose of 10mg/week) and the mean doses achieved in each treatment group were &gt;20mg/week. These doses were close to the maximum allowed MTX dose (25mg/week achieved by Weeks 6 to 8, as per the protocol) and were in line with current recommendations. MTX treatment was therefore considered to be optimised.

Methods to achieve and maintain blinding were acceptable as was the randomisation procedure. Subjects were randomly assigned to the CZP+MTX or PBO+MTX treatment arm in a 3:1 ratio with randomisation stratified by the time since RA diagnosis at Baseline (≤4 months or &gt;4 months).

The analysis approach and the statistical methods planned were overall acceptable. The primary analysis set was the FAS1 excluding subjects without a post-baseline assessment. FAS1 was used for all analyses of efficacy data except for the radiographic analyses which were based on the Radiographic Set (RAD1) and comprised the subset of subjects in FAS1 who had valid radiographs (i.e. resulting in a non-missing mTSS score) at baseline and at week 52 or the withdrawal visit.

Missing data was handled using a non-responder imputation (dichotomous variables), LOCF (change from baseline) or, for mTSS, linear extrapolation. Few sensitivity analyses were planned and those performed were mainly based on analyses excluding subjects with protocol deviations or those who did not complete through week 52 (i.e. PP1, CS1).

For the primary, the key and, three additional secondary endpoints a hierarchical test procedure was applied. Although no justification for the choice or ordering of secondary endpoints 3-5 (ACR50, change from baseline in HAQ-DI and change from baseline in mTSS) has been found the multiplicity approach is per se acceptable. A few changes were made to the planned analyses but they were considered minor.

Overall, 23.7% (155/655); CZP+MTX and 32.9% (70/213); PBO+MTX of subjects included in the full analysis set (FAS1) discontinued before week 52. No subjects used any prohibited medication and the proportion of subjects that used rescue were similar between groups; 16.5% (108/655) CZP+MTX and, 16.0% (34/213), PBO+MTX).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The proportion of subjects in sustained remission at Week 52 in the CZP+MTX group was 28.9% compared with 15.0% (p&lt;0.001) in the PBO+MTX group (FAS1 with non-responder imputation). The proportion of subjects in sustained LDA at week 52 in the CZP+MTX group was 43.8% compared with 28.6% (p&lt;0.001) in the PBO+MTX group. It is acknowledged that sustained remission or LDA are clinically important endpoints, and this difference was considered to be clinically meaningful.

By age group, the proportion of subjects ≥65 years in sustained remission was not different between groups (p=0.116); however, the odds ratio was 2.808, which was similar to the odds ratio for subjects &lt;65 years of age (2.230), indicating that the response was similar in both subgroups. Due to the comparatively small sample size in the ≥65 years subgroup, these results should be interpreted with caution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ACR response

61.8% of subjects in the CZP+MTX group compared with 52.6% in the PBO+MTX group were ACR50 responders at Week 52 (p=0.023). The proportion of ACR50 responders increased over time in both groups; however, the proportion was greater in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group.  At each visit, the p-value for the difference from PBO+MTX was ≤0.05 with the exception of Weeks 24 and 36. However, the CHMP considered that the lack of statistical difference at week 24 and 36 could be reflective of a difference in the time course of effect of CZP and MTX. In addition the CHMP noted that the proportion of responders at all the time points was higher in the CZP+MTX group than in the PBO+MTX group. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the groups for the most stringent ACR70. Therefore, the observed results were considered to be of clinical relevance.

The CHMP noted that difference in the proportion of ACR20 responders between the two treatment arms did not reach significance, however, the Applicant's view that this goal is not very hard to achieve when treatment is initiated early in the disease, was endorsed by the CHMP.

## Functional improvement

After 52 weeks, HAQ-DI had decreased more in the CZP-treated group. However, the difference, 0.177 was not very large as MCID has in literature been estimated to be 0.22. The relatively small difference was due to a relatively large proportion of improved patients in the placebo group, mean -0.819 at week 52, as compared to -0.997 in the Cimzia-treated group.

## Inhibition of progression of structural damage

The radiographic analyses (e.g. mTSS, radiographic non-progression) were based on the Radiographic Set (RAD1) including only subjects who had valid radiographs at baseline and at the Week 52 or early Withdrawal visit. In those analyses 20% (132/660) and 25% (56/219) of randomised subjects in the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX arm respectively, were excluded. Additional/sensitivity analyses based on FAS1 were therefore requested and were provided by the Applicant.

The change from Baseline in mTSS was lower in the CZP+MTX group compared to the PBO+MTX group, with mean changes from Baseline of 0.2 and 1.8, respectively (p&lt;0.001), indicating a protective effect of Cimiza on joint destruction in this population of early RA with poor prognostic factors. Although the difference between the CZP+MTX arm and the PBO+MTX arm was smaller in all the sensitivity analyses ranging from -0.284 to -0.619 as compared to the outcome in the primary pre-defined analysis, -0.978, the difference was still statistically significant in favour of CZP+MTX over PBO+MTX with the p-value being &lt;0.001 in all three sensitivity analyses.

Consistently, the proportion of subjects with radiographic non progression at Week 52 (defined as a change from Baseline to Week 52 in mTSS of ≤0.5) was greater in the CZP+MTX (70.3%) group compared with the PBO+MTX group (49.7%; p&lt;0.001).

As requested, the Applicant also submitted sensitivity analysis of the proportion of subjects with radiographic non-progression at Week 52 based on FAS1 and using a non-responder imputation. In this analysis the proportion of subjects with radiographic non progression, decreased from 70.3% (371/528) to 57.0% (371/651) in the CZP+MTX arm and from 49.7% (81/163) to 38.2% (81/212) in the PBO+MTX. The difference between the two treatment arms was however still in favour of CZP+MTX (OR: 2.12; 95% CI 1.54, 2.91; p&lt;0.001) supporting the outcome as shown in the primary pre-defined analysis (OR: 2.38; 95% CI 1.66, 3.42; p&lt;0.001) where subjects without valid radiographs were excluded.

In addition, information on time points for x-rays in early withdrawals was provided by the Applicant. Overall, more subjects in the PBO+MTX arm than in the CZP+MTX arm had radiographs taken at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

early withdrawal visit; 18.4% (30/163) and 9.5% (50/528) in the PBO+MTX and the CZP+MTX arm respectively.

Taken together, these observations provided further evidence in support of the claim that CZP+MTX is superior to PBO+MTX in the inhibition of the progression of structural damage after 52 weeks of treatment in DMARD-naïve subjects with severe, active, and progressive RA.

## Other efficacy endpoints

For subjects who achieved an improvement of ≥10mm from Baseline (MCID) in patients global assessment of disease activity (PtGADA), no difference between groups was seen at Week 12 (76.1% vs 76.6% in the placebo group and the Cimzia treated group respectively).  At week 52, the proportions were however 59.6% and 68.2% respectively. The CHMP considered that this observation could be explained by the fact that MCID in PtGADA is not difficult to achieve, in particular in previously DMARDnaïve subjects initiating MTX treatment and that is not a very sensitive tool for capturing changes between different treatments. In addition, CZP-treated subjects achieved higher levels above the MCID threshold than only MTX-treated subjects indicating a better clinical improvement in the CZP group.

At Week 52, the proportion of EULAR responders was 89.9% in the CZP+MTX group compared with 82.2% in the PBO+MTX group (p=0.003). The difference is modest, but it was noted that for subjects with a 'good' EULAR response, the proportion of subjects increased over time in the CZP+MTX group from Week 2 (8.2%) through Week 52 (60.6%); whereas the PBO+MTX group increased with 1.4% at Week 2 and 43.7% at Week 52.

Finally, the results from the Japanese study RA0096 supported the claim that initial treatment with CZP+MTX may inhibit progression of structural damage and reduce clinical signs and symptoms better than initial treatment with PBO+MTX.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Study RA0055 has provided results that support efficacy of Cimzia in combination with MTX in an early DMARDs-naïve RA population with poor prognostic factors such as CCP and elevated RF or presence of bone erosions in the hands or feet. The effect was in general better for signs and symptoms, and a significantly larger group achieved sustained remission, a clinically meaningful primary endpoint that is used for the first time in a study on a TNF-blocker. A beneficial effect on joint destruction has also been shown, and these results were further supported by the Japanese study RA0096.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety data corresponding to Period 1 from RA0055 and RA0096 were supported, where relevant, by long-term safety data from the overall RA pool, which comprised of 2 sets of data:

- The Placebo-Controlled (PC) Data: consisting of data from PC studies or PC study phases: C87002 (PC phase), C87004 (PC phase), C87011, C87014, C87027, C87050, C87076, C87077 (PC phase), C87094 (PC phase), and RA0017 (PC phase).
- All Studies Data: consisting of data from all studies/all phases: PHA001, C87002, C87004, C87011, C87014, C87015, C87027, C87028, C87050, C87051, C87076, C87077, C87094, and RA0017.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the PC Data Pool, the following treatment groups were summarised: Placebo; CZP 200mg every 2 weeks (Q2W; following a 400mg loading regimen); CZP 400mg every 4 weeks (Q4W); and All CZP in PC. For the All Data Pool, the All CZP in PC and All CZP in All Studies treatment groups were summarized.

A subgroup of 401 subjects, the early RA sub-pool, was created from the overall RA pool to include only those subjects with RA disease of less than 1 year duration. This early RA sub-pool was created to explore the long-term safety of CZP treatment in a larger population of subjects which more closely matched the RA0055 population, however unlike RA0055, the subjects in the early RA sub-pool were not DMARD naïve.

## Study RA0055

## Patient exposure

A total of 1377 subjects were enrolled (i.e. screened and signed an Informed Consent form) in the study, of which 880 subjects were randomised. The most common reason for screen failure was ineligibility (420/1377, 30.5%).

Exposure of these patients to treatment in this study is summarised in Table 23 .

d Calculated from Week 8 (end of MTX Titration Period). Subjects with no MTX dosing data after Week 8 were not included.

The mean weekly dose of MTX following the Titration Period (up to Week 8) was similar between the groups (21.1 and 22.3mg/week, in the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups, respectively). These mean values were close to the maximum allowed MTX dose (per the protocol) of 25mg/week.

Subjects who had no improvement at Week 20 (i.e., DAS28 (ESR) ≤0) were withdrawn from the study ( Table 24 ). Those with insufficient improvement were re-evaluated at Week 24 (and also at Week 36

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for Sweden only) and Week 52. Those subjects who did not have sufficient improvement in their disease activity (i.e. DAS28 (ESR) ≤3.2 and/or improvement in DAS28 (ESR) of ≥1.2 points since Baseline) at Weeks 24, 36, or 52 were withdrawn from the study.

Note: n=number of subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE in that category.

Note: Treatment emergence was defined as an adverse event starting on or after the date of first study medication administration and up to 70 days after the last (most recent) CZP or PBO dose.

Note: TEAEs having a serious flag as missing were counted as serious. TEAEs with a missing relationship to study medication were counted as related. TEAEs with a missing intensity were counted as severe.

The incidence of TEAEs was 79.7% in the CZP+MTX group and 72.8% in the PBO+MTX group. The incidence rate was 250.77/100 pt-yrs in the CZP+MTX group and 195.66/100 pt-yrs in the PBO+MTX group.

In the CZP+MTX group, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the following System Organ Classes (SOCs, summarised in Table 26 ):

- Infections and infestations (45.2% vs 35.0% for PBO+MTX),
- Gastrointestinal disorders (31.3% vs 24.4% for PBO+MTX)
- Investigations (20.8% vs 19.4% for PBO+MTX)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence rates were higher in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group for the following SOCs:

- Infections and infestations (71.77 vs 52.70/100 pt-yrs) and
- Gastrointestinal disorders (44.72 vs 33.99/100 pt-yrs)

CZP=certolizumab pegol; IR=incidence rate; MTX=methotrexate; PBO=placebo;

PT=Preferred term; pt-yrs=patient-years; SOC=System Organ Class; SS1=Safety Set 1; TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event

Note: n=number of subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE in that category.

Note: Treatment emergence was defined as an adverse event starting on or after the date of first study medication administration and up to 70 days after the last (most recent) CZP or PBO dose.

Note: Preferred terms are listed by descending order of frequency in the CZP+MTX group according to SOC. System Organ Classes for which no events were reported are not presented.

a Patient-years at risk was based on the time from the first Period 1 injection to the last Period 1 injection (excluding the Week 52 injection) +70 days divided by 365.25, censored at last clinical contact or first Period 2 injection.

b Exposure-adjusted incidence rate=incidence of new cases (subjects experiencing the event at least once) per 100 pt-yrs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the CZP+MTX group, the most commonly (i.e., those with an incidence of ≥5% in any group) reported TEAEs by PT were nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, and ALT increased. Most TEAEs were reported at a similar (&lt;2% difference between groups) or lower incidence in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group. The TEAEs that occurred in a higher percentage of subjects in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group (difference of ≥2% between groups) were nausea (12.6% vs 10.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9% vs 5.1%), headache (6.8% vs 3.7%), ALT increased (6.4% vs 4.1%), diarrhoea (4.7% vs 1.8%), and fatigue (2.1% vs 0); for each of these PTs, the incidence rate was also higher in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group.

## Severe adverse events

The incidence of any severe TEAE ( Table 27 ) was slightly lower in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX groups (7.1% and 9.2%, respectively). The most frequently reported severe TEAE by PT was latent TB, which was reported by 5 subjects overall (3 subjects (0.5%) for CZP+MTX and 2 subjects (0.9%) for PBO+MTX). All other severe TEAEs by PT were reported at &lt;1.0% and were similar between groups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Deaths

A total of 3 subjects experienced TEAEs leading to death during Period 1 of RA0055; 2 subjects in the CZP+MTX group (pulmonary TB, TB gastrointestinal, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in 1 subject and cerebrovascular accident in 1 subject) and 1 subject in the PBO+MTX group (respiratory failure).

In the CZP+MTX group, the total patient-years at risk was 6.05 per 100 pt-yrs, resulting in a mortality rate of 0.33 deaths per 100 pt-yrs, or 1 death per approximately 333 pt-yrs of exposure. In the PBO+MTX group, the total patient-years at risk was 1.93 per 100 pt-yrs, resulting in a mortality rate of 0.52 deaths per 100 pt-yrs, or 1 death per approximately 192 pt-yrs of exposure.

## Other significant events

## Serious infections

The incidence of TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was similar between the CZP+MTX group (3.0%) and the PBO+MTX group (3.2%). The incidence rate was similar in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group (3.34 vs 3.69/100 pt-yrs).

The most common (i.e. those reported by more than 1 subject in any group) Infection and infestation SAEs (by PT) in the CZP+MTX group were as follows:

- Pneumonia (0.6% vs 1.4% for PBO+MTX)
- Cellulitis (0.3% vs 0.5% for PBO+MTX)
- Latent tuberculosis (TB) (0.2% vs 0.9% for PBO+MTX)

All PTs were reported at similar or lower incidences and incidence rates in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group.

## Opportunistic infections (including active TB)

One subject in the CZP+MTX group had active TB and later died. No subjects in the PBO+MTX group presented with opportunistic infections.

## Herpetic infections

The incidence of herpetic infections was slightly higher in the CZP+MTX group compared to PBO+MTX (3.6% vs 2.3%, respectively). All of the herpetic infections in both treatment groups were non-serious, with the exception of 1 event of herpes zoster in a subject in the CZP+MTX group.

## Malignancies

The TEAE incidence of malignancies, including lymphoma, (as defined by the standardised MedDRA query (SMQ)='Malignancies') was 1.5% in the CZP+MTX group and 0.9% in the PBO+MTX group. No malignancies were reported for subjects ≤30 years of age.

A total of 1.2% CZP+MTX-treated subjects and 0.9% PBO+MTX-treated subjects reported malignancies during Period 1 of RA0055. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate was comparable in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group (1.33/100 pt-yrs vs 1.04/100 pt-yrs) suggesting no overall increased risk for malignant tumors with CZP exposure over the treatment duration covered by this study (52 weeks).

## Autoimmune disorders

There were 2 TEAEs of autoimmune disorders, including lupus and lupus-like illness; 1 event in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CZP+MTX group (0.2%) and 1 event in the PBO+MTX group (0.5%)

## Cardiovascular events

Two subjects (0.3%) in Period 1 of RA0055 had SAEs considered to be major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), both were in the CZP+MTX group. Neither was drug-related nor led to study discontinuation, and both events resolved.

## Neurological disorders

There were no TEAEs suggestive of demyelinating disorders or notable neurological SAEs reported during RA0055 Period 1. One SAE of cerebrovascular accident was reported in1 subject in the CZP+MTX group.

## Hematopoietic cytopenia

There were no serious events of isolated neutropenia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. The incidence of hematopoietic cytopenia treatment-emergent SAEs (defined using SMQ='Haematopoietic cytopenias') was 0.9% in the CZP+MTX group and 0% in the PBO+MTX group. There was no meaningful difference in the incidence rate between the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups (0.99 vs 0/100 pt-yrs), suggesting no overall increased risk for hematopoietic cytopenia with CZP exposure during the  52 weeks covered by this study.

In the CZP+MTX group, the incidences and incidence rates of treatment-emergent SAEs of aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, and bone marrow toxicity were low (≤0.5% and ≤0.50/100 pt-yrs, respectively). Of note, the bone marrow toxicity was considered related to MTX by the Investigator. Only the SAEs of pancytopenia were considered to be related to study medication. Both SAEs of pancytopenia and the SAE of bone marrow toxicity led to discontinuation from the study

## Serious bleeding events

The incidence of treatment-emergent serious bleeding events (defined using the SMQ='Haemorrhages') was 0.6% in the CZP+MTX group and 0.5% in the PBO+MTX group. The exposure adjusted incidence rate in the CZP+MTX group was similar to the PBO+MTX group (0.66 vs 0.52/100 pt-yrs), suggesting no overall increased risk for serious bleeding events with CZP exposure over the 52 weeks of the study.

## All hepatic events

The TEAE incidence of hepatic events was 13.1% in the CZP+MTX group and 12.0% in the PBO+MTX group. The exposure adjusted incidence rate in the CZP+MTX group was similar compared with the PBO+MTX group (15.54 vs 14.64/100 pt-yrs), suggesting no overall increased risk for hepatic disorders with CZP exposure over the 52 weeks of the study.

In the CZP+MTX group, the most frequently reported hepatic TEAEs were as follows:

- ALT increased (6.4% vs 4.1% for PBO+MTX)
- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (3.0% vs 2.3% for PBO+MTX)
- Hepatic enzyme increased (2.4% vs 2.8% for PBO+MTX)

All other hepatic TEAEs were reported at an incidence &lt;2.0%. All hepatic events had a similar incidence and incidence rate between the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups with the exception of ALT increased, which was higher in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group (7.24 vs 4.80/100 pt-yrs).

All subjects were using MTX concomitantly. Among the subjects who had an hepatic event, in the PBO+MTX group, the majority of subjects had received &gt;20mg/week MTX at any time (65.4%), whereas in the CZP+MTX group, a similar percentage of subjects with hepatic events had received 10 to 20mg/week MTX (46.5%) or &gt;20mg/week MTX (44.2%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 51 subjects with ALT increased, 17 subjects reduced the dose of MTX as a result of this event. Of the 25 subjects with AST increased, 8 subjects reduced the dose of MTX as a result of this event. The incidences of all post-Baseline marked elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) were low (&lt;7.0%) and similar between the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups. No subjects had both elevations of bilirubin ≥1xULN and AST or ALT ≥3xULN.

## Local injection site reactions

Local injection site reactions, as determined by the Investigator, were reported in 6.4% of subjects in the CZP+MTX group and 2.3% in the PBO+MTX group. All injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity and non-serious.

## Systemic hypersensitivity injection reactions

One subject reported 1 TEAE of acute systemic hypersensitivity injection reaction (pre-syncope in the CZP+MTX group (0.2%); the event was mild and non-serious). The incidence of delayed systemic hypersensitivity injection reactions was also low (1.1% in the CZP+MTX group and 0.5% in the PBO+MTX group). No delayed systemic hypersensitivity injection reactions were reported in more than 1 subject. All delayed systemic hypersensitivity injection reactions were mild or moderate in severity and non-serious.

## Adverse events by anti-CZP antibody status

A total of 63 of 659 subjects (9.6%) were positive for anti-CZP antibodies. The overall incidence of TEAEs was 90.5% in subjects who were anti-CZP antibody positive compared with 78.5% in subjects who were anti-CZP antibody negative.

The incidences of severe TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs requiring a change in MTX dose, SAEs, and discontinuation due to TEAEs were higher in anti-CZP antibody positive subjects compared with anti-CZP antibody negative subjects ( Table 29 ).

administration and up to 70 days after the last (most recent) CZP or PBO dose.

Note: TEAEs having a serious flag as missing were counted as serious. TEAEs with a missing relationship to study medication were counted as related. TEAEs with a missing intensity were counted as severe.

Note: A subject was overall positive to anti-CZP antibodies if the level was &gt;2.4units/mL on at least 1 visit in Period 1 (no samples were taken after the last/Withdrawal Visit). A subject was overall negative to anti-CZP antibodies if the level was ≤ 2.4units/mL at all visits in Period 1 (excluding Safety Follow-Up Visits).

In the anti-CZP antibody positive group, the incidence of TEAEs with a difference of difference of &gt;10% compared with the anti-CZP antibody negative group was observed in the SOCs of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (30.2% vs 16.8%).

## Adverse events associated with MTX use

The incidence of MTX-associated events was similar between the treatment groups (5.3% [35 subjects] and 5.5% [12 subjects], for CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX, respectively). The AEs reported to be associated with MTX by the Investigators were in line with what is known for this drug.

## Laboratory findings

No clinically meaningful changes in haematology values, serum biochemistry values, or urinalysis values were observed. Overall, the incidence of markedly abnormal haematology values was higher than the incidence of markedly abnormal biochemistry values.

The percentage of subjects with any markedly abnormal post-Baseline haematology value overall was lower in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group whereas the percentage of subjects with any markedly abnormal post-baseline biochemistry parameter was slightly higher in the CZP+MTX group compared to the PBO+MTX group. Treatment-emergent AEs related to biochemistry were most frequently reported in the HLT of liver function analyses; the incidence was similar between treatment groups (11.7% for CZP+MTX and 11.1% for PBO+MTX.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation (i.e. study withdrawal) was low (8.6% in the CZP+MTX group vs 9.2% in the PBO+MTX group), although slightly higher than that seen in the overall RA pool (4.4% in the All CZP in PC group but the median duration of exposure was less in the overall RA pool (112 days vs 364 days in RA0055). The most common TEAEs leading to discontinuation were in the SOC of Infection and infestations (1.7% in the CZP+MTX group).

## Supportive study RA0096

The key inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study were similar to those in RA0055. Subjects in RA0096 were excluded for any previous use of MTX or leflunomide, whereas subjects in RA0055 were excluded for any prior use of all DMARDs, with the possible exception of an antimalarial drug.

Incidences of TEAEs, SAEs, drug-related TEAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to study medication discontinuation during the Treatment Period were generally similar in both treatment groups ( Table 30 ). No deaths occurred.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH has presented safety data for the early RA indication from the pivotal study RA0055 and the supportive Japanese study RA0096.

To supplement this data, comparison, where relevant, with long-term safety data from the overall RA pool were also analysed. The overall RA pool comprised 2 sets of data:

- The Placebo-Controlled (PC) Data: consisting of data from 10 PC studies or PC study phases.
- All Studies Data: consisting of data from all studies/all phases including the 10 PC studies or PC study phases and another 4 studies.

In RA0055, study medication exposure was well-balanced between groups. The total mean duration of CZP/PBO exposure during Period 1 was 307.0 days for the CZP+MTX group and 288.3 days for the PBO+MTX group. The mean patient time at risk was similar between the CZP+MTX and PBO+MTX groups (335.5 and 324.1 days, respectively).

Consistent with RA0055, in the overall RA pool there were more TEAEs in the CZP groups (69.1% in the All CZP in PC group) compared with the placebo group (62.7%). However, the percentage of subjects with severe TEAEs was comparable across the CZP (8.6%) and placebo (8.2%) groups in the overall RA pool and slightly lower in the CZP+MTX group (7.1%) compared with the PBO+MTX group (9.2%) in RA0055.

Of the most common TEAEs (≥5% of subjects in any treatment group), the following AEs showed the largest difference in percentage between groups: nausea (12.6% vs 10.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9% vs 5.1%), headache (6.8% vs 3.7%), ALT increased (6.4% vs 4.1%), and fatigue (2.1% vs 0). The frequency and pattern of TEAEs were in line with previous experience of Cimzia, with the exception of diarrhoea which occurred more frequently in subjects treated with CZP compared to placebo-treated subjects (4.7% vs 1.8%). However, the CHMP considered that there was not enough

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evidence at this stage to establish a causal association between CZP use and diarrhoea, as in the total overall RA population in placebo controlled studies, diarrhoea was observed more frequently in patients treated with placebo (3.6%, compared to 2.6% for patients treated with CZP).

In addition, despite the higher incidence rates of diarrhoea in patients treated with CZP in Study RA0055, the incidence rates (incidence of new cases per 100 subject-years) and their associated 95% confidence intervals were 2.11 (0.57, 5.40) and 5.32 (3.62, 7.56) respectively. The overlapping 95% confidence intervals indicated that a statistical difference in the incidence of diarrhoea between these 2 groups could not be confirmed.

The most common SAEs were in the SOC of Infections and infestations (3.0% for the CZP+MTX group vs 3.2% for PBO+MTX) and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (0.9% for CZP+MTX vs 2.8% for PBO+MTX); for all other SOCs, the incidence of SAEs was &lt;1.5%. This is consistent with results in the overall RA pool where SAEs occurred most often in the SOC of Infections and infestations (3.1% in the All CZP in PC group vs 0.8% for placebo) and for all other SOCs the incidence of SAEs was &lt;1.5%, and is as expected for this class of drug.

The most frequently reported severe TEAE by PT was latent TB. The risk of infections and in particular that of tuberculosis is well established for CZP with extensive warnings and instructions in the SmPC for physicians in cases were latent tuberculosis is suspected.

The TEAEs leading to death in RA0055 were in line with the known risks with anti-TNFα agents, and did not present a new safety signal. The mortality rate of 0.33 deaths per 100 pt-yrs was slightly lower than that observed in the overall RA pool (0.84 deaths per 100 pt-yrs) in the All CZP in PC group.

A total of 1.2% CZP+MTX-treated subjects and 0.9% PBO+MTX-treated subjects reported malignancies during Period 1 of RA0055. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate was comparable in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group (1.33/100 pt-yrs vs 1.04/100 pt-yrs) suggesting no overall increased risk for malignant tumours with CZP exposure over the treatment duration covered by this study (52 weeks).

The overall SAE pattern was also in line with previous experience of Cimzia.

Regarding the incidence of TEAS in relation to the formation of anti-CZP antibodies, a difference of &gt;10% was observed for Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the anti-CZP antibody positive group over the anti-CZP antibody negative group. However, as there were no serious skin reactions reported in this study, and also considering the overall small number of subjects in the anti-CZP antibody positive group, the CHMP considered that the current SmPC adequately reflected the risks related to CZP skin toxicity.

No new safety signals in laboratory findings have emerged in the early RA population.

In study RA0096, incidences of TEAEs and SAEs were generally similar in both treatment groups. No deaths occurred.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of certolizumab pegol is established through the clinical development program in its currently approved indications and experience in the post-marketing setting. This includes several potentially serious risks, such as infections, and potential risks of malignancies, congestive heart failure and demyelinating disorders. Risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous procedures. Review of the submitted data, it was concluded that the adverse event (AE) incidence and profile of Cimzia in the early RA-population was as expected for an anti-TNF-therapy and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consistent with previous experience with Cimzia. No new safety signals emerged from the analysis of the data in the studies with early RA.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The application was to expand the RA indication and based on the current review of the data in support of this indication, no additional risks to the patient were identified.  Therefore the MAH considered that an update to the RMP was not warranted and that the currently approved RMP version for Cimzia was still sufficient to adequately minimise the risks associated with certolizumab use.

The justification provided by the MAH for not updating the RMP was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable, as the introduced changes are not considered to impact the readability of the package leaflet.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Certolizumab pegol is a biologic disease-modifying drug belonging to the class of TNF-inhibitors. In the current submission, the MAH submitted data from a pivotal study with sustained remission at Week 52 as the primary endpoint. The proportion of subjects achieving this in the CZP+MTX group was 28.9% compared with 15.0% (p&lt;0.001) in the PBO+MTX group (FAS1 with non-responder imputation). The proportion of subjects achieving the key secondary endpoint sustained LDA at Week 52 was 43.8% in the CZP+MTX group vs 28.6% in the PBO+MTX group (p&lt;0.001). These were considered to be stringent endpoints and the difference between the MTX-treated group and the MTX+CZP treated group was therefore clinically meaningful.

The proportion of subjects with radiographic non progression at Week 52 (defined as a change from Baseline to Week 52 in mTSS of ≤0.5) was greater in the CZP+MTX (70.3%) group compared with the PBO+MTX group (49.7%; p&lt;0.001).Thus, the submitted data also supported a joint protective effect of Cimzia in combination with MTX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Finally, the proportion of ACR 50 and 70 responders was higher in the Cimzia treated group providing further evidence of a positive effect of CZP in disease activity status.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

At Week 24, the difference in ACR 20/50 between the groups was not statistically different. However, for the more stringent ACR 70, a statistical significance was observed. In addition at all time-points CZP was superior to placebo all 3 measures and therefore the statistical insignificance for one time-point was not expected to be of clinical importance.

For subjects who achieved an improvement of ≥10mm from Baseline (MCID) in PtGADA, no difference between groups was seen at Week 12 (76.1% vs 76.6% in the placebo group and the CZP treated group respectively).  At week 52, the proportions were however 59.6% and 68.2% respectively. The CHMP considered that this observation could be explained by the fact that MCID in PtGADA is not difficult to achieve, in particular in previously DMARD-naïve subjects initiating MTX treatment and that is not a very sensitive tool for capturing changes between different treatments. In addition, CZP-treated subjects achieved higher levels above the MCID threshold than only MTX-treated subjects indicating a better clinical improvement in the CZP group.

Information on time points for x-rays in early withdrawals and sensitivity analyses of change from baseline in mTSS at Week 52 and proportion of subjects with radiographic non-progression at Week 52 were also submitted and all supported the positive findings in the primary pre-defined analyses in favour of CZP compared to placebo.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of certolizumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious risks, including but not limited to infections and potential risks of malignancies, congestive heart failure and demyelinating disorders. Risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place and detailed in the currently approved RMP for CZP. Upon review of the submitted data, it was concluded that the AE incidence and profile of Cimzia in the early RA-population was consistent with previous experience with Cimzia and no new safety signals emerged.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Subjects who developed CZP-antibodies achieved low disease activity at Week 52 to a lesser extent than subjects who did not develop antibodies. However, there was no difference between these groups regarding the need for rescue medication. Furthermore, the percentage of subjects with a positive antibody response to CZP was consistent with the overall percentage in previous RA-studies. Overall, the findings on immunogenicity were consistent with the current product information.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

There is a convincing evidence of the beneficial effects of early intervention in RA, and it is increasingly accepted to use TNF-blockers together with MTX early on in the disease's course, especially in cases with poor prognostic factors, such as high disease activity, presence of CCP-antibodies, and/or RF, or presence of erosions on hand/feet x-ray.

A number of TNF-inhibitors are approved for use in patients with, active and progressive RA not previously treated with MTX (adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab) or other DMARDs (infliximab). The higher sustained (over 12 weeks) remission rate and the joint protective effect which were demonstrated with CZP in the studies in early RA are considered of value in this population.

In addition, no new safety concerns were identified in this particular population and the known risks of CZP are adequately minimised with the risk minimisation activities detailed in the Risk Management Plan and the SmPC of the product.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Robust and clinically  relevant  efficacy  has  been  shown  for  CZP  in  the  treatment  of  severe,  active  and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs. Unfavourable effects typical of anti-TNF treatments have been observed, including infections, but the incidence rate was similar in the CZP and the PBO groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the data available, CZP is approvable for the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIb         |

Extension of indication to include treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not treated previously with methotrexate or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); as a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are revised in order to update the efficacy and safety information. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope
