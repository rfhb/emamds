## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Epithelial  ovarian  carcinoma  and  its  histological  and  clinical  equivalents,  primary  peritoneal  carcinoma (PPC)  and  primary  peritoneal  carcinoma  (FTC),  continue  to  be  a  highly  lethal  primary  gynecologic malignancy  and  is  a  leading  cause  of  gynecologic  cancer-related  mortality  among  women  globally. Worldwide, ovarian cancer affects 225,500 women annually and results in 140,200 cancer-related deaths around the world, with an annual incidence of 65,584 (42,749 deaths) in Europe 1 .

As the disease tends to be asymptomatic in the early stages, the majority of women are diagnosed with disseminated advanced-stage disease. Standard of care at initial diagnosis includes cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by platinum and taxane systemic chemotherapy. Despite optimal upfront surgery and the administration of front line chemotherapy approximately 70% of patients will relapse in the first 3 years 2 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Recurrent disease is classified as either platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive, depending on whether the disease recurs &lt; 6 or ≥6 months, respectively, following last cycle of previous platinum therapy; this classification  is  highly  prognostic  and  is  important  in  determining  treatment  options.  An  increased duration  of  this  platinum-free  interval  (PFI)  to  ≥6  months  corresponds  to  the  likelihood  of  achieving another response with a platinum-based regimen as well as improvements in progression-free survival (PFS)  and  overall  survival  (OS).  As  such,  treatment  for  recurrent  ovarian  cancer  is  directed  by  the patient's previously demonstrated sensitivity to their platinum-based chemotherapy.

For recurrent platinum-sensitive disease, carboplatin in combination with either paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or  pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin  (PLD)  are  the  most  commonly  used  chemotherapy  regimens 2,3 . Bevacizumab is used in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents 4 .

## About the product

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  that  inhibits  angiogenesis  by neutralizing all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by blocking their binding to VEGF receptors. Bevacizumab received Marketing Authorisation (MA) approval in the European Union (EU)  on  12  January  2005  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  mCRC  in  combination  with intravenous 5-FU/folinic acid or intravenous 5-FU/folinic acid/irinotecan. Since the initial MA, bevacizumab has  been  approved  for  use  in  a  variety  of  indications,  including  locally  recurrent  or  metastatic  breast cancer (mBC), advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced and/or metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (mRCC),  newly  diagnosed  glioblastoma  multiforme  (GBM)  and  GBM  after relapse or disease progression, persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, front-line treatment of epithelial ovarian (EOC), primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), or fallopian tube (FTC).

Avastin has been authorised on 31 July 2014 for the treatment of platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine.

The  MAH  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  for  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and paclitaxel in adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary  peritoneal  cancer  based  on  the  results  from  Study  GOG-0213  (Gynecologic  Oncology  Group [GOG] Study-0213), a phase III randomized controlled clinical trial of carboplatin and paclitaxel alone or in  combination  with  bevacizumab  followed  by  bevacizumab,  and  secondary  cytoreductive  surgery  in platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.

## The applied indication was as follows:

Bevacizumab,  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and  gemcitabine or  in  combination  with  carboplatin and paclitaxel ,  is  indicated  for  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  first  recurrence  of  platinum-sensitive epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

The recommended indication is as follows:

Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel , is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

Avastin is administered in combination with either carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 cycles and up to 10

cycles or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 cycles and up to 8 cycles, followed by continued use of Avastin as single agent until disease progression. The recommended dose of Avastin is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion (see SmPC section 4.2).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin of isotype IgG1, which will to a high degree be metabolised  by  normal  proteolytic  pathways  and  excreted  as  non-recognisable  and  non-functional fragments.  As  a  protein  bevacizumab  is  exempted  from  the  necessity  of  ERA  studies.  Nonetheless,  a ready  biodegradability  test  (OECD  301F),  an  algal  growth  test  (OECD  201)  and  an  acute  daphnia immobilisation (OECD 202) inhibition study have been conducted. The studies indicate that bevacizumab is readily biodegradable, and without potential for unexpectedly high ecotoxicity.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

An adequate justification for not providing a full ERA has been provided.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Considering the above data, bevacizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Efficacy and safety data to support this application are derived from Phase III Study GOG-0213 in adult women with platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC, PPC, or FTC.

## GCP

The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.4.2. Main study

## Study GOG-0213

## Methods

Study  GOG-0213  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  open-label  Phase  III  study  comprised  of  two  parts, Objective 1 and Objective 2. Objective 1 evaluated whether the addition of bevacizumab to the secondline and maintenance phases of treatment improves the duration of OS relative to second-line paclitaxel (Pac)  and  carboplatin  (Crb)  alone  in  patients  with  recurrent,  platinum-sensitive,  ovarian  cancer  (OC). Objective 2 is evaluating whether  the  addition of surgical  secondary  cytoreduction  to  adjuvant chemotherapy improves the duration of OS in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, OC.

The CSR submitted only reports the data collected on or before 5 November 2014 for Objective 1. The study is ongoing to address Objective 2 regarding secondary cytoreduction and is outside the scope of the CSR.

An overview of the study design (objective 1) is presented below.

## Treatments

## Bevacizumab

The dose of bevacizumab was 15 mg/kg administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

## Carboplatin

The dose of carboplatin (AUC5) was calculated to reach a target area under the curve (AUC) according to the Calvert formula using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Carboplatin  was  administered  as  a  60-minute  infusion.  When  administered  in  conjunction  with  other medications,  carboplatin  was  to  be  infused  after  the  other  agents.  Carboplatin,  either  alone  or  in combination was to be premedicated with dexamethasone (either IV or PO), anti-histamine H1 (such as diphenhydramine) and anti-histamine H2 (such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine).

Carboplatin  doses  were  based  on  the  patient's  weight  at  baseline  and  were  to  remain  the  same throughout the study. However, the doses were to be recalculated if the patient had a weight change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline.

## Paclitaxel

The initial dose of paclitaxel was 175 mg/m 2  given on Day 1 of each 21 day-cycle. Patients whose body weight changed by 10% or more were to undergo recalculation of the dose based on the adjusted body surface area.

## Docetaxel

Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2  IV over 1 hour could be substituted for paclitaxel.

## Objectives

## Primary objectives

·  To  determine  whether  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  the  second-line  and  maintenance  phases  of treatment increases the duration of OS relative to second-line carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer (Objective 1).

## Secondary objectives

· To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phase of treatment increases  the  duration  of  PFS  relative  to  second-line  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  alone  in  patients  with platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· To prospectively determine the incidence of carboplatin and paclitaxel hypersensitivity in these patients undergoing retreatment with both agents as first recurrence therapy.

· To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phases of treatment increases  quality  of  life  (QOL)  relative  to  second-line  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  alone  in  patients  with platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

## Outcomes/endpoints

- Primary endpoint:  OS defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause.
- Secondary endpoint:
- o PFS  defined  as  the  time  between  the  date  of  randomization  and  the  date  of  first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Tumor assessments and  response  evaluations  were  determined  by  the  investigators  using  GOG  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (a modification of standard RECIST criteria per Therasse. 2000). Measurable disease was defined as at least one lesion that could  be  accurately  measured  in  at  least  one  dimension  (longest  dimension  to  be recorded). Each lesion was to be ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain X-ray, CT, and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT.
- o Safety
- o Quality of life (QoL)

## Sample size

The targeted accrual for Objective 1 of the study was 660 patients. It was anticipated that 240 eligible patients per year could be enrolled from GOG treatment centers. Therefore, the expected time to accrue the  targeted  sample  size  was  2.75  years.  An  additional  1.5  year  post-accrual  follow-up  period  was anticipated.

## Randomisation

Patients meeting eligibility requirements were to be considered first for the surgical randomization aspect of the trial.

Chemotherapy was to be administered following recovery up to 6 weeks after surgery. Patients who were surgical candidates and consented to be randomized to the surgical objective underwent randomization to the surgical objective followed by randomization to the bevacizumab objective: Crb+Pac or Crb+Pac+Bev. Patients who were not surgical candidates or who declined randomization to the surgical objective, were randomized only to the bevacizumab objective: Crb+Pac or Crb+Pac+Bev.

Randomization was stratified by secondary surgical debulking status (randomized to undergo cytoreduction  or  randomized  to  not  undergo  secondary  cytoreduction  vs.  not  a  candidate  or  did  not consent to secondary surgical cytoreduction) and time from completing first-line platinum chemotherapy to  registration  onto  this  study  (6  -  12  months  vs.  &gt;  12  months).  The  registration  form,  i.e. randomization  schema  defined  the  stratification  factor  as  'treatment-free  interval'  that  does  not consistently represent the platinum-free interval due to the inconsistent use of maintenance therapy in the front-line setting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Objective 1 of this study was to determine whether bevacizumab reduced the overall death rate when compared to the standard treatment (CT).

The null hypotheses: H0: HR = λCTB / λCT = 1 was assessed, where λ is the death rate for the indicated treatment. The treatment regimens (Crb+Pac alone and Crb+Pac+Bev) were compared with a log-rank procedure  which  included  all  of  the  patients  categorized  by  their  randomly  assigned  treatment.  This comparison only included patients enrolled prior to 29 August 2011 and hence selected their systemic treatment. The type I error for this comparison was limited to 2.5% (one-tail) accounting for the planned interim analyses. This is equivalent to a 5% (two-tailed) test as described in the Roche SAP.

The log-rank test was stratified (using stratification factors as recorded on the CRF) by the secondary surgical debulking status (randomized to undergo cytoreduction or randomized to not undergo secondary cytoreduction  vs.  not  a  candidate  or  did  not  consent  to  secondary  surgical  cytoreduction)  and  the duration of platinum-free interval prior to enrolling onto this study (6 - 12 months vs. &gt; 12 months).

If  the  bevacizumab-containing regimen reduced the overall death rate of the control regimen by 25%, then  this  was  considered  clinically  significant.  Assuming  proportional  hazards,  this  effect  size  was comparable to increasing the expected proportion surviving for at least 22 months (median from previous studies) by 9.5% (50.0% vs. 59.5%). In order to provide an 81% chance of detecting this effect size, the study was considered sufficiently mature to permit a final analysis of the systemic regimens when there were  at  least  214  deaths  (214/330  =  0.65)  reported  among  those  patients  assigned  to  the  standard regimen (CT). If the alternative hypothesis was true, then the expected total number of deaths at the time of the final analyses would be 394. The critical values for rejecting the null hypothesis were adjusted for one interim analysis at 50% information to control the Type I error, using the O'Brien and Fleming like type I error spending function proposed by Lan and DeMets

An interim analysis of efficacy and futility with a data cutoff of 30 August 2012 was conducted as prespecified  in  the  protocol  when  at  least  110  deaths  were  reported  among  all  those  patients  randomly allocated  prior  to  29  August  2011  to  the  Crb+Pac  alone  regimen  (approximately  50%  of  the  full information for Objective 1). A total number of 209 deaths among all patients randomized prior to 29 August  2011  had  occurred  at  this  interim  analysis  (114  in  the  Crb+Pac  alone  arm,  95  in  the Crb+Pac+Bev arm).

The study was not stopped at the interim analysis (no information was released) and Genentech / Roche was made aware of the results after the final analysis, corresponding to the full information required for the final overall survival (OS) analysis pre-specified in the GOG-0213 protocol. At the time of the GOG data cutoff on 5 November 2014, there were 415 deaths reported among all patients randomly allocated prior to 29 August 2011.

The efficacy analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were randomized to study treatment.

The  primary  safety  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one  full  or partial dose of any component of the study treatment (bevacizumab or chemotherapy).

The comparison of OS between the two treatment arms was based on a two-sided stratified log-rank test at the overall 0.05 level of significance. Adjusting for the alpha spent during the first interim analysis, the two-sided alpha boundary for the final analysis was recalculated to be 0.0489 (adjusted two sided alpha

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

level).  Median  OS  for  both  treatment  arms  was  estimated  using  Kaplan-Meier  methodology  and  95% confidence  intervals  for  median  OS  were  computed  on  the  basis  of  standard  errors  from  Greenwoods formula. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for the two treatment arms. For patients who have not died  by  the  time  of  analysis,  data  was  censored  as  of  the  last  contact  date  at  which  the  patient  was known to be alive. Data for patients who were lost to follow-up were analyzed as censored observations on the date of last contact. Estimate of the treatment effect was expressed as a hazard ratio (HR, with two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]) using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model fitted with the treatment (carboplatin plus paclitaxel with bevacizumab compared to carboplatin plus paclitaxel alone) and adjusted for the stratification factors at randomization (the same as used in the stratified log-rank test).

A stratified log-rank test (using the same stratification factors as for the primary efficacy analysis) was used to compare the duration of PFS between treatment arms. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate  median  PFS  for  both  treatment  arms,  and  the  95%  CI  for  median  PFS  was  computed  using Greenwoods formula. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to provide a visual depiction of the difference between the treatment arms. Data from patients who have not experienced disease progression or death was censored at the last tumour  assessment  date.  Data  for  patients  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  were analyzed as censored observations on the date of the last tumour assessment or if no post-randomization tumour  assessment  was  available,  at  the  date  of  randomization.  Data  for  patients  who  received  nonprotocol specified anti-cancer therapy (NPT) prior to their PFS event were censored at the last disease assessment prior to receiving NPT. Data for patients without an event were censored at the date of the last  disease  assessment  prior  to  receiving  NPT.  The  HR  was  estimated  using  the  stratified  Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Descriptive summary statistics of the baseline HRQoL data were calculated, including descriptions of the distribution  of  HRQoL scores (mean, standard deviation, median, etc.). A repeated mixed-effect model (including patients as random effects) was used to assess the difference in mean FACT-O-TOI scores over time  and  between  treatment  arms.  This  model  had  a  term  for  time  that  was  treated  as  a  categorical variable, a term for treatment group, and a term for treatment-by-time interaction. Baseline scores were included as covariates in the model. Statistically significant differences were interpreted with reference to published estimates of clinically meaningful differences

ORR was defined as percentage of patients with a complete or partial overall response determined by two consecutive investigator assessments ≥ 4 weeks apart, was compared between the two treatment arms using the Mantel-Haenszel χ 2 test, stratified by the same factors used in the primary efficacy analysis. For both treatment arms, an estimate of the ORR and its 95% CI was determined; an exact 95% CI was constructed  using  the  Clopper-Pearson  method.  CIs  for  the  difference  in  ORRs  between  the  two  arms were determined using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

- Carboplatin AUC5 + paclitaxel 175 mg/m* + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days for 6- 8 cycles (bevacizumab continued until disease progression or adverse events precluded further treatment).
- ° See Section 4.2 for a fullist of reasons for treatment withdrawal. Note that patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm were at risk for withdrawal from treatment for longer than patients in the Crb+Pac alone arm. Patients in the Crb+Pac alone arm only received 6 - 8 cycles of treatment, whereas patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm received treatment with 6 -8 cycles of Crb+Pac+Bev followed by bevacizumab alone until PD or unacceptable toxicity.

## Recruitment

First Patient Entered: 10 December 2007.

Last Patient Entered: 26 August 2011 (for Objective 1) Data cutoff: 5 November 2014.

67 centers: United States (65 centers), South Korea (1 center), Japan (1 center).

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol deviations

A total of 33 patients were reported to have major protocol deviations, and these occurred with a similar frequency in the Crb+Pac alone arm (16 patients: 4.8%) and Crb+Pac+Bev arm (17 patients: 5.0%). A total of 11 patients (3.3%) in the Crb+Pac alone arm and 8 patients (2.4%) in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm were deemed to have deviations based on pathology committee review. These included 11 patients due to inadequate pathology, 5 patients due to wrong cell type and 3 patients due to wrong primary.

## Changes to study conduct

The original version of the protocol dated 6 December 2007 was amended 5 times for patients enrolled in the first part of the study prior to 29 August 2011 (for Objective 1).

## Changes to the Statistical Analysis

The  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP),  although  written  retrospectively  by  Roche,  was  based  on  the  prespecified GOG-0213 SAP as defined in the GOG-0213 protocol.  All analyses pertaining to the primary and secondary  endpoints  were  performed  on  the  basis  of  the  outline  in  the  protocol.  Additional  sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the robustness of the primary and secondary analyses.

The results presented in the CSR are based on the data that was transferred from GOG to Genentech / Roche on 10 December 2015, cleaned per Genentech / Roche standards and analyzed using methods considered appropriate for detailed scientific review. The major differences between the GOG and Roche analyses of the study included:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -For the stratified efficacy analysis, instead of using treatment-free-interval data based on the randomization system as one of the stratification factors as used by the GOG, Roche used the platinum-free-interval data based on the eCRF. Clinically, PFI is deemed to be the more robust prognostic factor than TFI. Furthermore, it can be more accurately assessed using eCRF inputs since it would take into consideration modifications in front-line treatment such as maintenance therapy with a taxane, bevacizumab, or another agent. The stratified OS analysis based on GOG's approach was also performed and is reported in this CSR as a sensitivity analysis.
- -A two-sided test with 5% alpha which is equivalent to a 1-sided test with 2.5% alpha was used.
- -ORR was added as an exploratory analysis in Roche's analysis plan although it was not part of the original protocol specified endpoints.
- -Adverse event reporting from Roche was through MedDRA coding.

The table below shows the concordance between platinum-free interval reported on the eCRF and the treatment  free  interval  reported  on  the  registration  form  (randomisation  schema)  for  all  randomised patients in the study. 45 patients (6.7%) had a discrepancy in the stratification factors (TFI vs. PFI) at randomisation between the eCRF and registration form.

Table 4: Concordance between PFI and TFI

| All 673 patients    | 6 ≤ TFI ≤ 12 months   | TFI > 12 months   |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 6 ≤ PFI ≤ 12 months | 169 (25.1%)           | 5 (0.7%)          |
| PFI > 12 months     | 40 (5.9%)             | 459 (68.3%)       |

There were 5 patients with 6 ≤ PFI ≤ 12 months and TFI &gt; 12 months. For one patient the date of recurrence was 9 days short of 12 months. The date of the recurrence was clarified and confirmed with the GOG after querying the site. For the other 4 patients, the TFI interval appears to have been incorrectly entered on the registration form.

## Ancillary analyses

Sensitivity analyses for OS

## a) Time to censoring

The Kaplan-Meier curves of time to censoring remained close over the course of the study.

## b) Multiple cox regression model for overall survival

A summary of a multiple Cox regression model adjusted for treatment and baseline prognostic factors that  might  be  associated  with  OS  is  shown  below.  No  covariate  selection  process  was  applied;  all covariates  were  included  in  the  model,  regardless  of  statistical  significance.  An  estimated  HR  in  one subgroup level is defined by the covariate (e.g., White for covariate race) relative to those in the other subgroup level (e.g., non-White) resulting from the model containing all covariates. The adjusted hazard ratio for treatment group was 0.80 (95% CI [0.66, 0.98], p-value = 0.0312).

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

No formal dose-response studies were submitted in support of this indication. The chosen dose is similar to other indications. The recommended dose of bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg bw given once every 21 days (q3w) as an intravenous infusion, is acceptable. The clinical studies performed in 7.5 and 10 mg/kg bw, are not convincing enough to change the 15 mg/kg bw dose, which is the currently approved dose in the front-line and recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer settings.

The Applicant initially submitted the results of one single pivotal trial to support the proposed indication. The treatment of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer (hereafter referred to as 'ovarian cancer') is based on platinum-doublet therapy. The commonly used agents are carboplatin and paclitaxel. Thus, the chemotherapy backbone is acceptable. Data from patients who underwent surgery were pooled with those who did not have surgery in the two treatment groups. Since these patients were randomised into the two treatment arms, it should be fairly balanced, and thus any possible impact of surgery status would be similar in the two groups.

The Applicant applied acceptable inclusion/exclusion criteria that clearly define patients with histological diagnosed recurrent EOC, PPC or FTC after complete response to front-line platinum-taxane therapy, and treatment-free interval of at least 6 months. Patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab were also enrolled in the study and this subgroup will provide valuable information with regard to continued bevacizumab treatment in the proposed patient population. Patients were excluded if they had conditions that may have been exacerbated upon treatment with bevacizumab.

Patients were randomised to crb+pac or crb+pac+bev. The used doses/schedules of bevacizumab, carboplatin, paclitaxel and docetaxel are in alignment with current clinical practice.

The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to the crb+pac chemo-backbone increase median OS. The Applicant has defined one primary endpoint, OS, and several secondary endpoints, incl. PFS. The primary endpoint, OS, is fully acceptable and secondary endpoints will  provide  further  valuable  evidence/data  with  regard  to  the  use  of  bevacizumab  in  this  patient population.  Tumour  assessments  and  response  evaluations  were  determined  by  the  investigators.  The GOG RECIST criteria have been used in this study which may differ from other studies with bevacizumab. Disease progression could be defined by CA-125 criteria alone. It is reflected in the SmPC 5.1, that GOG RECIST criteria have been used. Furthermore, the Applicant has post-hoc added ORR as an exploratory endpoint. This endpoint was not part of original protocol from GOG, and consequently the value of these data is very limited.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were randomized based on secondary surgical debulking and treatment-free period, which both are important prognostic factors. The MAH has applied slightly different criteria how to interpret/define treatment-free -interval compared to the GOG. However, analysis of OS by the GOG criteria were included as sensitivity analysis. Fourty five (45) patients (6.7%) had a discrepancy in the stratification factors (TFI vs. PFI) at randomisation between the eCRF and registration form. The 40 patients with 6 ≤ TFI ≤ 12 months and PFI &gt; 12 months could, according to the MAH, possibly be explained by the inconsistent use of maintenance therapy in the front-line setting obscuring the actual date of last platinum treatment.

The study is open-label thus there is a theoretical chance that secondary endpoints such as PFS, HRQoL and safety may have been biased due to the study design.

In terms of statistical methods, the MAH has correctly adjusted for multiplicity due to the interim analysis. The sample size calculation seems reasonable. The decision to stratify by platinum-free interval and not by the originally planned treatment-free interval was made retrospectively after the study results were published and well known to personnel involved in the reporting of the study. In the primary analysis of OS the stratification factors defined in the original randomisation schema would have been preferred (p=0.0683, a non-significant difference).

A higher percentage of patients had withdrawn from trial treatment in the Crb+ Pac + Bev arm (88.7%) than in  the  Crb  +  Pac  alone  arm  (32.7%).  However,  this  difference  is  largely  attributed  to  the  longer observation period in the Crb + Pac + Bev arm due to the continued treatment with Bev alone in that arm. The number of patients that did not receive treatment, patients that withdrew from treatment due to 'patient withdrawal' and patients lost to follow-up were quite similar between arms.

There were comparable numbers of major protocol deviations in the two arms, and these were mostly related to pathology committee review. The MAH has provided an overview of the protocol deviations, which were minor and are deemed not to have had any major influence on the trial results.

The baseline demographic characteristics were well-balanced with no major differences. Mean age is approximately 60 years, ranging from 23 to 85. The majority of patients are below 65 years, white, ECOG 0 or 1. Very few patients were ECOG 3. These characteristics are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The majority of patients were diagnosed with serous adenocarcinoma, FIGO stage III, poorly differentiated histology, with ovary as the primary site and with CA-125 being abnormal. The baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced; however, there were slightly more patients with FIGO stage III in the bev+chemo arm. If any, this slight imbalance is in favour of the control arm, however, this is considered unlikely.

In total 69 patients had received prior anti-VEGF/bevacizumab. The Applicant clarified that all of the 69 patients had received bevacizumab as part of frontline therapy. Furthermore, only 36 patients (ca. 5-6 %) had received frontline bevacizumab maintenance therapy, thus, only a limited number of patient are treated with prior bev/anti-VEGF or maintenance bevacizumab.

The applicant discussed results from three supportive studies in the platinum-sensitive recurrent OC setting as response to CHMP request to further justify the indication in patients previously treated with bevacizumab (data not shown). Among the 29 patients in the single arm phase 2 trial of irinotecan in combination with bevacizumab in recurrent OC (Musa et al. 2016), 12 patients (41.3%) had received prior bevacizumab and the clinical benefit rate was similar to that in the ITT population of the study [67% (95% CI: 35%, 90%) vs. 72.4% (95% CI: 52.8%, 87.3%)]. The AURELIA study included 26 patients (7%) who were previously treated with anti-angiogenic therapy and then were treated with bevacizumab. Sample size was deemed to be inadequate to draw any conclusions. Results from a single institutional pilot study examining the efficacy and safety of adding oral cyclophosphamide to sequential bevacizumab therapy in recurrent OC (Matulonis et al. 2012) were also provided. Thirteen (13) patients (of the total 20

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enrolled) who progressed with single bevacizumab were continued on bevacizumab with added oral cyclophosphamide, resulting in 4 patients with confirmed clinical benefit. The authors concluded that adding oral cyclophosphamide to bevacizumab after tumour progression on single-agent bevacizumab appears to be safe and tolerable. Overall, the three supportive studies mentioned are very small, single arm studies and therefore it is not possible to draw any conclusions from these.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The pivotal study met its primary endpoint. The HR is 0.823 (0.680, 0.996), p-value = 0.0447. Median OS improved 5.3 months from 37.3 to 42.6 months, adding almost an additional half year of survival is considered of clinical relevance. In the stratified analysis using the stratification factors based on the registration form during randomisation the HR for OS was 0.838 (95% CI [0.693; 1.014]) and the logrank test p-value was 0.0683. This was the planned analysis in the clinical study protocol by GOG, and did not reach statistical significance. However, both the HR and median survival times were similar to the OS analysis based on the on the eCRF. These data have been reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.1).

The results of the subgroup analyses for OS in the ITT population were generally consistent with the results of the protocol-specified primary analysis of OS with the majority of subgroups having the point estimate of the HR below 1 and were consistent with the overall treatment effect. Note, however, that the study was not powered to detect differences in the individual subgroups, and that many of the subgroups included small numbers of patients as seen by the wide 95% CIs.

With regard the subgroup of patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab/ant-VEGF, it is important to emphasize  that  only  69  patients  are  included  in  this  subgroup.  There  is  no  clear  benefit  of  treating patients  with  prior  exposure  to  bevacizumab  in  first-line,  with  bevacizumab  at  first  platinum-sensitive relapse.  Even  though  additional  supportive  studies  have  been  presented,  there  is  no  strong  scientific rationale to support removing the limitation from the current label.

Additionally, the proposed removal of the limitation to previous bevacizumab use will not only apply to paclitaxel and carboplatin, but also to carboplatin and gemcitabine. However, no data were presented in the  dossier  to  substantiate  a  removal  of  the  limitation  for  previous  bevacizumab  use  for  the  already approved carboplatin and gemcitabine combination.  Therefore, the provided data are not supportive of the indication of bevacizumab and chemotherapy using the carboplatin and gemcitabine combination in patients who received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

The PFS result support the primary endpoint, median PFS improved from 10.2 to 13.8 months, and these findings are also overall in line the PFS results in study AVF4095g, where the PFS by INV was 8.4 vs. 12.4 in the crb+gem and crb+gem+bev arm respectively. It is acknowledged that the chemotherapy backbone is different between studies AVF4095g and GOG-0213, but it is nonetheless encouraging to observe that the PFS results in the bevacizumab arms are similar. PFS was primary endpoint in study AVF4095g that led  to  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  use  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and gemcitabine in patients with platinum-sensitive disease.

The performance of bevacizumab in different subgroups in terms of PFS is overall in line with the ITT result. However, some of the subgroups are very small leading to great uncertainty. No firm conclusions can be drawn from these subgroups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is no indication of any detrimental effect on QoL by adding bevacizumab to crb-pac, but having in mind that the study is open-label, the value of these data are questioned. The Applicant also defined and performed  post-hoc  analysis  of  ORR,  and  as  such  it  has  limited  value.  However,  the  results  seem  to support the OS and PFS results.

Hence, the presented data from Study GOG-0213 show non-significant changes in OS and PFS for this small subgroup of patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab. In addition, the three supportive studies mentioned are very small, single arm studies and therefore it is not possible to draw any conclusions from these. A summary of data on bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme was provided, however, these data are not considered possible to extrapolate into the platinum-sensitive recurrent OC setting.

No explanation was provided regarding a possible resistance mechanism to bevacizumab in non-naïve patients and its potential impact on the efficacy of re-treatment with bevacizumab in the relevant setting.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In conclusion, the pivotal study met its primary endpoint and clinically relevant results are observed with regard to OS and PFS in the ITT population. Additional data from three supportive studies were also presented. However, no sufficient clinical data or strong scientific rationale were provided for the continuous treatment of patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Consistent with the objectives of the study, the primary comparison of safety was based on the safety population  over  the  entire  study  (i.e.,  Crb+Pac+Bev  followed  by  bevacizumab  alone  compared  with Crb+Pac  alone  without  any  further  treatment).  This  provides  a  conservative  assessment  of  the  safety profile of bevacizumab as well as of the bevacizumab based regimen investigated in this trial. No analysis by  treatment  phase  was  undertaken  given  the  known  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  treatment.  An overview of safety in patients previously treated with bevacizumab is also provided.

## Patient exposure

The safety population in the study comprised those patients who received at least one full or partial dose of  any  component  of  trial  treatment,  with  patients  assigned  according  to  the  treatment  they  actually received. Of the 336 patients randomized to Crb+Pac alone, 327 received the randomized treatment (i.e., Crb+Pac). Of the 337 patients randomized to Crb+Pac+Bev, 325 patients received at least one dose of Bev and 5 patients only received Crb+Pac. As a result, these 5 patients were included in the Crb+Pac alone arm for the safety analysis. Thus, the safety analysis population included 332 patients (98.8%) in the Crb+Pac alone arm and 325 patients (96.4%) in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. The safety population who were previously treated with bevacizumab included 35 patients (10.4%) in the Crb+Pac alone arm and 33 patients (9.8%) in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm.

The overall  median duration of exposure in the overall safety population was 18.6 (range 0.1 - 65.1) weeks in the Crb+Pac alone arm and 48.9 (range 0.1 - 333.9) weeks in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm.

The  median  duration  of  exposure  of  bevacizumab  was  48.9  (range  0.1  -  333.9)  weeks  in  the Crb+Pac+Bev arm, and the median duration of carboplatin (Crb+Pac: 18.1 weeks; Crb+Pac+Bev: 18.7

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks)  and  paclitaxel/docetaxel  (Crb+Pac:  18.3  weeks;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  19.3  weeks)  was  comparable between the Crb+Pac alone arm and the Crb+Pac+Bev arm.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)

In the overall safety population, one or more AESIs of any grade were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (73%) compared to the Crb+Pac alone arm (23%). This difference was mainly due to an increase of specific AESIs in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm compared to the Crb+Pac alone arm. These were bleeding events (42% patients vs. 11% patients, respectively), hypertension (42% patients vs. 3%  patients, respectively), proteinuria (17%  patients vs. &lt;1%  patients, respectively) and neutropenia and associated complications (Crb+Pac; 8%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 12%).

## Deaths/other significant events

A total of 219 (66.0%) deaths were reported in patients receiving Crb+Pac and 207 (63.7%) deaths were reported  in  patients  receiving  Crb+Pac+Bev.  The  most  frequently  reported  cause  of  death  in  both treatment arms was ''due to this disease'' (i.e., ovarian cancer), which accounted for 62.0% of deaths in the Crb+Pac arm and 58.8% of deaths in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. In addition, 5 patients (1.5%) in each treatment arm died 'due to this disease (i.e., ovarian cancer)/due to other cause', and 2 patients (0.6%) in each treatment arm died ''due to this disease/due to protocol treatment''. One patient (0.3%) in each treatment arm died ''due to protocol treatment'.

<!-- image -->

A review of all patients with causes of death recorded as 'Due to other cause', 'Due to this disease/Due to  other  cause'  and  'Unknown'  was provided. The analysis revealed that some deaths reported under these  categories  were  due  to  concomitant  diseases.  There  were  7  patients  who  died  due  to  unknown cause, and most events occurred during the follow-up period of the trial and in the absence of exposure to any study drug. Although the causes were unknown, they occurred for the most part during the follow up period without exposure to any study drug.

## Laboratory findings

Normal ranges were not available in this study. Therefore, Grade 0 and 1 could not be derived and were left as missing in the table below. As a result, this table can only be used to interpret CTCAE v3 Grades 2, 3  and  4.  Percentages  are  based  on  total  number  of  patients  with  laboratory  values  that  fall  within CTCAEv3 Grade 2, 3 or 4, and not on the overall safety population.

Clinically meaningful laboratory test value abnormalities as assessed by the investigator were reported as AEs.  During  the  study,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  a  worst  value  of  Grade  2  for  haemoglobin (Crb+Pac:  98%;  Crb+Pac+Bev  92%),  WBC  (Crb+Pac:  91%;  Crb+Pac+Bev  95%)  and  granulocytes (Crb+Pac:  96%;  Crb+Pac+Bev  95%)  was  similar  in  both  treatment  arms.  Too  few  patients  had  their platelets measured for a meaningful interpretation of the data to be made.

All incidences of Grade 3 haemoglobin and WBC, and Grade 3 and 4 granulocytes in both arms during treatment occurred in patients who had missing baseline values. Thus, it was not possible to determine whether these grades were newly occurring or were already present at baseline.  No chemistry laboratory values were available in this trial.

## Adverse events that led to dose modification

In study GOG-0213, dose modifications (increase or decrease in dose) for bevacizumab due to AEs were not allowed, and bevacizumab could be either held or discontinued according to the hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. For Crb and Pac, the dose could be modified (held, reduced or discontinued) based on hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity. AEs leading to a reduction in the dose of Crb and Pac were not collected consistently in study GOG-0213.

## Safety in prior bevacizumab population

The safety profile in patients who were retreated with bevacizumab in this trial was consistent with safety observed in the overall safety population The key safety data reported in the population of 69 patients previously treated with bevacizumab indicated the following:

- The proportion of patients with at least one AE (all grades) was similar in the two treatment arms (Crb+Pac: 97.1%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 100.0%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The proportion of patients with a SAE was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (27.3%) than in the Crb+Pac  alone  arm  (8.6%).  The  majority  of  SAEs  occurred  in  single  patients  only  in  either treatment arm.
- The proportion of patients with Grade ≥ 3 AEs was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (51.5%) than in the Crb+Pac alone arm (37.1%). The most frequently reported Grade ≥ 3 AEs were abdominal pain  (Crb+Pac:  0%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  12%),  nausea  (Crb+Pac:  3%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  9%),  small intestine  obstruction  (Crb+Pac:  3%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  6%),  febrile  neutropenia  (Crb+Pac:  0%; Crb+Pac+Bev:  9%),  hypertension  (Crb+Pac:  0%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  6%),  proteinuria  (Crb+Pac: 0%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 6%) and dyspnoea (Crb+Pac: 0%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 6%).
- Grade  5  AEs  were  reported  with  a  low  and  equivalent  frequency  in  both  treatment  arms (Crb+Pac: 1 patient [2.9%]; Crb+Pac+Bev: 0 patients [0%]).
- More patients  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm  (18.2%)  than  in  the  Crb+Pac  alone  arm  (2.9%)  were withdrawn from any study drug due to an AE. The majority of AEs (by preferred term) leading to study treatment discontinuation occurred in &lt; 1% of patients in either treatment arm.
- AESIs were reported more frequently in patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (63.6% patients) than in the Crb+Pac alone arm (11.4% patients). More patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (21.2%) than in the Crb+Pac alone arm (5.7%) had a Grade ≥ 3 AESI or a serious AESI (Crb+Pac+Bev: 9.1%; Crb+Pac: 2.9%).
- The  most  common  AESIs  were  non-CNS  bleeding  (Crb+Pac;  5.7%;  Crb+Pac+Bev:  45.5%), hypertension (Crb+Pac; 0%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 27.3%), proteinuria (Crb+Pac; 0%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 15.2%) and neutropenia and associated complications (Crb+Pac; 5.7%; Crb+Pac+Bev: 12.1%).

A total of seven patients were reported with 8 AEs between the 30 November 2010 and the data cutoff for the final CSR (31 March 2013), including one patient in the CP arm and six patients in the CPB7.5+ am.

Note: MedDRA v14.0 was used for Studies BO17707/ICON7 and G0G-0218. MedDRA v18.1 was used for Study G0G-0213.

Note: Duration of drug exposure is significantly different between the three studies and may account for the obsenved differences in the incidences of AEs. However. the observed differences remain consistent with the known safety profile of Avastine.

## Post marketing experience

Globally,  bevacizumab  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (mCRC),  locally recurrent  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  (mBC),  advanced,  metastatic,  or  recurrent  non-small  cell  lung cancer  (NSCLC),  advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (mRCC),  newly  diagnosed  glioblastoma multiforme  (GBM)  and  GBM  after  relapse  or  disease  progression,  front-line  treatment  of  EOC,  FTC,  or PPC,  treatment  of  platinum-sensitive  and  platinum-resistant  recurrent  EOC,  FTC,  or  PPC,  and  cervical cancer.

Since  initial  market  approval  in  the  United  States  on  26  February  2004  (i.e.,  international  birth  date [IBD])  and  until  the  end  of  the  February  2016,  bevacizumab  has  been  approved  for  use  in  over  100 countries worldwide. The  estimated cumulative clinical trial  exposure  to  bevacizumab  from  the development international birth date (DIBD, 3 March 1997) to February 2016 is 32,237 patients. Since the  IBD,  an  estimated  total  of  2,394,526  patients  have  received  bevacizumab  in  the  postmarketing setting.

The  number  of  AE  and  SAEs  experienced  by  patients  by  SOC  since  the  IBD  in  all  indications  and  in ovarian cancer was presented. The higher proportion of AEs and SAEs in patients with ovarian cancer compared to the proportion  of  AEs  and  SAEs  in  the  overall  population  (i.e.,  all  indications)  within  the Gastrointestinal SOC and Reproductive system and breast disorders SOC is confounded by the ovarian patient population. Overall, the safety profile of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer was consistent with the known safety profile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No relevant new additional safety signals have been identified based on postmarketing data from patients treated  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  The  Sponsor  will  continue  to  actively monitor safety as part of the ongoing pharmacovigilance program.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab across multiple indications. Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is also indicated for the front-line treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

The median duration of exposure of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel is comparable between the two treatment arms. The median number of bevacizumab cycles is 16. The total dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel is also comparable between the two arms.  Overall, this enables a reasonable assessment of safety in this patient population. The duration of safety follow-up is also considered acceptable.

The overall number of AEs was comparable between the two arms, however, there were more SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the crb+pac+bev arm. There were considerably more cases of non-CNS bleedings, hypertension, proteinuria and thromboembolic events. However, the events are expected and observed in clinical trials with bevacizumab. They are clinically manageable and are reflected in the SmPC, where precautionary measures are also provided.

Hypomagnesaemia is often associated with chemotherapy and may in theory be augmented by diarrhoea or by increased excretion from the kidney, however, diarrhoea occurred only slightly more frequently in the crb+pac+bev arm. Proteinuria, as a sign of affected kidney function, was much more frequently observed in the crb+pac+bev arm. There were significantly more patients in the chemo + bev arm who developed hypomagnesaemia (16.9% vs 27.4%) and the applicant conducted a detailed review of all patients who experienced a hypomagnesaemia event. Although hypomagnesaemia was possibly associated with proteinuria, no firm conclusions could be drawn. The nature, severity, and incidence of hypomagnesaemia in bevacizumab-exposed patients was consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab and no clinically significant consequences from hypomagnesaemia were observed in the trial. Hypomagnesemia has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. No other change in risk minimization activities was proposed and this is considered acceptable.

In terms of AESIs, bleeding, hypertension, neutropenia, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, wound healing complications and GI perforations occurred more frequently in the bevacizumab arm. These events are AESI and are as such expected to occur more frequently in the bevacizumab arm. This is expected based on previous experience with bevacizumab in different indications over the past decade. These events are clinically manageable and adequately reflected in the SmPC, where precautionary measures are also provided.  Most of the bleeding events were epistaxis. There were no cerebrovascular bleeding events in the bevacizumab arm.

The number of patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm with a GI fistula did not exceed what has earlier been reported for this patient group and is reflected in the SmPC (2%). In the present trial four patients (1.2%) in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm experienced a Grade ≥3 GI perforation event (colonic fistula, intestinal perforation, small intestine perforation, and large intestine perforation). All-grade GI perforations were reported in 6 patients (2%) in the crb+pac+bev arm, of which 4 patients (1%) experienced a Grade ≥ 3 GI perforation event comprising colonic fistula , intestinal perforation, small intestine perforation, and large intestine perforation. Given the frequency of GI perforation events observed in GOG-0213 and the assessment of the cases, it is agreed that the current SmPC covers the risk of GI perforation sufficiently and that no changes in the SmPC based on GOG-0213 are warranted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade ≥ 3 AESIs were reported in the overall safety population more frequently in patients in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm (30% patients) than in the Crb+Pac alone arm (8% patients). This difference was mainly due to an increase in the incidence in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm compared to the Crb+Pac alone arm of hypertension (11% patients vs. &lt;1% patients, respectively) and proteinuria (8% patients vs. 0% patients, respectively).

Overall, SAEs was more frequently observed in the bevacizumab arm, mostly related to GI, neutropenia and infections. The applicant provided an overview of Grade 4 SAE which showed that eight patients (2.4%) experienced a total of 11 Grade 4 SAEs in the Crb+Pac arm and 28 patients (8.6%) experienced a total of 31 Grade 4 SAEs in the Crb+Pac+Bev arm. These Grade 4 SAEs were equally distributed between the System Organ Classes (SOCs) in both arms. Unfortunately, the duration of Grade 4 SAEs could not be determined for most of the events as the investigators did not collect these data.

In terms of laboratory findings, there were no major differences, however, with regard to platelets, too few patients had their platelets measured, and thus no conclusions can be drawn.

The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal of study treatment was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev compared to the chemotherapy only arm (25.2% versus 11.1%, respectively); this was mainly due to proteinuria.

Eighty-seven of 325 patients (27%)  discontinued bevacizumab during the initial chemotherapy combination treatment phase with a median of 4 cycles of treatment. Additionally, 227 patients (70%) stopped bevacizumab during the maintenance phase with a median of 20 cycles.

There were no relevant imbalances in deaths related to treatment between the two study arms.

Overall,  based  on  the  difference  of  at  least  10%  in  all-grade  AEs  or  2%  difference  in  Grade  ≥  3  AEs between the bevacizumab arm and the control arm, the following additional ADRs were identified and included  in  the  SmPC  (see  section  4.8):  all  grade  cough,  all  grade  hypomagnesemia,  all  grade hyponatremia and Grade  3- 5 hyponatremia. Furthermore the frequency of  myalgia  and  epistaxis  has been modified from common to very common based on the data from the pivotal study. The frequency of Grade 3-5 wound healing complications was also updated to 1.8% based on the data from study GOG213. In addition, two corrections based on previous data from studies OCEANS and AURELIA were made to section 4.8 regarding the frequency Grade 3 proteinuria (10.9%) and reporting rate of Gastrointestinal perforations in patients with ovarian cancer (2%) and were considered acceptable.

With  regards  to  safety  in  special  population,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  more  non-CNS bleedings and neutropenia in patients &lt; 65 years of age in the bevacizumab arm, comprising 2/3 of the population.  A  review  confirmed  a  high  incidence  of  both  epistaxis  and  neutropenia  including  febrile neutropenia in patients &lt; 65 years. As epistaxis is a known identified risk associated with exposure to bevacizumab and is included in the 'undesirable effects' section of the SmPC, no additional changes are proposed.  Neutropenia  is  already  considered  an  important  identified  risk  associated  with  exposure  to bevacizumab  and  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  activities  for neutropenia  are  included  in the bevacizumab Risk Management Plan (RMP). Therefore, no additional changes are proposed.

The  majority  of  patients  were  below  65,  white,  ECOG  0  or  1.  Very  few  patients  were  ECOG  3.  These characteristics are reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The incidence of AEs, SAEs, Grade 5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment, and AESIs was consistent  with  prior  observations  in  patients  aged  &gt;  65  years-old  being  treated  with  bevacizumab. However, the relatively small sample sizes preclude any very strong conclusions.

Generally, the safety profile of the Crb+Pac+Bev combination was similar in patients who were previously treated  with  bevacizumab  in  first  line  (N=68)  compared  with  patients  who  were  bevacizumab-naïve. Again,  the  number  of  SAE/AESIs  and  treatment  discontinuations  was  higher  in  the  Crb+Pac+Bev  arm compared with the Crb+Pac arm. The number of deaths was balanced.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compared with safety data from the previously assessed Studies BO17707/ICON7 and GOG-0218 that studied  the  combination  bevacizumab  +  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel  in  patients  with  platinum-sensitive ovarian  cancer  in  the  first  line  setting  the  absolute  incidence  of  hypertension  and  proteinuria  in  the bevacizumab-exposed patients in Study GOG-0213 was higher (42% vs. 26% vs. 32% for hypertension; 17% vs. 4% vs. 9% for proteinuria). Still, there were differences in the design, dose, and population of these studies hampering any direct comparisons. Further, these higher incidences of hypertension and proteinuria were consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab.

Generally,  the  safety  profile  of  the  bevacizumab  +  carboplatin  +  paclitaxel  combination  was  similar  in patients  who  were  previously  treated  with  bevacizumab  in  first  line  compared  with  patients  who  were bevacizumab naïve. However, the number of patients in this subgroup is limited (Crb+Pac+Bev n=33, Crb+Pac n=35).

The safety of bevacizumab is well-known and as expected. The overall number of AEs is comparable between the two arms, however, there are more SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the crb+pac+bev arm. AESI for bevacizumab are not unexpected in the active arm. The following additional ADRs were identified based on the submitted data and included in the SmPC (see section 4.8): all grade cough, all grade hypomagnesemia, all grade hyponatremia and Grade 3- 5 hyponatremia.

In conclusion, there are no new major safety concerns. Although more toxicity was observed with the addition of bevacizumab, it is considered to be clinically manageable and adequately addressed by current risk minimisation activities.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

- The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 27.0 could be acceptable if the MAH implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 27.1 with the following content:

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma and its histological and clinical equivalents, primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) and primary peritoneal carcinoma (FTC), continue to be a highly lethal primary gynecologic malignancy and is a leading cause of gynecologic cancer-related mortality among women globally. Worldwide, ovarian cancer affects 225,500 women annually and results in 140,200 cancer-related deaths around the world, with an annual incidence of 65,584 (42,749 deaths) in Europe 1 . As the disease tends to be asymptomatic in the early stages, the majority of women are diagnosed with disseminated advancedstage disease.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Standard of care at initial diagnosis includes cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by platinum and taxane systemic chemotherapy. Despite optimal upfront surgery and the administration of front line chemotherapy approximately 70% of patients will relapse in the first 3 years 2 .

Recurrent disease is classified as either platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive, depending on whether the disease recurs &lt; 6 or ≥ 6 months, respectively, following last cycle of previous platinum therapy; this classification is highly prognostic and is important in determining treatment options. For recurrent platinum-sensitive disease, carboplatin in combination with either paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) are the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens 2 .

Avastin is used, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Efficacy and safety data supporting this application are derived from a multicenter, randomized, openlabel pivotal Phase III Study GOG-0213 in adult women with platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC, PPC, or FTC evaluating whether the addition of bevacizumab to the second-line and maintenance phases of treatment improves the duration of OS relative to second-line paclitaxel (Pac) and carboplatin (Crb) alone in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, ovarian cancer (Objective 1).

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The study met its primary endpoint. The HR was 0.823 (0.680, 0.996), p-value = 0.0447. Median OS improved 5.3 months from 37.3 to 42.6 months, adding almost an additional half year of survival, which is considered of clinical relevance.

The PFS results are clearly in support of the primary endpoint. Median PFS improved from 10.2 to 13.8 months. The results are statistically significant and clinically relevant. The PFS findings are also overall in line with the PFS results in study AVF4095g, where the PFS by INV was 8.4 vs. 12.4 in the crb+gem and crb+gem+bev arm respectively. It is acknowledged that the chemotherapy backbone is different between studies AVF4095g and GOG-0213, but it is nonetheless encouraging to observe that the PFS results in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bevacizumab arms are similar. PFS was primary endpoint in study AVF4095g that led to the extension of the indication to use bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine in patients with platinum-sensitive disease.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

For the stratified efficacy analysis, instead of using treatment-free-interval data based on the randomization system as one of the stratification factors as used by the GOG, the MAH used the platinum -free-interval data based on the eCRF. The stratified OS analysis based on GOG's approach was performed as a sensitivity analysis. In this analysis using the stratification factors based on the registration form (during randomisation), the HR for OS was 0.838 (95% CI [0.693; 1.014]) and the logrank test p-value was 0.0683. In the unstratified analysis, the HR for OS was 0.840 (95% CI [0.695; 1.015]) and the log-rank test p-value was 0.0698. The originally planned primary analysis of OS (GOG analysis) using the stratification factors based on the registration form (during randomization) would have been preferred in the primary analysis and has been reflected in the SmPC.

With regard to patients with prior bevacizumab exposure, it is important to emphasize that only 69 patients were included in this subgroup. There is also no clear benefit of treating patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab in first-line, with bevacizumab at first platinum-sensitive relapse. Even after additional presentation of data from three supportive studies, there was no strong scientific rationale to remove the limitation from the current SmPC.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The safety of bevacizumab is well-known as a consequence of many years of use in the clinical setting. Bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is also indicated for the front-line treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The median duration of exposure of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel was comparable between the two treatment arms. The median number of bevacizumab cycles was 16. The total dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel/docetaxel is also comparable between the two arms.  Overall, it is considered that this allows a reasonable assessment of safety in this patient population.

The overall number of AEs was comparable between the two arms, however, there were more SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the crb+pac+bev arm. There were considerably more cases of non-CNS bleedings, hypertension, proteinuria and thromboembolic events. Neutropenia, wound healing complications and GI perforations were also reported more frequently in the bevacizumab arm. These events are expected and observed in clinical trials with bevacizumab. They are clinically manageable and are reflected in the SmPC, where precautionary measures are also provided.

The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal of study treatment was higher in the Crb+Pac+Bev compared to the chemotherapy only arm. Regarding discontinuation, eighty-seven of 325 patients (27%) discontinued bevacizumab during the initial chemotherapy combination treatment phase with a median of 4 cycles of treatment. Additionally, 227 patients (70%) stopped bevacizumab during the maintenance phase with a median of 20 cycles.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The  majority  of  patients  were  below  65,  white,  ECOG  0  or  1.  Very  few  patients  were  ECOG  3.  These characteristics have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of AEs, SAEs, Grade 5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment, and AESIs was consistent  with  prior  observations  in  patients  aged  &gt;  65  years-old  being  treated  with  bevacizumab. However, the relatively small sample sizes preclude any very strong conclusions.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The observed improvement in median overall survival of almost half year is clinically relevant. These findings are further supported by the PFS results, which are in line with the PFS results observed in study AVF4095g that led to the extension of the indication to use bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. However, the added benefit comes at a cost. There are more SAE, AESI and discontinuations in the bevacizumab arm, but there are no new safety findings, and the safety profile is consistent with previous studies. The discontinuation rate of 25% is not unexpected in this setting and is also in line with previous findings.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The benefit-risk balance is positive for Avastin in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

There were insufficient data to support a positive benefit-risk balance for Avastin in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptortargeted agents. There is no clear benefit of treating patients with prior exposure to bevacizumab in firstline, with bevacizumab at first platinum-sensitive relapse while the risk of AEs remains. Furthermore, strong scientific rationale to support removing the limitation from the current SmPC has not been presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Not applicable.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Avastin is positive in the following indication: in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                         | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include the use of Avastin in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated with efficacy and safety information from study GOG-0213. The Package Leaflet and RMP (v. 27.1) are updated in accordance.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Avastin is not similar to Yondelis and Lynparza within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.
