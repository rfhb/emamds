The safety profile of Intanza/IDflu is well characterised and reflected in the PI. Among the unfavourable effects, severe allergic reactions are the only important identified risk included in the last version of the RMP. Encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Convulsion, Neuritis, Vasculitis and Thrombocytopenia are the important potential risks included in the last RMP. In addition, the MAH should submit a cumulative review of severe cutaneous reactions and infections and infestations in the next PSUR. Overall, the assessment of the benefit/risk balance for Intanza/IDflu remains positive.   |

Larger datasets on safety are available for the second and third trimester, compared with the first trimester; however, data from worldwide use of inactivated influenza vaccines do not indicate any adverse foetal and maternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine.

Among them there were 2 anaphylactic reaction, 2 laryngeal oedema, 1 tongue oedema , 2 laryngeal oedema, and 1 lip swelling and 1 generalized urticaria. The information provided of the cases is considered scarce but a close temporal relationship with the vaccine administration was reported in all cases. Therefore, 'allergic reactions' have been included in the tabulated summary of                                                               |

The SmPC of Intanza 15 µg has been updated to add the immunogenicity data generated from study FID01C in section 5.1.
