1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Pursuant to Article 14-a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the CHMP recommends by consensus the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Ervebo. Consequently, section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to delete the reference to 'Conditional Approval' scheme and Annex II E has been updated to delete Specification Obligations to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Due to extensive commercial confidential information enclosed in the Assessment Report for quality variations, this is not available to public access. |

With this submission, REC 20 is fulfilled.       | 14/01/2021   | 31/01/2022 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Protocol 018 was a Phase 3 open-label trial conducted in Guinea to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of age and older that was implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 ring vaccination study for Protocol 010. In this trial, a total of 2,115 subjects were enrolled and 2,016 subjects were vaccinated with Ervebo. An immunogenicity sub-study included 1,217 subjects who were vaccinated and provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity. Immunogenicity data were obtained in Protocol 009 in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| C.I.4: To update section 5.1 of the SmPC based on the result of the final study reports on the Correlate of Protection. With this submission, REC 16 is fulfilled. C.I.4: To update section 5.1 of the SmPC, based on results from the integrated summary of immunogenicity (ISI). With this submission, RECs 15 and 22 are fulfilled. C.I.13: Submission of Non-Human Primates (NHP) Correlate of Protection analysis report (non-clinical report). Analysis is based upon previous submitted NHP studies which are already part of the dossier. The MAH takes the opportunity to implement changes in the Package Leaflet following the assessment of the User Acceptance Test, procedure EMEA/H/C/004554/REC/011. With the implementation of these changes to the PL, the MAH fulfils REC011. In addition, minor editorial changes have been included in the SmPC and patient leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to   | Liberia, Protocol 011 in Sierra Leone, Protocol 012 in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and Protocol 018 in Guinea. Gamma irradiation of specimens (from regions involved in Ebola outbreaks) was performed to reduce risk of wild-type Ebola virus infection of laboratory workers, but increased pre-vaccination GP-ELISA immune responses by approximately 20% and decreased post-vaccination GP- ELISA and PRNT immune responses by approximately 20%. Gamma irradiation, baseline seropositivity and other factors result in a higher immune response in Protocol 012. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.   |

The CHMP considered that process validation data were provided demonstrating that the active substance process is properly validated. Comparability data confirmed that the commercial product manufactured at the Burgwedel site is representative of the material used in the clinical trials. Additional qualification data were provided for a critical reagent used in the identity test ensuring proper quality control of the active substance and the finished product. An in-process control for total protein with appropriate acceptance was introduced for the active substance, ensuring proper quality control of the active substance.
