## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/345/2010 for the following condition:

-  Treatment of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum
-  Treatment of oropharyngeal, laryngeal or nasal epithelial carcinoma (excluding nasopharyngeal carcinoma or lymphoepithelioma)

on the granting of a class waiver.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Cetuximab  is  a  chimeric  monoclonal  Immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  antibody  directed  against  the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion/metastasis. Cetuximab  binds  to  the  EGFR  with  an  affinity  higher  than  that  of  endogenous  ligands.  Cetuximab blocks binding of endogenous EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition of the function of the receptor and induces the internalization of EGFR, which can lead to down-regulation of the receptor. Cetuximab also targets  cytotoxic  immune  effector  cells  towards EGFR-expressing  tumour  cells  (antibody  dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).

Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  EGFR-expressing,  KRAS  (Kirsten  rat  sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer:

 in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy or FOLFOX4

 as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy, and who are intolerant to irinotecan.

Erbitux is also indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck:

 in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease

 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease.

In all indications, Erbitux is administered once a week as intravenous infusion at a maximum rate of 10 mg/min. The initial dose is 400 mg/m 2 , and all subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg/m 2 .

With this variation application the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted high level results of the Nordic VII study, which was an independent study not sponsored by the MAH, as well as responses to additional questions in order to fulfil the Annex II condition adopted by the CHMP in conclusion to the  EMEA/H/C/000558/II/0042  (II/42)  variation.  With  variation  II/42,  the  mCRC  indication  'in combination  with  chemotherapy'  had  been  restricted  to  the  'combination  with  irinotecan-based chemotherapy or FOLFOX4' based on all relevant available data at the time and the CHMP proposed to revisit this indication upon availability of the results of the Nordic VII study.

In  accordance with the conclusion of the variation II/42, conditions were imposed as set out in the Annex II of the marketing authorisation and which were as follows:

-  As  data  for  the  Nordic  VII  study,  which  also  employed  a  combination  of  cetuximab  with  an oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine regimen, were not available at the time of the assessment, the Marketing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  committed  to  submit  a  new  variation  application  with  the  intention  to include data from the Nordic VII study in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

-  In  3  out  of  4  studies  with  oxaliplatin-containing  chemotherapy  background  regimens,  no  add  on activity of cetuximab was seen in KRAS wild type tumours, the only positive study being a randomised phase II trial. The MAH should justify why the add-on option to FOLFOX4 should be retained in the SmPC.

-Taking  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  from  MAH  sponsored  and  investigator  initiated  studies  into account, are there reasons to believe that:

-  there might be a negative dynamic interaction between oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) and cetuximab in case of KRAS mutation positive tumours, something not seen for irinotecan?
-  the  apparent  relationship  between  percentage  of  EGFR  positive  tumour  cells  and  negative outcome in KRAS mutation positive tumours has a biological foundation?

Based on the data collected in fulfilment of these above conditions, the MAH proposed through this variation  to  extend  the  mCRC  indication  in  combination  with  FOLFOX4  to  the  combination  with continuous infusional 5-fluoruracil/folinic acid plus oxaliplatin.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## Cetuximab/oxaliplatin interaction and mechanism of adverse outcome in patients with mutant KRAS tumours

In response to the questions whether:

- there might be a negative dynamic interaction between oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) and cetuximab in case of KRAS mutation positive tumours, something not seen for irinotecan

- the apparent relationship between percentage of EGFR positive tumour cells and negative outcome in KRAS mutation positive tumours has a biological foundation the MAH summarised data from non-clinical in  vitro and in  vivo studies  (data  not  shown)  discussed below. No experiments have been conducted in fresh tumour samples from patients with CRC with wild type or mutated KRAS.

## 2.2.1. Discussion

The MAH argued that the majority of nonclinical data rather provide evidence for a positive or neutral interaction of cetuximab and oxaliplatin in in vitro and in vivo models from CRC and other indications, similarly  as  it  is  reported  for  combination  of  cetuximab  with  other  chemotherapies  such  as  other platinum derivates or topoisomerase I inhibitors. Two major molecular mechanisms contribute to the positive interaction of cetuximab and oxaliplatin:

1. Inhibition of oxaliplatin-induced activation of EGFR-mediated survival pathways by cetuximab.

2. Inhibition of EGFR-mediated DNA damage repair by cetuximab.

Both mechanisms were demonstrated in nonclinical models and were shown to be associated with the efficacy of the combination of cetuximab and oxaliplatin as well as other chemotherapies.

One in vitro study reported a negative interaction between cetuximab and oxaliplatin. It is difficult to put the data of this study into the overall context since:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. the antagonistic activity was observed in cell lines in which other nonclinical studies saw a positive combination effect and

2.  the  antagonistic  effect  was  obtained  in  KRAS  wild-type  cells,  but  not  in  KRAS  mutated  cell  lines which is in contradiction to the situation observed in the clinical setting.

Nevertheless,  the  study  provided  a  potential  mechanistic  rationale  that  might  be  of  relevance  to explain  the  observed  antagonistic  effect  of  the  combination  of  cetuximab  and  oxaliplatin  in  patients with KRAS mutated tumours: In order to exert its cytotoxic effect, oxaliplatin relied on EGFR-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via Nox1, a mechanism that was blocked by cetuximab in those cells, so that addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin produced an antagonistic activity.

The reason for the opposite role of the KRAS mutation status in this study is not known. However, the antagonistic  effect  occurred  in  two  cell  lines  (HT-29-D4  and  Caco-2)  expressing  EGFR  on  the  cell surface  whereas  no  combination  effect  was  observed  in  two  cell  lines  (SW480  and  SW620)  lacking EGFR expression  on  the  cell  surface.  This  is  in  line  with  the  clinical  data  which  suggested  that  the potential antagonistic effect in KRAS mutated tumours is absent or less pronounced in tumours with no or very low EGFR expression.

Cell  line  data  are  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that  certain  cell  lines  are  sensitive  to  cetuximab alone. E.g., the mechanistic  interaction  between  cetuximab  and  oxaliplatin  is  currently  being investigated  in  the  parental  CRC  cell  line  SW48  (KRAS  wt)  and  seven  isogenic  SW48  cell  lines harbouring  the  most  commonly  occurring  KRAS  mutations  in  CRC.  The  parental,  KRAS  wt  cell  line SW48 has low to medium EGFR expression levels, but is very sensitive to EGFR inhibition by cetuximab already in in vitro growth assays. Interestingly, introducing KRAS mutations rendered the isogenic cell lines  more  resistant  to  cetuximab  treatment.  The  degree  of  resistance  varied  among  the  different isogenic cell lines with KRAS mutations, but they all displayed higher IC50 values and/or less maximal inhibition in the in vitro growth assay compared to the parental, KRAS wt cells.

The cell lines showed variable sensitivity to growth inhibition to oxaliplatin, however within the same order  of  magnitude.  No  apparent  difference  was  visible  between  KRAS  wt  and  KRAS  mt  cells.  The addition  of  cetuximab  to  oxaliplatin  resulted  in  stronger  growth  inhibition  than  oxaliplatin  alone  for SW48 KRAS wt cells. Similar, but weaker effects were observed for SW48 cells harboring the KRAS mutations  with  the  exception  of  one  cell  line,  which  reacted  antagonistically  when  cetuximab  was added to oxaliplatin concentrations particularly at or below the IC50 of oxaliplatin.

In conclusion, the MAH considered that most nonclinical studies point to a rather positive (or at least neutral) interaction  of  cetuximab  and  oxaliplatin including  mechanistic  rationales,  similarly  as  it  was described  for  combinations  of  cetuximab  with  other  chemotherapies,  such  as  topoisomerase  I inhibitors.  Until  now,  only  limited  nonclinical  evidence  exists  for  an  antagonistic  interaction  that appears  to  occur  in  the  clinical  setting  under  certain  circumstances  such  as  mutated  KRAS  CRC tumours  with  higher  EGFR  expression  levels.  However,  first  hypotheses  have  been  generated  how EGFR signalling might not only protect against the cytotoxic action of chemotherapy, but could also be required for the activity of chemotherapy, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for a potential negative interaction of cetuximab and oxaliplatin.

So far  the  nonclinical  data  do  not  allow  a  robust  judgement  of  the  influence  of  the  KRAS  mutation status  and  EGFR  expression  levels  on  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  of  cetuximab  and  oxaliplatin. More dedicated studies are needed to identify the main central factors and mechanisms that influence the interaction of the two compounds.

The CHMP considered that robust data on the possible association between EGFR expression level and interaction with oxaliplatin are not available. Further mechanistic studies are underway and might, if explants studies are undertaken, even shed some light on the clinical observation that there seems to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be a negative interaction between oxaliplation containing regimens and cetuximab in KRAS mt CRC. Moreover, it is of obvious interest to investigate the reasons behind the negative effect of cetuximab on the activity of oxaliplatin in the isogeneic SW40 cell line carrying a specific KRAS mutation and to also see results of the above-mentioned cell line experiments (in SW40 cellls with wt KRAS or isogeneic clones carrying KRAS mutations) with irinotecan, too.

In  conclusion,  in  the  cell  lines  tested,  KRAS  status  was  non-informative  for  the  interaction  between oxaliplatin and cetuximab. The mechanistic background to the observed clinical phenomenon remains unexplained.

## 2.3. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## Nordic VII

The Nordic VII study was an investigator-sponsored trial sponsored by the Nordic Colorectal Cancer Biomodulation  Group  (NCCBG).  The  NCCBG  owns  the  data  collected  in  the  Nordic  VII  study  and  is responsible for statistical analysis, reporting, and publication.

## 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

NORDIC VII was performed in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from May 2005 until May  2009.  Important  inclusion  criteria  were  age  &gt;  18  and  &lt;  75  years,  World  Health  Organization (WHO) performance status 0-2, no prior chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease, no previous oxaliplatin, and no current indications for resection with curative intent.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned, independently of KRAS status, in a ratio of 1:1:1 to one of 3 intravenous (IV) treatment regimens, administered in cycles of 2 weeks, with stratification by study centre:

Arm A: (Nordic) FLOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² over 1 h (30 to 90 min), 5-FU 500 mg/m² as a bolus infusion (&lt; 5 min), followed 30 min later by bolus FA 60 mg/m² (&lt; 10 min) on days 1 and 2)

Arm B: Cetuximab plus FLOX (Cetuximab was given as an initial infusion of 400 mg/m² followed by weekly infusions of 250 mg/m²)

## Arm C: Cetuximab and intermittent FLOX

The  primary  endpoint  was  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  (RECIST)  assessed  every  8  weeks, calculated from randomisation to first recorded progression or death. Patients who had not progressed or  died  by  a  pre-specified  cut-off  date  (approximately  12  months  after  last  enrolled  patient)  were treated as censored. The main comparison was between arm B and A. As PFS is not considered an appropriate endpoint with regard to the stop and go principle (arm C), comparisons including arm C are primarily of interest for the secondary endpoint overall survival (OS).

## 2.3.2. Results

In terms of biomarkers of interest, the following numbers were reported at baseline:

- KRAS: evaluable 88% (498/566), wild type 61% (303/498), mutant 39% (195/498)
- KRAS wild type: arm A 63% (97/155), arm B 57% (97/169), arm C 63% (109/174)
- BRAF: Evaluable 81% (457/566), mutant: 12% (55/457)
- BRAF mutant in KRAS wild type: arm A 21%, arm B 22% and arm C 17%.

In terms of exposure and in the ITT population, the dose intensities and number of cycles for 5-FU and oxaliplatin were similar in arms A and B. However, relative dose intensities compared to the expected intensity without dose adjustments were not reported.

## 2.3.3. Discussion

The description of the results for the Nordic VII study was based on the study protocol, a draft study report prepared by an involved contract research organization and records from a poster published at the ASCO GI 2011 conference.

With  regard  to  study  treatments,  5-FU  was  administered  in  Nordic  VII  as  a  bolus  infusion  (FLOX regimen)  while  the  FOLFOX  regimens  utilise  continuous  infusion.  The  Nordic  FLOX  regimen  is  used almost exclusively within the Nordic area.

On  the  biomarker  data,  mutated  BRAF  appears  to  be  a  prognostic  factor  of  poor  outcome  in  CRC; whether it is also predictive of poor cetuximab activity is disputed.

With regard to ORR data (Table 1), the MAH stated that 95% CI and p-values were not available. The seemingly higher ORR in arm B than in arm A in the mutant KRAS groups prompted the assessor to calculate the 95% CI for the difference between arms A and B: this was (-8%, +26%), B performing 'better' than A. Even though the difference is not statistically significant, note that the ORRs in the wild type  KRAS  groups  are  rather  similar  in  arms  A  and  B.  Thus  the  results  must  be  regarded  as unexpected in that they are showing a tendency for benefit from cetuximab in the mutant KRAS group and no difference in the wild type KRAS group.

In terms of PFS (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 1), the comparison of primary interest is between arms A and B. In KRAS wild type, results are similar, while in the KRAS mutant groups, arm B tends to be better than A (HR 0.7, p=0.07), again clearly unexpected.

OS results (Tables 2 and 3) indicate similarity.

Overall, available results were considered by the MAH as incomplete as, among other information, the following were missing: results for the KRAS-evaluable and non-evaluable populations, relative dose densities, safety analyses by KRAS status, and second-line treatment. Based on this, reported results were considered to be preliminary. Therefore, a meaningful and complete assessment of the outcome of the Nordic VII study is not yet possible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP considered that NORDIC VII is the only study where cetuximab as add-on to chemotherapy in  CRC  appears  to  be  associated  with  add-on  activity  in  patients  with  KRAS  mutant  disease,  albeit statistically  formally  not  significant  (p=0.07  for  PFS).  Actually,  as  add-on  to  FOLFOX  a  negative interaction between FOLFOX and cetuximab has been seen in this population (in contrast to irinotecan based regimens). No mechanistic explanation has been identified as discussed previously.  In contrast, no  discernable  add-on  activity  is  seen  in  the  target  population,  i.e.  patients  with  wild  type  KRAS tumours.

Absence of add-on activity in the target population could be related to the background chemotherapy regimen, i.e. 5-FU as bolus instead of infusional as in FOLFOX, but why that should be the case is not obvious. Alternative explanations include differences in study populations, less rigorous assessment of events  of  progression,  censoring  rules  etc.,  i.e.  factors  reducing  'assay  sensitivity'  (as  in  the  COIN study). However, the dose intensity of the FLOX regimen seems similar in arms A and B.

Apparent add-on activity in mutant KRAS tumours could be a spurious finding related to imbalances in hidden  and  important  prognostic  factors  (but  not  predictive  of  cetuximab  activity)  as  all  available clinical data indicate that cetuximab (and panitumumab) are devoid of activity in this population.  As the study was not stratified by KRAS status for obvious reasons, such imbalances could affect results in both  wild  type  and  mutant  KRAS  subgroups  and  could  produce  the  reported  results  seemingly contradicting all available prior data independently of and without any consequence for the predictive value of KRAS mutation status.

The results,  as  reported  by  the  MAH,  were  reviewed  in  detail  and  no  convincing  explanation  to  the rather  surprising  results  of  an  apparent  add-on  benefit  of  cetuximab  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS tumours  has  been  identified.  Whether  the  full  study  report,  e.g.  with  respect  to  dose  intensity, discontinuations,  distribution  of  PFS  events,  sensitivity  analyses,  etc.  will  provide  further  clarity  is considered  rather  unlikely.  However,  the  MAH  should  still  provide  the  final  clinical  study  report  of Nordic VII, when available although provision of this report is no longer considered key to the benefitrisk balance of cetuximab in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal  cancer. This  is  because  the  report  is  unlikely  to  pinpoint  the  reason(s)  for  the unexpected  results,  while  the  study  also  used  an  oxaliplatin-based  regimen  with  bolus  5-FU administration, which is outside the final indication in combination with FOLFOX in which a continuous 5-FU infusion is being employed.

## Cetuximab add-on activity to oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy

As mentioned earlier, in three out of four studies with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy background regimens, no add on activity of cetuximab is seen in KRAS wild type tumours, the only positive study being a randomised phase II trial (OPUS). The MAH was asked to justify why the add-on option to FOLFOX4 should be retained in the SmPC.

## 2.3.4. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The  MAH  provided  a  tabulated  overview  of  studies  employing  cetuximab  in  combination  with oxaliplatin-containing  regimens.  This  included  the  four  studies  mentioned  before  (OPUS,  CAIRO2, COIN, Nordic VII).

## 2.3.5. Results

Results  from  the  tabulated  studies  were  reported  by  the  MAH.  The  most  pertinent  results  for  the discussion are presented below.

The first line studies 'OPUS' and 'COIN' have been discussed in detail before. For COIN, the MAH has focused on the modified De Gramont regimen (OxMdG), i.e. the arm with infusional 5-FU and presents pooled  results  of  OPUS  and  COIN  and  then  compares  the  results  with  'CRYSTAL'  i.e.  the  first-line FOLFIRI +/- cetuximab study.

Moreover, the MAH has tabulated the results of single arm studies where cetuximab was used as addon to infusional 5-FU and oxaliplatin. The table also contains the controlled CECOG CORE 1.2.002 study which did not employ any treatment arm without cetuximab, as well as the controlled FUTURE study, in which  the  control  (no-cetuximab)  arm  received  an  non-infusional  fluoropyrimidine  regimen;  hence,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these  two  studies  were  considered  as  single-arm  for  the  purposes  of  this  table.  As  reference,  EMR 62 202-047 (OPUS) was also included in the table.

## 2.3.6. Discussion

The  MAH  claimed  that  studies  investigating  cetuximab  in  combination  with  continuous  infusional  5FU/FA plus oxaliplatin show that this is an effective therapy with consistent results across studies and efficacy endpoints. The results overall compare well with those obtained in the pivotal EMR 62 202-013 (CRYSTAL) study investigating cetuximab in combination with FOLFIRI.

Overall the combinations of cetuximab with continuous infusional 5-FU/FA and oxaliplatin or irinotecan show  acceptable  and  manageable  toxicity  in  the  treatment  of first-line  metastatic  CRC.  The corresponding safety profile is adequately reflected in the current product information for cetuximab.

The CHMP commented that there are numerous ways to administer 5-FU, folinic acid and oxaliplatin; infusional  5-FU  such  as  in  FOLFOX4,  FOLFOX6 and OxMdG, but also as bolus 5-FU as in the Nordic FLOX regimen. While these regimens may show differences in terms of benefit/risk, there are no good reasons to assume that the add-on activity of cetuximab should differ if the chemotherapy regimens and the combinations with cetuximab are reasonably well tolerated.

The current indication for cetuximab is restricted to add-on to FOLFOX4. Submitted data supporting an extension of the indication to 'continuous infusional 5-FU' regimens are weak; only add-on to OxMdG (similar  to  FOLFOX  regimens)  provides  some  insight  as  regards  benefit/risk.  Add-on  efficacy  of cetuximab with all FOLFOX regimens is nevertheless highly likely.

Finally, the MAH was invited to provide data on a possible relationship between rash development in the  course  of  cetuximab  treatment  and  cetuximab  efficacy  and  to  comment  whether  treatment continuation should be re-assessed in the absence of rash development within the first 4-8 weeks of treatment. The MAH provided data from two clinical studies (CRYSTAL and EVEREST, data not shown) which were inconclusive, so that at this stage it is agreed that it cannot be concluded that absence of early rash in patients with CRC warrants reconsideration of cetuximab therapy. A follow-on study to EVEREST (EVEREST-II) is currently ongoing. This study is conducted first-line and as cetuximab add-on to  FOLFIRI  with  dose  escalation  vs.  standard  dose  in  patients  with  vs.  without  rash  at  week  3, respectively.

## 2.4. Clinical Safety aspects

## Nordic VII

## 2.4.1. Results

With  respect  to  safety,  grade  3/4  febrile  neutropenia  was  common  in  both  arms  A  and  B  (9.4  vs. 12.9%), grade 3 fatigue was higher in arm B compared to arm A (16 vs. 10%) and so was grade 3 diarrhoea (17 vs. 10%).

## 2.4.2. Discussion

With  regard  to  skin  reactions,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  consider  whether  other  measures  should  be recommended in addition to interruption of cetuximab treatment, such as use of mild steroids, sun screen,  antibiotics  etc,  and  whether  such  measures  could  also  be  of  potential  benefit  used  preemptively.

The MAH summarised published trial data on the use of antibiotics (data not shown) which, with the exception of one standard tetracycline trial, all indicated that the skin-related Quality of Life was better in those patients receiving antibiotics regardless of the assessment tool used.

One study is ongoing to evaluate in a randomised double-blinded trial setting the use  of Vitamin K versus placebo in the prophylactic treatment of skin rash induced by cetuximab. The MAH argued that data  from  the  ongoing  trials  should  be  awaited  to  decide  on  the  value  of  topical  Vitamin  K  for  the treatment of skin rash.

With regard to sunscreen, the MAH submitted a published study (data not shown) which failed to show any benefit from pre-emptive or symptomatic treatment of EGFR inhibitor-induced rash.

Based on randomised data, the recommended preventive therapy for the development of rash would be the topical application of 1% hydrocortisone cream with moisturizer and sunscreen twice daily and systemic monocycline or doxycycline. Reactive use of medium to high-potency topical steroids is also recommended based on pathophysiological considerations, while tetracyclines are a therapeutic option in the treatment of patients who already experienced skin rash, as well.

## 2.5. Changes to the Product Information

Based on all data from the combination of cetuximab with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, the MAH  proposed  that  cetuximab  should  be  indicated  for  metastatic  CRC  in  combination  with continuous infusional 5-FU/FA plus oxaliplatin.

During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  final  amendment  of  the  mCRC  indication  in combination  with  oxaliplatin  chemotherapy  appears  warranted  as  discussed  in  detail  above.  More specifically, the indication should be extended from FOLFOX4 to all FOLFOX regimens but restricted to the  first  line  therapy  in  agreement  with  clinical  trials  conducted.  Moreover,  the  requirement  for demonstration  of  wild  type  KRAS  tumour  status  before  starting  cetuximab  treatment  should  be strengthened and a contraindication against use of cetuximab with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy  for  patients  with  mutant KRAS mCRC  or  for  whom KRAS mCRC  status  is  unknown should  be  added.  Finally,  information  regarding  prevention  and  treatment  of  skin  rash  should  be provided.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Benefit - risk remains favourable for the use of cetuximab in accordance with the approved and now modified indication.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation(s) accepted   | Variation(s) accepted                                                                                              | Type   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a                 | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Modification of the metastatic colorectal cancer indication in combination with FOLFOX4 to an extended combination with FOLFOX but restricted to first line treatment only based on data from the Nordic VII study and additional data on the potential negative dynamic interaction between oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) and cetuximab in case of KRAS mutation positive tumours and on the potential biological foundation of the apparent relationship between percentage of EGFR positive tumour cells and negative outcome in patients with KRAS mutation positive tumours. Both sets of data are fulfilling an Annex II condition. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC are amended with the modified mCRC indication, strengthening of the wording on the requirement for KRAS testing prior to treatment initiation, adoption of a new contraindication against use of cetuximab in combination with oxaliplatincontaining chemotherapy in patients with mutant KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) or for whom KRAS mCRC status is unknown, introduction of prophylaxis treatment recommendations for skin reactions and inclusion of statements regarding paediatric use.

The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. In addition minor editorial amendments are included in the SmPC and PL. Moreover, the condition imposed on the marketing authorisation is considered fulfilled. Therefore, the obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures is deleted from the Annex II.
