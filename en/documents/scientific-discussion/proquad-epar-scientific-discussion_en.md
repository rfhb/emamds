## 1. Introduction

ProQuad  is  a  quadrivalent  vaccine  containing  the  components  of  measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine (more attenuated vaccine strain of measles virus (derived from Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain), the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus, the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus) and of VARIVAX (Oka/Merck strain of varicella virus). ProQuad is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in individuals from 12 months of age.

Measles (rubeola) is caused by a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus and is transmitted from person  to  person  via  aerosolized  or  large  respiratory  infectious  droplets.  The  clinical  presentation consists  of  prodromal  fever,  conjunctivitis,  coryza,  and  cough.  In  some  cases,  Koplik  spots  (an erythema with white spots in the buccal mucosa) can be observed. Subsequently, a maculopapular rash usually appears, spreads from the head to the entire body, and fades within 4 to 7 days. Measles can result in otitis media, pneumonia, encephalitis and death.

Mumps is caused by a paramyxovirus of the genus Rubulavirus and is spread by direct contact via the respiratory route. The clinical presentation is characterized by swelling of one or more salivary glands (usually the parotid glands) and may be preceded by several days of non-specific symptoms, including fever,  lymphadenopathy, headache, malaise, myalgias, and anorexia. Mumps can result in deafness, orchitis, pancreatitis, meningitis, encephalitis and death.

Rubella is caused by a togavirus of the genus Rubivirus and is spread via infectious droplets shed from the  respiratory  secretions  of  infected  persons  to  susceptible  individuals.  The  clinical  presentation  is characterized  by  nonspecific  signs  and  symptoms  including  transient  erythematous  and  sometimes pruritic rash, postauricular or suboccipital lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever. The most important consequences  of  rubella  are  the  miscarriages,  stillbirths,  fetal  anomalies,  and  therapeutic  abortions, associated with Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) that result when rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy. Anomalies associated with CRS include sensorineural deafness, cataracts, glaucoma, and  other  ophthalmic  disorders,  cardiac  defects,  microcephaly,  meningoencephalitis  and  mental retardation.

Varicella  is  caused  by  varicella-zoster  virus  (VZV),  a  herpes  virus.  The  clinical  presentation  of varicella  is  characterized  by  fever,  malaise,  and  a  generalized  rash.  The  rash is  usually  pruritic  and consists of 300 to 500 maculopapular lesions that progress to vesicles, and crusts over the course of several days. The skin lesions are generally concentrated on the face, head, and trunk. Varicella may be associated with serious and life-threatening complications including bacterial superinfection of skin lesions with S taphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, viral  or  bacterial  pneumonia, septic shock, secondary bacterial arthritis, fasciitis, cerebella ataxia and encephalitis.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

The finished product is presented as a powder and solvent for suspension for subcutaneous injection in a single 0.5 ml dose. The lyophilised vaccine must be stored frozen at -15ºC or colder. The lyophilised powder is presented in a vial (Type 1 glass) with a butyl rubber stopper and flip-off aluminium seal. The finished product contains the following excipients: sucrose, hydrolysed gelatin (porcine), sodium chloride, sorbitol, monosodium  glutamate, sodium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium phosphate,  potassium  chloride,  Medium  199  with  Hanks'  Salts,  Minimum  Essential  Medium  Eagle (MEM), neomycin, phenol red, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (pH adjustment).

Before use, each vial is to be reconstituted with 0.7 ml water for injections supplied in either a vial (Type 1 glass) with a butyl rubber stopper or in a prefilled syringe (Type 1 glass) with plunger stopper and tip cap (chlorobutyl rubber).

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lyophilised vaccine must be stored frozen at -15ºC or colder, whereas the diluent should be stored refrigerated or at room temperature. Therefore, the product is shipped using a styrofoam box allowing packing the frozen component and the non-frozen component together. This polystyrene container is composed of two compartments. The frozen component is placed in the lower compartment where dry ice is used as the refrigerant. The non-frozen component is placed in the receptacle compartment in the lid, so it is not exposed to the freezing conditions of the dry ice.

## After reconstitution, one dose (0.5 ml) contains:

| Measles virus 1 Enders' Edmonston strain (live, attenuated) ................. not less than 3.00 log 10 TCID 50     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mumps virus 1 Jeryl Lynn™ (Level B) strain (live, attenuated) ............ not less than 4.30 log 10 TCID 50        |
| Rubella virus 2 Wistar RA 27/3 strain (live, attenuated) ........................ not less than 3.00 log 10 TCID 50 |
| Varicella virus 3 Oka/Merck strain (live, attenuated) ............................. not less than 3.99 log 10 PFU** |

The product also contains human serum albumin, used in the manufacturing process of the vaccine.

## Active substance - measles

- Manufacture

## Seed lot system

The  Enders'  Edmonston  strain  of  measles  virus  was  isolated  in  primary  human  kidney  cell  tissue culture from the blood of a child (Edmonston) in the early acute phase of measles. The virus (10 ml) was received by Merck from Dr. John Enders at the Children's Hospital of Harvard Medical School in 1960. Further passages were performed at Merck to develop the Moraten (more attenuated Enders) strain that served as a pre-master seed  from which Master Seed was derived. The preparation of the Master Seed and the Stock Seed is appropriately described in the dossier.

## Chicken embryo cells (CEC) as cell substrate

To prepare the cell substrate for virus propagation, eggs, sourced from a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken flock, are incubated and prepared.

## Manufacture of measles harvested virus fluids (HVFs)

A virus propagator, a stainless steel tank, is planted with CEC suspension. The cells are infected with an  appropriate  volume  of  thawed  measles  stock  seed,  added  to  the  seeding  medium,  stirred  and incubated. The cell sheets are rinsed and refed several times and virus propagators are harvested. HVF is sampled for virus potency and sterility.

## Manufacture of redispensed bulk

Harvests from one or more batches of HVF may be used to produce a single batch of measles vaccine bulk. The final bulk is dispensed in cans (dispensed bulk) and stored frozen. The dispensed bulk cans comprise a batch of drug substance. The dispensed bulk is thawed and used for filling or redispensed into aliquots appropriate for filling ( redispensed bulk ). Samples for QC are drawn from the appropriate different bulk stages.

*

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Control cell Cultures and Harvest Control Fluids (HCFs)

Uninfected  harvested  control  fluids  (HCF)  are  produced  using  the  same  cell  substrate  and  culture media. Before the final collection of the HCF, control cell monolayers are examined microscopically throughout the harvest period.

## Controls of materials and critical steps / process validation

The CEC substrate used in the manufacture of measles vaccine bulk is tested according to Ph. Eur. requirements.

Testing of the measles stock seed is consistent with the Ph. Eur., Section 2.6.16 and the monograph for Measles Vaccine (Live), with the exception of the virus identification test. Identity testing is instead performed post-clarification on the vaccine bulk, where antibody neutralization can be performed on a clarified bulk virus solution.

Critical process parameters (CPPs), critical quality attributes (CQAs), and their specifications/acceptance  criteria  are  based  on  historical  process  capability,  current  manufacturing specifications, and the specifications defined in the company's monovalent measles vaccine license.

Process validation was both retrospective and prospective. Retrospective validation of measles vaccine was first used to determine acceptable ranges; a prospective validation of measles vaccine was then performed  to  demonstrate  conformity  of  the  processes  to  validation  specifications.  Within  each manufacturing  process  step,  goals,  CPPs  and  CQAs  were  determined,  along  with  appropriate specifications and acceptance criteria.

## · Characterisation and specifications

The  complete  nucleotide  sequences  for  the  Stock  Seeds  and  a  monovalent  measles  filled  container vaccine lot have been determined. Nucleotide sequence alignment showed complete agreement.

Process-related  impurities  arising  from  the  measles  vaccine  bulk  manufacturing  processes  are classified as cell substrate or cell culture derived.

Cell substrate derived impurities may include proteins derived from the host organism, such as CECs used  as  substrate  for  measles  vaccine  bulk  production.  Cell  culture-derived  impurities  may  include antibiotics (e.g., neomycin), serum, or other media components. Also low levels of particle-associated reverse transcriptase activity are found; however, no signal of infectious retrovirus could be detected.

Since the measles process uses cell growth medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), measures have  been  taken  to  minimize  the  concentration  of  bovine  serum  proteins  in  the  vaccine  bulk.  The concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used as a surrogate marker for other bovine serum proteins.  Each  measles  final  bulk  is  tested  for  BSA.  Measles  vaccine  bulk  is  an  unpurified  product whose potency was measured through a biological assay for the active substance rather than through evaluation of integrity of physical form. Degradation products are neither identified nor quantified.

Tests  are  performed  at  specified  stages  of  vaccine  bulk  processing  in  order  to  confirm  absence  of extraneous  agents,  to  verify  potency  and  identity,  and  to  provide  a  measure  of  quality  and  process consistency. Most assays performed on measles bulks are qualitative methods for which there are only two  outcomes  (growth  or  no  growth,  absence  or  presence,  etc.).  In  many  of  these  cases,  the  assay specifications are compendial.

The parameters that were evaluated as part of the method validation for the assays have been provided for each analytical procedure. When applicable, the assay parameters addressed were specificity, interassay precision, limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity, range, ruggedness, and robustness.

Batch analysis results have been provided for HVF/HCF lots and dispensed bulk lots; all results met specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  reference  standard  used  in  potency  testing  is  a  monovalent  measles  vaccine  lot  manufactured using currently approved processes. The applicant committed to characterize the performance of the measles potency assay with international reference standards.

## · Stability

The stability studies were initiated using three lots of vaccine bulk. The current storage time of these lots was documented as the initial testing time point. Satisfactory stability results for these three lots of measles final bulk are available.

Stability  results,  combined  with  the  production  history  of  measles  final  bulk,  were  evaluated  to determine the maximum hold time used for vaccine bulk prior to processing into the filled container. The resultant filled containers passed release specifications for potency. Formal stability studies are ongoing to justify the proposed hold time and results will be provided on an annual basis.

## Active substance - mumps

## · Manufacture

## Seed lot system

The Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus was isolated from a throat washing specimen collected in 1963 from a clinical  case  of  mumps  (Jeryl  Lynn)  by  Dr.  M.  R.  Hilleman,  Merck Research  Laboratories, Merck  &amp;  Co.,  Inc.  Virus  strain  isolation  was  performed  at  the  Merck  West  Point,  Pennsylvania facility. The preparation of the master seed and the stock seed is described in detail in the dossier.

## Manufacture of mumps harvested virus fluids (HVFs) and redispensed bulk

CEC are planted in analogy to the process described for measles. Post-infection, the virus propagators are refed and the spent medium is drained and discarded; the virus harvest is collected. The HVFs are sampled for virus potency and sterility and shell frozen.

The redispensed bulk is manufactured in analogy to the process described for measles.

## Control cell Cultures and Harvest Control Fluids (HCFs)

The HCFs are manufactured in analogy to the process described for measles.

## Controls of materials and critical steps / process validation

The seed testing is consistent with the Ph. Eur., Section 2.6.16 and monograph for Mumps Vaccine (Live), with the exception of the virus identification test. Identity testing is instead performed postclarification on the vaccine bulk, where antibody neutralization can be performed on a clarified bulk virus solution.

Definition of CPPs and process validation were performed in a similar manner as for measles.

## · Characterisation and specifications

To assess the population diversity of the stock seed and bulk product, the JL-strain specific nucleotide sequences were determined and results provided in the dossier.

Process-related impurities arising from the mumps bulk manufacturing processes may be classified as cell  substrate-derived  or  cell  culture-derived.  Since  the  mumps  process  uses  cell  growth  medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), mumps bulk lots were tested for BSA and the results for all of these  lots  were  within  the  specification.  Mumps  vaccine  is  an  unpurified  product  whose  potency  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measured  through  a  biological  assay  for  the  active  substance  rather  than  through  evaluation  of integrity of physical form. Degradation products are neither identified nor quantified.

The testing (and method validation) of the mumps bulk is essentially the same as for the measles bulk. Batch analysis results have been provided for HVF/HCF lots and dispensed bulk lots; all results met specifications.

The reference standard used in potency testing is a monovalent mumps vaccine lot manufactured using currently approved processes. The applicant committed to characterize the performance of the mumps potency assay with international reference standards.

## · Stability

The stability studies with the mumps final bulk were initiated using three lots of vaccine bulk. The current storage time of these lots was documented as the initial testing timepoint. Stability results for these three lots of mumps final bulk are available.

Stability  results,  combined  with  the  production  history  of  mumps  final  bulk,  were  evaluated  to determine the maximum hold time used for vaccine bulk prior to processing into the filled container. The  resultant  filled  containers  passed  release  specifications  for  potency  formal  stability  studies  are ongoing to justify the proposed hold time and results will be submitted on an annual basis.

## Active substance - rubella

## · Manufacture

## Seed lot system

The  Wistar  RA  27/3  strain  of  rubella  virus  was  isolated  in  1964  by  Dr.  Stanley  Plotkin,  Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., from a kidney explant obtained from a surgically aborted foetus. It was directly inoculated into WI-38 cells, and then attenuated. The preparation of the Master Seed and the Stock Seed is appropriately described in the dossier.

Release testing results were presented for Virus Stock Seed Lots.

## Human diploid fibroblast cells (WI-38) as cell substrate

The  source  of  the  cell  substrate  used  in  the  manufacture  of  rubella  vaccine  is  female,  embryonic, human, lung tissue (WI-38) obtained from the Karolinska Institut, Stockholm, Sweden. Primary cells were isolated and a cell suspension was prepared at a population doubling level (PDL) of 8. Frozen ampoules of cells at PDL of 8 were sent to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for storage.

WI-38 working cell banks (WCBs) are prepared using appropriate cells from the ATCC. WCB lots have been used in clinical trials; in the meantime, the stock for these two WCBs has been depleted and a new WCB lot was manufactured by the method described in the dossier and has passed all release testing.

## Manufacture of rubella harvested virus fluids (HVFs)

An appropriate number of WCB ampoules are expanded to create a sufficient amount of cell substrate. Post-plant, the spent medium is removed and discarded. A sufficient quantity of rubella stock seed is added. Following virus adsorption, the infected cells are refed and incubated.

Post-infection,  the  spent  medium  is  removed  and  discarded;  the  cell  sheets  are  rinsed,  refed  and incubated.

The HVF are collected, pooled and mixed with a stabilizer. The HVF is sampled for virus potency and sterility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture of redispensed bulk

Harvests from one or more batches of HVF may be used to produce a single batch of rubella dispensed bulk which is redispensed into appropriate aliquots. The dispensed bulk cans comprise a batch of drug substance. The redispensed bulk is diluted to target fill potency during the formulation of ProQuad.

## Control cell Cultures and Harvest Control Fluids (HCFs)

Control roller bottles and HCFs are prepared in analogy with the HVFs.

## Controls of materials and critical steps / process validation

Historically, no direct qualification/certification of the WI-38 master cell bank was performed. Each WI-38 WCB is further tested to ensure freedom from extraneous agents and certify the bank for use in manufacturing. Cells from each WCB are passaged to the vaccine production PDL level or beyond to demonstrate  safety  and  acceptable  karyology  at  the  PDL  intended  for  use  in  harvested  virus  fluid (HVF) manufacturing. Release testing is described at appropriate process steps and will be performed in compliance with Ph. Eur 5.2.3.

Historically,  no  direct  qualification/certification  of  the  rubella  master  seed  was  performed.  Release testing of stock seeds is performed at appropriate process steps.

Definition of CPPs and process validation were performed in a similar manner as for measles.

## · Characterisation and specifications

Rubella virus Stock Seed Lots showed complete agreement in the nucleotide sequence alignment.

Process-related impurities arising from the rubella vaccine bulk manufacturing processes are classified as cell-substrate or cell-culture derived. Cell-substrate-derived impurities may include proteins derived from the host cell line; cell-culture-derived impurities may include antibiotics (e.g., neomycin), serum, or other media components.

Rubella vaccine bulk is an unpurified product whose potency is measured through a biological assay for  the  active  substance  rather  than  through  evaluation  of  integrity  of  physical  form.  Degradation products have been neither identified nor quantified.

Drug substance release tests are performed at the specified stages of vaccine bulk processing in order to confirm absence of extraneous agents, to verify potency and identity, and to provide a measure of quality and process consistency. For qualitative assays, the specifications are based on historical data. Assays involved in control of drug substance are performed according to approved control procedures that describe the main steps in a procedure.

The validation was performed using the assay procedure that was in place at the time the assays was validated.  The  parameters  that  were  evaluated  as  part  of  the  method  validation  for  the  assays  were provided for each analytical procedure.

Batch  analysis  results  have  been  provided  for  three  HVFs,  pooled  bulk  lots  and  ProQuad  filled container lots. Consistency of production was demonstrated and all lots met the specifications. The reference standard used in potency testing is a monovalent rubella vaccine lot manufactured using the  currently  approved  process.  The  applicant  committed  to  characterize  the  performance  of  the rubella potency assay with international reference standards.

## · Stability

Formal stability studies with the rubella final bulk were initiated using three lots of vaccine bulk. The current storage time of these lots was documented as the initial testing timepoint. Stability results for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these three lots of rubella final bulk are available. The study is on-going and results will be submitted on an annual basis.

## Active substance - varicella

## Seed lot system

The Oka strain of the varicella -zoster virus (VZV) was isolated from fluid taken from the vesicles of a  3-year-old  boy  with  a  case  of  chicken  pox.  The  virus  was  isolated  in  primary  human,  embryonic lung cells (HEL) and was passaged 11 times. The strain was further passaged 12 times in guinea pig embryo fibroblasts (GPE) to attenuate the strain and once in human diploid cells (WI-38) to passage 24. One vial of frozen infected cells of the passage 24 Oka VZV strain was received by Merck from Osaka University.

Although no clinical studies with ProQuad have been conducted using varicella virus from the passage levels  intended  for  commercial  production,  varicella  vaccine  at  the  passage  level  for  commercial production was developed and evaluated in the setting of the applicant's monovalent varicella vaccine, VARIVAX. The preparation of Master Seed and Stock Seed lots are appropriately described in the dossier.

## Human diploid fibroblast cells (MRC-5) as cell substrate

MRC-5 cells, a human, embryonic, lung, fibroblast cell line (diploid, male) originally isolated by J.P. Jacobs at the National Institute for Medical Research (London, England) and deposited at approximately population doubling level (PDL) 7 at the National Institute for Biologicals Standards and Controls (NIBSC).

## Manufacture of varicella harvested virus fluids (HVFs)

A vial from the MWCB is thawed and planted. Cells are trypsinized and finally planted for infection. A batch of HVF represents mechanically harvested, varicella-infected MRC-5 cells.

Based on appropriate criteria, the concentration of the working seed is adjusted. Each production roller bottle is planted with working seed cell suspension and incubated. The spent medium is removed and discarded, and each cell culture is rinsed. Stabilizer is added; the suspension is removed and stored with appropriate conditions.

## Manufacture of dispensed bulk

Varicella dispensed bulk is a blend of HVF lots. The cells in the HVF suspension are disrupted and clarified. This volume is dispensed prior to freezing. The dispensed final bulk containers (dispensed bulk) comprise a batch of the active substance and are stored.

## Control cell Cultures and Harvest Control Fluids (HCFs)

Final harvested control fluids are tested for sterility, mycoplasms, and tissue culture safety, while cells are tested for hemadsorption.

## Controls of materials and critical steps / process validation

The MRC-5 MCB and WCB are tested to ensure freedom from extraneous agents and to ensure that the  cells  behave  normally  through  production  use  PDL.  Release  testing  is  described  at  appropriate process steps and will be performed in compliance with Ph. Eur 5.2.3.

Release testing of the varicella master seed and stock seeds is performed in compliance with Ph. Eur. The applicant committed to consult the EMEA to discuss the need for monkey neurovirulence testing on any new varicella master seed if MNV is still required in the Ph. Eur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within  each  manufacturing  process  step,  goals,  CPPs,  and  CQAs  were  determined,  along  with appropriate specifications and acceptance criteria.

## · Characterisation and specifications

The complete sequences of the Oka/Merck strain and the wild-type Oka parent have been determined. Process-related impurities arising from the rubella vaccine bulk manufacturing processes are classified as cell-substrate or cell-culture derived. Cell-substrate-derived impurities may include proteins derived from the host cell line; cell-culture-derived impurities may include antibiotics (e.g., neomycin), serum, or other media components. Varicella process uses cell growth medium containing fetal bovine serum. Serum protein clearance is provided by rinsing the cell layers to remove as much serum as possible prior to virus harvest. Each varicella final bulk is tested for BSA.

Assays are performed at several stages of processing of vaccine bulks in order to confirm absence of extraneous  agents,  to  verify  potency  and  identity,  and  to  provide  a  measure  of  quality  and  process consistency. Assays involved in release testing of drug substance are performed according to approved control  procedures that describe the main steps in a procedure. Most assays performed on varicella vaccine bulks and bulk intermediates are qualitative methods for which the experimental outcome is only: growth or no growth, absence or presence etc... In many of these cases, the assay specifications are compendial. For quantitative assays, the acceptance criterion is based on historical data.

The validation was performed using the assay procedure that was in place at the time the assays was validated.  The  parameters  that  were  evaluated  as  part  of  the  method  validation  for  the  assays  were provided for each analytical procedure.

Batch  analysis  results  have  been  provided  for  three  HVFs,  pooled  bulk  lots  and  ProQuad  filled container lots. Consistency of production was demonstrated and all lots met the specifications.

The reference material used for the varicella potency and antigen content is described appropriately. To  generate  an  antigen  reference  standard  lot,  material  from  multiple  varicella  final  bulk  lots  is pooled,  filled,  and  lyophilized  according  to  procedures  applied  in  VARIVAX  vaccine  manufacture. Varicella antigen content in a new reference standard is established by calibration against a previously qualified  reference  standard.  The  applicant  satisfactorily  demonstrated  that  varicella  standards  are stable, perform in concordance with test samples in a specific assay and that the assigned potencies of standards  are  linked  to  potencies  of  lots,  shown  in  clinical  studies  to  be  efficacious.  However,  the difference between observed and assigned potencies of reference standards is not fully understood yet and  therefore,  sequential  calibration  of  standards  should  be  avoided.  Therefore,  the  applicant committed to establish a 'gold standard' with a link to the clinic which in the future will be used to calibrate standards included in varicella potency testing.

## · Stability

Formal stability studies with the varicella final bulk were initiated for three lots. Stability results for these three lots of varicella final bulk are available. Formal stability studies are ongoing to justify the proposed hold time.

## Finished product

ProQuad  is  a  sterile  lyophilized  vaccine  preparation  combining  the  four  viruses  used  in  the manufacture of currently licensed M-M-R II and VARIVAX vaccines from Merck. Sterile water for injections  is  provided  for  reconstitution.  The  product  is  intended  for  single-dose  administration  and contains no preservative.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The formulation composition of ProQuad is based on the formulation compositions of the currently licensed trivalent vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, and for varicella vaccine. The individual viruses  are  known  to  be  compatible  with  their  own  stabilisers.  The  compatibility  of  varicella  virus with diluents used for measles, mumps and rubella and of the measles, mumps and rubella viruses with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the varicella stabiliser have been demonstrated through stability studies. The formulation of ProQuad vaccine is appropriately described in the dossier.

Three lots were tested in one Clinical Study aimed to determine the varicella dose necessary to elicit the minimum acceptable immune response. The filling potency of varicella in these lots was increased to  compensate  for  the  reduced  immunogenicity  observed  in  the  presence  of  measles,  mumps,  and rubella  viruses.  Three  lots  of  ProQuad  vaccine  were  then  manufactured  to  demonstrate  clinical consistency and were considered the initial process validation series.

Each vial is reconstituted with 0.7 ml diluent (0.2 ml overage) to ensure that a 0.5 ml dose can be recovered.

## · Manufacture of the Product

All manufacturing operations are performed at Merck &amp; Co., Inc, West Point, Pennsylvania, USA.

Due to the range of potency of the starting vaccine bulks, a dilution factor specific for each vaccine bulk component is calculated to target the desired potency in the filled container.

Predetermined  amounts  of  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella  bulks  are  mixed  into  the  intermediate stabilizer  for  a  minimum  time  to  ensure  homogeneity,  forming  the  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella intermediate (MMR intermediate).

The  required  amounts  of  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  intermediate  is  transferred  into  the stabilizer. Varicella vaccine bulks are added and mixed for a minimum time to ensure homogeneity, forming the final formulated bulk (FFB). The FFB is then sampled for sterility and neomycin testing. The  FFB  is  maintained  at  2-8  °C  with  mixing  throughout  the  pooling  and  subsequent  vial  filling process. CPPs are identified.

Vials are filled using an automatic filling machines. Filled vials are then lyophilised for an appropriate cycle  time.  The  vials  are  removed  from  the  lyophilization  chamber  and  stored  at  appropriate temperature  prior  to  sealing.  The  time  that  vaccine  is  held  at  room  temperature  during  sealing, inspection,  labelling,  packaging  and  assembly  operations  is  documented.  Inspected  sealed  vials  are stored at appropriate temperature until they are packaged. After packaging, the vaccine may be stored at &lt; 15°C for a maximum of 18 months as stated in the Summary of Product Characteristics. CPPs and CQAs of the filling process are identified and include filling volume, time in solution of the active substances, and transfer time to the lyophilization cabinet.

Qualified insulated containers have been designed specifically for frozen vaccine shipments. During transport to Europe, a temperature below -20 ºC is maintained.

Process  validation  for  ProQuad  was  successfully  performed  by  comparing  the  results  of  three validation  lots.  The  validation  results  demonstrate  that  the  predefined  specifications  for  CPPs  and CQAs were met.

Both,  the  sterile  diluent  in  a  syringe  with  fixed-needle  and  the  diluent  in  a  syringe  without  needle syringe are manufactured by an outside vendor. The diluent in a vial is manufactured by Merck &amp; Co., Inc, West Point, Pennsylvania, USA.

At the outside vendor, Water for Injection (WFI), manufactured by distillation of purified water, is filled  into  glass  syringes  and  sterilized.  Raw  materials  are  tested  according  to  standard  operating procedures or according to specifications and methods described in pharmacopoeias. Raw materials are in accordance with specifications. The manufacturing process is described in detail and all relevant information  regarding  quality  control,  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  stability  of  the diluent have been provided by the applicant.

At Merck, WFI, manufactured by distillation of purified water, is filled into glass vials and terminally sterilized.  The  manufacturing  process  is  described  in  detail  and  all  relevant  information  regarding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

quality control, validation of the manufacturing process and stability of the diluent have been provided by the applicant

## · Control of excipients

The excipients are derived from specific monovalent viral bulks and stabilisers. Culture media are also used as diluent to achieve a consistent chemical composition, since viral bulks of different potencies are diluted to a target potency (for each virus) at the time of formulation. Different proportions of viral bulk and diluent are necessary to ensure consistent release potency and chemical composition between lots. In addition, human serum albumin (HSA) is used as a component of the cell culture medium and consequently, is present in the drug product as a residual.

Except  for  hydrolyzed  gelatine  and  phenol  red,  the  stabilizers  used  are  compliant  with  all  existing compendial monographs. The excipients of human or animal origin, hydrolyzed porcine gelatine and human serum albumin  (HSA),  are  derived  from  non-ruminant  sources  and  therefore  in  compliance with Ph.Eur. Chapter 5.2.8. HSA is obtained from vendors that use validated ethanol precipitation and heat  treatment.  The  plasma  pools  are  tested  in  compliance  with  the  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  for Plasma Pool testing.

## · Product Specification

The  testing  scheme  of  the  finished  product  represents  a  combination  of  the  regimens  used  for  the testing  of  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella  virus-containing  vaccines,  all  of  which  are  in currently licensed products.

Tests are performed on the drug product to ensure safety, sterility, to confirm the identity and quantify the  potency  of  the  product,  and  to  provide  a  measure  of  process  consistency.  Assays  employed  in control of the finished product lots are performed according to approved CPs that describe the main steps in a procedure.

Each dose of the vaccine contains at the end of its shelf-life a minimum of 3.00 log TCID50 measles virus, 4.30 log TCID50 mumps virus, 3.00 log TCID50 rubella virus, and 3.99 log plaque forming unit (PFU) varicella virus. The release specifications have been selected to ensure that, at expiry, each dose will  contain  the  aforementioned  minimum potency for each virus when the vaccine is reconstituted and stored at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Several assays performed on the finished product are qualitative methods for which there are only two experimental  outcomes  (growth  or  no  growth,  absence  or  presence,  etc.).  In  many  cases,  the  assay specifications are compendial.

The  potency  specifications  for  filled  container  have  been  derived  from  several  sources.  Each  virus release potency is described in the dossier.

The parameters that were evaluated as part of the method validation for the assays are listed for each analytical  procedure.  When  applicable,  the  assay  parameters  addressed  were  specificity,  inter-assay precision, limit of detection, limit of quantisation, linearity, range, ruggedness, and robustness.

Batch analysis was performed on three process validation lots within the range of a commercial lot size. All results met the pre-defined specifications.

Because ProQuad is a live virus vaccine composed of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella bulks prepared from cell culture fluids, it is not a highly purified product. To provide a marker for removal of  fetal  bovine  serum  used  during  the  cell  culture  process,  a  quantitative  test  for  residual  BSA  is conducted on the virus bulks. This BSA content is used to calculate the amount of BSA present in the filled  container  based  on  the  dilution  of  each  bulk  during  filling.  A  specification  exists  for  BSA content in filled container ( ≤ 500 ng BSA per single human dose) as per the Ph. Eur. monograph 0648 even though filled container material is not directly tested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  committed  to  characterize  the  performance  of  his  potency  assay  with  international reference standards and to establish a 'gold standard' with  a link to the clinic for calibration of future standards used in ProQuad potency testing.

## · Viral safety and TSE

## Adventitious Agents

The  testing  program  for  adventitious  agents  is  described  in  detail  in  the  chapters  on  the  Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella active substances. All raw materials used in vaccine manufacturing are tested  for  adventitious  agents  prior  to  release  and  use  in  manufacturing.  Validated  processing  steps that add additional levels of confidence for the absence of adventitious agents are filter sterilization and ultraviolet (UV)- or gamma -irradiation.

## TSE

The manufacturing process for ProQuad™ was evaluated for the theoretical risk of transmission of infectivity  associated  with  BSE  prions,  with  the  conclusion  that  the  risk  of  BSE  transmission  in ProQuad  is  exceedingly  remote.  The  rationale  and  the  calculation  for  the  theoretical  risk  of transmission of infectivity associated with BSE prions were provided.

Biological  reagents  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the  vaccine  or  intermediates  include  iron-enriched bovine  calf  serum  (BCS),  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS),  porcine  pancreatic  trypsin,  porcine-derived hydrolyzed gelatine, choline chloride, bovine or porcine tallow-derived polysorbate 80, fish or sheep wool-derived cholesterol, amino acids, and human serum albumin (HSA). Certificates of Suitability (CoS), which are granted by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM), and the measures applied (e.g. regular audits of vendor facilities, testing to ensure that the appropriate quality standards are met, etc.) ensure that the ruminant-derived raw materials currently used in manufacturing are  free  of  transmissible  spongiform  encephalopathy  (TSE)  or  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy (BSE) contamination.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  tests  have  been  designed  to  measure  product  performance  under  anticipated  handling  and storage  conditions  and  under  stressed  conditions  that  might  be  encountered  after  distribution.  The anticipated  conditions  following  lyophilization  were  studied.  Upon  use,  the  vaccine  is  reconstituted and may be stored for up to 30 minutes at room temperature prior to injection.

Stability studies were conducted on different process validation lots at various temperatures described in the dossier suitable to support the storage conditions of the vaccine.

All viruses undergo a statistically significant loss of potency when stored at 2-8 ° C or higher, which underscores the importance of frozen storage of the vaccine.

Available stability  data  indicate  this  vaccine  to  be  satisfactorily  stable  for  at  least  18  months  when stored  at ≤ -15 ° C  (frost-free)  and  up  to  30  minutes  at  room  temperature  following  reconstitution immediately prior to use as stated in the SPC.

Stability studies are on-going In addition, post-launch vaccine lots will be placed on stability on an annual basis for the purpose of routine monitoring. Full testing will be performed at initial and expiry intervals; a subset of the tests will be performed at each time interval as appropriate.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

During the evaluation of ProQuad, two major objections were identified. Firstly, there was a question whether the varicella seed lot system used by the manufacturer conforms to Ph. Eur. Chapter 5.2.1; the terminology  used  in  the  dossier  was  clarified  and  it  was  shown  to  be  conform  to  the  Ph.  Eur. requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondly, the change of a higher passage level for the varicella component, as described in the dossier, raised concerns regarding safety and efficacy of the higher passage vaccine. However, a corresponding change had been approved for the monovalent Varivax vaccine, based on data from a clinical study. Since  no  clinical  studies  were  performed  for  ProQuad  to  address  this  issue,  data  from  Varivax  are regarded  as  relevant  and  suitable  to  demonstrate,  that  the  additional  passage  does  not  change  the quality of the varicella component. Hence it can be concluded, that requesting a further clinical study, to investigate the safety and efficacy of ProQuad, comprising the higher passage varicella component, is not justified.

A  number  of  other  concerns,  including  setting  potency  specifications  for  HVFs  and  the  dispensed bulk, setting a specification for BSA content in the measles, mumps and rubella bulks. The applicant was also asked to characterize the performance of the measles, mumps and rubella potency assay with international reference standards. Regarding the calibration of potency results for measles, mumps and rubella and calibration of varicella and ProQuad reference standards used for calibration of potency results for varicella, both issues are resolved, resulting in one follow-up measure. Data provided by the applicant satisfactorily address the concerns raised and support the view, that the calibration procedure is suitable and of significance to consistently manufacture vaccine of satisfactory quality.

Several  commitments  are  made  by  the  applicant,  and  several  follow-up  measures  are  defined  to provide further information post-approval. In conclusion, all quality issues are resolved.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

ProQuad is a combination of known marketed antigens (measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine). These authorised viral components have been administered safely to millions of children and adults. Furthermore the safety of these authorised components has been established pre-clinically by extensive safety testing of cell cultures, cell banks, seeds, viral bulks and final formulated vaccine and clinically by trials and post-marketing surveillance.

## Pharmacology

Although the Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxcicological testing of vaccines, CPMP/SWP/465/95 mentions that 'It is preferable  to  study  new  combined  vaccines  in  comparison with  the  individual  antigen  in  animals….',  traditional  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  not  been performed for either ProQuad (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella [Oka/Merck] Virus Vaccine Live) or its authorised component vaccines measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, and varicella vaccine.

## Pharmacokinetics

Traditional pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed for either ProQuad (Measles, Mumps, Rubella  and  Varicella  (Oka/Merck)  Live  Virus  Vaccine)  or  its  authorised  component  vaccines measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine,  and  varicella  vaccine.  Pharmacokinetic  studies  are  not  normally needed such as in combined vaccines according to the Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxcicological testing of vaccines, CPMP/SWP/465/95.

## Toxicology

Traditional  toxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  ProQuad  [Measles,  Mumps  Rubella  and Varicella Vaccine Virus Live (Oka/Merck)]. However, exhaustive safety testing was performed for the absence  of  transmissible  or  infective  viral  agents  according  to  requirements  listed  in  the  European Pharmacopoeia (Supplement 2002, Section 2.6.16).

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

No non-clinical data have been submitted for ProQuad. However, with respect to the actual stage of the  vaccine  development  and  considering  the  extended  clinical  testing  of  the  vaccine  already performed, it appears not to be justified to request additional preclinical testing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

ProQuad is a sterile, lyophilized preparation of the components of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (live) and varicella vaccine (live [Oka/Merck]). The vaccine is comprised of the:

- -more attenuated vaccine strain of measles virus (derived from Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain),
- -Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus
- -Wistar RA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus
- -Oka/Merck strain of varicella virus

ProQuad is administered subcutaneously in a single 0.5-mL dose. The vaccine must be stored frozen at -15ºC or colder and shelf life of the product is 18 months.

A formal efficacy trial was not conducted with ProQuad. The efficacy of the product was determined through  the  use  of  serologic  correlates  of  protection  previously  established  in  the  evaluation  of  the efficacy of the monovalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines.

In  all  of  the  clinical  trials  performed  with  ProQuad,  the  specifications  for  the  measles,  mumps, and rubella  components  of  the  product  remained  the  same  as  those  used  for  the  production  of  measles, mumps,  rubella  vaccine.  Studies  performed  with  an  early  formulation  of  a  combination  measles, mumps,  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine  (referred  to  as  MMRV)  using  doses  of  each  of  the components similar to the doses in measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine indicated that the measles, mumps, and rubella immune responses were not affected by the presence of varicella virus.  Using  the  same  specifications  for  the  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella  components  of  ProQuad allowed  the  extensive  safety,  immunogenicity,  and  efficacy  database  for  measles,  mumps,  rubella vaccine to be used in support of this Application for ProQuad. The studies performed with MMRV also showed that the varicella immune response was diminished in the presence of measles, mumps, and  rubella  viruses.  Therefore,  dose  ranging  of  the  varicella  component  was  performed  in  order  to determine the appropriate specifications for the varicella component of ProQuad.

The safety and immunogenicity of ProQuad were demonstrated in clinical trials involving over 5400 subjects 12 to 23 month of age and 399 subjects 4 to 6 years of age. The safety profile of ProQuad also is  supported  by  the  extensive  data  generated  with  measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella vaccine in prelicensure clinical trials and post licensure experience

The clinical program to support licensure of ProQuad consisted of 5 randomized, controlled studies s in  which  over  5800  subjects  received  ProQuad  with  a  varicella  virus  release  potency ≥ 3.97  log10 plaque-forming  units  (PFU),  the  lowest  dose  of  varicella  virus  in  the  product  determined  to  be clinically acceptable.

Four (4) of the studies 009, 011, 012, and 013) evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad compared with measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine in children 12 to 23 months of age.  Study  014  evaluated  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  ProQuad  in  place  of  measles,  mumps, rubella  vaccine  in  children  4  to  6  years  of  age.  The  studies  included  in  this  Application  are summarized in the table below:

## Pharmacodynamics

This information is provided in the Clinical efficacy section.

## Clinical efficacy

Studies  performed  in  the  early  1990s  with  an  earlier  formulation  of  a  combined  measles,  mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine (referred to as MMRV) had demonstrated that the measles, mumps, and rubella responses were adequate, but the varicella response was suboptimal compared with measles, mumps,  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine.  Modifications  to  the  manufacturing  process  for varicella vaccine were made to improve the varicella vaccine yield; these changes were incorporated into ProQuad.

## METHODS

## Study participants and treatments

Study 009 : A multicenter (2 centres in the US), partially-blind (subjects were blinded with regard to the treatment group until the second visit), controlled, small-scale trial in which healthy children 12 to 23 months of age were assigned to one of two treatments: concomitant injections of either ProQuad and placebo or measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine on Day 0.

Subjects  who  received  ProQuad  and  placebo  on  Day  0  received  a  second  dose  of  ProQuad  at approximately  Day  90  in  the  first  group.  The  second  group  received  measles,  mumps  and  rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine on Day 0.

Subjects  were  randomised  2:1  (ProQuad:  measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine  +  varicella  vaccine) according to a computer generated allocation scheme provided by the applicant.

Study  011: A  multicenter  (18  centers  in  the  U.S.),  partially  double-blind  (blinded  with  regard  to specific  formulations  of  ProQuad,  but  not  to  treatment  group),  controlled  trial,  in  which  healthy children 12 to 23 months of age , were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: the first 3 groups received 1 dose of ProQuad containing 1 of 3 different potencies for the varicella component (3.48, 3.97, or 4.25 log10 PFU) or measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine.

Subjects randomized to receive ProQuad on Day 0 received a second dose of ProQuad containing the same potency  as  the  first  dose  on  Day  90.  The  fourth  group  received  measles,  mumps  and  rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine (PUVV) on Day 0.

Subjects  were  randomised  to  one  of  3  different  doses  of  ProQuad  or  measles,  mumps  and  rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine PUVV

Study 012: A multicenter (35 U.S. centers, 5 Canadian centers), partially-double blind (blinded with regard  to  specific  formulation  of  ProQuad,  but  not  to  treatment  group),  controlled  trial  randomized study in which healthy children were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: the first 3 groups received 1 of  3  consistency  lot  formulations  of  ProQuad  (frozen)  in  which  the  dose  level  of  the  varicella component contained 4.40, 4.61, and 4.73 log10 PFU/dose, henceforth referred to as Lot 1, Lot 2, and Lot  3,  respectively.  The  fourth  group  received  marketed  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  and varicella vaccine concomitantly at separate injection sites. All subjects were randomized on Day 0 to 1 of the 4 groups.

Subjects were randomised to one of 3 ProQuad lots or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine.

Study 013: Open, multicenter (48 U.S. centers), randomized study, in which healthy children, 12 to 15 months of age, were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:

Group 1 (concomitant group) received ProQuad, DTPa (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine), and Hib-Hep B (haemophilus b conjugate and hepatitis B vaccine) concomitantly at separate injection sites on Day 0.

Group 2 (non-concomitant group) received ProQuad on Day 0 (Visit 1), and on Day 42 (Visit 2) received DTPa and Hib-Hep B concomitantly at separate injection sites.

Group 3 (control) received measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine on Day 0 (Visit 1) concomitantly at separate injection sites and on Day 42 (Visit 2) received DTPa and Hib-Hep B concomitantly at separate injection sites.

Subjects  were  randomised  to  one  of  3  treatment  groups  (ProQuad  +  DTPa  +  Hib-Hep  B,  ProQuad followed  6  weeks  later  by  DTPa  +  Hib-Hep  B,  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  +  varicella vaccine followed 6 weeks later by DTPa + Hib-Hep B).

Study  014: This  was  a  double-blind  (operating  under  in-house  blinding  procedures),  multicenter, randomized  study  in  which  healthy  children,  4  to  6  years  of  age,  were  enrolled.  Subjects  were stratified based on whether their primary doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine  were  received  concomitantly  or  non-concomitantly.  Subjects  within  each  stratum  were enrolled into 1 of the 3 treatment groups.

Group  1 received  1  dose  each  of  ProQuad  and  placebo  administered  concomitantly  at  separate injection sites.

Group  2 received  1  dose  each  of  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  and  placebo  administered concomitantly at separate injection sites. Subjects enrolled into

Group  3 received  1  dose  each  of  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine administered concomitantly at separate injection sites.

## Objectives

See Table 1; Summary of Pivotal studies

## Outcomes/endpoints

With regard to the design and conduct of the clinical studies the following items were evaluated:

(1)  Evaluation  of  immunogenicity  using  validated  assays  could  be  used  as  a  surrogate  measure  for efficacy;

(2) Seroconversion and GMTs were evaluated for all studies supporting Marketing Authorisations;

(3) Non-inferiority or equivalence margins were implemented to establish the similarity of ProQuad with  measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine  administered  concomitantly  at  separate injection sites; no more than a 5-10 percentage points difference for measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and no more than a 10-15 percentage points difference for varicella vaccine.

(4) Definition of the minimum clinically acceptable dose of varicella virus in ProQuad

The choice of a wider non-inferiority threshold for varicella has been justified by the Applicant by a wider variability in response rate for varicella, compared to the other ProQuad components and by the lower acceptable response rate which has been set at 76%.

Comparisons of antibody response rates and/or GMTs ~6 weeks following vaccination were used as the primary serologic endpoints in each study. All serologic assays were developed and performed by Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania, with the exception of serologic assays for diphtheria antitoxin, tetanus antitoxin, and antibodies to pertussis toxin (PT) and pertussis FHA, which were accomplished by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Sydney, Australia. Levels of antibody for each  assay  were  evaluated  by  an  appropriately  sensitive  and  reliable  method  and  each  assay  was rigorously validated.

The response rate for varicella was  defined  as  the  percent  of  subjects  with  a  postvaccination  VZV antibody titer ≥ 5 gpELISA units/mL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The response rate for measles was originally defined as the percent of subjects with a postvaccination measles antibody titer ≥ 207.5 milli International units (mIU/mL) for Studies 009 and 011 and ≥ 120 mIU/mL for Studies 012, 013, and 014.

For  Studies  009  and  011,  a mumps enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  based  on  the mumps vaccine strain was used. The response rate for mumps in these 2 studies was the percent of subjects  with  a  postvaccination  mumps  antibody  titer  above  the  optical  density  (OD)  cutoff.  For Studies  012,  013,  and  014,  a  mumps  ELISA  based  on  the  wild-type  mumps  virus  was  used.  The response rate for mumps in these 3 studies was the percent of subjects with a postvaccination mumps antibody titer ≥ 10 ELISA units.

The  response  rate  for rubella in  each  study  was  defined  as  the  percent  of  subjects  who  had  a postvaccination rubella antibody titer ≥ 10 IU/mL.

The  following  Table  2  summarizes  the  serological  criteria  that  must  be  fulfilled  in  order  meet  the clinical  endpoint  requirements  for  MMRV  vaccines,  i.e.  protection  from  infection  with  measles, mumps, rubella and varicella virus were identified in each study.

Publications and epidemiological surveillance provide sufficient evidence that cut off ELISA values indicating protection from measles, mumps, rubella and varicella were correctly chosen.

Similarly serological correlates account for efficacy analysis of other vaccines used concomitantly in Study 013, DTPa and Hib-Hep B. These parameters are summarised in Table 3:

The definitions of post-vaccination response for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis PT, and pertussis FHA are based on data in the package circular for DTPa which (diphtheria, and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, Aventis Pasteur) was used with ACTHib  (tetanus,  toxoid  conjugate,  Aventis  Pasteur  MSD)  as  well  as  the  Clinical  Development  Plan  for  ARBI  (ACTHib, RECOMBIVAX

HB, DTPBiken, Inactivated Polio). The definitions of post-vaccination response for hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) are based on the Hib-Hep B (Haemophilus b conjugate [meningococcal protein conjugate] and hepatitis B [recombinant] vaccine) package circular.

EIA = Enzyme immunoassay.

RIA = Radioimmunoassay.

FHA = Filamentous haemagglutinin.

Hib = Haemophilus influenzae type b.

## Sample size

The immunogenicity data described are presented from each clinical study separately and also pooled across all studies within the same subject population.

The  4  clinical  trials  in  healthy  children  12  to  23  months  of  age  (studies  009,  011,  012  and  013) included  5833  subjects  who  received  ProQuad  (4884  who  received  ProQuad  alone  and  949  who received ProQuad concomitantly with other paediatric vaccines [DTPa and Hib-Hep B]). Study 012 investigating the consistency of the manufacturing process for ProQuad evaluated the largest number (2915) of recipients of ProQuad. In the additional Study 014, 399 children received ProQuad at 4 to 6 years of age.

Statistical methods With respect to immunogenicity all studies were planned and analysed as noninferiority or equivalence (in case of lot-to-lot consistency) studies. In general the analyses were performed on per-protocol populations of patients initially seronegative to the component analysed. With regard to the different studies the following statistical methods were applied.

- Similarity based on rates (e.g. seroconversion rates):
- o Similarity hypotheses were tested by expanding the method of Farrington and Manning to multicenter studies
- o Confidence intervals on the average difference in proportions across study centers were calculated using the method proposed by Miettinen and Nurminen
- Acceptability of rates:
- o Two-sided (exact) binomial tests for rates were applied
- Similarity based on GMTs:
- o While in studies  011,  012  and  013  ANOVA  models  with  the  natural  log of  individual titers  and  fixed  effects  for  study  center,  treatment  group  and  center-by-treatment interaction  were  applied,  no  interaction  term  was  used  in  study  009.  In  study  014  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

same model as in studies 09 adding primary vaccination status and log predose titer level as covariate was applied.

To account for the multiplicity issues arising from the multiple comparisons in each study, different methods were applied. The experiment-wise Type I error in studies 009 and 011 was set to 0.025 (onesided)  while  in  studies  012,  013  and  014  an  experiment-wise  Type  I  error  of  0.05  (one-sided)  was used.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow and recruitment

Five  pivotal  (009,  011,  012,  013,  014)  clinical  trials  were  conducted  from  1998  to  2002  using ProQuad.

The studies were conducted to address the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Around 95% of subjects  enrolled  completed  the  studies.  Drop-outs  were  mainly  due  to  technical  reasons  and  a  few number of subjects discontinuing due to severe adverse drug reactions.

## Conduct of the study and Baseline data

A number of study amendments were made during the conduct of all pivotal studies. These changes were  mainly  of  technical  nature  or  refinements  to  the  original  study  plans.  None  of  these  changes modified  the  initially  defined  objectives  and  hypotheses.  No  asymmetries  in  treatment  arms  were observed in any of the pivotal studies in terms of age, sex, gender and ethnicity.

## Proof-of-Concept Study

Study 009 evaluated the primary immunogenicity hypothesis comparing varicella responses of 1 and 2 doses of ProQuad to measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine.

The percent of subjects (initially seronegative) achieving a post-vaccination varicella antibody titer ≥ 5 gpELISA units is estimated to be 91.2% after receiving 1 dose of ProQuad, 99.2% after receiving 2 doses of ProQuad, and 92.2% after receiving measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine.

Although similarity criteria have been met for post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 it is very clear from study 009 that a single immunisation is not sufficient to provide optimal immune protection against VZV infections. This impression is corroborated by the fact that GMTs increase significantly post-dose 2 as summarized in the brief Table shown below:

In  contrast  to  the  VZV  component  of  ProQuad,  a  second  dose  only  marginally  impacts  response (seroconversion) rates mediated by the measles, mumps and rubella components. Likewise, although GMTs  increase  post-dose  2,  this  effect  is  far  less  pronounced  compared  to  VZV  confirming  the present  view  that  a  second  dose  of  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  constitutes  a  catch-up immunisation rather than a true booster.

## Dose-Ranging Study

Study 011 represents a formal dose finding study for the VZV component contained in ProQuad. Dose ranges of the other components remained unchanged compared to authorised vaccine and no new dose finding  studies  were  performed.  PUVV  (process  upgrade  varicella  vaccine)  monovalent  varicella vaccine  corresponds  to  varicella  vaccine  used  in  the  other  pivotal  studies  and  to  the  varicella component present in ProQuad.

Thus, it could be concluded that all three 2-injection regimens of ProQuad - Low Dose, Middle Dose, and High Dose (4.25, 3.97 and 3.48, log10 PFU) and the 1-injection regimen of ProQuad (High Dose; 4.25 log10 PFU) were statistically non-inferior (&lt;10 percentage points decrease) to the control group. However,  the  data  did  not  support  the  hypotheses  that  the  1-injection  regimens  of  Low  Dose  and Middle Dose ProQuad (3.48, 3.97 log10 PFU) were non-inferior to the control group.

There  is  no  interference  with  the  other  vaccine  components  of  any  of  the  VZV  doses  present  in ProQuad formulations under investigation in Study 011. It is also evident that unlike for VZV a single dose  vaccination  schedule  is  sufficient  to  achieve  acceptable  response  rates  and  titers  against  the vaccine components. A second dose of ProQuad only marginally impacts seroconversion rates. Anti measles, mumps and rubella-antibody titers are generally increased following dose 2, however, since GMTs were high already following administration of the first dose the further increase might have no clinical significance. For any of the VZV doses included in ProQuad investigational vaccine, there is no statistical difference in the performance of the vaccine components.

## Consistency Lots Study And Persistence Of Antibody

Study  012 provided  clinical  confirmation  of  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  for ProQuad. This study evaluated the largest number (2915) of recipients of ProQuad.

Equivalent  antibody  responses  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella  were  achieved  by  the  3 consistency lots of ProQuad. Similar immune responses to all four antigens could be demonstrated by comparison of the combined lots of ProQuad with the control group receiving measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine concomitantly. The immune responses specific to measles mumps, rubella  and  varicella  met  the  predefined  acceptability  criteria  at  6-weeks  post-vaccination.  Thus  the study objectives are met.

The antibody persistence rates  for  all  four  antigens  among  the  3  consistency  lots  of  ProQuad  were comparable to each other, and the combined antibody persistence rate from the 3 consistency lots of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ProQuad  was  comparable  to  that  of  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine administered  concomitantly  at  separate  injection  sites.  Persistence  of  antibodies  to  all  four  antigens was demonstrated at 1 year postvaccination.  The  increase  between 6 weeks and 1 year in varicella titers can indicate a continuous exposure to circulating varicella wild type virus.

A higher number of varicella breakthrough cases were observed in the ProQuad arm.

## Overall Immunogenicity Results Following the Primary Dose of ProQuad

Evaluation of the response in subjects 12- to 23-months old, 6 weeks following administration of a primary dose, was used to determine the equivalence of the immune response to all 4 antigens between recipients of ProQuad (containing a varicella virus dose ≥ 3.97 log10 PFU) and recipients of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine.

The results suggest that 1 dose of ProQuad containing a varicella virus dose ≥ 3.97 log10 PFU in 12- to 23-month-old  initially  seronegative  subjects  is  highly  immunogenic  with  response  rates  6  weeks postvaccination of 91.2% for varicella, 97.4% for measles, 98.8% for mumps (vaccine strain ELISA), 95.8% for mumps (wildtype ELISA), and 98.5% for rubella. Studies 009, 011, and 012 demonstrated the  similarity  of  ProQuad  to  and  varicella  vaccine  using  preplanned  objectives,  hypotheses,  and statistical methods.

## Concomitant Use With Other Routine Pediatric Vaccines

Study  013 was  designed  to  evaluate  whether  ProQuad  could  be  administered  with  other  pediatric vaccines without impairing the immune response to any of the vaccine antigens. The immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of ProQuad, Haemophilus b conjugate and hepatitis B vaccine (HibHep B), and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa) at separate injection sites was evaluated among 1915 healthy children, 12 to 16 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  for  the  Pertussis  FHA  component,  the  p-value  for  non-inferiority  (0.815)  does  not  show  noninferiority; a conclusion of a similar immune response for the concomitant group compared with the non-concomitant  group,  with  respect  to  immune  responses  to  all  antigens  in both Hib-Hep  B  and DTPa could not be made based on this analysis.

Concomitant use of these vaccines led to a statistically significant reduction in antibody responses to Pertussis FHA. Furthermore, the expected antibody response rates to Pertussis PT of 85% and Hep B of 98%, respectively, which are based on former clinical experience and are outlined in the respective package  circulars,  were  not  met.  Taking  these  findings  as  a  signal,  ProQuad  should  not  be  given concomitantly with these two vaccines.

Noninferiority was demonstrated for the concomitant use of ProQuad and Hib-Hep B. However, the antibody response rates and the GMTs for the HepB component of Hib-Hep B are numerically lower for the concomitant group than for the nonconcomitant group. In the light of the current discussion on the low immunogenicity of Hep B component in several of the applicant's vaccine formulations and due  to  the  highly  diverse  national  childhood  immunization  programs  throughout  the  EU,  using  far more complex DTPa vaccines compared to DTPa, concomitant administration of ProQuad with other childhood vaccines must be avoided for the time being.

## Immune Response to ProQuad When Used to Administer a Second Dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and Varicella Vaccines

In 3 studies, ProQuad was used to administer a second dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccines to children.

In Studies 009 and 011 , a total of 1097 recipients of ProQuad received a second dose of ProQuad 3 months after  the  first  dose  (at  ~15  months  of  age).  For  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella,  the  response rates remained above 98% and the GMTs increased 1.7-fold to 2.4- fold in subjects who received a second  dose  of  ProQuad  ~3  months  following  the  primary  dose.  The  varicella  responses  increased significantly  from 86.6% after  1  dose  to  99.4%  after  2  doses,  with  up  to  an  approximate  41-fold increase in GMTs after 2 doses.

In Study 014 , 399 children were administered ProQuad instead of the routinely recommended dose of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age.

§: Rubella antibody titers obtained by the legacy format were converted to their corresponding titers in the modified format. Percentages were calculated as the number of subjects who met the criterion divided by the number of subjects contributing to the per-protocol analysis.

The  study  does  not  show  significant  differences  in  observed  response  rates  between  ProQuad  and measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  +  varicella  vaccine  given  concomitantly  at  separate  injection sites, in children 4 to 6 years of age. For varicella and rubella, the GMTs were numerically higher in the  recipients  of  ProQuad compared to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine group, whereas for mumps the GMTs were lower in the recipients of ProQuad. The percent of subjects achieving a ≥ 4- fold rise in titers from prevaccination to postvaccination are low for measles (~4.5%), moderate  for  mumps  (27%-41%)  and  rubella  (27%-33%),  but  are  substantially  high  for  varicella (80.7% - 72%).

- Clinical studies in special populations

## None

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

None

- Supportive studies

The following studies were submitted as supportive clinical information:

- Study 007 is a  vaccine / varicella vaccine concomitant use study with the primary objective to define an acceptable end of expiry titer of the mumps component in  vaccine. Immunogenicity of the varicella component is not specifically investigated in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Studies 003, 004, 005, 006 were conducted in the early '90s of the past century using an MMRV formulation  unrelated  to  the  current  PUVV  manufacturing  process  for  ProQuad,  thus  being unrelated to the present application
- Study 745 is an early study on Merck's varicella vaccine, conducted 1982 -1989 focussing on the immunogenicity and safety as well as long-term efficacy of the monovalent varicella vaccine.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Although no immunogenicity data have been provided for children aged 24 to 47 months and 7 to 12 years  it  can  be  assumed  based  on  previous  experience  that  the  immunogenicity  profile  after administration of ProQuad will be comparable in children from 12 months of age.

Manufacturing consistency was confirmed in clinical studies through the evaluation of 3 consistency lots of ProQuad, all of which were shown to be similar to each other, as well as to the concomitant administration (at separate injection sites) of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine in terms of the immune responses to each of the 4 antigens in ProQuad.

The  minimum  clinically  acceptable  doses  for  the  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella  components  of ProQuad are the same as those for measles, mumps, rubella vaccine because use of the same dose of these  3  components in ProQuad resulted in similar measles, mumps, and rubella immune responses between  recipients  of  ProQuad  and  recipients  of  measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine.  The  minimum clinically acceptable dose of varicella virus in ProQuad is 3.97 log10 PFU. The immune response in terms  of  percent  of  subjects  with  a  VZV  antibody  titer ≥ 5  gpELISA  units/mL  with  this  dose  is comparable to the response obtained with varicella vaccine (at end-expiry).

## The need for a 2 nd dose to provide optimal protection from varicella

There is no major concern on the efficacy of the measles, mumps and rubella component of ProQuad.

However, for the varicella component the following major objection was raised and discussed: From Studies 009 and 011 where ProQuad was given in a two dose schedule, the second dose received 90 days after the first dose, it is concluded that a single dose of ProQuad is not sufficient to provide optimal  protection  from  varicella.  This  is  evident  from  the  increase  of  seroconversion  rates  from below 90% to virtually 100%, and from the 10 to 40 fold increase in anti varicella GMTs. A primeboost concept is highly unusual for live attenuated vaccines (in contrast to inactivated vaccines) but can  be  explained  by  the  high  attenuation  level  of  the  OKA/Merck  varicella  vaccine  strain  and/or interference phenomena between vaccine components.

A one-dose schedule would leave the vaccinee with a considerable risk to acquire varicella despite vaccination due to an insufficient quality of the immune response following a single dose of ProQuad. The higher number of varicella breakthrough cases observed in the ProQuad arm might be indicative for improper protection after only one ProQuad dose. This supports the CHMP conclusion on Studies 009 and 011 that the first dose of ProQuad constitutes a priming of the anti varicella immune response whereas the second dose has a booster function.

Although a second dose of varicella vaccine for this age group is not recommended in any Member State,  administration  of  a  second  dose  of  ProQuad  could  increase  the  efficacy  of  the  varicella component of the vaccine by further reducing the rate of breakthrough varicella. From the perspective of the significant increase in GMTs observed post-dose 2, it was concluded that for protection from VZV infection, the first dose of ProQuad should be considered as a primary vaccination, while the second dose of ProQuad is mandatory to booster the primary immune response mediating long term persistence  of  immune  response  and  protection  from  disease.  The  need  for  a  second  dose  of  a varicella-virus  containing  vaccine  to  increase  immunity  to  varicella  to  prevent  further  varicella outbreaks was discussed extensively, and agreed by the CHMP.

Thus  the  first  dose  considered  as  the  primary  immunisation,  and  a  second  booster  dose,  is  clearly stated in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-inferiority margin for varicella

The choice of a wider non-inferiority threshold for varicella has been justified by the Applicant by a wider variability in response rate for varicella, compared to the other ProQuad components and by the lower acceptable response rate which has been set at 76%.

However  it  should  be  noted  that  varicella  is  a  highly  infectious  disease  and  extended  use  of vaccination should provide the same protection level ensured for the other vaccine components.  The fact that the varicella vaccine is less stable than measles, mumps and rubella vaccine components does not  justify  the  acceptance  of  lower  sero-response  rates  and  wider  non-inferiority  margins.  These arguments on the non-inferiority margins should be taken into account also in view of the future type II variation already planned to be requested for the refrigerated product suitable for the EU market.

## Concomitant use

In Study 013 - concomitant use of ProQuad and DTPa and ProQuad and Hib-HepB - non-inferiority of  concomitant  versus  non-concomitant  use  could  not  be  shown  for  ProQuad  and  DTPa  given concomitantly. Response against the Pa components (PT and FHA) was insufficient. Concomitant use of ProQuad and Hib-Hep B vaccine showed a reduced response rate against the Hep B component of the Hib-Hep B vaccine in the concomitant group.

ProQuad should not be used concomitantly with other vaccines as stated in the SPC.

## Long term persistence

Long  term  persistence  studies  conducted  with  Varivax  will  provide  helpful  information  on  the persistence of antibodies in a changing environment as well as the rate of breakthrough cases and the risk of HZ. The applicant has committed to conduct long-term follow-up studies.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

Over  93%  of  the  12-  to  23-month-old  subjects  and  over  97%  of  the  4-  to  6-year-old  subjects completed their respective studies.  A  subject  was  considered  to  have  completed the study if he/she received all scheduled vaccinations, completed all safety follow-up, and provided blood samples as defined in the study.

Approximately 53% of the 12- to 23-month-old subjects and ~53% of the 4- to 6-year-old subjects who received ProQuad were male. The median age of the 2 groups was 12.0 months (range: 11 to 23 months) and 4.0 years (range: 4 to 6 years), respectively. The largest racial/ethnic groups in both age groups were Caucasian (66.0% and 78.4%, respectively), followed by African American (13.0% and 12.3%, respectively), and Hispanic (9.8% and 3.8%, respectively). These demographic characteristics appeared to be consistent with those observed in recipients of the respective control groups.

The safety data for the 4,497 children (12-23 month) from the ProQuad groups in studies 009, 011, 012 and 013 (non-concomitant) who were administered lots of ProQuad with varicella virus potencies greater than the minimum clinical acceptable dose of 3.97 log10 PFU were compared with the data obtained  from  the  2038  children  administered  who  were  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  + varicella vaccine.

## · Adverse events

In general, increase of the varicella dose was paralleled by an increase of vaccine related adverse experiences.

When  comparing  the  overall  rate  of  subjects  experiencing  one  or  more  injection-site  adverse experiences following a single dose of ProQuad versus subjects who received both measles, mumps and  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine,  the  rate  was  significantly  lower  among  recipients  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ProQuad (31.3% versus 34.6%, respectively). However, in parallel to the increase of the varicella dose an increase of the injection site adverse experiences (except for Study 011) was observed.

The rate of pain at the injection site was significantly lower among recipients of ProQuad compared with the rate at either site for recipients of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (22.0% versus 26.8%, respectively). However, increasing doses of Varicella prompted higher rates of pain. A significantly higher rate of pain was observed when ProQuad was given concomitantly with other pediatric vaccines compared to the administration of ProQuad only. In addition, in Study 014 (46 year old children, second vaccination) the rate of pain was higher in the ProQuad than in the control group.

Erythema at the injection site for ProQuad occurred more frequently than erythema at the injection site for measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (24.4% for ProQuad, 15.6% and 14.5% for each of the injection sites for measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, and 15.5% for varicella vaccine). Rash at the injection site of ProQuad occurred at a higher rate than rash at the injection site of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine or varicella vaccine (2.4% versus 0.5% versus 1.4%, respectively).

In was also observed that in Study 014 older children showed a higher rate of swelling compared to the corresponding control-group (measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine).

There  was  a  higher  rate  of  subjects  with  one  or  more  clinical  adverse  experiences  in  the  ProQuad group than in the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine group (81.5% versus 79.6%, respectively). The number of subjects who reported one or more systemic clinical adverse experiences was higher in recipients of a single dose of ProQuad compared with recipients of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine (76.1% versus 72.3%, respectively).

Systemic clinical adverse experiences that were reported at a higher rate among subjects who were administered  a  single  dose  of  ProQuad  were  fever  (37.2%  versus  31.5%,  respectively),  upper respiratory  infection  (23.5%  versus  20.7,  respectively),  and  measles-like  rash  (3.2%  versus  2.2%, respectively).  When  comparing only  systemic  clinical  adverse  experiences  that  were  assessed  to  be related to the study vaccine, upper respiratory infection was numerically but not significantly different between the two groups.

Fever  ( ≥ 40.0°C)  was  a  systemic  adverse  experience  that  was  statistically  higher  in  recipients  of ProQuad than in those who received measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine (37.3% versus 31.6%, respectively). The rate of temperature - 40.0°C oral equivalent was also significantly higher  in  recipients  of  ProQuad  when  compared  with  the  control  group  (5.8%  versus  4.7%, respectively). There were more subjects with fever rated as severe in the ProQuad as in the control groups. In Study 013 the intensity of fever was described to be moderate for 39.2% (55.4% mild) of subjects in the concomitant group but for only 27.9% in the nonconcomitant (69.9% mild) and only for 19.6% in the control group (76.1% mild ). It is also noted that when comparing all children (12-23months  of  age)  vaccinated  with  ProQuad  (first  dose)  higher  rates  of  fever  were  observed  in  older children.

The rate of measles-like rash was significantly higher (all children, 12-23 months, together) in recipients of ProQuad than in recipients of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine (3.0% versus 2.1%, respectively).

The  distribution  of  the  day  of  onset  of  the  upper  respiratory  infections,  the  average  duration,  the intensity  and  concurrent  adverse  experiences  were  similar  between  both  groups.  Although  it  is difficult to distinguish, nearly 95 % of the infections in both groups were considered not to be vaccine related.

However, 35,2% of the upper respiratory infections reported in recipients of ProQuad were not rated as mild in intensity. Even if there is no plausible biological explanation a significant difference was observed related to the rate of upper respiratory infections between both groups. Therefore, a followup observation is recommended.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Sixty-four  (64)  subjects  reported  one  or  more  serious  adverse  experience  during  the  42-day  safety follow-up period.

Thirteen (13 from 5731) of febrile seizures were reported among recipients of ProQuad and eight (8 from 1997) were reported among recipients of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (i.e  0.23%  ProQuad  versus  0.4%  measles,  mumps,  rubella  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine.  Thus, ProQuad appears to be less reactive with respect to febrile seizures compared to measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine.

In the ProQuad -group, five of the thirteen febrile seizures were classified as vaccine related, one is unknown. By day 12 postvaccination eight of the thirteen febrile seizures appeared. In the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine group, two of the eight febrile seizures were classified as vaccine related. By day 12 postvaccination six of the eight febrile seizures appeared.

Incidence rates of SAEs between treatment groups appear to be comparable; however, it is noted that the clinical studies were not powered to detect significant differences.

## · Laboratory findings

The  objective  of  the  sub-study  of  Studies  012  and  013  (Reference  P012C1)  was  to  determine  if subjects who developed measles-like rashes were more likely to have increased levels of circulating measles virus postvaccination with either a single dose of ProQuad or the concomitant administration of a single dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a single dose of varicella vaccine than subjects who did not develop a measles-like rash.

A total of 193 samples were tested for measles RT-PCR. Samples were collected between 5 and 44 days  postvaccination,  with  the  majority  of  both  RT-PCR  control  and  measles-like  rash  samples collected between 10 and 17 days postvaccination. Fifty-eight (58) samples were from subjects who developed  measles-like  rash  (45  from  subjects  who  received  ProQuad  and  13  from  subjects  who received measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine) and 135 samples were from RTPCR control subjects (69 from subjects who received ProQuad and 66 from subjects who received measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine).

Only  3  samples  (2/135  RT-PCR  control  and  1/58  measles-like  rash)  collected  at  ~5  to  20  days postvaccination were above the limit of quantitation for the RT-PCR assay. No conclusions can be drawn from this study. In wild-type measles infection, the peak of measles viremia occurs just prior to the rash onset and then falls rapidly during the next 2 to 3 days. This suggests that samples in this clinical trial may have been collected at a suboptimal time postvaccination because the samples were collected either after the onset of a measles-like rash, or after the time the peak in viremia might have been seen for subjects who donated a control sample.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Eleven subjects discontinued the studies due to adverse events.

There were no discontinuations due to serious AES in pivotal studies 009, 011, 012, 013 or 014.

The proportion of children  who  completed  participation  was  &gt;95% in  all  studies  except  Study 011 (89%) and 013 (93%).  Both these studies were conducted in 12-23 month old children and included the administration of a second dose, at a 3-month interval from the first one. The drop-out from the first  to  second  dose  was approximately 7% in Study 011, and 4% in Study 013. The Applicant has described the reasons for discontinuation reported for children who did not receive the second dose, of which 6 /76 subjects in Study 011 were discontinued due to a clinical adverse experiences; 3 of which reported clinical adverse experience(s) related to the study vaccine. One subject reported respiratory infection, a second subject reported fever, viral infection, and injection-site pain, and a third subject

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported measles/rubella-like rash. In Study 013 a total of 57 subjects (4.0%) discontinued the study, but not due to adverse events.

## · Post marketing experience

Since  the  marketing  of  M-M-R™II  vaccine  in  1978,  more  than  446  million  doses  of  vaccine  have been  distributed  worldwide.  Postlicensure  experience  with  measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine collected  through  passive  reporting  of  spontaneous  adverse  experiences  to  Merck  &amp;  Co.,  Inc.  has confirmed the excellent safety profile of the vaccine, with a very low frequency of reported serious adverse reactions. This is demonstrated by the overall AE reporting rate of 2.87 reports per 100,000 doses  distributed,  and  the  serious  AE  reporting  rate  of  0.61  serious  reports  per  100,000  doses  of measles,  mumps  and  rubella  vaccine  distributed  worldwide.  The  most  frequently  reported  serious adverse  recations  are  pyrexia,  febrile  convolution,  convolutions  NOS  (new  onset  seizures),  autism (published literature  reports  have  found  no  scientific  basis  for  a  casual  relationship  between  autism and vaccination with a combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) and rashes.

Since  the  marketing  of  varicella  vaccine in  1995,  over  45  million  doses  of  vaccine  have  been distributed.  Post-licensure  experience  with  varicella  vaccine collected  through  passive  reporting  of spontaneous adverse experiences to Merck &amp; Co., Inc. and to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has confirmed that varicella vaccine has an excellent safety profile and is generally well  tolerated  with  a  very  low  frequency  of  serious  adverse  experiences  in  all  age.  This  is demonstrated  by  the  overall  rate  of  31.5  reports  per100.00  doses  distributed,  and  the  serious  AE reporting rate of 1.4 serious reports per 100.00 doses of varicella vaccine distributed worldwide. The most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  are  varicella,  pyrexia,  abortion  spontateous  and induced, convolutions and herpes zoster.

Selected adverse reactions reported to VAERS for Varicella vaccines during 1995-1998 were: rash, injection site reaction, HZ, pharyngitis, cellulites, hepatic pathology, pneumonia, erythema multiforme,  arthropathy,  thrombocytopenia,  anaphylaxis,  vasculitis,  aplastic  anemia,  neuropathy, convulsion, ataxia, encephalopathy and meningitis. A recent description of a 4-year old girl with an ischemic stroke two weeks after receiving varicella vaccine has also been reported.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The incidence of adverse reactions with ProQuad did not differ dramatically from the simultaneous use of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine + varicella vaccine. The number of subjects with erythema and rashes at the injection-site, with measles like rashes, with upper respiratory infections and with fever increased. Statistically significant difference in the number of vaccine-related SAEs could not be found,  although  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  elevated  temperature  following  the  administration  of ProQuad may lead to an increase in the incidence of postvaccination febrile seizures.

Although no other safety issue is expected after the use of ProQuad, it should be mentioned that no investigations were made with children at the age of 24 - 47 month and 7 to12 years.

Postmarketing  experience  with  varicella  vaccine suggests  that  transmission  of  the  varicella  vaccine virus  may  occur,  rarely,  between  healthy  vaccine  recipients  who  develop  a  varicella-like  rash  and healthy susceptible contacts. Therefore, recipients of ProQuad must try to avoid, whenever, possible, contact with susceptible high-risk individuals (e.g., newborns, pregnant women, immunocompromised persons) for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. This has been has been adequately reflected in the SPC (4.4 Special warnings and precautions)

The  Applicant  has  agreed  to  further  evaluate  the  occurrence  of  rare  adverse  events  following administration of ProQuad in a post-marketing follow-up study. The primary objective of this intended study  will  be  to  evaluate  rates  of  medically-attended  (i.e.,  resulting  in  a  medical  encounter)  febrile convulsions  associated  with  the  administration  of  ProQuad.  In  addition  to  the  main  objective  of assessing the incidence of febrile convulsions, this study is also designed assess the general short-term

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(30  day)  safety  of  ProQuad  including  the  rate  of  respiratory  infections  in  children  12  months  to 12 years of age.

The  Applicant  has  also  agreed  to  evaluate  the  occurrence  of  rare  and  very  rare  events  in  older seronegative  children  (older  than  23  month)  that  are  vaccinated  for  first  time  in  a  post-marketing follow-up study.

In previous studies with children who received either one or two doses of varicella vaccine, subjects were observed for around 10 years. In these studies no evidence of an increasing risk of zoster has been found so far. On the other hand the short intervals between vaccination and HZ occurrence in several  patients  seem  consistent  with  the  intriguing  hypothesis  that  varicella  vaccine  might,  in  rare cases,  provoke  reactivation  of  latent  wild-type  VZV.  Whether  or  not  a  second  dose  of  varicella vaccine  can  trigger  similar  effects  cannot  be  answered  for  the  time  being  but  requires  long-term observation of varicella-vaccinated individuals. The Applicant has also agreed to carry out a long-term follow-up study to assess the risk of HZ in vaccinated individuals after the first and second varicella vaccination as well as in non-vaccinated individuals having experienced natural disease.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

The applicant has performed satisfactory readability testing of the product information.

## Quality

During  the  evaluation  of  ProQuad,  two  major  objections  were  identified.  These  concerned  the nomenclature used for the seed lot system and also the passage number for the varicella component. Satisfactory justification has been provided to resolve these concerns.

Other minor concerns have been adequately addressed, however, several commitments are made by the  applicant,  and  several  follow-up  measures  are  defined  to  provide  further  information  postapproval. In conclusion, all quality issues are resolved.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

No non-clinical data have been submitted for ProQuad. However, with respect to the actual stage of the  vaccine  development  -  after  extended  clinical  testing  of  the  vaccine  was  already  performed, requesting additional preclinical testing appears not to be justified.

## Efficacy

The two issues of major concern were identified in relation to clinical efficacy were:

1. Insufficient seroconversion rates and GMTs in relation to the varicella component after only a single dose of ProQuad. This is in contrast to the other ProQuad components (measles, mumps and rubella) for which efficacy is not different from well established trivalent measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.
2. Insufficient  efficacy  of  the  acellular  pertussis  component  FHA  of  the  DTPa  vaccine  when administered concomitantly with ProQuad

With respect to the first major concern, clinical evaluation of available scientific information on the applicant's  varicella  vaccine  component  (OKA/Merck  varicella  virus  vaccine  strain)  revealed  that regardless of the potency (plaque forming units/ml) a single dose of ProQuad is to be considered as a primary immunisation dose requiring a second dose of ProQuad (or monovalent varicella vaccine), 4 12 weeks after the first dose to complete the varicella vaccination course. A second dose of varicella vaccine  shifts  seroconversion  rates  in  terms  of  gpELISA  units ≥ 5  to  almost  100%  and  increases GMTs by a factor of 40 to 50. Most notably gpELISA units ≥ 5 according to the current knowledge is a good and widely accepted correlate for protection from disease over a period of at least 10 years. Section 4.2 of the SPC has now been appropriately worded highlighting that a second dose of varicella

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine should be administered to complete immunization against varicella disease, and this concern has now been satisfactorily addressed.

With respect to the second major concern the applicant's proposal to recommend concomitant use of ProQuad with other childhood vaccines was not substantiated by appropriate clinical data. Firstly, the applicant failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Pa component (FHA) of a DTPa vaccine when administered concomitantly with ProQuad. Secondly, the type of DTPa vaccine investigated does not adequately  reflect  the  more  complex  combination  vaccines  commonly  used  in  the  EU  such  as  the penta - and hexavalent DTPa containing vaccines. This concern has now been satisfactorily addressed by stating in section 4.5 of the SPC that: 'there are insufficient data to support use of ProQuad with other vaccines.'

## Safety

No major safety concerns were identified during the evaluation phase. The safety profile of ProQuad does  not  deviate  significantly  from  those  known  from  the  applicant's  measles,  mumps  and  rubella vaccine  and  monovalent  varicella  vaccine  administered  separately  or  concomitantly.  However,  a number of issues have been identified requiring further investigation in the post-marketing phase that the applicant has committed to put in place. These include:

- Safety of ProQuad in older, seronegative children
- Rate of febrile seizures following ProQuad vaccination
- Rate of respiratory infection following ProQuad vaccination
- Long-term  follow-up  studies  concerning  long  term  persistence  of  protective  post  vaccination antibodies to varicella and with special regard to an epidemiologically changing environment and the rate of break-through cases
- Long -term follow-up studies with special regard to the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in vaccinated individuals

## Different storage conditions of the lyophilized powder and the diluent

During the evaluation  of  ProQuad,  the  appropriateness  of  the  applicant's  approach  on  handling  the different storage conditions for the lyophilized powder and the diluent has been extensively discussed at the Biologics Working Party, the Vaccine Working Party and CHMP.

The diluent is supplied together with the lyophilized powder to avoid that the vaccine is reconstituted with the wrong diluent (e.g. 0.9% NaCl solution for injection) or with the wrong volume of diluent. It is believed that this risk outweighs the potential risk of incorrect use or error caused by the different storage conditions of the vaccine components.

As the components of ProQuad cannot be stored together, a link between the lyophilized powder and the  diluent  is  made  through  the  text  on  the  SPC,  labeling  and  package  leaflet,  including  a  clear reference to each other and specific recommendation of use/method of administration. This is not a self-administered  product  and  it  is  expected  that  reconstitution  and  administration  by  a  health  care professional according to the instructions ensures correct storage and use of the vaccine. In order to secure traceability of all the batches that have been shipped together and to maintain the link between active substance and diluent, the applicant will use a validated computerized system, which will assign a specific code for each combination that is shipped.

The applicant will also ensure that the expiry date of the diluent shipped with the active substance is at least equivalent to the expiry date of the active substance. If either component of the product has to be replaced (for ex. if a component has expired or if a component is missing) the applicant will provide a replacement of the complete product (active substance and diluent).

The applicant also pointed out that they currently market a frozen varicella vaccine presented in the same way as ProQuad on the Italian and US markets; in the US alone, over 40 million doses have been distributed  over  the  past  10  years  where  the  different  storage  conditions  have  been  implemented  in distribution centers, pharmacies, physician's practices and public health clinics. The CHMP considers that the distribution channels within the EU (e.g Italian ) are comparable to the US ones.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Taking into  account  the  above,  the  CHMP  concludes  that  the  company  has  provided  a  satisfactory justification  for  this  approach  and  has  implemented  appropriate  measures  to  ensure  the  safe  and correct use of the vaccine.

## Benefit/risk assessment

All major immunogenicity and safety concerns have been satisfactorily addressed and the Applicant has agreed on appropriate follow-up measures. The benefit/risk assessment is therefore considered to be favourable.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of ProQuad for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella in individuals from 12 months of age was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
