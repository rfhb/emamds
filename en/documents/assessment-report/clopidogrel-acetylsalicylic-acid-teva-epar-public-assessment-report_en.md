The active ingredients are combined from two separate granulates that are mixed together to form a monolithic tablet. In both tablet strengths, the percentage of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate granulate is the same, while the percentage of the acetylsalicylic granulate is proportional to the strength.

The choice of the formulation and manufacturing process is based on the manufacturer's experience with the mono-product clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate tablets and products containing acetylsalicylic acid. A

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

wet  granulation  process  with  ethanol  was  selected  for  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  while  dry granulation was selected for acetylsalicylic acid.

The physicochemical properties of the drug substance relevant for the drug product performance include polymorphism,  solubility  and  impurity  profile  of  the  active  substances.  The  polymorphic  form  of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate is not susceptible to change upon storage of the drug substance itself and during the manufacture of the tablets.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.

The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. The primary packaging is Al/Al blisters with desiccant, white HDPE bottles with PP child-resistant closure and desiccant and white HDPE multilayer bottles with PP child-resistant closure and desiccant .The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Manufacture of the product and process controls The manufacturing process consists of wet granulation of the clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate granulate, dry granulation of acetylsalicylic acid granulate, followed by final blending of both granulates and compression in one tablet. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for manufacture of immediate release tablets. Product specification The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and these include description (visual), identification (HPLC-DAD), dissolution (Ph. Eur., HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), water content (KF), microbial quality (Ph. Eur.) and colour identification. Batch analysis results are provided for four pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Stability of the product Medicinal product no longer authorised

Stability data on for four pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 12 months at intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Open container studies were also carried out at 25 ºC / 60% RH for 30 and 60 days. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, dissolution, related substances, water content and microbial quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.1. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamics

## Clopidogrel

Clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.

The mechanism of the antiplatelet action of clopidogrel is mediated through a metabolite, the structure of which has been identified during the process of regulatory assessment of the marketing authorization application of the Plavix file. This metabolite has been isolated and its structure characterized as a thiol derivative of 2 oxo clopidogrel. In vitro, in the absence of hepatic biotransformation no effect on platelet aggregation  by  clopidogrel  could  be  observed,  demonstrating  the  metabolite  associated  effect.  The pharmacological target of this active metabolite is a Gi2 coupled receptor designated as P2Y12. The molecular interaction between the clopidogrel active metabolite and the P2Y12 receptor consists in the formation of a disulfur bridge between the reactive thiol of the molecule and cysteine 97 of P2Y12, causing the  disruption  of  receptor  complexes  and  translocation  from  platelet  membrane  microdomains.  The activity of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation was appropriately evaluated in vitro and ex vivo. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) ASA inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2, an inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet. The pharmacological profile of ASA as a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor (both COX-1 and COX-2) has been extensively established. It is active in most conventional models of inflammation, irrespective of their different mechanisms. ASA has also been shown to be a peripheral  analgesic  and  antipyretic.  The  anti-thrombotic  activity  of  ASA  is  based  on  a  specific anti-platelet activity due to selective acetylation of thrombocyte COX-1 and on a fibrinolytic activity due to N-acetylation of fibrinogen. Clopidogrel/ASA combination The synergistic over potentiation obtained when ASA and clopidogrel are given in combination has been demonstrated  in  some  studies.  The  observed  additive  effect  strongly  suggests  that  the  combined inhibition of 1/ COX (and subsequently of thromboxane synthesis) by ASA and 2/ ADP receptors by clopidogrel can provide substantial protection against platelet aggregation and thrombosis at the site of endothelial injury, in humans. Secondary pharmacodynamics Secondary pharmacodynamic studies with the combination were not performed and are not requested in view of the extensive data available on the use of combined individual medicinal products at the dosage now being applied for in the Clopidogrel/ASA application. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Safety pharmacology

Safety pharmacology studies with clopidogrel did not reveal any relevant effect to the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal and renal systems.

The targets for toxicity of acetylsalicylic acid have been identified in nonclinical studies and clinical experience has put these findings into context.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional safety pharmacology studies in animals with the combination were not performed and are not required given the extensive clinical data available on the combined use of individual medicinal products at the dosage being applied for the combination.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

In summary, no preclinical pharmacology studies were conducted with the Clopidogrel/ASA formulation. The pharmacological features of Clopidogrel/ASA have been extensively studied. As there is no evidence to suggest a possible negative interaction between clopidogrel and ASA, this is considered acceptable.

2.2.2. Pharmacokinetics Clopidogrel The metabolism and disposition of clopidogrel were evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies performed in the mouse, rat, rabbit and baboons. The pharmacokinetics of ASA has been investigated in the rat (with some further limited data in the dog and monkey) and is largely documented in humans. Clopidogrel is well absorbed (at least 50%), and undergoes extensive metabolism. Twenty metabolites were identified. In all species, the primary biotransformation pathways consist of: hydrolysis of the ester function by carboxylesterases (leading to the formation of SR26334, the main circulating metabolite); sulfoxidation, oxidation of the tetrahydropyridine moiety, and glucuronidation of SR26334. The main metabolite found in plasma, the  carboxylic acid derivative (SR26334), is inactive. The peak plasma concentration of SR26334 was observed 1 to 2 hours after oral administration of clopidogrel in all the studied  animal  species.  The  active  thiol  metabolite  of  clopidogrel  isolated  following  incubation  of clopidogrel with hepatic microsomal fractions has not been detected in plasma. The binding of clopidogrel and SR26334 to plasma proteins was high (98% and 94% respectively) in all species and distributed widely in tissues. Radioactivity was slowly eliminated from the tissues, and in particular from arterial wall, thyroid gland, cartilage, skin and spleen. Transfer of the radioactivity to the developing foetus was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. The majority of radioactivity was excreted within 48 hours in all species. In lactating rats, clopidogrel and/or its metabolites levels in milk were 0.5 to 2.6 times higher than the maternal plasma levels. ASA After oral administration, ASA is rapidly absorbed to give appreciable concentrations in plasma even after 30 minutes before a gradual decline with conversion of ASA to salicylate. Both ASA and salicylate are rapidly and extensively distributed in body fluids (including breast milk). They are localized in excretory organs (liver and kidney) and glandular stomach and cross the placental barrier. ASA binds strongly to plasma proteins and may displace certain compounds including other acidic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or coumarins. The biotransformation of ASA proceeds in two steps. The first step is independent of dose and involves conversion to salicylate by pre-absorptive hydrolysis in the gut mucosa and a hepatic first-pass effect. The second step, the metabolic conversion of salicylate and subsequent formation of conjugates and their renal excretion, is dose-dependent. Salicyluric acid is the main and rate-limiting metabolite in humans. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Clopidogrel/ASA combination

The  PK  of  combined  Clopidogrel/ASA  has  not  been  addressed  in  dedicated  studies.  Based  on  the pharmacokinetic characteristics of clopidogrel and ASA and on the drug-drug interaction profiles of each of these drugs, no pharmacokinetic interactions between the 2 compounds are expected.

Both compounds are highly protein bound and undergo hepatic metabolism. Although these aspects might raise the possibility for pharmacokinetic interaction, this is expected to have been covered in the

clinical use, since the combined use of both compounds has been taking place already. Therefore, it is considered that there is no need for dedicated pharmacokinetic and interaction studies with the fixed dose combination.

## 2.2.3. Toxicology

## Single -dose toxicity

## Clopidogrel

The oral LD50 for Clopidogrel in rats is 620 (males; 2420 mg/kg) and 490 (females; 1910 mg/kg) times the  daily  recommended therapeutic dose in humans. The intravenous LD50 was 22 (males) and 17 (females) times lower. Similar results were obtained in mice. ASA The oral LD50 of ASA was 960 mg/kg for mice, 1430-1600 mg/kg for rats and 1075-1095 mg/kg for Guinea pig, around and about 100 to 200 times the daily recommended therapeutic dose in humans. In conclusions, oral single dose toxicity of both Clopidogrel and ASA is low. Repeat -dose toxicity Clopidogrel At repeated doses of 400 mg/kg/day Clopidogrel and higher, increased liver weight, associated with hypertrophy of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in centrolobular hepatocytes induced by an effect on hepatic enzymes, was observed. This was reflected in elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Based on liver weight, the NOEL was 27 mg/kg/day (rats) and 65 mg/kg/day (baboons), corresponding to an exposure of 7 times (rats) and more than 10 times (baboons) the recommended therapeutic dose in humans. ASA Repeat dose toxicity of ASA in rats with 200 mg/kg but not 50 mg/kg revealed increased liver weight without  histopathological  lesions.  No  morbidity  associated  with  gastric  erosions  and  ulceration  was detected. Nephrotoxicity (papillary necrosis, decrease in urinary concentration) could be induced after 40-83 weeks of treatment with 120-230 mg/kg/day. In mice, doses of 130-1270 mg/kg/day induced an overall severe deterioration of general condition, including hair loss, decreased litter size and a highly significantly shortening of survival time. ASA is stated to play a role in the Reye's syndrome; therefore, ASA should not be given to children younger than 12 years old. Epithelal  desquamation, hyperemia, local ulceration and/or gastric hemorrhage have been described caused by high doses of ASA in Guinea pigs, rats, dogs, humans and other species. Doses have not been specified  (Collier,  1969;  Adv  Pharmacol  Chemother  7,  333-405).  No  other  reports  of  spontaneous bleeding are available. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In conclusion, since the therapeutic dose for humans is significantly lower, the aforementioned toxic effects of both Clopidogrel and ASA are not relevant.

## Genotoxicity

## Clopidogrel

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clopidogrel  has  been  tested  in  a  range  of in  vitro and in  vivo genotoxicity  studies,  and  showed  no genotoxic activity.

## ASA

ASA did not show any evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in vitro . There are no reports on in vivo genotoxicity tests.

## Carcinogenicity

## Clopidogrel

The applicant provided adequate consumption data of Clopidogrel/ASA.  A marked effect of improved adherence to therapy of the fixed combination product on the environmental exposure of clopidogrel bisulfate and acetylsalicylic acid is not expected.

At doses of Clopidogrel of at least 25 times the human therapeutic dose, no carcinogenic effects were observed in rats after 104 weeks of treatment nor in mice after 78 weeks of treatment. ASA No carcinogenic effects of ASA could be demonstrated in mice after administration of 2 to 20 times the maximum tolerated clinical dose in mice for up to one year. Reproductive and developmental toxicity Clopidogrel At  doses  up  to  500  and  300  mg/kg/day  Clopidogrel,  no  teratogenic  or  foetotoxic effects  have  been reported. A slight delay of development of the offspring of treated lactating rats has been reported due to a direct toxic effect or an indirect effect (low palatability). ASA At doses of 130 mg/kg/day ASA, infertility rate reached 8 times (40.5 %) the control group in the 5 th generation of mice. The number of pups raised to weaning at 130 mg/kg/day reduced to one third the number raised by the controls and reduced dramatically with increasing dose (625-1270 mg/kg/day). In rabbits, at doses of 500 mg/kg for 24 h on day 8-9 or day 9-10 of pregnancy, ASA induces cleft lip. When administered at day 12-13, day 13-14 or day 13 alone, no increase of clefts of the secondary palate was observed. In rats, the NOEL of ASA was 80 mg/kg/d, which is around and about 10 times the therapeutic dose. In  conclusion,  Clopidogrel/ASA  should  not  be  given  during  pregnancy.  Breast  feeding  should  be discontinued during treatment. This is adequately addressed in the Product Information. 2.2.4. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Combination  products  of  Clopidogrel/ASA  are  marketed  for  several  years.  The  environmental  risk assessment  consisted  of  the  determination  of  the  PNEC  for  both  substances.  These  studies  were performed according to GLP. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2.5. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Referring to published studies in animals, in men and in vitro models, pharmacological and toxicological features of Clopidogrel/ASA are well known. Moreover, both compounds have been extensively used in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

humans in monotherapy as well as in combination. Following this and since there is no evidence to suggest negative interactions between Clopidogrel/ASA, no supplementary studies with the combination are required.

Taken  into  account  the  reproductive  toxicity  effects  arising  from  ASA  during  early  (embryofoetal malformation) and late pregnancy (dystocia and foetal death), it is indicated that Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid should not be used during pregnancy as a precautionary measure. This is appropriately indicated in section 4.6 of the SmPC. Further, since it is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human milk and since ASA is known to be excreted in human milk, breast-feeding should not be continued during treatment with Clopidogrel/ASA.

Concerning the environmental risk assessment, reliable data on consumption of Clopidogrel/ASA are provided to demonstrate that no increase in environmental exposure is expected. From non-clinical point of view, no further studies are asked. 2.2.6. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects In conclusion, referring to the low oral toxicity of Clopidogrel and ASA and to the extensive use of its combination  in humans, no further studies concerning pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology are asked. The non clinical data provided are considered adequate to support the clinical use. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a clinical syndrome of acute cardiac ischemia related to coronary artery disease (CAD). The ACS continuum representing ongoing myocardial ischemia or injury consists of unstable  angina  (UA),  non-ST-segment  elevation  myocardial  infarction  (NSTEMI),  and  STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

## GCP

In terms of pathology, ACS is commonly associated with rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and partial or complete thrombosis of the infarct-related artery. Approximately 90% of myocardial infarctions (MIs) result from an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. Plaque rupture and erosion are considered to be the major triggers for coronary thrombosis. Following plaque erosion or rupture, platelet activation and aggregation, coagulation pathway activation, and endothelial vasoconstriction occur, leading to coronary thrombosis and occlusion. ACS can also be produced by elevated demand in the presence of a high-grade fixed coronary obstruction, due to increased myocardial oxygen and nutrition requirements, such as those resulting from exertion, emotional  stress,  or  physiologic  stress  (e.g.,  from  dehydration,  blood  loss,  hypotension,  infection, thyrotoxicosis, or surgery). This  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  concerns  clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic  acid  tablets  containing clopidogrel (75 mg) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (75 mg or 100 mg). Clopidogrel / Acetylsalicylic acid Teva is a fixed dose combination formulated as a substitution therapy used in prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients already taking both clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). This is used for continuation of therapy in non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction) including patients undergoing a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  and  in  ST  segment  elevation  acute myocardial infarction in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. The use of a fixed-dose combination tablet instead of the individual administration of the two compounds is expected to be more convenient to patients (and thus to improve compliance) by limiting the number of tablets they need to take. The  clinical  development  program  consists  of  two  bioequivalence  studies  with  the  objective  to demonstrate the bioequivalence between Clopidogrel / Acetylsalicylic acid Teva 75/75 mg and 75/100 mg tablets  (Teva  Pharmaceutical  Industries  Ltd.,  Israel)  and  the  free  combination  of  clopidogrel  and acetylsalicylic acid .

2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics 2.3.2.1. Background information · Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral doses; absorption appears to be at least 50%. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolised in the liver, mainly to its inactive carboxylic acid derivative and its active metabolite, clopidogrel thiol. Clopidogrel and its carboxylic acid metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively) in a nonsaturable manner at concentrations ≤ 100 mg/l The  elimination  half-life  of  the  carboxylic  acid  metabolite  is  about  7-8  hours  after  single-dose  and repeated daily administration of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel and its metabolites are excreted in urine and in faeces; about 50% of an oral dose is recovered from the urine and about 46% from the faeces. · Acetylsalicylic acid Acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly absorbed after oral doses. Following oral administration acetylsalicylic acid is partially hydrolised to salicylate during absorption by esterases in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Following absorption unhydrolised acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly and almost completely hydrolysed by esterases principally in the liver but also in plasma, erythrocytes and synovial fluid. Salicylic acid is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism; the metabolites include salicyluric acid, the ether or phenolic glucuronide, the ester or acyl glucuronide, gentisic acid, and other hydroxybenzoic acids ASA is poorly bound to serum proteins (up to 33%) and binding of salicylic acid to plasma proteins depends on the concentration - it is 90-95% at concentrations of around 100 μg/mL (which is around 2-fold higher than achieved with oral ASA doses of up to 325 mg) and decreases at higher concentrations. Elimination of ASA is almost exclusively by hydrolysis to salicylic acid (around 1% of ASA dose is excreted unhydrolyzed by the kidney) and starts already in the gut wall. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Elimination of acetylsalicylic acid is a first-order process at concentrations in the range between 100-300 μg/mL with a half-life of around 2- 3 hours.

Acetylsalicylic acid inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of prostaglandin cyclo oxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2, an inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet.

Safety data A total of 77 post-dose adverse events were reported by 26 of the 60 subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication (safety population). All the 77 post-dose adverse events reported were graded as mild. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of the trial. Pharmacokinetic Conclusion From  these  results,  it  can  be  concluded  that  Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic  Acid  75/75  mg  tablets  are bioequivalent to the concomitant administration of ASS gamma® 75 mg tablets tablets and Plavix® 75 mg tablets as well as Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic Acid 75/100 mg tablets are bioequivalent to Aspirin® N 100 mg tablets and Plavix® 75 mg tablets, with respect to rate and extent of absorption. 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics Repeated doses of clopidogrel 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP induced platelet aggregation from the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was between 40% and 60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, generally within 5 days after treatment was discontinued. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.4. Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This application concerns a fixed dose combination of clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and the following strengths are proposed for this FDC: clopidogrel/ASA 75mg/75mg and 75mg/100mg. In this context, two bioequivalence studies were conducted.

Both  bioequivalence  studies  were  identical  in  design  and  consist  in  an  open-label,  randomized, four-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, single oral dose, crossover design under fasting conditions. The fasting state is acceptable since the mono-therapy products can be taken with or without food. The applicant chose to conduct a replicate design bioequivalence study: data from 4 periods were analysed for clopidogrel since it was expected to be highly variable, data from period 1 and 2 were analysed for salicylic acid and ASA.

The CURE study included 12,562 patients with non ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q wave myocardial infarction), and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischaemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischaemia or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. Patients were randomised to clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg/day, N=6,259) plus ASA (75 325 mg once daily) or ASA alone (N=6,303), (75 325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies. Patients were treated for up to one year. In CURE, 823 (6.6%) patients received concomitant GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy. Heparins were administered in

Bioequivalence was investigated for both strengths based on the clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid data. In the study with the lower strength the 90%CI for acetylsalicylic acid's Cmax around the point estimate was 110.34 - 127.59%, exceeding the standard bioequivalence range. The 90% confidence intervals around  the  point  estimate  of  AUCt  for  ASA  was  within  the  standard  bioequivalence  range.  It  was pre-specified in the protocol that ASA data would be analysed for information only. This approach is considered acceptable since ASA has an half-life less than 1 hour. Wider 90%CI for the Cmax of ASA has been previously  accepted  by  the  CHMP  during  the  authorisation  of  DuoCover/DuoPlavin  (fixed  dose combination of clopidogrel/ASA 75mg/100mg and 75mg/75mg). Based on these results, bioequivalence is considered as demonstrated between Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic Acid  75/75  mg  tablets  and  ASS  gamma®  75  mg  tablets  and  Plavix®  75  mg  tablets  and  between Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic Acid 75/100 mg tablets and Aspirin® N 100 mg tablets and Plavix® 75 mg tablets with respect to rate and extent of absorption under fasting conditions. The potential for PK interaction between clopidogrel and ASA has not been assessed in humans but is based on the PK characteristics of clopidogrel and ASA and on the drug-drug interaction profiles of each of these drugs.  The potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between clopidogrel and ASA is deemed unlikely. ASA and clopidogrel have a synergistic antiplatelet effect as both affect platelet aggregation by different mechanisms, thus the combination is well justified. The mechanism of action of both substances are well known. The Applicant provides a thorough bibliographic review on the pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel and ASA. There are no outstanding issues on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 2.4. Clinical efficacy The efficacy of clopidogrel plus ASA have been evaluated in three double blind studies involving over 61,900 patients: the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies, comparing clopidogrel plus ASA to ASA alone, both treatments given in combination with other standard therapy.

more than 90% of the patients and the relative rate of bleeding between clopidogrel plus ASA and ASA alone was not significantly affected by the concomitant heparin therapy.

The  number  of  patients  experiencing  the  primary  endpoint  [cardiovascular  (CV)  death,  myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 719 (11.4%) in the ASA group, a 20% relative risk reduction (RRR) (95% CI of 10% 28%; p=0.00009) for the clopidogrel plus ASA group [17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% when they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent and 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)]. New cardiovascular events (primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% (CI: 12.8, 46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0 1, 1 3, 3 6, 6 9 and 9 12 month study intervals, respectively. Thus, beyond 3 months of treatment, the benefit observed in the clopidogrel plus ASA group was not further increased, whereas the risk of haemorrhage persisted (see section 4.4).

The CLARITY trial included 3,491 patients presenting within 12 hours of the onset of a ST elevation MI and planned for thrombolytic therapy. Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg/day, n=1,752) plus ASA or ASA alone (n=1,739), (150 to 325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, heparin. The patients were followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the composite of an occluded infarct related artery on the predischarge angiogram, or death or recurrent MI before coronary angiography. For patients who did not undergo angiography, the primary endpoint was death or recurrent myocardial infarction by Day 8 or by hospital discharge. The patient population included 19.7% women and 29.2% patients ≥ 65 years. A total  of  99.7%  of  patients  received  fibrinolytics  (fibrin  specific:  68.7%,  non-fibrin  specific:  31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, 54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins.

The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the need for thrombolytic therapy (RRR = 43.3%; CI: 24.3%, 57.5%) and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (RRR = 18.2%; CI: 6.5%, 28.3%). The  number  of  patients  experiencing  the  co  primary  endpoint  (CV  death,  MI,  stroke  or  refractory ischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the ASA group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6% 21%, p=0.0005) for the clopidogrel plus ASA group. This benefit was mostly driven by the statistically significant reduction in the incidence of MI [287 (4.6%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 363 (5.8%) in the ASA group]. There was no observed effect on the rate of rehospitalisation for unstable angina. The results obtained in populations with different characteristics (e.g. unstable angina or non Q wave MI, low to high risk levels, diabetes, need for revascularisation, age, gender, etc.) were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. In particular, in a post hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the total CURE  population)  who  underwent  stent  placement  (Stent  CURE),  the  data  showed  that  clopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for the co primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second co primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia). Moreover, the safety profile of clopidogrel in this subgroup of patients did not raise any particular concern. Thus, the results from this subset are in line with the overall trial results. In patients with acute ST segment elevation MI, safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 2 randomised, placebo controlled, double blind studies, CLARITY and COMMIT.

Fifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 21.7% in the group treated with ASA alone reached the primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36% odds reduction in favor of clopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p &lt;0.001), mainly related to a reduction in occluded infarct related arteries. This benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups including patients' age and gender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 2x2 factorial design COMMIT trial included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of suspected MI with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e. ST elevation, ST depression or left bundle-branch block). Patients received clopidogrel (75 mg/day, n=22,961) plus ASA (162 mg/day), or ASA alone (162 mg/day) (n=22,891), for 28 days or until hospital discharge. The co primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re infarction, stroke or death. The population included 27.8% women, 58.4% patients ≥ 60 years (26% ≥ 70 years) and 54.5% patients who received fibrinolytics.

Clopidogrel plus ASA significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p = 0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p = 0.002), representing an absolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was consistent across age, gender and with or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours.

2.4.1. Discussion and conclusions on clinical efficacy Clopidogrel / Acetylsalicylic acid Teva is a fixed dose combination formulated as a substitution therapy used in prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients already taking both clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). This is used for continuation of therapy in non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction) including patients undergoing a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  and  in  ST  segment  elevation  acute myocardial infarction in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. The combined use of these active substances can be considered well recognised and adequately demonstrated. The review on the available efficacy data proves that clopidogrel and ASA both decrease vascular events and each component apart contributes to this effect. The most important trials are CURE, CLARITY-TIMI and COMMIT.  The applicant provided adequate information supporting the efficacy of the combination and its use in combination as a fixed-dose combination tablet instead of the individual administration of the two compounds. The combination clopidogrel/ASA is expected to be more convenient to patients and thus to improve compliance by limiting the number of tablets they need to take. 2.5. Clinical safety Summary of the safety profile Clopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in clinical studies, including over 30,000 patients treated with clopidogrel plus ASA, and over 9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant adverse reactions observed in four major studies, the CAPRIE study (a study comparing clopidogrel alone to ASA) and the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies (studies comparing clopidogrel plus ASA to ASA alone) are discussed below. Overall clopidogrel 75 mg/day was similar to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of age, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Bleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in the post-marketing experience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment.

In CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding was 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was similar for clopidogrel and ASA.

In CURE there was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel plus ASA within 7 days after coronary bypass graft surgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery. In patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

who  remained  on  therapy  within  five  days  of  bypass  graft  surgery,  the  event  rate  was  9.6%  for clopidogrel plus ASA, and 6.3% for placebo plus ASA.

In CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel plus ASA group vs. the group taking ASA alone. The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups. This was consistent across  subgroups  of  patients  defined  by  baseline  characteristics,  and  type  of  fibrinolytic  or  heparin therapy.

In COMMIT, the overall rate of noncerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar in both groups.

## 2.4.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Clopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in clinical studies, including over 30,000 patients treated with clopidogrel plus ASA, and over 9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant adverse reactions observed in four major studies, the CAPRIE study (a study comparing clopidogrel alone to ASA) and the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies (studies comparing clopidogrel plus ASA to ASA alone) are discussed above. Overall clopidogrel 75 mg/day was similar to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of age, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

Bleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in the post marketing experience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. In CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding was 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was similar for clopidogrel and ASA. In CURE there was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel plus ASA within 7 days after coronary bypass graft surgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery. In patients who  remained  on  therapy  within  five  days  of  bypass  graft  surgery,  the  event  rate  was  9.6%  for clopidogrel plus ASA, and 6.3% for placebo plus ASA. In CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel plus ASA group vs. the group taking ASA alone. The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups. This was consistent across  subgroups  of  patients  defined  by  baseline  characteristics,  and  type  of  fibrinolytic  or  heparin therapy. In COMMIT, the overall rate of non cerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar in both groups. 2.4.2. Conclusions on clinical safety The combined use of these active substances can be adequately demonstrated and well known. The most important safety problem is bleeding. This is linked with the mechanism of action of both substances. Another problem is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. It has been estimated that there are about four cases in every million patients. Both the safety of ASA and Clopidogrel have been well analysed in the bibliographic review provided in support of this application. No new safety studies have been performed which is considered acceptable. 2.6. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clopidogrel / Acetylsalicylic acid Teva is a fixed dose combination formulated as a substitution therapy used in prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients already taking both clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). This is used for continuation of therapy in non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction) including patients undergoing a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  and  in  ST  segment  elevation  acute myocardial infarction in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most important trials are  CURE,  CLARITY-TIMI and COMMIT.  The applicant provided adequate information  supporting  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  and  its  use  in  combination  as  a  fixed-dose combination  tablet  instead  of  the  individual  administration  of  the  two  compounds.  The  combination clopidogrel/ASA is expected to be more convenient to patients and thus to improve compliance by limiting the number of tablets they need to take.

In the CURE trial, the number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 719 (11.4%) in  the  ASA  group,  a  20%  relative  risk  reduction  (RRR)  (95%  CI  of  10%  28%;  p=0.00009)  for  the clopidogrel plus ASA group. New cardiovascular events (primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% (CI: 12.8, 46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0 1, 1 3, 3 6, 6 9 and 9 12 month study intervals, respectively.

-In patients with non ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non Q wave myocardial infarction): The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data support use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months (see section 5.1). If the use of the combination of clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid is discontinued, patients may benefit with continuation of one antiplatelet medicinal product.

In the CLARITY trial, fifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 21.7% in the group treated with ASA alone reached the primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36% odds reduction in favor of clopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p &lt;0.001), mainly related to a  reduction  in  occluded  infarct  related  arteries.  This  benefit  was  consistent  across  all  prespecified subgroups including patients' age and gender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used. In the COMMIT trial, Clopidogrel plus ASA significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p = 0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p = 0.002), representing an absolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was consistent across age, gender and with or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours. The  combined  use  of  these  active  substances  can  be  considered  well  recognised  and  adequately demonstrated. This fixed combination can improve the compliance because patients will have to take only one tablet instead of two. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects The efficacy of clopidogrel /ASA has been evaluated in three double blind studies involving over 61,900 patients: the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies, comparing clopidogrel plus ASA to ASA alone, both treatments given in combination with other standard therapy. There is still uncertainty if the beneficial effects are maintained on the very long term which was not tested in clinical trials. The efficacy of clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid in children and adolescents under 18 years old have not been  established.  The  combination  of  clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic  acid  is  not  recommended  in  this population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-In patients with ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: Therapy should be started as early  as  possible  after  symptoms  start  and  continued  for  at  least  four  weeks.  The  benefit  of  the combination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied in this setting. If the use of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the combination of clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid is discontinued, patients may benefit with continuation of one antiplatelet medicinal product.

Therapeutic experience is limited in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.

Therapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses.

## Risks

Unfavourable effects Bleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in the post marketing experience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. Another problem is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. It has been estimated that there are about four cases in every million patients. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Clopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in clinical studies, including over 30,000 patients treated with clopidogrel plus ASA, and over 9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. There is still uncertainty about the safety on the very long term which was not tested in clinical trials. The safety of clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid in children and adolescents under 18 years old have not been established. The combination of clopidogrel/acetylsalicylic acid is not recommended in this population. Therapeutic experience is limited in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Therapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses. Balance The favourable effect of clopidogrel/ASA to prevent ischaemic events outweighs the risk of bleeding. Bleeding can be limited by excluding high risk patients and careful monitoring during treatment. Ischaemic events cause irreversible damage. Benefit-risk balance The benefit/risk balance is positive.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment

A fixed dose combination of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel is proposed for a substitution indication in secondary cardiovascular prevention. Both individual components have been used long-term in this indication.

The  company  provides  an  overview  of  the  use  of  both  components  of  the  proposed  fixed  dose combination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In combination, both components exhibit superior efficacy compared to each component alone. This superior efficacy is counterbalanced by an increased risk of bleeding. In balance, it is generally accepted that patients at high cardiovascular risk benefit from the combination. This is established in a number of large scale trials (e.g. CURE, COMMIT and CLARITY) and a meta-analysis of use of the combination. The combination is recommended in current guidelines of the European Cardiologic Society (ECS) on Acute Coronary Syndrome. The proposed SmPC reflects this long-standing experience.

Both components are well known with respect to their safety profile.

4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Teva in the prevention of atherothrombotic events  in  adult  patients  already  taking  both  clopidogrel  and  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA).
