| WS/0877            | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add administration by subcutaneous (s.c.) route in addition to the intravenous (i.v.) route in treatment of anaemia in patients with chronic renal failure based on clinical study HX575-308 (SENSE) to address MEA 024.1. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC and to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet for Abseamed and Binocrit and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.1. Moreover, the updated RMP version 15 has been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/02/2016 | 30/03/2016 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | In patients with chronic renal failure where intravenous access is routinely available (haemodialysis patients) administration of Abseamed/Binocrit/ Epoetin alfa Hexal by the intravenous route is preferable. Where intravenous access is not readily available (patients not yet undergoing dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients) Abseamed/Binocrit/ Epoetin alfa Hexal may be administered as a subcutaneous injection. During the maintenance phase, Abseamed/Binocrit/ Epoetin alfa Hexal can be administered either 3 times per week, and in the case of subcutaneous administration, once weekly or once every 2 weeks. The maximum dosage should not exceed 150 IU/kg, 3 times per week, 240 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 20,000 IU) once weekly, or 480 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 40,000 IU) once every 2 weeks. Chronic renal failure patients treated with epoetin alfa by the subcutaneous route should be monitored regularly for loss of efficacy, defined as absent or decreased response to epoetin alfa treatment in patients who previously responded to such therapy. This is characterised by a sustained decrease in haemoglobin despite an increase in epoetin alfa dosage. |

| WS/0013 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This was an application for a type IB variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Section 2 of the Package Leaflet (PL) in order to implement the CHMP/PhVWP agreed wording for all erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) regarding the need to maintain patient medication records and the information concerning any modification to the ESA prescribed. The Package Leaflet has also been aligned with the SmPC with regards to wording on pure red cell aplasia in patients with hepatitis C. Minor linguistic changes were introduced to the Dutch, Greek and German annexes. The list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet was also updated. Additionally, minor changes to the product information were introduced. C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Changes with NO new additional data are submitted by the MAH | 22/07/2010 | 31/08/2010 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Two cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) occurred during a clinical study investigating erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), where anti-epoetin antibodies were detected. While investigations on the cause of PRCA in these cases are still ongoing, the CHMP and Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) considered it important that accurate medication histories are maintained for patients treated with epoetins, recording the trade name or the scientific name with the name of the manufacturer. It is recommended that the product information of all ESAs includes a request to maintain patient medication records. The scope of this variation is to implement the CHMP/PhVWP agreed wording for all erythropoiesis stimulating agents (class labelling) to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet of Abseamed/Binocrit/Epoetin Hexal, as requested by the CHMP. SmPC Section 4.4: Special warnings and precautions for use .\"In order to improve the traceability of erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs), the trade name of the administered ESA should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file.\" PL: Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: |

| II/0018   | This variation concerns an update of the SPC following the completion of a class safety review by the PhVWP and the CHMP. As a result, CHMP requested to update section 4.4 of the SPC to include more information on pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in patients with hepatitis C treated with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin and section 5.1 to include additional data on the Cochrane meta- analysis and the effects of epoetins in cancer patients. Minor linguistic and formatting changes have also been introduced. Furthermore, the contact details for the local representatives in France, Spain, Greece and Cyprus have been updated in the Package Leaflet. | 17/12/2009   | 20/01/2010   | SmPC and PL | As a result of the discussion of the updated risk management plans (RMPs) and the results of the Cochrane meta-analysis it was agreed at the PhVWP/CHMP meeting in September 2009 that all MAHs for epoetins should submit a type II variation to amend the summary of product characteristics (SPC). Information with respect to the results of the Cochrane meta-analysis on the effects of epoetins in cancer patients and to the occurrence of PRCA in patients with Hepatitis C treated with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin should be included into the SPC. The amendments of Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC have been implemented as recommended by the PhVWP / CHMP.

In patients with moderate anaemia undergoing major elective surgery accompanied by considerable blood loss, epoetin alfa can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood in a predonation program. Epoetin alfa treatment was shown to reduce the exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery.

However, in cancer patients with a reasonably long life-expectancy, the benefit of using epoetins does not outweigh the risk of tumour progression and shorter overall survival and therefore the Committee concluded that in these patients anaemia should be corrected with blood transfusions. The decision to administer epoetin-containing medicines should be based on an informed assessment of the benefits against the risks on individual basis, taking into account the type and stage of tumour, the degree of anaemia, the patient's life- expectancy, the environment in which the patient is being treated and patient preference. As a result, Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the Package Leaflet are being updated to reflect these conclusions by incorporating wording requested by CHMP for inclusion for all epoetins for which a cancer indication is   |

The safety review was initiated because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the |
