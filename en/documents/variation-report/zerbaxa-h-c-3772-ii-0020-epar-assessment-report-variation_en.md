As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance (sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6).

The applicant also took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in sections 5.2 of the SmPC and to bring Section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL in line with the latest Annex to the EC guideline on 'Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use'.

Version 2.1 of the RMP was also submitted.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0277/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0277/2017 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did seek scientific advice regarding the clinical developmental program for the pivotal phase 3 trial PN008 at the SAWP/CHMP in 2011 (procedure no: EMEA/H/SA/2182/1/2011/II) with follow-up clinical advice in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2182/1/FU/1/2016/II). The main issues for discussion with SAWP/CHMP regarding the pivotal phase 3 study were study objectives/endpoint, primary analysis population, the proposed eligibility criteria, comparator, non-inferiority margin, dose selection and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adjunctive therapy. An additional scientific advice regarding the toxico-pharmacological development and the non-clinical safety data package was also discussed in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2182/2/2016/I).

## Summary

Please refer to Scientific Discussion Zerbaxa-H-C-3772-II-20.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This application summarises the results from three Phase 1 studies ( PN018 , PN028 , PN007 ) and one pivotal Phase 3 study ( PN008 ) supporting the use of ceftolozane/tazobactam ( i.e. TOL/TAZ; also known as ZERBAXA TM , MK-7625A, CXA-201) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including both Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP, also known as HAP) and Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP, also known as VAP), in patients 18 years or older.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

## Introduction

ZERBAXA is a fixed dose combination product of ceftolozane (a cephalosporin antibiotic) and tazobactam (a well-established β-lactamase inhibitor); ZERBAXA is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of complicated genitourinary tract infections (cUTI) and intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). This application concerns an extension of indication to include treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) infections in adults.

The  currently  marketed  formulation  of  ZERBAXA  will  be  used,  which  contains  a  dose  of  1.5  g  (1  g ceftolozane/0.5 g tazobactam). The proposed 3 g dose (2 g TOL/1 g TAZ) to be used for the NP indication will be produced by using two vials. This injection will be required three times per day for a total daily dose of 6 g ceftolozane and 3 g tazobactam for a maximum duration of treatment of 14 days.

## Phase I analysis

The log of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Dow) of ceftolozane was determined to be -0.21 at pH 7.4, and for tazobactam -0.63 at pH 7.4.  As these values are well below 4.5, an evaluation for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was not conducted.

## PEC calculations

For the calculation of the PECsw values, the default Fpen was used to account for all indications. The DOSEai (maximum daily dose of active substance consumed) is 6000 mg/day for ceftolozane and 3000 mg/day for tazobactam.

- -The PECsw for ceftolozane was calculated to be 30.0 µg/L, which is above the threshold of 0.01 µg/L and therefore a phase II risk assessment is provided.
- -The PECsw for tazobactam was calculated to be 15.0 µg/L, which is above the threshold of 0.01 µg/L and therefore a phase II risk assessment is provided.

## Phase II

Phase II studies were conducted and assessed in the previous application in 2014.

PEC and RQ values have now been updated for surface water, groundwater and wastewater treatment facilities, based on a maximum daily dose of 6 g ceftolozane and 3 g tazobactam (see table). All RQs for Tazobactam are under the threshold of 1, indicating no risk to the environment. For Ceftolozane a risk for surface water is indicated, which is investigated further in Tier B.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  are  not  readily  biodegradable,  however,  tazobactam  did  not significantly shift to the sediment, and a Tier B assessment was not necessary. For ceftolozane a Tier B for sediment was conducted, by means of an OECD 218 study (sediment-water chrironomid toxicity using spiked sediment) which did not indicate a risk when the updated PEC  values were used in the risk calculation.

In the Tier B the PECsurfacewater for ceftolozane was refined using consumption data for the period 19/03/2018-18/03/2019  in  Europe.  These  consumption  data  were  extrapolated  to  include  the  new indication and higher maximum dose:

- -Consumption ceftolozane in 2018/2019: 2,359,004 g/yr.
- -Extrapolated DDD (old indication) 3* 1 g/day = 7,077,012 g
- -Extrapolated DDD (new indication) 3* 2 g/day = 14,154,024 g
- -Projected consumption: 21,231,036 g/yr = 21,231,036,000 mg/yr
- -DDD: 6000
- -Inhabitants Europe: 5.03 x 10 8

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

An Fpen of 0.002 results in a PECsurfacewater of 5.8 µg/L and a corresponding RQ of 3.9. This ratio indicates a potential risk to the environment.

Based on the currently available information, the SmPC for ZERBAXA includes the following statement:

One  of  the  active  ingredients,  ceftolozane,  may  have  harmful  effects  if  it  reaches  the  aquatic environment. Do not throw away any unused medicinal product or waste material via wastewater. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local requirements. These measures will help protect the environment.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The updated data submitted in this application lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of ceftolozane and tazobactam.

Considering the above data, ceftolozane and tazobactam should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

A comprehensive clinical pharmacology program was conducted to support the original application of TOL/TAZ for cUTI and cIAI indications at the TOL/TAZ 1.5 g q8h dose. Nine phase 1 studies evaluated the safety, PK, effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, tissue distribution (ELF PK), and effect on QTc interval of TOL/TAZ. The studies cover a dose range that included the proposed 3 g dose for the NP indication. Additional  studies  ( PN018 , PN007 , PN008 )  have  been  completed  since  the  original  cIAI/cUTI application to provide data to support the new adult NP indication and dose regimen (3g q8h). Also, four popPK modelling and ER analysis reports have been submitted in the current application:

- -popPK analysis for TOL/TAZ in adults with ventilated NP ( 050zc7 ),
- -popPK analysis for TOL/TAZ for CXA-ICU-14-01 ( 050w2j ),
- -popPK modelling and simulation to support paediatric dose selection for TOL/TAZ ( 04kb9q ), and
- -ER analysis for TOL/TAZ in adult patients with ventilated NP ( 050zc9 ).

The current commercial formulation will be used for the NP indication by reconstituting two 1.5 g vials to make an infusion solution containing the intended 3 g dose of TOL/TAZ. Single agent or commercial TOL/TAZ formulations were used in the three new clinical studies. As the TOL and TAZ powder was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reconstituted into clear solution and infused intravenously, similar in vivo performance was anticipated for each component regardless of formulation. This enabled pooling of PK data across studies to fully characterise the PK profile and assess factors affecting TOL and TAZ PK using a population PK (popPK) modeling approach.

## CHMP's comment

A  paediatric  indication  for  Zerbaxa  is  not  pursued  at  this  stage.  Hence,  the  popPK  model  report concerning selection of paediatric dose in cUTI and cIAI has not been assessed.

## Methods

## Analytical methods

## Validated analytical methods

LC-MS/MS  methods  validated  in  accordance  with  applicable  regulatory  guidance  were  used  for  the determination of TOL, TAZ, and TAZ M1 metabolite in biological matrices. Colorimetric methods were used to determine urea in plasma and ELF. Methods are listed in Table 1. The methods MN10131 (TOL) and MN14014 (TOL+TAZ, TAZM1) were developed and validated to support the studies in the original submission. New analytical LC methods were developed and validated for the determination of:

- -TOL (MN09055) and TAZ/ TAZ M1 metabolite (MN08036) in urine (study PN018) ,
- -TOL (MN10120) and TAZ (MN14114) in epithelial lining fluid, ELF (study PN007 ),
- -urea (MN14016) in plasma (study PN007 ), and
- -urea (MN14017) in ELF (study PN007 ).

Primarily,  isotopically  labelled  internal  standards  (TOL,  TAZ  M1)  were  used.  Sulbactam  was  internal standard for TAZ in ELF and plasma. Satisfactory between- and within-run accuracy and precision were shown for LLOQ, low, medium and high QC sample concentrations. Dilution integrity was demonstrated. Stability in matrixes at room temperature, -20°C and -70°C, and over a number of freeze-thaw cycles have been determined.

## Acceptance criteria of analytical runs

Bioanalysis were performed. Inter-run accuracy and precision data for each trial are given in Table 2. ISR assessments were conducted for plasma and urine analyses in studies PN007 , PN008 , and PN018 . All ISR assessment met acceptance criteria. Most clinical samples were analysed within the established stability period of the analysis.

## Pharmacokinetic data analysis

In general, the PK data analyses were performed using non-compartmental analysis (Phoenix WinNonlin software version 6.3 or later). Standard statistical methods were used, including ANOVA analysis for comparisons to assess potential ethnicity differences in PK in study 018.

050ZC7: All exploratory data analyses and presentations of data were performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), KIWI Version 2 (Cognigen Corporation, Buffalo, NY), and PsN Version 4.4.0 (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden). PopPK modeling was performed using the computer program NONMEM, Version 7, Level 3.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD). NONMEM analyses were performed on an Intel cluster with the Linux operating system. The first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCE-I) was used for the model development.

## Evaluation and qualification of models

## popPK model 050zc7

## Methodology

To evaluate the PK of TOL and TAZ in NP patients, the previously developed popPK models were refined by including PK data from studies PN008 (ventilated NP patients), PN013 (MK-7625A-013, Japanese cIAI patients) and PN014 (MK-7625A-014, Japanese cUTI patients), whereas PK data from the paediatric study CXA-PEDS-13-08 were excluded.

## Objectives ( 050zc7 )

- -Refine the popPK models for TOL and TAZ using data from PN008 , PN013 and PN014 ,
- -evaluate the effect of pneumonia/other infections on the plasma PK parameters of TOL&amp;TAZ,
- -perform stochastic simulations to estimate individual plasma and ELF exposures and calculate the probability of target attainment (PTA) for TOL&amp;TAZ in patients with NP, and
- -support TOL/TAZ dose regimen justification in adult patients with NP.

## Model development process

2-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order elimination was selected as a starting point for the base model development. Forward selection, backward elimination was used in the covariate analysis. An exponential variance model was used for IIV and a proportional variance model was used for RV. The IIV error model was further refined by estimating an additive plus constant coefficient of variation form. During model refinement, the TOL and TAZ models were evaluated for the effect of ESRD on CL and Vc, model sensitivity to identified outliers, and the effect of sparse data on the estimation of IIV in Vp (for TOL only).

## Dataset

Two single agent (TOL) phase 1 studies ( CXA-101-01 , -101-02 ), nine Phase 1 trials ( CXA-201-01 , -201-  02 , -MD-1107 , -QT-10-02 ,  -ELF-10-03 ,  -REN-11-01 (incl.  six  patients  receiving  HD), -DDI-12- 10 , -EB-13-05 , and PN007 ), two Phase 2 studies ( CXA-IAI-10-01 , -101-03 , the latter TOL single agent), and three Phase 3 trials ( PN013 , PN014 and PN008 ).

TOL: Presumably a total of 8680 plasma concentrations from 987 subjects. Following data cleaning, 8330 (96%) observations from 968 (98%) subjects remained, including 1481 sparse observations from 305 NP patients ( PN008 ). The final dataset also consisted of 47 ELF concentrations from 47 subjects.

TAZ: Presumably a total of 6144 plasma concentrations from 854 subjects. Following data cleaning 5679 (92.4%) observations and 835 (97.8%) subjects remained, including 1455 sparse PK samples from 305 NP patients ( PN008 ). The final dataset also consisted of 42 ELF concentrations from 42 subjects.

In the overall pooled final dataset for TOL, median (range) for age, weight, and baseline CrCL was 56 years (18-98), 73.35 kg (33.5-173) and 102.9 mL/min (6.30 to 531.3). In study PN008 , the median (range) for age, weight, and baseline CrCL was 62.0 years (18 to 98), 80 kg (42 to 150.1), and 110.4 mL/min (14.9 to 531.3), respectively, and the majority (84.6%) were whites. Demographics for the TAZ population were similar.

TOL/TAZ was administered as a 60 minute infusion in all studies. TOL (0.25-3 g) and TAZ (0.25-1.5g) were given either alone or as a TOL/TAZ combination. Single or combined agents were given as a single dose or as multiple doses (q6h, q8h, q12h, or QD). In PN008 TOL/TAZ was administered according to renal function (≥30 mL/min) using the dose regimen proposed in the SmPC. A combination of rich (eleven phase 1 studies) and sparse (all phase 2 and 3 studies) PK sampling were performed. In study PN008 sampling was performed at four time points on Day 4: end of infusion, 0.5-1.5, 2.5-3.5 and 5.0-6.0 hours post infusion.

Data  missingness :  BLQ  data  were  excluded:  5.21%  and  23.25%  of  TOL  and  TAZ  observations, respectively, were BLQ. The majority of BLQs were 15 hours (5.09%, TOL) or 5 hours (22.93%, TAZ) post-dose.

Outliers : Outliers were defined as [TOL]plasma &gt; 450 µg/mL, [TAZ]plasma &gt;130 µg/mL, |CWRESI|≥6 for both TOL and TAZ, and were retained in the datasets but excluded during the model development process in the NONMEM control streams  ( i.e. N=23, N=23, N=33, N=12 observations excluded, respectively). Outliers were considered included in the final model dataset.

## Assumptions

Baseline covariates were assumed to be constant. Other assumptions were not explicitly stated.

## Co-variate considerations

Covariates evaluated were body weight (BW, kg), race (white, Japanese, and other), infection type (cIAI, cUTI, pneumonia, other infection and healthy), CrCL (Cockcroft and Gault formula, mL/min). Critically ill adult patients in Group 2 from study PN007 were included in the other infection category. Covariate correlation (|r|&gt;0.6) was examined prior to covariate analysis.

## Diagnostics/GoF evaluation

Objective function value (forward inclusion ΔOFV ≥ 6.64 [ α =0.01, df1], backward elimination ΔOFV ≥ 10.83 [ α =0.01, df1]), convergence, adequate precision (%RSE), DV vs. PRED/IPRED, CWRES vs. PRED, IWRES  vs.  IPRED,  IIV  (Δ%IIV  ≥5%),  and  RV  for  specified  vs.  comparator  model,  pcVPC  (1000 simulations), unexplained IIV vs. all covariates, delta plots etc.

## Simulations to support dose recommendations in special populations and for PTA analysis

Individual model-based empiric Bayesian parameter estimates (EBE) were used to simulate individual PK profiles  for  subjects  included  in  the  analysis  datasets  ( PN008 ).  The  relevant  parameters  from  the previously developed PK models for lung penetration of TOL/TAZ ( 050w2j ) were combined with the simulated plasma concentrations (using model 050cz7 ) to stochastically simulate ELF concentration-time profiles in patients with NP. Lung penetration of TOL/TAZ was described using a hypothetical  linked  compartment  model,  where  drug  disposition  between  the  central  and  ELF compartments was described using K1E and KE0 (Figure 1). The linked model assumes that the amount of drug transferred to the ELF compartment is negligible and does not affect plasma disposition.

Using  a  virtual  demographic  dataset,  stochastic  simulations  of  plasma  and  ELF  concentrations  were performed to support dose justification for patients with NP and varying degrees of renal function, based on CrCL (N=1000 for each subgroup): accelerated renal clearance (ARC) (≥ 210 mL/min, 180 mL/min to &lt; 210 mL/min and 150 mL/min to &lt; 180 mL/min), normal renal function (80 mL/min to &lt;150 mL/min), mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (50 mL/min to &lt; 80 mL/min, 30 mL/min to ≤ 50 mL/min and 15 mL/min to ≤ 29 mL/min, resp ectively), and ESRD (&lt;15 mL/min or on HD). Correlation between CrCL and body weight in the pooled demographic dataset was graphically compared with that in study PN008 , and was found generally comparable. Unexplained IIV and residual error components of the final model were retained in the simulations performed.

A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of varying magnitudes of IIV in K1E on ELF PTA by: 1) assuming the estimated value, 2) restricting the distribution of eta in K1E to the estimated range and 3) fixing IIV in K1E to zero.

The effect of haemodialysis (HD) on CL, Vc, IIV in CL, and IIV in Vc, determined in a separate analysis ( CXA-POPPK-002 , 04DDG4 ) was included in the current simulations by applying these effects during a 4-hour HD treatment (performed on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12). Three 14 days dosing schedules were investigated in ESRD (dose given immediately after HD):

- -Scenario 1. single loading dose of 1.0/0.5 g, maintenance dose of 0.2/0.1 g q8h,
- -Scenario 2. single loading dose of 1.5/0.75 g, maintenance dose of 0.3/0.15 g q8h, and
- -Scenario 3. single loading dose of 2.0/1.0 g, maintenance dose of 0.4/0.2 g.

## Results

## Final model

A 2-compartment model with first-order elimination best described the plasma concentration time profile of TOL. The plasma PPK model was parameterised in terms of Vc, Vp, CL, and Q. The significant covariates relevant to the NP population included: body weight on Vc, and Vp; CrCL on CL; and pneumonia on Vc. The popPK model of TAZ had the same structure and parameterisation as that for TOL, but with one additional covariate i.e. pneumonia on Vp. PK parameter estimates are given in Table 3 and Table 4. Considering the substantial effect of outliers on many of the final fixed and random effect parameter estimates, outliers were not included in the final TOL and TAZ models.

## Simulations

Simulation results are described in sections 5.3.2 (Target population and Special populations) and 5.3.3 (Pharmacodynamics).

In the sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of the magnitude of IIV in K1E on TOL and TAZ PTA (ELF model), TAZ PTA in ELF decreased when the magnitude of IIV in K1E increased. Ceftolozane PTA in ELF at an MIC = 4 μg/mL was &gt; 90% for all K1E scenarios.

## Distribution

## Lung penetration - study PN007

Intrapulmonary penetration of TOL/TAZ was assessed in a phase 1, prospective, multi-centre, open-label lung penetration PK and safety trial of TOL/TAZ in two groups of patients: (1) mechanically ventilated patients with proven or suspected pneumonia and (2) critically ill patients with CrCL ≥180 mL/min (ARC). Twenty-six  (26)  mechanically  ventilated  (≥24  hours  prior  to  enrolment)  patients  with  proven  or suspected pneumonia receiving concurrent standard antibiotic therapy, of whom eight patients had CrCL ≥150  mL/min  (Cockcroft-Gault  equation),  were  included  in  group  1.  At  least  one  clinical  symptom (documented  fever,  hypothermia,  elevated  WBC  count,  radiological  finding  suggestive  of  bacterial pneumonia) were required.

Patients received 4-6 IV doses of TOL/TAZ q8h according to renal function using the proposed posology. Plasma PK sampling occurred at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the start of the first and last infusions. A BAL procedure was performed at either 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 hours post-dose, with only one BAL sampling per patient.

The composite ELF profile showed delayed TOL and TAZ Tmax, at 6 and 2 h, respectively, compared to 1 hour in plasma (Table 5). TOL ELF concentration was &gt;8 μg/mL and TAZ ELF concentration was &gt;1 μg/mL 100% of the dosing interval. The ELF penetration ratios (ELF AUC / unbound plasma AUC) were ~50% and 62% for TOL and TAZ, respectively. The tmax and elimination were slower in ELF than in plasma for both TOL and TAZ whereas the PK profiles for ELF and plasma were parallel in healthy subjects (not shown). The exposure profiles of TOL/TAZ in plasma and ELF from patients appear to be similar to those in healthy subjects (study CXA-ELF-10-03 , Table 6).

## Elimination

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

## · Dose proportionality

The dose proportionality of TOL/TAZ for single doses up to 4.5 g and multiple doses up to 3 g daily was assessed in the original application (studies CXA-101-01, CXA-QT-10-02 ). Exposures (Cmax and AUC) were found to be approximately dose proportional.

## · Time dependency

Following  multiple-dose  administration  in  mechanically  ventilated  patients  with  proven  or  suspected pneumonia ( PN007 ), plasma accumulation of ~1.6- and 1.2-fold was observed in AUC0-8h for TOL and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TAZ, respectively. No accumulation in plasma of TOL and TAZ was observed in the PK trials of healthy subjects  submitted  in  the  original  application  ( CXA-101-01,  CXA-201-01,  CXA-MD-11-02 ),  with dosing up to 4 g q8h for 10 days.

## Patients with ESRD requiring HD

Three different dosing regimens were simulated, taking into account the effect of a four-hour HD on CL, Vc, IIV in CL and IIV in Vc (Xiao et al . 2013). Simulation results from the final proposed dose of 2.25g loading dose and 450 mg maintenance dose q8h are shown below.

## Augmented renal clearance (ARC)

PK parameters after a single IV dose of 3 g TOL/TAZ were assessed in plasma in ten critically ill patients with ARC (CrCL ≥ 180 mL/min; study PN007 ). Compared with patients without ARC, these patients had reduced exposures (AUC 223/34 vs. 394/61 h*µg/min) and shorter plasma half-lives (4.86/2.33 hours vs. 2.59/1.47 hours) of ceftolozane and tazobactam (Table 10). Free TOL plasma concentration was over the PK/PD target of 8 µg for approximately 70% of the dosing interval, and above the threshold of 1 µg/ml for approximately 60% of the dosing interval (not shown).

Model-based exposures in patients with different renal function, including ARC, from PN008 are shown in Table 9 above.

## · Race

A single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the effects of ethnicity on the PK of TOL/TAZ administered in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian healthy subjects (study PN018 ). Ten Japanese, nine Chinese and ten Caucasian healthy subjects were administered IV single doses of 1.5 g and 3 g TOL/TAZ as 60 minute infusions. Blood and urine were sampled at predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 hours postdose ( i.e. start of infusion) and at 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 and 24-36 hours postdose, respectively. The mean values for most of the PK parameters are similar across ethnic groups for all the analytes (Table 11). Dose normalisation resulted in comparable PK parameters between doses for each ethnic group, suggesting dose proportional PK. Weight normalisation yielded comparable parameters between groups at both doses. A trend towards higher exposure (Cmax and AUC) levels for TAZ M1 in Caucasians compared to Japanese and Chinese subjects.

## · Weight

In the NP popPK analyses ( 050zc7 ), body weight was a statistically significant covariate on volume parameters for both TOL and TAZ. TOL and TAZ AUC in NP subjects in the lowest weight tertiles (43 to &lt;75 kg) with normal renal function (CrCL ≥80 mL/min) receiving the same 3-g TOL/TAZ dose throughout the treatment duration was estimated to be ~ 20% higher than those in the middle body weight tertile (75 to &lt;88 kg). There was no significant difference in TOL and TAZ PK in the highest body weight tertile (88 to ~ 150 kg) compared to those in the middle body weight tertile. The small increases in the lowest body weight tertile were not considered clinically meaningful, and no dose adjustment based on body weight is recommended.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Based on the predominant renal elimination as unchanged parent drug and minimal CYP450 mediated metabolism of TOL and TAZ, plasma levels are not expected to be altered in a clinically relevant manner by other CYP450 inhibitors or inducers. Co-administration of TOL/TAZ with drugs that inhibit OAT1 and/or OAT3 may increase TAZ plasma concentrations.

Co-administration of TAZ with probenecid has been shown to prolong the TAZ t1/2 by 71% (prescribing information for the FDA approved Zosyn [piperacillin/tazobactam]). In a clinical study ( CXA-DDI-12-10 ) evaluating the potential of TOL/TAZ 1.5-g dose to alter the PK of substrates of CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and OAT1/3, the results showed minimal potential for a clinically relevant inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 enzymes  or  OAT1/OAT3  transporters  by  TOL/TAZ,  as  evidenced  by  no  increase  in  exposure  of  the respective probe substrates. Similar results are expected after the 3 g TOL/TAZ dose given that the exposures observed are well below concentrations tested in vitro , which did not show any potential to alter activity of any major enzyme or transporter to a clinically meaningful extent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

Findings from in vitro metabolism and transporter studies conducted in support of the original 1.5-g TOL/TAZ dose regimen can be extended to the 3-g TOL/TAZ dose regimen proposed in this application, based on the concentrations tested. Therefore, no new in vitro human biomaterial studies were conducted specifically to support the NP indication. Key in vitro data for TOL/TAZ from the original submission are summarised below; and the applicability of the data to the 3-g dose for NP is indicated where relevant.

## Metabolism

TOL undergoes minimal metabolism and is not a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes. TAZ, like TOL, appears not to be a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes. The M1 metabolite of TAZ is formed by the hydrolysis of the tazobactam β-lactam ring and lacks pharmacological activity.

## Transporters

TOL is not a substrate for the P-gp or BCRP human transporters at concentrations up to 1000 μg/mL. TOL produced no clinically relevant inhibition of any transporter at concentrations up to 1000 μg/mL (MRP2) to 2500 μg/mL ( OAT1 , OAT3, OCT1 , OCT2 , OATP1B1, OATP1B3 , P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2). The highest concentrations tested, 1000 and 2500 μg/mL, are approximately 10- and 26-fold greater, respectively, than the geom. mean Cmax,ss after 3 g TOL/TAZ dosing (96.1 μg/mL, PN008 ).

TAZ is not a substrate for the P-gp, BCRP, or OCT2 human transporters at 5-500 µg/mL, but is a substrate for the human OAT1 and OAT3 transporters. TAZ produced no clinically relevant inhibition of human OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, Pgp, BCRP, and BSEP transporters at concentrations ≤900 µg/mL, i.e. 37-fold greater than geom. mean Cmax,ss after 3 g TOL/TAZ dosing (24.2 μg/mL, PN008 ). TAZ inhibited the human OAT1 and OAT3 transporters (IC50 ~118 and 147 μg/mL, respectively). These concentrations are ~ 5- to 6-fold greater than the geom. mean Cmax,ss after 3 g TOL/TAZ dosing (24.2 μg/mL, PN008 ).

TAZ M1 metabolite did  not  produce  clinically  relevant  inhibition  at  concentrations  ≤  75  μg/mL, i.e. ~26-fold greater than the geom. mean TAZ M1 Cmax at a 3-g dose (2.84 μg/mL, PN007 ).

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Primary pharmacology

## Susceptibility ( In vitro spectrum activity) - Methodology

TOL/TAZ is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against P. aeruginosa , including drug-resistant strains, and other common gram-negative pathogens. TOL belongs to the cephalosporin class  of  antibacterial  drugs,  but  is  less  susceptible  to  hydrolysis  by  AmpC  β-lactamases  than  other antibiotics in this class. The combination of TOL with β-lactamase inhibitor TAZ, which is a potent inhibitor of most class A and some class C β-lactamases, improves the coverage of TOL to include ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

The  spectrum  of  activity  for  ceftolozane  includes  many  clinically  relevant  gram-negative  respiratory pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae.

## Surveillance studies

In vitro activity of TOL/TAZ has been tested against respiratory tract isolates from hospitalized patients in a combined surveillance study for the US and Europe during 2015-2017. Results for the European isolates are summarised below.

TOL/TAZ (MIC50, 0.25 mg/L and MIC90, 2 mg/L) inhibited 88.6% of 11,390 European Enterobacteriaceae from all infection types at the EUCAST susceptible breakpoint of ≤1 mg/L. Of the 2,456 isolates with an ESBL-phenotype,  TOL/TAZ  inhibited  64.0%  (MIC50/90  0.5/&gt;32  mg/L).  When  excluding  CRE,  2,080 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were ESBL, non-CRE; 75.3% were inhibited by TOL/TAZ (MIC50/90 0.5/8 mg/L); and 99.9% of non-ESBL isolates were susceptible.

For 2,679 P. aeruginosa isolates from all infection types in European hospitals, 89.1% were susceptible (EUCAST, 2018) to TOL/TAZ (MIC50/90, 0.5/16 mg/L). For 1,257 P. aeruginosa isolates from European PIHP, 87.6% were susceptible (EUCAST) with MIC50/90 values of 0.5/32 mg/L.

For 852 Acinetobacter spp. isolates from all infection types in European hospitals, the MIC50/90 values were 32/&gt;32 mg/L.

For 171 H. influenzae isolates from all infection types in European hospitals, the TOL/TAZ MIC50/90 values were 0.12/0.25 mg/L.

## Susceptibility testing

MICs of TOL were determined using broth microdilution and agar dilution at a fixed 4 μg/mL concentration of  TAZ,  using  CLSI  methodology.  Disk  diffusion  susceptibility  testing  was  performed  with  a  disk containing 30 μg TOL and 10 μg TAZ.

## In vitro studies

## Hollow-fiber experiment

Twenty-one clinical isolates (8 P. aeruginosa , 9 K. pneumoniae , and 4 E. coli ) were tested for efficacy in the HF model using a concentration-time profile simulating the steady-state exposures of TOL and TAZ in the lung ELF of pneumonia patients receiving the 3 g dosing regimen evaluated in the Phase 3 NP study (PN008). Clinical isolates were selected based on their resistance mechanisms and TOL/TAZ MICs ranged from 2 to 256 μg/mL for the Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and 4 to 8 μg/mL for the P. aeruginosa isolates.

Efficacy was defined as a ~ 3-log drop in CFU/mL from the starting inoculum, with no re-growth within 69 hours. Efficacy was observed in 4 of 4 P. aeruginosa isolates with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 4 μg/mL, as well

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as in 3 of 4 isolates with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 8 μg/mL. Of the 9 K. pneumoniae isolates, efficacy was observed only in 3 of 4 isolates with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 4 μg/mL. Of the 4 E. coli isolates, efficacy was observed in 1 of 1 isolate with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 16 μg/ml.

Overall,  these  data  demonstrate  bactericidal  activity  of  3-g  TOL/TAZ  at  simulated  PK  exposures corresponding to human SS-ELF in patients with confirmed or suspected pneumonia, supporting the current  breakpoints  of  4/4  μg/mL  for P.  aeruginosa isolates  and  a  breakpoint  of  2/4  μg/mL  for Enterobacteriaceae  (i.e.  combined  with  PN008  clinical  data  hollow  fiber  results  suggest  a  1  dilution increase in the EUCAST breakpoint from 1 mg/L to 2 mg/L for the latter).

## Animal model studies

## Neutropenic Mouse Lung Infection Model

The in vivo efficacy of TOL/TAZ was evaluated in a delayed treatment neutropenic mouse lung infection model at doses that approximate the human TOL and TAZ concentrations in SS-ELF in ventilated patients with suspected or confirmed pneumonia receiving the 3 g TOL/TAZ dose evaluated in the Phase 1 NP study (PN007). Isolates (n=5) were chosen based on their various resistance mechanisms (with MIC up to 4 μg/mL) to represent isolates in patients with disease.

Efficacy in these studies was defined as a ≥ 1 log CFU/g decrease in lung bacterial burden 26 hours post infectious challenge relative to pre-treatment. Treatment with the humanized TOL/TAZ dose of 125/62.5 mg/kg was efficacious in all K. pneumoniae isolates (including one with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 256 μg/mL), except one isolate with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 2 μg/mL. A 2 -fold lower TOL/TAZ dose did not show comparable efficacy,  indicating  that  the  humanized  TOL/TAZ  dose  of  125/62.5  mg/kg  was  required  to  provide significant efficacy in this model.

## Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

The currently approved dose regimen for TOL/TAZ in treatment of cUTI and cIAI in adults is 1.5 g q8h administered as a 1-hour IV infusion. The proposed TOL/TAZ dose regimen for the indication NP, including VAP is 2 g/1 g every 8 hours (i.e. 3 g q8h) administered in 1-hour IV infusion for a duration of 8-14 days. This dose regimen was selected based on probability of target attainment (PTA) analyses and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS), using the nonclinical PD targets,

## Non-clinical PD targets

The non-clinical PD targets for ceftolozane and tazobactam were determined based on neutropenic mouse thigh infection models and are the same as those employed in MCS/PTA analyses in the initial Dossier.

For ceftolozane ,  the  antimicrobial  effect  is  correlated  best  with  %fT&gt;MIC  (the  time  that  free-drug concentrations are above the MIC). In neutropenic mouse thigh infection model using 4 P. aeruginosa and 4 Enterobacteriaceae strains, the mean (median) %T&gt;MIC based on total drug concentration associated with bacteriostasis and 1-log kill were 31.5 (32.2), respectively (Craig and Andes 2013). As TOL plasma protein binding in mice is &lt;10% and as no notable impact of serum on MIC was observed in in vitro studies, only total drug TOL was applied to these PD targets. Based on these results, the %fT&gt;MIC of 30% was selected as the TOL PD target for PTA analysis.

For tazobactam , %fT&gt;threshold concentration (CT), which is the time above the threshold free-drug concentration needed to effectively neutralize the beta-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria, was previously  identified  as  the  PD  parameter  of  importance  based  on  hollow-fiber  and  animal  model experiments. In neutropenic mouse thigh infection model ( 04D9N8 ),  using  8  bacterial strains (4 K. pneumoniae and 4 E. coli ), infected mice were treated with TOL doses that achieved 30% fT&gt;MIC, in conjunction with different TAZ q2h or q8h dosing regimens in order to determine the PD target of TAZ. The applicant stated that the average TAZ %fT&gt;1 μg/mL across bacterial strains was ~20% (for a static

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effect, i.e. to obtain static effects of ceftolozane). Therefore, 20% fT&gt;CT was selected as the TAZ PD target  for  PTA  analysis.  However,  in  the  submitted  study  report  ( 04D9N8 )  it  is  stated  that  ' Full exposure-response relationships  (n=8,  R2  0.51-0.90)  for  TOL/TAZ  indicate  that  TAZ  q2h  was  more efficacious than q8h, reducing the TAZ daily dose by a factor 4.1 to 117 to obtain a static effect of the TOL/TAZ combination, the reduction dependent on strain and resistance mechanism. This corresponds to a mean %fT&gt;CT 1 mg/L of 32% (range 14.5-51.9) '.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Selection of Phase 3 dose based on PTA analysis

Population PK modeling and MCS were conducted to determine PTA based on the nonclinical PD targets for TOL and TAZ (Xiao et al . 2015). The objective was to achieve PTA &gt;90% for the selected PD targets for TOL and TAZ both in plasma and ELF against pathogens with an MIC of ≤ 8 µg/mL.

On the basis of the 2012 US/European Union PACTS surveillance data selected from hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the most commonly isolated pathogens of interest were Enterobacteriaceae (n=1530; 51.5%) and P. aeruginosa (n=1019; 34.3%). The MIC distributions for these pathogens are illustrated in Figure 9 and Figure 10. The ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC50 and MIC90 against Enterobacteriaceae were 0.25 and 4 mg/L, respectively, and against P. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 4 mg/L, respectively.

The popPK model used for MCS included 2 parts, one for plasma PK and the other for plasma-to-ELF PK. The plasma PK model was developed with the plasma data from 8 Phase 1 studies and 2 Phase 2 studies in cUTI and cIAI patients. Thus, the PK model used for simulation was a mixed PK model, combining the plasma  PK  for  cIAI  patients  and  the  plasma-to-ELF  PK  data  from  healthy  subjects  ( 04D3Y0 ).  The individual TOL and TAZ concentration-time profiles in both plasma and ELF were simulated for different dosing regimens, including the 1.5 and 3 g TOL/TAZ doses through a 1 hr IV infusion every 8 hours for patients with normal renal function. The goal was to determine the dosing regimen that achieved a PTA &gt;90% for the 1-log kill target. An unbound fraction of 0.79 was used for ceftolozane to calculate the  %fT&gt;MIC.  In  the  simulation  for  tazobactam,  an  unbound  fraction  of  0.70  was  used  to calculate %fT&gt;CT.

The generated PK profiles were then used to assess TOL and TAZ PTA for both ELF and plasma, using nonclinical PD targets as follows:

- -For TOL, targets of 24.8% and 32.2% fT&gt;MIC to achieve bacteriostasis and 1-log kill, respectively, and  targets  of  40%  and  50%  fT&gt;MIC  associated  with  greater  killing  (i.e.  2-log  kill  for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa ) effect were examined.
- -For TAZ, 20% and 30% fT&gt;CT to achieve bacteriostasis and 1-log kill, respectively, and targets of 40% and 50% fT&gt;CT were examined.

As shown in Figure 9 and 10, the PTA for TOL was consistently higher for all the % fT&gt;MIC targets with the 3 g dose relative to the 1.5-g dose at the targeted MIC of 8 mg/L in ELF for NP. Of note, the PTA for TOL was 98% against pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF and 97.1% against pathogens with an MIC up to 16 mg/L in plasma for the 1-log kill target with the 3 g TOL/TAZ dose (Figure 5). The PTA was 95% for the 40% fT&gt;MIC target up to 8 mg/L in ELF. Comparatively, at the 1.5 g dose, the PTA for 1-log kill was ~ 85% and 74% for pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF or 16 mg/L in plasma, respectively (Figure 6), whereas the PTA was approximately 75% for the 40% fT&gt;MIC target up to 8 mg/L in ELF. When  using  the  target  of  50%fT&gt;MIC  for  the  3-g  TOL/TAZ  dose,  the  PTA  reached  87.7%  against pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF. The 1.5 g dose of TOL/TAZ, however, achieved only 59% PTA for pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF for NP.

At the dose level of 3 g TOL/TAZ, the PTA for TAZ was comparable for all targets in plasma and ELF (Figure 11) and was higher than the PTA achieved in plasma at the 1.5-g dose. According to Xiao et al (2015), it was aimed that the target attainment in ELF of the 3-g dose of TOL/TAZ in nosocomial pneumonia patients with normal renal function would not be lower than that of the 1.5-g dose in plasma for cUTI/cIAI patients. The authors stated further that ' the MEC coverage achieved in plasma with the current dose of 1.5 g for treatment of cUTIs and cIAIs was confirmed to be sufficient against ESBL-producing pathogens in the ceftolozane/tazobactam clinical trial programs '.

Therefore,  the  applicant  considered  the  3-g  dose  of  ceftolozane/  tazobactam  as  appropriate  to  be evaluated in patients with nosocomial pneumonia and normal renal function, which is double the dose that is approved for use in patients with cUTIs and cIAIs.

## Simulation of exposure and PTA analyses following Phase 3 study

The MCSs that employed the updated NP popPK models ( 050ZC7) for both TOL and TAZ following the Phase 3 study were used to justify the dose selection for the treatment of ventilated patients with NP, and to support the proposed susceptibility testing interpretive criteria by assessing the PTA.

The previously developed two separate popPK models for TOL and TAZ were refined by including PK data collected from 3 Phase 3 trials ( PN013 , PN014 and PN008 ) in the analysis datasets. The TOL ELF data in healthy and critically ill ventilated patients with proven or suspected pneumonia were incorporated in previous TOL popPK models ( 04D3Y0 and 050w2j , respectively). The structure of the ELF compartment from the previous popPK model was directly transferred to the NP popPK model 050ZC7 with  fixed parameter estimates. For TOL, a total of 8330 (including 1481 sparse PK samples from NP patients in PN008) plasma concentrations from 968 subjects (305 NP patients in PN008) and 47 ELF concentrations from 47 subjects were used for the popPK analysis. For TAZ, a total of 5679 plasma concentrations (including 1455 sparse PK samples from NP patients in PN008) from 835 subjects (305 NP subjects in PN008) and 42 ELF concentrations from 42 subjects were used. A 2-compartment model with first-order elimination best described the plasma concentration-time profile of both TOL and TAZ. The significant covariates relevant to the NP population in the model included: body weight on Vc, and Vp; CrCL on CL; and pneumonia on Vc. The updated popPK models were then used for stochastic simulations to generate plasma and ELF exposures and PTAs to justify the dose selection for the treatment of ventilated patients with NP.

MCSs were performed in NONMEM (version 7.3.0) using the final popPK models to generate individual ELF and plasma concentration-time profiles. These analyses were based on virtual subjects randomly selected from a virtual population dataset containing a distribution of demographic covariates (weight) and CrCL that  is  representative  of  the  intended  patient  population.  A  total  of  1000  virtual  individuals  were generated in each of the renal function categories. TOL/TAZ doses of 3 g ( i.e. 2/1 g), 1.5 g ( i.e. 1/0.5 g), and 0.750 g ( i.e. 0.5/0.25 g) administered as 1-hour IV infusion were used to generate PK profiles in subjects with normal and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. The 3 g dose was also evaluated in subjects with augmented renal clearance (ARC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The generated PK profiles were then used to assess TOL and TAZ PTA for both ELF and plasma, using non-clinical PD targets as follows:

- -For TOL: 30% fT&gt;MIC to achieve 1-log kill.
- -For TAZ: 20%fT&gt;Ct of 1 μg/mL to achieve 1-log kill.

PTA was defined as the percent of patients who achieved PD targets of %fT&gt;MIC ≥ 30% for ceftolozane at MIC of 8 µg/ml and/or %fT&gt;CT ≥ 20% for tazobactam at the CT of 1 µg/ml.

Further,  the  steady-state  exposures  in  the  patients  with  NP  from PN008 receiving  adjusted  dosing regimens based on CrCL were estimated using the Bayesian parameter estimates from the final models for  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam.  Results  of  steady-state  exposures  between  different  renal  function groups are presented in the boxplots (Figure 7).

## PTA simulations using estimated steady-state exposures in the patients with NP/VAP from PN008

A summary of target attainment parameters in plasma and ELF is provided in Table 12 and Table 13 for ceftolozane and tazobactam by CrCL groups, respectively.  These PTA analyses were performed only at a TOL/TAZ MIC of 8 μg/mL.

## PTA simulations in virtual patients with NP/VAP

For virtual NP patients with normal renal function (80 mL/min ≤ CrCL &lt;150 mL/min) receiving 3-g TOL/TAZ, the TOL ELF PTA was 98% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of 8 μg/mL (Table 14), and the TOL plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of 16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was 98% at a TAZ CT of 1 μg/mL for the PD target 20% of fT&gt;CT (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a TAZ CT of 2 μg/mL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients with mild renal impairment (50 mL/min ≤ CrCL &lt;80 mL/min), similar exposure levels and PTA were attained as the patients with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required.

For virtual NP patients with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min) receiving CrCL-adjusted  TOL/TAZ  doses  of  1.5  g  which  is  2-fold  the  recommended  CrCL-adjusted  doses  for cIAI/cUTI patients with moderate renal impairment, the TOL ELF PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of up to 8 μg/mL ( Table14), and the TOL plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MICs of up to 16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was &gt;90% at a TAZ CT of 1 μg/mL  (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a CT of 2 μg/mL.

For  virtual  NP  patients  with severe  renal  impairment (15  mL/min ≤ CrCL ≤ 29  mL/min)  receiving CrCL-adjusted doses of 0.75 g, which is 2-fold the recommended CrCL-adjusted doses for cIAI/cUTI patients, the TOL ELF PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of up to 8 μg/mL ( Table 14), and the TOL plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of up to 16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was 87.2% at a TAZ CT of 1 μg/mL (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a CT of 2 μg/mL.

For virtual NP patients with ARC (CrCL ≥ 150 mL/min) at the 3 g dose, the TOL ELF PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MICs of up to 4 μg/mL ( Table 14), and the TOL plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC up to 16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was &gt;90% at a CT of 1 μg/m L (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was &gt;90% at a TAZ CT of 2 μg/ml.

For virtual NP patients with ESRD using a 1.5/0.75 g loading dose and 0.3/0.15 g maintenance dose q8h, the TOL ELF PTA was &gt;99% for 30%t&gt;MIC target at a TOL/TAZ MICs of up to 4 µg/mL. This held true for each day during the simulated treatment duration of 14 days. The TAZ ELF PTA was also &gt;90% for 20%T&gt;CT target at the CT of 1 µg/mL during 14 days of simulation.

The figures below show the results of simulations in ELF for those with normal renal function as well as for those  with  different  categories  of  renal  impairment  and  ARC.  At  the  1-log  kill  target  the  3  g  q8h ceftolozane dose is supported for P. aeruginosa strains with MICs up to 4 µg/mL, for Enterobacteriaceae strains with MICs up to 2 µg/mL, and for H. influenzae strains with MICs up to 0.5 µg/mL.

## Clinical exposure-response relationship

Exposure-response (E/R) analysis was conducted to assess the potential relationship between TOL and TAZ plasma PK and the two primary efficacy endpoints evaluated in study PN008: Day 28 all-cause mortality and clinical response at TOC visit. However, no interpretable trend between either efficacy endpoint and TAZ %fT&gt; CT (1 μg/mL) was identified.

Of  the  231  subjects  in  the  E/R  analysis  dataset,  the  highest  baseline  TOL/TAZ  MIC  from  relevant pathogens for the 177 subjects was ≤ 4 μg/mL. The TOL plasma %fT&gt;MIC was &gt;30% for all 177 subjects. Notably, TOL plasma %fT&gt;MIC was 99% for 173 of the 177 subjects, and the lowest %fT&gt;MIC in the remaining 4 subjects was 73.7%. The all-cause mortality rate and clinical cure rate in these 177 subjects were 13.3% and 70%, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  total  of  65.4%  patients  (151  out  of  231)  were  considered  a  clinical  cure  at  the  TOC  visit  in  the E-R-efficacy population (Table 16). The occurrence of clinical cure at the TOC visit was 70.6% (125 patients out of 177) in patients with an MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL as compared to 48% (26 patients out of 54) in patients with MIC &gt; 4 μg/mL. Of the 177 with an MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL, the clinical cure rate for the 173 patients with %fT&gt;MIC of 99% was 70% versus 100% in the remaining 4 patients, suggesting a lack of an E-R relationship with ceftolozane exposures.

In  the  final  E/R  report,  it  was  stated  that:  ' In  patients  with  an  MIC  below  the  breakpoint,  the mean %fT&gt;MIC was higher in patients (98.6%) as compared to patients above the breakpoint (47.7%); the all-cause mortality rate on Day 28 was 13% in the 177 patients with an MIC below the breakpoint as compared to 24% in the 54 patients with an MIC above the breakpoint, respectively '.

As  no  AEs  met  the  pre-defined  criteria  for  in  the  E-R  safety  analysis,  no  safety  E-R  modeling  was conducted.

The applicant concluded that there was no E-R relationship trend with both TOL and TAZ in patients with an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL as all patients achieving exposures above the PD targets.

## Clinical trials

In the pivotal study PN008 , microbiological cure rates at TOC were in general comparable between the study arms, slightly favoring TOL/TAZ in ME population. No correlation was observed between MIC and outcome in either treatment group.

In patients with P. aeruginosa isolates, higher microbiological eradication rates were observed in the TOL/TAZ arm compared to the meropenem arm in the mITT population [i.e. 74% (47/63) vs 63% (41/55), respectively]. Microbiological response rate against AmpC overexpressing P. aeruginosa isolates was (6/9) 66% vs. (1/6) 16% in the TOL/TAZ arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae isolates, slightly lower microbiological cure rates were observed for the TOL/TAZ arm compared to the meropenem arm (mITT); 66% (56/84) vs. 71% (52/73), respectively.

Regarding the ESBLK. pneumoniae , lower microbiological cure rates were observed in the TOL/TAZ arm compared to the meropenem arm (mITT); 62% (33/53) vs. 73% (38/52), respectively.

For H.  influenzae ,  microbiological  eradication  rates  were  higher  in  the  TOL/TAZ  arm  than  in  the meropenem arm [90% (20/22) vs. 73% (11/16) in mITT population, respectively].

The number of isolates with MIC ≥8 μg/mL encountered in the study PN008 were in general limited, especially with P.  aeruginosa isolates (n=5). For Enterobacteriaceae and K. pneumoniae , a total of 41 and 34 isolates had higher MIC values of ≥ 8 μg /mL. For these isolates, no correlation was observed between MIC and outcome, and compared isolates with MIC &lt; 8 μg /mL.

## Resistance development

Incidences of emergence of non-susceptibility (i.e. &gt;1 dilution change in MIC) were comparable between the study arms in PN008; 29 (12.7%) subjects in the TOL/TAZ arm vs. 28 (12.0%) subjects in the meropenem arm by the TOC visit. In the TOL/TAZ treatment arm, the most common pathogens to develop non-susceptibility were 11 K. pneumoniae and 8 A. baumannii isolates; among P. aeruginosa isolates, 3 developed non-susceptibility. A lower percentage of subjects with P. aeruginosa isolates in the TOL/TAZ  treatment  arm  (3/63,  4.8%)  developed  non-susceptibility  compared  to  the  meropenem treatment arm (17/65, 26.2%). Among 29 subjects in whom non-susceptibility emerged in the TOL/TAZ treatment arm, 17 (59%) and 17 (59%) subjects had clinical and microbiological cure at the TOC visit, respectively.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

The current application concerns the extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP) at a 3g q8h dose. Single dose and multiple dose PK data have been obtained for TOL/TAZ at doses up to 4.5 g and 3 g daily up to ten days, respectively (original MAA). Additional studies ( PN018 , PN007 , PN008 ) as well as popPK and ER modelling have been performed since the original cIAI/cUTI application to provide data to support the present application.

Validated  LC/MS/MS  bioanalytical  methods  (in  accordance  with  the  EMA  bioanalytical  guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1) were used for analysis of TOL, TAZ and TAZ M1 in plasma, urine, dialysate and epithelial lining fluid samples from the clinical studies.

Several popPK models have been developed throughout Zerbaxa product development, with separate models for each active substance. The preceding models are overall similar to the most recent ones with respect to base structure and co-variates. The main model ( 050zc7 ) includes phase I ELF PK data from healthy subjects and pneumonia patients, and sparse phase 3 plasma PK data from ventilated NP patients ( PN008 ). The model is used to estimate probability of target attainment to further justify the proposed dosing regimen in NP patients with normal, augmented or impaired renal function, and is considered to be of low to moderate regulatory impact.

Overall,  the  methodology  is  considered  appropriate.  The  final  models  for  TOL  and  TAZ  were 2-compartment models with first-order elimination. For TOL and TAZ (pneumonia population), significant covariates were BW on Vc and Vp, CrCL on CL and pneumonia on Vc. In addition, pneumonia was a covariate on Vp in the TOL model. Diagnostic plots are overall adequate for the TOL and TAZ model,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

although they indicate that the TAZ model does not fully capture the observed. The VPC plots for the overall  and  NP  populations  look  acceptable.  The  popPK  models  need  to  be  sufficiently  robust  for simulations and subsequent PK/PD analyses to evaluate PTA. Additional VPC plots provided in the RSI response demonstrated that the model adequately captures the observed PK concentrations in patients from study PN008 and in patients within the different renal function categories.

Results from study PN007 indicate that TOL and TAZ distributes into the lung of ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia. Total ELF to free plasma AUC ratios for TOL and TAZ in ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia were 50% and 62%, respectively, overall similar to penetration ratios seen in healthy  subjects  (61%  and  63%,  respectively).  The  observed  penetration  ratio  supports  the  use  of TOL/TAZ in pneumonia.

The proposed dose is within the established linearity range. The slight accumulation noted for both TOL and TAZ following multiple doses of 3 g q8h in patients with suspected or proven pneumonia ( PN007 ) was likely attributed to the high variability in CrCL of included patients. In the popPK analysis, IIV for TOL and TAZ were found to be moderate.

Based on model-predictions, TOL and TAZ AUC0-8h in pneumonia patients is comparable to that of healthy subjects, while Cmax is lower (25-30%), attributed to the larger volume of distribution in NP patients (~2-fold higher). Variability is markedly higher in  patients compared to healthy subjects. Estimated exposures (AUC) appear to be ~2-fold of those estimated for the cUTI and cIAI populations receiving 1.5 g q8h.

Only sparse PK data in plasma were collected in study PN008 and the applicant relies on plasma from PN007 to characterise PK in NP patients. It is not clear in what extent these patients had a similar degree of infection-associated systemic disturbances as patients with confirmed nosocomial pneumonia in the pivotal study. Reassuringly, observed concentrations in PN008 were adequately captured by the popPK models.

TOL and TAZ are eliminated by the kidney, and dosage adjustments according to renal function are warranted.  The  same  percent  reduction  in  dose  as  recommended  for  cUTI  and  cIAI  patients  with moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment are  proposed  ( i.e. a  50%  and  25%  reduction  in  TOL/TAZ, respectively). TOL and TAZ model-predicted exposures in NP patients with renal impairment using the proposed posology are overall comparable to those of NP patients with normal renal function. Updated PTA analysis, taking variability into account, support the proposed doses of TOL and TAZ in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment.

All subjects with moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline received the per-protocol reduced dose within the treatment period. 52 (14,4%) patients with moderate/severe renal impairment were treated with  TOL/TAZ, 47 (12.9%) were treated with meropenem. In 32 (61.5%) and 26 (55.3%) patients treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem, respectively, the treatment failed. Analysis of underlying cause of the  disease  revealed  that  in  patients  suffering  from  VABP,  treatment  failure  rates  reached  65.2% (15 patients) and 58.3% (14 patients) in patients treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem respectively. In patients with ventilated HABP, the failure rates were 58.6% (17 patients) and 52.2% (12) in patients treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem respectively.

In ESRD patients requiring HD a loading dose of 2.25 g followed by maintenance dose of 450 mg q8h ( i.e. reduction by 75% and 15% compared to the dose in NP patients with normal renal function), is proposed. The  maintenance  dose  is  suggested  to  be  given  at  the  earliest  possible  time  following  end  of haemodialysis. Simulated TOL and TAZ exposures (AUC0-8h, Cmax) were overall within the range of model-predicted  exposures  in  NP  patients  from  study PN008 .  The  proposed  dose  adjustments  for patients with ESRD is considered appropriate based on the updated PTA analysis provided in the RSI response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No dose adjustment is currently proposed for NP patients with augmented renal clearance (ARC; ≥150 mL/min).  Model-predicted  AUC0-8h,ss  ( PN008 )  decline  with  increasing  CrCL  within  the  three  ARC categories compared to NP patients with normal renal function. The lack of dose recommendations in patients with ARC was adequately justified in the response to the 2 nd RSI.

Based on the popPK analysis, race or body weight had no significant impact on TOL or TAZ PK.

Findings from in vitro metabolism and transporter studies conducted in support of the original 1.5 g TOL/TAZ dose regimen can be extended to the proposed 3 g TOL/TAZ dose regimen. The potential for DDIs to occur is considered to be relatively low .

## Pharmacodynamics

The currently approved dose regimen for TOL/TAZ in treatment of cUTI and cIAI in adults is 1.5 g q8h administered as a 1-hour IV infusion. The proposed TOL/TAZ dose regimen for the indication NP, including VAP is 2 g/1 g every 8 hours (i.e. 3 g q8h) administered in 1-hour IV infusion for a duration of 8-14 days.

Although the dose is increased to 3 g for patients with NP/VAP, the TOL/TAZ exposure at the infection site (i.e. in ELF) will likely be comparable to plasma exposures achieved in patients with cIAI and cUTI as only 50% and 60% of these drugs penetrates to ELF, respectively.

## Non-clinical PD targets

The non-clinical PD targets for ceftolozane and tazobactam were determined based on neutropenic mouse thigh infection models (i.e. plasma-derived) and are the same as those employed in MCS/PTA analyses in the initial Dossier.

For ceftolozane, the antimicrobial effect is correlated best with %fT&gt;MIC. Based on neutropenic mouse thigh infection model using P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae strains, 30% fT&gt;MIC (for 1 log kill), was selected as the TOL PD target for PTA analysis. In addition, 40% fT&gt;MIC and 50% fT&gt;MIC targets were employed to obtain 2 log-kill for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa , respectively.

For tazobactam, %fT&gt;threshold concentration needed to protect ceftolozane from the beta-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria is the important factor for efficacy. Based on the neutropenic mouse thigh infection model, 20% fT&gt;CT (stasis) and 35% fT&gt;CT (1-log-kill) were selected as the TAZ PD target for PTA analysis. This would provide sufficient tazobactam exposures to protect ceftolozane from hydrolysis (i.e.  as  long  as  ceftolozane  is  required  for  activity  to  obtain  at  least  1  log-kill).  This  protection  is particularly important against ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates.

## Selection of dose

For the selection of Phase 3 dose regimen, popPK modelling (including Phase 1 and 2 data, and ELF data from healthy subjects) and MCS were conducted using the non-clinical PD targets. For both TOL and TAZ, both the targets of 20% and ~30% fT&gt;MIC/T&gt;CT to achieve bacteriostasis and 1-log kill, respectively, were examined, in addition to 40% and 50% fT&gt;MIC/fT&gt;CT targets for greater killing effect against key respiratory pathogens (i.e. P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively). The objective was to achieve PTA &gt;90% for the selected PD targets for TOL and TAZ both in plasma and ELF against pathogens with an MIC of ≤ 8 µg/mL.

PTA simulations suggested a high target achievement of &gt;95% in ELF for ceftolozane with 3-g dose for the 1-log kill and 40% targets against pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L while PTA was ~87% for the target  of  50%fT&gt;MIC.  For  tazobactam,  the  PTA  was  comparable  for  all  targets  in  plasma  and  ELF following the 3-g dose. While &gt;90% PTA was achieved for 20% and 30% fT&gt;CT both in plasma and ELF at CT of 1 µg/ml, much lower PTAs of 85% and 65% were achieved in ELF for 40% and 50% fT&gt;CT targets, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of note, no simulations have been conducted to investigate prolongation of the infusion time, which might have led to higher target attainments (i.e. better coverage with pathogens with high MIC values) for both ceftolozane and tazobactam.

## Simulations following Phase 3 study

Once the Phase 3 data from patients with NP/VAP were available, the popPK model was updated to justify the selected dose regimen, including also data from cIAI and cUTI studies as well as ELF data from critically-ill patients.

In general, target attainments were much higher in plasma than ELF for TOL, as expected. At a TOL/TAZ MIC of 8 μg/mL, 98% PTA was achieved in ELF based on the PD target of 30%T&gt;MIC for TOL, according to the MCSs in virtual patients with normal renal function. Additional PTA data using more conservative targets of 40% and 50% T&gt;MIC for TOL showed that &gt;99% target attainments are achieved in ELF for MIC up to 4 µg/ml in all renal function categories (including patients with ESRD with a PTA &gt;97%). Further, &gt;95% target attainments achieved in ELF for MIC up to 8 µg/ml in all renal categories except for ARC categories of 180 mL/min ≤ CrCL&gt;210 mL/min and CrCL ≥ 210 mL/min (for these PTAs were ~92% and 87%, respectively). For plasma, even better results were obtained. These results are reassuring with regards to adequacy of TOL dose for treatment of patients with NP/VAP.

For tazobactam, PTA data using the PD target of 35% fT&gt;CT=1 μg/mL revealed that patients with renal function categories between 30 to 150 ml/min achieved &gt;95% target attainment in the ELF while 84% of patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  86-90%  of  patients  with  ARC  with  a  CrCL ≥ 150  ml/min achieved  target  attainment.  For  both  subgroups  of  ARC  patients  and  patients  with  severe  renal impairment, available clinical data from PN008 showed that clinical success rate and mortality rates were comparable to patients with normal renal function as well as to patients in the meropenem arm. In addition,  very  high  PTA  achieved  in  plasma  is  reassuring  regarding  the  patients  with  severe  renal impairment. Although extrapolation of clinical outcome data to a larger population is hampered by the TAZ PTA &lt;90% for patient with ARC and uncertainties about the magnitude of the PTA estimate due to sparse PK data from this subpopulation, available clinical data support that efficacy was comparable between patients with and without ARC. Overall, the TAZ dose can be considered sufficient for restoring antibacterial TOL activity in all renal categories, including patients with extremes of ARC as well as severe renal impairment.

Additional joint PTA data in ELF and plasma using the PD target of 40% and 50%T&gt;MIC for TOL and the PD target of 35% fT&gt;CT=1 μg/mL for TAZ were provided. These data revealed that patients with renal function categories between 30 to 150 ml/min achieved &gt;94% target attainment in the ELF while 84% of patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  85-90%  of  patients  with  ARC  with  a  CrCL ≥ 150  ml/min achieved target attainment at MIC ≤ 4 mg/L. These results revealed that TAZ dose is the limiting factor for achieving higher target attainments.

Separate simulations for patients with ESRD using the above mentioned TAZ target showed that daily ELF PTA  is  &gt;90%  on  non-dialysis  days  and  &gt;88%  on  dialysis  days  of  the  14-day  treatment  period  at CT=1 μg/mL while daily plasma PTA is 99% for the entire treatment period. These target attainments hold true in the joint PTA analyses at MIC=4 μg/mL for both ELF and plasma. Although there is drop in concentration in dialysis days, generally higher PTAs achieved in ELF. Further, it is reassuring that plasma PTA was constantly &gt;99% during the entire treatment period. The proposed dose adjustment for patients with ESRD is considered appropriate although a PTA of &gt;95% on non-dialysis days could have been preferable.

Although no E-R relationship trend could be found with TOL or TAZ in patients with an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL as all  patients achieved exposures above the PD targets, Efficacy Response comparisons by MIC Group reveal that a higher proportion of subjects with an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL achieved clinical cure at the TOC visit

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to patients with MIC &gt; 4 µg/mL (i.e. 70% vs. 48%). In addition, all-cause mortality on Day 28 was higher in patients with MIC &gt; 8 µg/mL compared to those with MIC ≤4 µg/mL [i.e. 24.1% (13/54) vs. 13% (23/177)]. It is noted that patients with MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL achieved more than twice the ceftolozane exposures using the 30% T&gt;MIC target ( i.e. 98% vs. 47%) while TAZ exposures were similar. These results indicate a trend of better clinical outcomes and lower mortality in patients with an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL. Whereas, these findings do not provide reassurance that the proposed dose will sufficiently cover bacteria with MIC &gt; 4 μg/mL (i.e. up to 8 µg/mL or higher).

Clinical and microbiological success rates in the TOL/TAZ arm seem to be comparable to those in the meropenem arm for P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae isolates with baseline MIC values of ≤4 µg/mL and ≤2 µg /mL, respectively. Overall, MIC-based clinical outcomes data do not provide sufficient evidence in support of the adequacy of the dose regimen (especially the tazobactam dose) to cover bacteria with MIC up to 8 µg/mL and higher, as vast majority of the treated isolated had MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL in PN008 .

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

All  issues regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been satisfactorily addressed. In general, proposed ceftolozane-tazobactam dose of 3 g q8h and the proposed dose adjustments for some renal function categories, including ESRD, is considered appropriate.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

The indication applied for are:

'Nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.'

The clinical support for this indication mainly include one pivotal Phase 3 study. In addition, supportive data for administration of ceftolozane/tazobactam (TOL/TAZ) at a dose of 3 g q8h were obtained from three Phase 1 studies (PN007, PN018, PN028). Study PN007 provided PK data in a population intended to be comparable to the study population for the NP indication. Study PN018 studied impact of race in PK.

PN028 were assessed in the original marketing application and provided PK data in healthy subjects.

A higher dose of 3 g ceftolozane/tazobactam (comprising 2 g ceftolozane and 1 g tazobactam), compared with the currently approved dose of 1.5 g for patients with cUTI and cIAI, was selected based on popPK modelling and Monte Carlo simulations. The modelling approach and adequacy of the proposed dose are discussed in sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3.

## 2.4.2. Main study

Study PN008 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of ceftolozane/tazobactam in the treatment of adult subjects with ventilated nosocomial pneumonia (including VAP and ventilated HAP subjects), compared with meropenem. Approximately 726 subjects were planned to be randomized 1:1 to receive either ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem. The number of subjects enrolled with VAP was planned to be at least 50% of the randomized population. The overall study design is shown in the table below.

## Methods

Study  assessments  at  baseline,  during  study  drug  therapy  and  at  scheduled  study  visits  included components of the APACHE II score as an inclusion criterion (until 15 Mar 2016, protocol amendment 5.0),  Clinical  Pulmonary  Infection  Scores  (CPIS),  Sepsis  Organ  Failure  Assessment  (SOFA)  scores, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements and safety labs. Quantitative LRT cultures were required in intubated patients at specified time points during study therapy.

Local (i.e. site laboratory) or regional laboratory results were used to determine patient eligibility for study enrolment as well as for the ongoing management of the patient during the treatment period.

The lower respiratory tract culture specimen could be obtained by any one of the techniques mentioned in  inclusion  criteria  number  4  (refer  to  the  table  below).  However,  at  sites  where  bronchoscopic  or mini-BAL or PBS were available, these modalities were strongly recommended, instead of an ETA, for obtaining the baseline LRT specimen. Whenever possible, it was recommended that the same method used  to  obtain  the  baseline  LRT  specimen  be  used  consistently  throughout  the  study  for  obtaining post-baseline LRT specimens.

All patients had to have a chest radiograph for inclusion into the study. The Investigator's interpretation (or that of a qualified designee at the site) of the chest x-ray was used to make the enrolment decision. However, in addition to the local reading of chest-x-rays, a centralized independent second evaluation of the baseline and day 8 chest x-ray was conducted on all patients enrolled in the study.

Patients  were  hospitalized  throughout  the  treatment  period  and  completed  all  study  treatment intravenously. No oral switch was permitted in this study.

The LFU visit could be conducted in person or via a telephone call. A telephonic LFU assessment was only permitted to assess the patient's wellbeing if the patient had no known adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that required an in-person follow-up assessment.

Analysis  of  susceptibility  was  based  on  data  from  the  central  microbiology  lab  when  available.  For subjects without central lab susceptibility data at baseline local lab data was used.

## Dose adjustment criteria for the study drugs

Dose adjustment for TOL/TAZ and meropenem was made for subjects with moderate or severe renal insufficiency. Please refer to the tables below.

Dose  adjustments  for  renal  insufficiency  were  performed  by  the  un-blinded  pharmacist  following notification from the PI, including the subject's CrCL value.

Table 21. Recommended intravenous dose regimens for ceftolozane/tazobactam according to renal function

| Renal Function      | Dose                   | Infusion Frequency     |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| CLcR >50 mL/min     | 3000 mg IV             | q8(±2)h                |
| CLcR 30 - 50 mL/min | 1500 mg IV             | q8(±2)h                |
| CLcR26 - 29 mL/min  | 750 mg IV              | q8(±2)h                |
| CLcR 15 - 25 mL/min | 750 mg IV              | q8(±2)h                |
| CLcR <15 mL/min     | Discontinue study drug | Discontinue study drug |

CLcR=creatinine clearance; IV=intravenous;qSh=every 8 hours

Table 22. Recommended intravenous dose regimens for meropenem according to renal function

| RenalFunction       | Dose                   | Infusion Frequency     |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| CLcR >50 mL/min     | 1000 mg IV             | q8(±2)h                |
| CLcR 30 - 50 mL/min | 1000 mg IV             | q12(±2)h               |
| CLcR26 -29mL/min    | 1000 mg IV             | q12(±2)h               |
| CLcR 15 - 25 mL/min | 500 mg IV              | q12(±2)h               |
| CLcR <15 mL/min     | Discontinue study drug | Discontinue study drug |

CLCR=creatinine clearance; IV=intravenous;q12h=every 12 hours

The total number of infusions may increase if a dose adjustment is required based on renal function due to the addition of dummy infusions.

In cases where dosing every 8 hours is used for both ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem, the use of a dummy infusion is not required.

Conversely, to maintain blinding of the dosing regimens when meropenem is required to be dosed every 12 hours, the subjects' treatment schedule must be adjusted to 4 infusions per day. These 4 infusions are to accommodate the 3 every 8 hours infusions for ceftolozane/tazobactam and the 2 every 12 hours infusions for meropenem (the first infusion for active drug and dummy infusions should be administered simultaneously at time zero, therefore, leading to a total of 4 total infusions per day).

Subjects who develop a CrCL &lt;15 mL/minute or who were placed on dialysis or hemofiltration were withdrawn from study drug because dose recommendations of ceftolozane/tazobactam for such subjects have not yet been determined.

## Non-study antibiotic use

In the 72 hours preceding the first dose of study drug for treatment of the current VNP, subjects may not receive more than 24 hours (i.e. &gt;1 dose of a once daily antibiotic, &gt;2 doses of a twice daily antibiotic, etc.) of antibiotic therapy active against gram-negative pathogens known to cause VNP. Exceptions to this prior antibiotic rule are noted under Exclusion criteria #3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After randomization, non-study antibiotics for the treatment of VNP are not permitted except in the following circumstances:

- -Allowed empiric adjunctive therapy (as described below) administered at baseline for potential resistant pathogens, OR
- -For treatment of documented clinical and/or microbiologic failure.

If non-study antibiotics for the treatment of VNP are required after randomization, the subject must be discontinued from study treatment.

## Empiric therapy at baseline

## Empiric gram-positive adjunctive therapy

Subjects  were  required  to  receive  empiric  gram-positive  adjunctive  therapy  (linezolid)  at  baseline. Alternatives to linezolid could be permitted (if these were standard of care or the patient did not tolerate linezolid)  but  only  after  discussion  and  prior  approval  from  the  Medical  Monitor.  At  sites  with  a  low incidence of MRSA pneumonia (e.g., MRSA prevalence &lt;5% as determined by the local antibiogram), the investigator  could  request,  from  the  Medical  Monitor,  substitution  of  linezolid  with  a  semisynthetic penicillin. If S. aureus (MRSA or MSSA) was not isolated from baseline LRT culture, the investigator was recommended to discontinue linezolid and complete treatment with assigned study drug alone. Patients whose baseline LRT culture grew both a gram-negative pathogen and S. aureus (MRSA or MSSA) should complete treatment with study drug and with linezolid.

## Empiric gram-negative adjunctive therapy

Subjects were permitted to receive adjunctive gram-negative (aminoglycoside-amikacin) therapy for ≤ 72 hours started at baseline (at sites with &gt;15% carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa ) pending baseline culture results. Aminoglycosides other than amikacin may be permitted if standard of care at the site, but only after discussion and prior approval from the Medical Monitor. Upon receipt of the baseline LRT microbiology results (including study drug susceptibility), if the isolate(s) were susceptible to both study drugs, empiric amikacin had to be discontinued immediately and study drug alone continued for the remainder  of  the  treatment  duration.  Concomitant  therapy  with  study  drug  and  amikacin  (or  other approved gram-negative adjunctive therapy) was not permitted after day 3.

## From the protocol:

Upon availability of the baseline LRT culture and pathogen susceptibility results:

Management of study drug and empiric gram-negative adjunctive therapy:

- If all gram-negative isolates are resistant to both study drugs: study drug must be discontinued, appropriate non-study antibiotics started, and the subject followed for safety through the LFU visit.
- If gram-negative isolate(s) with varying susceptibility results is/are present: the Investigator is strongly encouraged to base decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation of study therapy on the clinical presentation of the patient and the totality of the available clinical and laboratory data,  including  the  baseline  LRT  culture  susceptibility  testing  results.  Empiric  gram-negative adjunctive therapy, if started at baseline, must be discontinued after 72 hours.
- If  no  growth  of  any  gram-negative organism: study drug should be continued based on the discretion of the Investigator and guided by the subject's clinical response. Empiric gram-negative adjunctive therapy, if started at baseline, must be discontinued after 72 hours.

Management of empiric gram-positive adjunctive therapy:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- If S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) is present [with or without a gram-negative pathogen]: linezolid should be continued for a minimum of 8 days. If MSSA is the only LRT pathogen isolated, the Investigator  may  switch  the  gram-positive  adjunctive  therapy  to  an  anti-staphylococcal semisynthetic penicillin (with gram-positive coverage only) and complete treatment with the semisynthetic penicillin.
- If S.  aureus (MRSA  or  MSSA)  does  not  grow:  empiric  gram-positive  coverage  should  be discontinued, unless in the opinion of the Investigator, continuation provides expected benefit for the  patient.  If  gram-positive  adjunctive  therapy  is  discontinued  and  then  a  subsequent, post-baseline LRT culture shows presence of S. aureus, the appropriate gram-positive adjunctive therapy may be reinitiated (i.e., linezolid if MRSA or anti-staphylococcal semisynthetic penicillin for MSSA).

## Objectives

## Primary objective

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem in adult subjects with ventilator-associated nosocomial pneumonia based on the difference in clinical response rates in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population at the TOC visit (7 to 14 days after the EOT visit), using a non-inferiority margin of 12.5%.

## Key secondary objective

- To compare the Day 28 all-cause mortality rates of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem arms in the ITT population.

## Analysis populations

## ITT Population

The ITT population consisted of all randomized subjects with documented informed consent, regardless of whether or not they received study drug. Subjects in the ITT population were categorized based on the treatment arm to which they were randomized. No subjects were excluded from the ITT population due to important deviations or premature un-blinding of study treatment.

## mITT Population

The mITT population was a subset of the ITT population that included any subject who received any amount of study drug and had at least 1 bacterial respiratory pathogen isolated from the baseline LRT culture  that  was  susceptible  to  at  least  1  of  the  study  drugs.  Subjects  with  a  non-streptococcal gram-positive pathogen as their only baseline LRT pathogen were excluded from the mITT population. No subjects were excluded from the mITT population due to important deviations or premature un-blinding of study treatment.

## CE Population

The CE population was a subset of the ITT population that included any subject who received study drug, adhered to the study protocol through the TOC visit, and had an evaluable clinical outcome (either Cure or Failure) at the TOC visit (or were classified as a clinical failure prior to the TOC visit).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ME Population

The ME population was a subset of the mITT population that included any subject who adhered to the study protocol through the TOC visit, had an evaluable clinical outcome (Cure or Failure) at the TOC visit (or  were classified  as  clinical  failure  prior to the  TOC  visit),  and  had  at  least  1  bacterial  respiratory pathogen (at the appropriate CFU/mL threshold) isolated from the baseline LRT culture. To be eligible for the ME population, the following quantitative bacterial counts were required: ≥ 10 5  CFU/mL for ETA, ≥ 10 4 CFU/mL for BAL/mini-BAL, and ≥ 10 3  CFU/mL for PBS.

## Safety Analysis Population

All safety analyses were based on a subset of the ITT population (the Safety Population), who received any  amount  (i.e.,  full  or  partial  dose)  of  study  drug.  All  subjects  received  their  randomly  assigned treatments, and no subjects with important deviations were excluded from the safety population.

## Sample size

This population comprised totally 726 subjects (i.e., 362 in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 364 in the meropenem arm). The study was designed to have at least 85.3% power to meet non-inferiority for the primary endpoint, assuming a cure rate of 58.4% in both arms. It was initially powered at 88%, but power decreased due to the planned futility look by DSMB when approximately 30% of patients had been enrolled.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was stratified by diagnosis (HABP or VABP) and by age (≥65 or &lt;65 years) to balance distribution of 726 subjects between the 2 double-blind treatment arms. Three pre-specified sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoints were conducted to confirm the overall robustness of the study results: 1) unadjusted for the stratification factors, 2) based on randomized stratification from IRT to evaluate the impact from mis-stratifications, and 3) stratified and un-stratified approaches based on a subset of subjects that were not forced randomized. Additional analyses were conducted in the mITT, CE, and ME populations across applicable time points, including Day 14, EOT, TOC (7 to 14 days after EOT), and LFU (28 to 35 days after EOT) for each primary efficacy endpoint. Subgroup analyses based on various demographic and baseline disease characteristics were also conducted for the primary efficacy endpoints.

## Blinding (masking)

This  is  a  double-blinded  study.  The  subject,  site  personnel  (with  the  exception  of  the  un-blinded pharmacist), Sponsor personnel (with the exception of the un-blinded drug supply and quality assurance teams, as appropriate) and Sponsor designees (with the exception of the un-blinded monitoring team) will  have  no  knowledge of treatment assignment. A treatment assignment was only un-blinded in a situation of urgent medical necessity when the identity of the study medication needed to be known in order to select appropriate continuing therapy for the disease under study or to manage an AE.

To maintain blinding of the study staff, an independent statistical reporting group will provide data to the DSMB.

The recommended dose of meropenem in this indication is 1000 mg q8h administered over 30 minutes. To facilitate blinding of the study, meropenem was administered as a one-hour infusion in this study to match the duration of infusion of ceftolozane/tazobactam. The efficacy of meropenem was not affected by administration  in  this  way,  as  it  is  a  β-lactam  antibiotic  whose  efficacy  depends  on  time  the  drug

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentration is greater than minimum-inhibitory concentration (MIC), see also Assessor's comment under 'Treatments'.

In  the  protocol,  it  is  stated  that  if  gram-negative  isolate(s)  with  varying  susceptibility  results  were present,  the  Investigator  was  strongly  encouraged  to  base  decisions  regarding  continuation  or discontinuation of study therapy on the clinical presentation of the patient and the totality of the available clinical and laboratory data, including the baseline LRT culture susceptibility testing results.

The handling of patients with resistant pathogens was therefore guided by clinical outcome in order to decide whether to continue or discontinue study therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

## Primary and key secondary objectives

The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses were conducted in the ITT population, defined as all randomized  subjects,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  received  study  drug.  Subjects  in  the  ITT population were categorized based on the treatment arm to which they were randomized.

The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  versus meropenem in adult subjects with VNP based on the difference in clinical response rates in the ITT population at the TOC visit (7 to 14 days after the EOT visit), using a non-inferiority margin of 12.5%.

The secondary key objective was to compare the Day 28 all-cause mortality rates of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem arms in the ITT population using a non-inferiority margin of 12.5%.

For both primary and key secondary objectives, a 2-sided 97.5% CI was constructed instead of 95% CIs. A sequential testing approach was used in order to maintain a 1-sided 0.0125 overall type I error rate across the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in the ITT population.

For categorical data, descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were provided for each category; 95% CIs were constructed around the percentage, when appropriate.

## Changes to the planned analysis

There were five versions of the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All revisions to the final SAP (version 2.0) occurred before database lock and un-blinding.

The  following  additional  changes  to  the  planned  analyses  were  performed post-hoc after  study un-blinding:

- To evaluate the impact of miss-stratification within each stratum for primary efficacy endpoints, the following sensitivity analyses were performed:
- -Clinical response at TOC visit by randomized stratum per EMA analysis (ITT Population)
- To  evaluate  the  magnitude  of  treatment  difference  in  TEAE  rates  in  the  safety  population, treatment  differences  and  associated  95%  CIs  for  the  key  TEAE  summary  categories  were provided. The magnitude of treatment differences in serious TEAE rates and associated 95% CIs for various serious TEAEs ( ≥ 1% of subjects in either treatment group) were also provided.
- To  evaluate  the  proportions  of  subjects  who  received  concomitant  non-study  antibiotic medications in the ITT population during the study treatment period, the non-study concomitant antibiotic medications between first and last dose of study drug by ATC class and preferred term were summarized.
- To evaluate the enrollment status of ICU patients on study, the number of subjects randomized while in the ICU was summarized.
- To evaluate the magnitude of treatment difference in clinical response on a pathogen level, per-pathogen clinical cure rates with associated unstratified 95% CIs were summarized for the mITT and ME populations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Handling of missing data

For all-cause mortality at Day 14 and Day 28, subjects with missing or unknown mortality outcomes were categorized as deceased. For time to all-cause mortality from randomization through LFU visit, subjects with a missing or unknown all-cause mortality status were analyzed using the following two approaches: 1) assumed missingness as death at the time of last study contact, and 2) assumed missingness as alive and censored at the time of last study contact.

For clinical response, missing data were handled using a TFA for the ITT and mITT populations and with a  DAO  approach  for  the  CE  and  ME  populations.  In  the  TFA,  subjects  with  a  missing  (including indeterminate)  efficacy  endpoint  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures.  In  the  DAO  approach,  all subjects with missing outcomes including indeterminate were excluded from the analysis.

## Recruitment

A total of 263 sites were opened for enrollment, of which 119 randomized at least 1 subject (whereof around 40 sites appear to have included only 1 patient). The majority of subjects was recruited from sites in Europe (in total 36.3% whereof 21.8% from the eastern part and 14.5% from the western part), Russia (in total 24.2%), Ukraine (in total 9.6%) and Georgia (in total 8.0%). Contributions from other continents were distributed as follows: Latin America (5.8%), North America (4.3%), Asia/Pacific (7.9%) and Rest of the World (3.9%).

| Rationale and Key Changes                                  | The comparator, imipenem, was revised to meropenem, widely used for the treatment of a variety of serious bacterial infections, including NP. The recommended dose in this indication, which was used in this study, was 1000 mg every 8 hours. To facilitate blinding, meropenem was administered as a 1-hour infusion in this study to match the duration of infusion of ceftolozane/tazobactam. A summary of risks and benefits for meropenem was added. The FDA primary objective was revised from the mITT to ITT population. Statistical comparisons were updated. cITT and clinical mITT were considered subsets of the ITT. CE was considered a subset of the cITT, and ME a subset of the mITT. The primary objective for all other regulatory jurisdictions was updated to the cITT, and the non- inferiority margin was reduced from 15% to 12.5% for other regulatory jurisdictions. Randomization stratification was updated to accommodate a reduced sample size with the addition of ventilated HABP subjects to the study population. A window for the duration of study drug administration was added, along with dose adjustment criteria for meropenem. PK sampling was added to the study assessments. Several criteria were added, clarified, modified, or removed: criteria for contraception were clarified, diagnostic criteria for subjects with ventilated HABP were added, standalone criteria for PaO2/FiO2 ratio were removed, exclusion criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome were removed, allowance of prior non-study antibiotic use for subjects who failed prior therapy was clarified, Gram-stain criteria were added, prohibited duration for prior receipt of meropenem was updated, hematocrit/hemoglobin criteria to exclude subjects based on critical care publications that lowered transfusion recommendation thresholds was modified, allowed window of baseline lower respiratory specimens for quantitative culture and procalcitonin samples was added, criterion to discontinue study drug if the LRT culture came back negative was removed, language for expected events was added, clinical and laboratory criteria for the definition of cure for the clinical outcomes at the EOT and LFU visits were updated, and language specifying that a | The comparator, imipenem, was revised to meropenem, widely used for the treatment of a variety of serious bacterial infections, including NP.

| Rationale and Key Changes                                  | In order to avoid selection bias in the PK/PD analyses, PK sample collection was changed from Day 3 to Day 4 to ensure that all subjects received at least 72 hours of therapy and reached steady state concentrations. Stratification factor APACHE II score was changed to age in order to better facilitate equal distribution of severity. The requirement for CLcr was updated from <50 to ≤50 to be consistent with the dosing recommendation for ceftolozane/tazobactam in renal impairment. Inclusion criteria describing the clinical criteria requirements were updated to be more consistent with FDA Guidance on Developing Drugs for treatment of HABP/VABP. Language was added to help clarify the following: the required for prior antibiotic therapy, use of alternatives to linezolid if it was standard of care at that site after prior approval from the medical monitor, use of imipenem or doripenem data as a surrogate for meropenem susceptibility at sites that did not include meropenem on the antiobiogram, use of alternatives to amikacin if standard of care at that site and prior approval from the medical monitor, and disclosures detailing the potential personnel that may become unblinded during the trial to assure quality of investigational drug product. Statistical methods were revised as follows: confidence intervals for analysis of dichotomous endpoints were changed from 2-sided of 95.034% to 95.002%, multiplicity analyses were only to be performed for the newly defined key secondary endpoints, all populations specific to EOT, TOC, and LFU were removed and a single CE population and a single ME population was used after removing the cITT population, study endpoints were reassigned and reprioritized based on the planned statistical analysis with consideration to the hierarchy of endpoints and multiplicity analyses and objectives corresponding to the updates in endpoints were updated, the primary population for EMA was changed from cITT to CE population, and ITT replaced the cITT analysis and was considered a key secondary endpoint, and a Data Monitoring Committee was to perform | In order to avoid selection bias in the PK/PD analyses, PK sample collection was changed from Day 3 to Day 4 to ensure that all subjects received at least 72 hours of therapy and reached steady state concentrations.

- Clarification was provided for making study drug treatment decisions, including adjunctive therapy, following the results of the baseline LRT culture.
- Based on the results of the baseline respiratory culture, the investigator had discretion for continuing or discontinuing study drug and the applicable adjunctive therapy based on the subject's clinical presentation.
- If unblinding occurred and the baseline LRT isolates were susceptible to the study drug received, open-label therapy was permitted regardless of study drug received.
- Language was added regarding the role of unblinded sponsor (or designee) and processes in place to ensure unblinding information was not divulged.
- Clarified that clinical failures, including the following, were NOT AEs: progression, relapse, or recurrence of new symptoms or complications attributable to VNP, as well as lack of resolution (persistence) or insufficient improvement in signs and symptoms of VNP which were present at baseline that required new or prolonged antibiotic therapy.
- The DSMB charter was amended to include only a futility look during the interim analysis. Therefore, it was no longer necessary to adjust the type I error rate in this study.

## Rationale and Key Changes

- Removed APACHE II score as an inclusion criterion since it was no longer required as an entry criterion in regulatory guidance documents.
- Changed treatment duration of study drug from a fixed duration of 8 days (with extension to 14 days only when Pseudomonas is isolated from baseline culture) to a treatment duration range of 8 to 14 days.
- If a prior LRT culture taken within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study drug produced a gram-negative pathogen, this confirmed a case of gram-negative bacterial pneumonia and took precedence over the results of a baseline Gram stain that showed only grampositive bacteria.
- Exclusion Criterion #6 was modified to allow for the entry of subjects who had ≤24 hours of a carbapenem within the 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Previously, any carbapenem use within the prior 15 days was excluded.
- Excluded medications were added that were contraindicated for the use of meropenem or linezolid.
- Guidance of patient management was modified following receipt of the baseline LRT susceptibility results. The requirement to discontinue a subject from study therapy if all baseline LRT gram-negative pathogens were resistant to both study drugs was maintained. The ability to unblind subjects and keep them on unblinded study drug based on presence of a resistant pathogen was removed.
- Replaced text referring specifically to the Etest device with language generally indicating that gradient test strips as well as other standard/validated antibiotic susceptibility testing methods may be used for testing susceptibility to ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem.

## Baseline blood pathogens

Overall, the proportion of subjects with bacteremia at baseline (16.3% versus 10.5%, respectively) and the distribution of baseline blood pathogens were comparable between the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem groups in the mITT population, and similar results were observed in the ME population. The most common blood pathogen in the mITT population was Staphylococcus epidermidis 17/511 (3.3%), and the most common gram-negative blood pathogen was K. pneumoniae 13/511 (2.5%).

The MIC50 and MIC90 values for gram-negative baseline blood pathogens were 2 and ≥256 μg/mL, respectively, for ceftolozane/tazobactam and 0.25 and 64 μg/mL, respectively, for meropenem in the mITT population with high MICs for both Staphylococcus epidermidis and K. pneumoniae . Similar results were observed in the ME population.

## Sensitivity analyses

Various sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were performed. Results for each sensitivity analysis are displayed in the Forest plot below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Meropenem ←Favor→Ceftolozane/Tazobactam %Difference (Ceftolozane/Tazobactam minus Meropenem)

<!-- image -->

Notes: For stratified, the adjusted proportions are a weighted average across strata of diagnosis (VABP, ventilated HABP) and age (&lt; 65, &gt;=65) categories constructed using Mehrotra-Railkar continuity-corrected-minimum risk (MRc) stratum weights. Forced assignment of subjects to a treatment arm was permitted and implemented in a blinded fashion when subjects were randomized to a study drug which was temporarily unavailable at the site.

[1] The 97.5% CIs are stratified Newcombe CIs for diagnosis and age factors using MRc stratum weights.

[2] The 97.5% CIs are unstratified Newcombe CIs.

## Superinfection and new infection rates in the mITT population

Superinfections in the mITT population were generally comparable between treatment groups with the number of subjects having a superinfection being 54/264 (20.5%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. 51/247 (20.6%) in the meropenem group. The most common superinfecting pathogen, isolated in &gt;5% of the subjects, was A. baumannii found in 24/264, 9.1% and 28/247, 11.3% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  meropenem  groups,  respectively.  Overall,  the  total  number  of  new pathogens classified as superinfections was higher for the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared to the meropenem group (74 vs. 58, respectively).

The most common new infecting pathogen was P. aeruginosa found in 8/264, 3.0% and 5/247, 2.0% of subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  meropenem  groups,  respectively,  closely  followed  by K.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

One  pivotal  phase  3  trial  (PN008)  and  three  phase  1  trials  ( PN018 , PN028 , PN007 )  have  been submitted in order to support the variation application for Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam). The applied extension  of  indication  for  ceftolozane/tazobactam  is  as  follows:  'Nosocomial  pneumonia,  including ventilator-associated pneumonia.'

Study  design .  The pivotal trial PN008 is  a  multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 study, comparing the efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam to meropenem in adult patients  with  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP)  (including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  [VAP]  and ventilated  hospital-acquired  pneumonia  [HAP]).  Patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem. The treatment duration was 8-14 days. Of note, according to IDSA treatment guideline  2016,  the  usual  treatment  duration  for  nosocomial  pneumonia  is  7  days. However, there exist situations in which a shorter or longer duration of antibiotics may be indicated, depending upon the rate of improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters. Originally, in the first approved protocol, a fixed treatment duration of 8 days was set, with an exception for when Pseudomonas was isolated from baseline culture; in such cases, it was allowed to extend the treatment to 14 days. However, when 433 subjects were enrolled, the protocol was amended to a treatment duration range of 8 to 14 days for all patients. The length of treatment for the patients was at each investigator's discretion.  It  is  acknowledged  that  patients  with  these  very  serious  and  potentially  life-threatening infections have to receive treatment as long as it is considered necessary, however, a set of clinical criteria, common for all participating study centres, guiding the investigators for when the patients should be given treatment beyond 8 days would have led to a more standardized approach across the study centres instead of completely leaving this decision to the individual investigator.

Study population. Patients diagnosed with either ventilated HAP or VAP were eligible to participate in the study provided that: for ventilated HAP: the patient had been either hospitalised for ≥ 48 hours or been discharged from a hospital within the prior 7 days, for VAP: mechanical ventilation had to be received ≥ 48 hours. For both conditions specified clinical signs or/and symptoms had to be fulfilled, in addition to chest radiograph/CT scan and a lower respiratory tract specimen at baseline. Several scoring systems were employed at baseline in order to assist the selection of a severely ill patient population (CPIS, SOFA and APACHE II score). Originally, the APACHE II score were part of the inclusion criteria (required a score of between 12-35 [inclusive]), but, this criterion was later removed after over 400 patients had been included into the study. Nevertheless, the score was still registered from all patients at baseline,  but  seemingly  the  change  in  score  was  not  recorded  post-baseline.  Changes  in  the inclusion/exclusion criteria after a significant number of patients have been enrolled can introduce bias. Although the subgroup analysis of patients with APACHE score &gt; 20 or &lt; 20 was inconclusive, a sensitivity analysis conducted on the subset of the 433 patients recruited prior to the change has been provided. This analysis reported the following: the observed treatment differences (TOL/TAZ - meropenem) and their 95% CIs were 4.4 (-9.55, 18.31) for Day 28 All-cause Mortality Rate by stratum and 1.9 (-13.46, 17.08) in the clinical response at Test of Cure (TOC) visit by stratum - EMA analysis. Hence, subjects enrolled under different protocol versions (ITT population) were both similar to overall results, although with more variability and wider confidence intervals, likely due to smaller sample sizes.

Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including diagnoses, were in line with the CHMP guidance and considered to ensure an enrolment of patients who are representative for the sought indication. It is, however, noted that patients with various comorbidities, such as e.g., NYHA Stage IV congestive heart failure, were excluded from the study, thereby excluding the most severely ill patients.

Concomitant/adjunctive  treatments. As ceftolozane/tazobactam only covers infections caused by gram-negative  pathogens,  the  patients  were  required  to  receive  empiric  gram-positive  adjunctive treatment (i.e., linezolid or an alternative if viewed necessary) at baseline. Only patients whose culture grew S. aureus (MRSA or MSSA) were to continue with linezolid (or alternative). This is acceptable. Subjects were also allowed to receive empiric adjunctive gram-negative (i.e., aminoglycoside-amikacin) therapy for ≤ 72 hours started at baseline at sites with &gt; 15% carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa pending baseline results. This cut-off of 15% was questioned by the SAWP/CHMP. It would require that all study sites had very high quality centre-specific data on recent rates of carbapenem resistance. The applicant  refers  to  the  2016  IDSA/ATS  and  2017  International  ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT  guidelines which  consider  a  range  varying  between  &gt;10-25%  local  prevalence  of  resistant  pathogens  as representing high-risk. This is acknowledged. Even if it is still unclear why the applicant chose a specific cut-off instead of a range, the study has been finalised and it is not considered that this choice has affected the study results. This issue will therefore not be further pursued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The handling of patients with resistant pathogens was guided by clinical outcome in order to decide whether to continue or discontinue study therapy.  However, there was a potential concern that this may compromise the blinding of the study as ceftolozane/tazobactam has shown good in vitro activity against P.  aeruginosa strains,  including  meropenem-resistant  strains.  If  laboratory  culture  data  indicated resistance to one of the study drugs, while clinical improvement was observed in a patient, this may have led  the  investigator  to  conclude  which  study  drug  the  patient  was  receiving.  SAWP/CHMP  therefore requested that the applicant should provide a justifiable strategy to manage this risk. It was originally proposed  that  if  the  patient  was  responding  to  therapy  (i.e.,  improving  clinical  signs  compared  to baseline) the investigator may either continue study therapy alone (with close monitoring), or continue study drug and add a new non-study antibiotic (e.g. amikacin for P. aeruginosa ). However, in the protocol version 7, it seems that the latter option no longer was allowed. Based on the patient's response on therapy, the study drug was to be either continued alone or discontinued. However, as the resistance pattern is partly different between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem it could still be possible to reveal which treatment group the patient belonged to. However, as it seems that there were rather few isolates of e.g. resistant P. aeruginosa strains in the study, this probably have concerned only a very small number of patients and therefore neither influenced the clinical outcome nor compromised the blinding.

Dose. The chosen dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam was 3000 mg (i.e., 2000 mg ceftolozane and 1000 mg tazobactam) administered every 8 hours as an IV infusion over 1 hour. This dose is higher than the currently  approved  dose  of  1500  mg  (i.e.,  1000  mg  ceftolozane  and  500  mg  tazobactam)  for  the indications cIAI and cUTI. The adequacy of TAZ exposure in patients with ARC (hyper clearance) is of concern  considering  critical  importance  of  the  adequate  initial  antibiotic  treatment  in  patients  with NP/VAP and as most patients may likely experience ARC/be ventilated during the treatment period. The applicant is asked to justify acceptability of a PTA &lt;90% for TAZ in patients with ARC considering the severity of infection, difficult-to-treat/less susceptible pathogens and potentially heavy bacterial load, and discuss whether there is a need for dose adjustment to optimize TAZ exposures in patients with different ARC-categories. The applicant is asked to provide additional simulations of alternative dosing regimens for TOL/TAZ with dose increment and/or prolonged infusion that may increase the chance of achieving pre-defined PD targets. For patients with severe renal impairment, the applicant has already proposed  a  dose  adjustment  for  TOL/TAZ,  which  however  resulted  in  slightly  insufficient/borderline exposures of TAZ (i.e. with a PTA 84%). During the procedure the applicant has justified the acceptability of a PTA &lt;90% for TAZ in patients with severe renal impairment. It is reassuring that very high PTA for TAZ was achieved in plasma (i.e.&gt;98%) in addition to very high TOL PTAs both in ELF and plasma.

Comparator. Meropenem is considered to be a relevant comparator for patients with NP and is approved for use in patients with HAP and/or VAP. The choice of comparator was also discussed with the SAWP and found to be, overall, acceptable.

Meropenem was given in a dose of 1000 mg every 8 hours. In order to facilitate the blinding in the study, an IV infusion over 1 hour was chosen. The dose of meropenem is acceptable and already approved for these severe pneumonias, however, the infusion time is usually recommended to be 15-30 minutes. Taking into consideration that the activity of meropenem is dependent on the proportion of the dosing interval that the drug concentration is greater than the MIC, and that meropenem prepared for infusion is stable for up to 4 hours at room temperature, the 1-hour infusion time is not considered to adversely affect its efficacy. In line with the approved SmPC for meropenem, the dose was adjusted for renally impaired patients.

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments

The protocol has been amended 10 times (6 global amendments and 4 country-specific amendments, resulting in 7 versions of the protocol), also after the study was initiated and patients enrolled. The protocol changed gradually during the study period including, among other things, removal of inclusion criterion  (APACHE  II  score),  change  of  the  analysis  population  for  the  primary  EMA  endpoint, non-inferiority margin (changed in SAP version 5.0) and key secondary endpoint. The MAH has confirmed that all protocol amendments were performed before database lock. Furthermore, the MAH stated that the integrity of the study was not compromised by any changes made to the primary and key secondary endpoints, as these were only changes in the structure of the final statistical analysis and not changes in study conduct or design.

## Protocol deviations

In total, there were over 30% of the subjects in the ITT population who had at least one important protocol deviation documented during the study. These deviations included mainly issues such as not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria (in total 8.8%), lack in  safety reporting (in total 2.5%) and not following trial procedures/study interventions (in total 26.2%). The number of patients with protocol deviations was, in general, similar between the two arms. The single protocol deviation that concerned most patients  in  both  study  arms  was  'Patients  who  were  mis-stratified  in  Bracket  (IXRS  system)' (26/362,  7.2%  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm  vs.  32/364,  8.8%  in  the  meropenem  arm).  The applicant conducted a sensitivity analysis (seemingly post-hoc) in order to evaluate the impact of this miss-stratification. This analysis concluded that the miss-stratification only had a minor impact on the result within each stratum of primary diagnosis factor. The high percentage of protocol deviations in the ITT population, led to a rather high percentage of subject data being excluded from the CE population (in total approximately 40%) which might have compromised the robustness of the estimates. In this study, clinical response in the CE population was a secondary endpoint. The results showed that the clinical cure rates were similar between the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and the meropenem arm for this endpoint and as such supported the results achieved for the primary and key secondary endpoint.

Endpoints. The primary objective for the analysis to be presented to the EMA was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem in adult subjects with ventilator-associated nosocomial pneumonia based on the difference in clinical response rates in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population at the TOC visit (7 to 14 days after the EOT visit), using a non-inferiority margin of - 12.5%. Aiming  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  towards  an  appropriate  reference  regimen  is  an  acceptable strategy  for  the  sought  indication  and  in  line  with  the  recommendation  of  the  CHMP  guideline.  Key secondary  objective  was  comparison  of  the  Day  28  all-cause  mortality  rates  of  subjects  in  the ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem arms in the ITT population.

There were a lot of secondary endpoints in this study, and all of these were in line with what is commonly evaluated  in studies for antimicrobial medicinal products  (i.e.,  per-subject  and  per  pathogen microbiological responses in the microbiological populations ME in addition to clinical responses in the same populations as well as in the CE population at the EOT, TOC and LFU visits). The per-subject and per pathogen  microbiological  responses  in  the  mITT  population  was  chosen  as  exploratory  endpoints, however, the results were still provided together with the corresponding results in the ME population.

However, the CHMP guideline and the SAWP/CHMP scientific advice, recommended to view the ITT and the  CE  population  as  co-primary.  The  advice  was  not  followed  by  the  applicant.  This  is  considered unfortunate, as it would have been preferable that the evaluation of the clinical cure rates had been performed  in  both  the  ITT  and  CE  populations  using  the  same  level  of  statistical  power.  It  is acknowledged, though, that in the new draft CHMP guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indicated for treatment of bacterial infections from 14 January 2019, it is suggested that the primary analysis should be clinical outcome in only the ITT population at the TOC visit. However, this draft is out for consultation until 31 July 2019 and is therefore not yet put into force.

Sample size. The population comprised totally 726 patients; 362 patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. 364 patients in the meropenem group. The study was designed to have at least 85.3% power to meet the non-inferiority for the primary endpoint, assuming a cure rate of 58.4% in both arms. It was initially  powered  at  88%,  but  power  decreased  due  to  the  planned  futility  look  by  DSMB  when approximately 30% of patients had been enrolled. Overall, the sample size used is considered adequate and the power of the study is deemed acceptable.

Statistical methods. The proposed primary analyses as well as the planned supportive analyses are endorsed. A Treatment Failure Approach was applied to handle missing data for mITT and ITT population. This seems conservative and hence is acceptable. Data-as-observed approach was applied to handle missing  data  for  clinical  responses  in  ME  and  CE  populations.  This  approach  is  generally  not recommended in confirmatory studies due to risk of population selection bias and reduction of power and underestimation of variability (EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev. 1). A sensitivity analysis whereby another imputation  approach  is  applied  was  provided  by  the  applicant  during  the  procedure.  This  analysis demonstrated that the observed treatment differences (TOL/TAZ - meropenem) and their 95% CIs were 3.4 (-3.60, 10.32) in the CE at TOC population and 4.0 (-2.61, 10.58) in the ME at TOC population, both meeting the non-inferiority criterion of TOL/TAZ compared to meropenem.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Baseline characteristics. Since patients with NP, in particular those receiving mechanically assisted ventilation, are usually very ill and have multiple co-morbidity factors, it is crucial for a clinical study on this condition to ensure that the included population is as representative as possible. In the current study, an adequate number of patients with different risk factors were included; APACHE II scores over 15 in &gt; 70% (and mean value of 17), the majority of patients had CPIS score &gt; 8, relatively high percentage of high age (44% ≥ 65 years old whereof &gt; 20% ≥ 75 years of age) and &gt; 70% were diagnosed with VAP. This is reassuring and contributes to the external validity of the study. Subjects were hospitalized for a mean duration of 10.4 days prior to randomization, and 49.3% were ventilated for ≥5 days prior to randomization. The fact that patients had been hospitalised as long as 10 days (on average) before randomisation would ensure that most patients have acquired infection from pathogens located in the hospital environment. Only 14.5%  of patients had bacteraemia at baseline (in the pooled ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem group). There was a relatively low total number of subjects with moderate (8.4%) or severe renal failure (5.2%) and co-morbidities like COPD (12%), diabetes (22%) and congestive heart failure (16%), however, this is a consequence of the exclusion criteria which prevent the most severely ill patients from being included into the study.

Baseline  microbiology. Endotracheal  aspirate (ETA)  was  the  dominant  method  for  the  specimen collection (ca. 50% in both arms). This is considered acceptable as ETA is now suggested as superior to invasive  or  non-invasive  sampling  with  quantitative  cultures  (BMJ  2016).  The  pathogens  isolated  at baseline  reflect  the  pattern  of  pathogens  most  commonly  detected  for  NP.  The  most  common gram-negative pathogens isolated at baseline in both treatment groups were K. pneumoniae (approx. 35%), P. aeruginosa (25%) and E. coli (18%). In total, approximately 63% of the randomised patients in the two study groups had a mono-microbial infection and at least one valid pathogen at baseline. Nearly all of the patients (98%) in the mITT population had a gram-negative LRT pathogen isolated at baseline.

Both ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem showed significant activity against most LRT pathogens. Overall,  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  meropenem  MIC  distributions  for  the  most  common  LRT pathogens at baseline were similar across the mITT and ME populations. The favourable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility data for P. aeruginosa is encouraging, and may pose an advantage for the study drug compared to alternative regimens. However, the number of isolates with MIC ≥ 8 µg/mL encountered in the study PN008 were in general limited, especially with P. aeruginosa isolates (n=5).

The susceptibility interpretation at baseline was performed using provisional breakpoints for ceftolozane/tazobactam. In general, the susceptibility data were comparable between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem. It is noted, though, that 54/175 (30.9%) K. pneumoniae LRT isolates  were  resistant  to  ceftolozane/tazobactam  compared  to  1/176  (0.6%)  isolates  resistant  to meropenem.

Primary  and  key  secondary  endpoint. Non-inferiority  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  compared  to meropenem  was  demonstrated  for  both  the  primary  endpoint  'clinical  response  at  TOC  in  the  ITT population' (197/362, 54.4% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 194/364, 53.3% in the meropenem arm) and for the key secondary endpoint, 'Day 28 all-cause mortality in the ITT population' (87/362, 24.0% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 92/364, 25.3% in the meropenem arm). The lower limits of the stratified 97.5% CIs were within -12.5% for the primary endpoint ( 1.1 [-7.20, 9.31]) and for the key secondary endpoint ( 1.1 [-6.03, 8.28]).

The results from the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the results achieved in the primary analysis and key secondary analysis for the ITT population, indicating that the stratification factors diagnosis (HAP or VAP) and age (≥ 65 or &lt; 65 years) did not impact on the primary results, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the primary analyses.

Concerning the diagnosis VAP, the clinical response rate was similar for patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and patients in the meropenem group (i.e., 147/263, 55.9% vs. 146/256, 57.0%, respectively). A tendency towards a numerically higher Day 28 all-cause mortality rate was observed  for  the  diagnosis  VAP  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (63/263,  24.0%)  vs.  the meropenem group (52/256, 20.3%). For the diagnosis ventilated HAP, a tendency towards numerically higher  cure  rate  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  vs.  the  meropenem  group  (50/99,  50.5%  vs. 48/108, 44.4%) and lower mortality rate (24/99, 24.2% vs. 40/108, 37.0%) was seen.

## Other secondary endpoints.

Clinical  response  rates. The  clinical  cure  rates  in  the  CE  population  were  similar  between  the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem arms (139/218, 63.8% vs. 143/221, 64.7%, respectively). For both groups, the rate was higher compared to the cure rate reported for the ITT population (primary analysis). However, as already previously mentioned, due to the high percentage of exclusion of patients from this population (ca. 40%), the robustness of the estimates might have been compromised.

In  the  mITT  and  ME  populations  the  clinical  cure  rates  were  similar  to  the  results  seen  in  the  CE population. They were also comparable between the two treatment arms. It is noted that the clinical cure rate at TOC showed a numerical trend in favour of ceftolozane/tazobactam in the ME population (87/115, 75.7% vs. 78/118, 66.1% in the meropenem arm).

## Microbiological response rates.

Per-subject  microbiological  response: The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  mITT  population  in  both  the ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (193/264  [73.1%]  subjects)  and  the  meropenem  group  (168/247 [68.0%] subjects) had a favourable microbiological response. The results were consistent between the mITT and ME populations in both study groups for the TOC visit.

Per-pathogen  microbiological  response: In  general,  the  microbiological  response  rates  by  pathogen showed similar response rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem. It is unclear how many  of  the  isolates  that  were  eradicated  and  how  many  were  only  presumed  eradicated.  In  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

applicant's response, it was clarified that for nearly half of the baseline pathogens, the highest percentage was presumed eradicated and this was the case for both arms. Overall, the differences between the eradicated rate and the presumed eradicated rate for the two arms were rather small and consistent with the observations made for the eradication and presumed eradication rate taken together as previously presented by the applicant.

The microbiological eradication rates were higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared with the meropenem group for P. aeruginosa (47/63, 74.6% vs. 41/65, 63.1%), Enterobacteriaceae (145/195, 74.4% vs. 129/185, 69.7%) and H. influenzae (20/22, 90.9% vs. 11/16, 68.8%). The response rates were lower for ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem for ESBL+ K. pneumoniae (33/53, 62.3% vs. 38/52, 73.1%).  Although there was approximately 11% difference in the microbiological response rates in the mITT population, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy toward these isolates considering the overall outcomes. As already noted, 49.5% (52/105) of ESBL + K. pneumoniae isolates  treated  in  the  study  were  resistant  to  ceftolozane/tazobactam  while  none  were  resistant  to meropenem (0/105). The distribution of these isolates between the study arms is, however, unknown. The applicant was asked to specify the distribution of resistant isolates to the study arms, and discuss whether this might explain the lower microbiological response rates for ESBL + K. pneumoniae in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm compared to the meropenem arm (i.e. 62.3% [33/53] vs. 73.1% [38/52], respectively). The applicant presented the microbiological outcome in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm for subjects with ESBL positive K. pneumoniae that were resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam. stating that  28  ESBL  + K.  pneumoniae resistant  isolates  were  present  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm. Comparisons were made between the patients with ESBL + K. pneumoniae resistant isolates as baseline LRT pathogen and the overall patient population receiving ceftolozane/tazobactam with regards to clinical response rate and the Day 28 all-cause mortality rate. Furthermore, the results for the per-pathogen microbiological  response  rate  for  the  total  ESBL  + K.  pneumonia e  (susceptible  +  intermediate  + resistant)  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm  were  compared  to  the  per-pathogen  microbiological response rate for the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm with only ESBL + K. pneumoniae resistant isolates. The results showed that all the rates were comparable between the two groups, and therefore it seems like the observed difference noted between the treatment arms for the species was not entirely driven by resistance against ceftolozane/tazobactam. However, as the number of ESBL + K. pneumoniae resistant isolates was very limited, the results could also be random. It is therefore not possible to draw any firm conclusions and the issue will not be further pursued.

The applicant was asked to discuss the risks associated with using ceftolozane/tazobactam empirically in clinical  settings  in  case  of  infections  caused  by  ESBL+ K.  pneumoniae and  propose  risk  mitigation measures to avoid that risk. In their response, the MAH referred to that in the setting of empiric use, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns will inform whether ceftolozane/tazobactam is likely to provide benefit to the patient. The answer from the MAH is noted. In addition, the information in Section 5.1 in the SmPC now adequately reflects the pathogens that are susceptible and resistant respectively towards ceftolozane/tazobactam  in  order  to  guide  prescribers  in  choosing  the  most  potentially  effective antibacterial agent in an empirical setting. The MAH states in the RMP that they will continue to monitor the emergence of bacterial resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam through routine PV.

Concerning P. aeruginosa overexpressing AmpC (9 isolates in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. 6 in the  meropenem  group),  the  number  of  samples  was  unfortunately  too  low  to  make  any  valid assumptions.

Overall, the results in the ME analysis population were consistent with those in the mITT population for both study groups. It is noted that in this population the response rates for ESBL+ K. pneumoniae were similar for the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem group, respectively (20/30, 66.7% vs. 18/27, 66.7%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No trend for outcome by MIC could be discerned.

Non-study  concomitant  antibiotic  medication. Twenty-one  percent  (77/362)  of  patients  in  the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm received carbapenems as non-study concomitant antibiotic medication. Of these patients, 17.4% (63/362) received meropenem. The concomitant antibiotics could be administered at any time during the treatment period. It is therefore uncertain at which time point patients might have received  carbapenems  and  for  which  duration.  This  concomitant  administration  of  carbapenems (including  meropenem)  as  'any  non-study  concomitant  antibiotic  medication'  to  the  patients  in  the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm might have impacted the clinical and microbiological response rates. This hampers the interpretation of the efficacy outcomes due to the assumed bias, and raises a question whether the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam might have been overestimated. During the procedure the MAH clarified that 58/362 (16%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 39/364 (10.7%) in the meropenem group received carbapenems as non-study concomitant medication before TOC. According to the MAH, given that, only 2 subjects received ≥ 1 dose of a non-study carbapenem concomitantly with study drug treatment (i.e., until EOT), there is no expected impact on the results of the primary endpoints or microbiological response rates. While this is agreed, considering that clinical cure at TOC is the primary endpoint, it is the number of patients receiving a non-study carbapenem from study start to TOC visit that is of interest and could have an impact on the primary endpoint results. As requested, the MAH has performed a sensitivity analysis where the 10/58 patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm receiving non-study carbapenems up until TOC vs. the corresponding 7/39 patients in the meropenem arm, were calculated as clinical failures. This analysis demonstrated that this re-calculation did not impact the final study  results  (clinical  response  at  TOC:  187/362,  51.7%  [failures:  175/362,  48.3%]  for  the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 187/364, 51.4% [failures: 177/364, 48.6%] for the meropenem group). Most of the patients receiving concomitant carbapenems were clinical failures at EOT and needed further treatment for the pneumonia. Since the results from the sensitivity analysis in which patients receiving concomitant carbapenems were regarded as clinical failures were comparable to the results in the overall study population, it is agreed that the use of concomitant carbapenems before TOC probably have not affected the clinical outcome of the study.

Subgroups. In general, for the majority of the subgroups the cure rates or mortality rates showed no or only minor  difference  between  the  two  study groups  or were  numerically in favour of the ceftolozane/tazobactam group. However, imbalances were observed between the following subgroups: The Day 28 All-cause mortality rate in the subgroup of patients with P.  aeruginosa as  baseline  LRT pathogen, tended to be higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. the meropenem group (16/63, 25.4%  vs.  12/65,  18.5%,  respectively).  The  same  tendencies  were  also  seen  for  the  subgroups bacteremic at baseline (all respiratory pathogens, 14/29, 48.3% vs. 7/21, 33.3%) and bacteremic at baseline (all gram-negative respiratory pathogens, 13/25, 52.0% vs. 7/19, 36.8%). The MAH clarified that there are differences in the demographics of TOL/TAZ versus meropenem: a higher percentage of subjects ≥75 years old in the TOL/TAZ group (23.8%) compared to the meropenem group (16.9%), a higher rate of subjects that had failed prior antibiotic therapy (17.5% vs. 6.2%) and of subjects that were bacteremic at baseline (27.0% vs. 10.8%). In addition, there was a higher proportion of subjects with different  co-morbidities  (i.e.  diabetes,  congestive  heart  failure)  in  the  TOL/TAZ  group  than  in  the meropenem group. It is agreed that these differences in demographic factors between the treatment groups might have affected the study results.

Clinical cure rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem tended to be lower in those ≥75 years of age (35/83, 42.2% vs. 42/76, 55.3%), having had no prior antibiotic therapy (19/44, 43.2% vs. 23/41, 56.1%) and having had baseline gram-negative adjunctive therapy (47/103, 45.6% vs. 64/112, 57.1%). During the procedure the MAH clarified that increased failure rate in patients &gt;75 years of age as well as patients who did not receive any antibiotic therapy prior to study entry may be attributed to the differences  in  demographics  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  versus  meropenem-treated  subjects  in  this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subgroup as ceftolozane/tazobactam subjects displayed more high-risk characteristics at baseline. This is considered reasonable. It is also agreed that rates of susceptibility to study therapy which were lower in the subjects with Enterobacteriaceae in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared to the meropenem group (84.4% vs. 100%) could contribute to a lower clinical response rate in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group.

Furthermore, the applicant was asked to state how many of the patients with impaired renal function did receive the per-protocol (CE) defined reduced dose regimen and specify the outcome. The MAH clarified that all subjects with moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline received the per-protocol reduced dose within the treatment period. Fifty-two (14.4%) patients with moderate/severe renal impairment were  treated  with  TOL/TAZ,  while  47  (12.9%)  were  treated  with  meropenem.  In  32  (61.5%)  and 26 (55.3%) patients treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem, respectively, the treatment failed.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In general, the included patient population is considered to be representative for the applied indication. Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam to meropenem has been clearly demonstrated in these patients for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoint.  The  issues  related  to  efficacy  has  been  adequately addressed. No outstanding concerns remains. Conclusion on the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam in the indication of NP including VAP is considered demonstrated. Hence, Zerbaxa may be granted an extension of the current indication from the efficacy point of view.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The  safety  assessment  is  based  on  a  single  phase  III  study PN008 (P008MK7625A)  where ceftolozane/tazobactam 3 g dose is compared to meropenem 1 g dose. A total of 361 patient were exposed to ceftolozane/tazobactam.

Notes: n=Number of subjects in specific category. N=Number of subjects in ITT population. N1=Number of subjects prematurely discontinuing study drug in ITT population. N2=Number of subjects prematurely withdrawing from study in ITT population. ESRD: end stage renal disease. Premature discontinuation or withdrawal due to adverse event includes death.

The majority (63%) of subjects received between 8 and 14 days of study therapy as specified in the protocol,  with  comparable  mean  duration  of  exposure  in  both  treatment  groups;  20.7%  of  subjects received less than the specified minimum treatment course of 8 days.

## Adverse events

A  high  proportion  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  experienced  TEAEs  (84.6%),  including  a substantial proportion of subjects who experienced serious TEAEs (39%) and fatal TEAEs (28.6%). In general, the incidence of TEAEs and deaths were reported in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group. None of the deaths were considered to be related to the study drug therapy. The incidence of drug-related TEAEs, drug-related serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were low and similar between the treatment groups. Overall, 45.8% of subjects had TEAEs that were mild to moderate in severity whereas 38.8% had severe TEAEs. The proportion of subjects in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each category of severity was similar between the treatment groups. The incidence of serious TEAEs was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group (42.1%) compared with the meropenem group (35.9%).

Notes: n=Number of subjects in specific category. N=Number of subjects in Safety population. Percents are calculated as 100 x (n/N).

Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 17.0. TEAE=Treatment Emergent Adverse Event. A TEAE is defined as an AE that starts on/after the first study drug administration. For each category, subjects are counted only once, even if they experienced multiple events in the category.

1. If subjects have multiple events, they are counted only once with the maximum (highest) severity rating. The orders of severity from worst case to best case are severe, moderate, and mild.

2. If subjects have multiple events and at least one is related, then the AE is counted as related to study drug.

## Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events

In general, the incidence of subjects with TEAEs and the types of TEAEs seen were generally similar between the 2 treatment groups, distributed across multiple body systems, and typical of ventilated subjects with NP receiving antibiotic therapy, many of whom had significant underlying comorbidities and multiple concomitant therapies which contributed to the reported events.

Anemia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and decubitus ulcer were the most frequently reported TEAEs (&gt;5% of subjects overall) during the study and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group. TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included anemia, decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and increased ALT and AST. The majority of the TEAEs of increased ALT and AST in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group were mild or moderate in severity and not related to study drug therapy. In the meropenem group, anemia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, hydrothorax, and hypotension occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects. Note that for each preferred term, subjects were counted only once even if they experienced multiple events of the preferred term. No TEAE was reported in more than 10% of subjects overall; the only TEAE preferred term reported in &gt;10% of subjects in either treatment group was anemia reported in the meropenem group.

The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with TEAEs were infections and infestation (35.3% of subjects overall) and gastrointestinal disorders (24.6% of subjects overall) and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group.

## Severity

Overall, 45.8% of subjects had TEAEs that were mild to moderate in severity, whereas 38.8% had severe TEAEs.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  TEAEs  was  similar  between  the treatment groups. The high percentage of severe TEAEs was not unexpected in this critically ill population with underlying comorbid conditions.

## Related to Study Treatment

The incidence of investigator-assessed, drug-related TEAEs was low and comparable in the 2 treatment groups  (38  [10.5%]  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  and  27  [7.5%]  subjects  in  the meropenem group. Diarrhea, increased ALT and AST, and increased hepatic enzyme were the most common drug-related TEAEs ( ≥ 0.8% of subjects overall) and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group.

A total of 8 (1.1%) subjects (5 [1.4%] subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 3 [0.8%] subjects  in  the  meropenem  group)  had  drug-related  TEAEs  that  were  considered  severe.  In  the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, the events were bradycardia, diarrhea, hepatic failure, systemic candida, increased ALT, increased AST, and increased gamma glutamyl transferase. The events of increased ALT, AST,  and  gamma  glutamyl  transferase,  which  were  considered  serious  TEAEs  and  resulted  in discontinuation of study therapy, all occurred in a single subject. These increases did not meet laboratory criteria  for  potential  drug-induced  liver  injury.  The  TEAE  of  hepatic  failure,  which  resulted  in discontinuation of study therapy, represented a worsening of a baseline medical history of hepatic failure in this subject admitted following cardiac arrest. The event was not considered serious and did not meet laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury. In the meropenem group, the drug-related TEAEs that were considered severe were diarrhea, cholestatic hepatitis, and C. difficile infection.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious Adverse Events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A substantial proportion of subjects experienced serious TEAEs (281 [39%]) in both treatment groups, consistent with the critically ill population under study. The proportion of subjects with serious TEAEs was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group (42.1%) compared to the meropenem group (35.9%). No single SOC or preferred term was responsible for this imbalance.

A post-hoc safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the magnitude of treatment differences in serious TEAE rates and associated 95% CIs for various serious TEAEs. Results of these analyses confirm that the 95% CI for the overall treatment difference in the serious TEAE rate included 0. The serious TEAEs that occurred more frequently in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group were widely distributed among a variety of SOCs and preferred terms.

Source: [P008MK7625A: analysis-adsl; adae]

The 12 serious TEAE preferred terms that occurred in &gt;1% of subjects and were more frequent in the ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  were  distributed  across  7  different  SOCs.  Among  these,  cerebral hemorrhage, which occurred in 5 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and no subjects in the meropenem group, was the only serious TEAE preferred term with a 95% CI for risk difference that did not include 0. In 4 of these 5 subjects, the cerebral hemorrhage represented a worsening of underlying intracranial hemorrhage that was present as an admission diagnosis on medical history. The remaining subject was admitted with an ischemic stroke and the cerebral hemorrhage occurred 1 day after the subject received thrombolytic therapy for a pulmonary embolism. In 3 of the 5 subjects, the cerebral hemorrhage occurred after completion of study drug therapy. None of the 5 events were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug therapy. There was no change in mean prothrombin time or decrease in mean platelet count from baseline through the EOT visit in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group to  suggest  an  induced  hypocoagulable  state.  There  was  no  imbalance  in  serious  TEAEs  related  to hemorrhage at other anatomical sites.

No serious TEAE was reported in &gt;4% of subjects in either treatment group. The SOCs with the highest percentage  of  subjects  with  serious  TEAEs  were  cardiac  disorders  (10.0%  of  subjects  overall)  and infections and infestations (9.0% of subjects overall), each occurring in a similar proportion of subjects in the 2 treatment groups. Septic shock and multi-organ failure were the most commonly reported serious TEAE preferred terms (&gt;3% of subjects overall) and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group.

## Serious TEAEs related to the study drug

Among subjects that had serious TEAEs, only 10 subjects (8 in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group versus 2 in the meropenem group) experienced serious TEAEs that were considered related to study drug by the investigator. Only C. difficile colitis was reported by more than 1 subject as a treatment-related serious TEAE  ( C.  difficile colitis  was  reported  by  2  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group).  All treatment-related serious TEAEs had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study.

Notes: n=Number of subjects in specific category. N=Number of subjects in Safety population. Percents are calculated as 100 x (n/N).

Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 17.0. For each system organ class and preferred term, subjects are counted only once, even if they experienced multiple events in the system organ class or preferred term.

## Deaths

A total of 206 (28.6%) deaths were reported during the study and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in the 2 treatment groups. Fatal serious TEAEs were distributed across multiple SOCs. The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with fatal TEAEs were cardiac disorders (6.7% of subjects overall) and  nervous  system  disorders  (6.0%  of  subjects  overall),  each  occurring  in  a  similar  proportion  of subjects in the 2 treatment groups. Multi-organ failure, septic shock, brain edema, and cardiac failure acute were the most commonly reported TEAE preferred terms leading to death (&gt;2% of subjects overall) and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group.

All TEAEs leading to death were considered unrelated to study drug therapy by the investigator and in general were related to underlying comorbidities or complications that developed while the subject was enrolled in the study.

## Laboratory findings

A comparable number of subjects in each treatment group experienced a shift from baseline in laboratory values. The incidence and magnitude of the shifts were consistent between the 2 treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hematology

The baseline hematology parameters were similar between the 2 treatment groups. For all scheduled visits (Day 3, Day 8, EOT, TOC, and LFU), no apparent differences were seen in mean values and mean changes from baseline between the 2 treatment groups in any particular parameter.

The overall incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 toxicity was low and similar between the 2 treatment groups. For hemoglobin, the majority of subjects that had Grade 3 or 4 toxicity at EOT had abnormal values of  Grade  2  to  4  at  baseline.  Considering  the  severity  of  illness  in  this  study  population,  the incidence of worsening grade shifts during treatment was low and comparable for both treatment groups.

Seroconversion  of  direct  Coombs  test  from  negative  to  positive  is  a  known  side  effect  of  β-lactam exposure.  A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  compared  to  the meropenem group seroconverted from a negative result at baseline to a positive direct Coombs test result at  EOT,  36%  versus  3.6%.  The  seroconversion  rates  observed  were  similar  to  those  seen  in  other cephalosporin clinical trials. There were no TEAEs or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hemolytic anemia in these subjects, and rates of TEAEs of anemia were similar between the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem groups.

## Clinical Chemistry

The baseline chemistry parameters were similar between the 2 treatment groups. For all scheduled visits (Day 3, Day 8, EOT, TOC, and LFU), no apparent differences were seen in mean values and mean changes from baseline between the 2 treatment groups in any particular parameter.

The overall incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 toxicity was low. Considering the severity of illness in this study population, the incidence of worsening grade shifts during treatment was low and comparable for both treatment groups.

Mild, transient transaminase elevations are a known side effect of β-lactam therapy. The number of subjects who demonstrated shifts from baseline in ALT or AST values and the magnitude of the shifts were similar in both treatment groups at each time point assessed. Mean serum transaminases increased slightly during therapy in both treatment groups, peaking mostly at the EOT visit.

Six subjects met predefined laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (Hy's law) (an AST or  ALT  value ≥ 3 times the ULN and a total bilirubin level ≥ 2 times the ULN with concurrent alkaline phosphatase value &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal): 2 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 4 in the meropenem group. Both subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group had medical histories of liver disease prior to study enrollment. One of these subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group had a medical history of cirrhosis and met the laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury at baseline  prior  to  initiation  of  study  drug  therapy,  precluding  drug-induced  hepatotoxicity  related  to ceftolozane/tazobactam as a cause for the LFT abnormalities. The other subject had a nonserious TEAE of

' elevated LFT ' considered unrelated to study drug therapy that was reported on study Day 4 after hospital admission for cardiac arrest. This subject completed a 10-day course of ceftolozane/tazobactam. There were no clinical, hepatic-related TEAEs reported in this subject.

## Safety in special populations

## Safety in elderly subjects

In  PN008, the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs and fatal TEAEs were higher in subjects ≥65 years of age compared to those &lt;65 years of age. The higher incidence of TEAEs among elderly subjects was observed in  both  treatment  groups,  and  was  not  associated  with  higher  rates  of  drug-related  TEAEs  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuations due to TEAEs, suggesting that this difference was related to the subjects' underlying condition and not the study medication.

## Safety in subjects with renal impairment or hyperclearance

In PN008, increased incidence of TEAEs and serious TEAEs was observed in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment at baseline in both treatment groups compared with subjects with mild renal impairment, normal renal function, or hyperclearance (defined as CrCL &gt;150 mL/min). There were no drug-related serious TEAEs in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment in either treatment group. TEAEs with higher incidence in subjects with moderate and severe baseline renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function were distributed across multiple body systems. TEAE rates in subjects with hyperclearance were comparable to rates in subjects with normal renal function. TOL and TAZ plasma.  The number of drug-related TEAEs in subjects with hyperclearance was low in both treatment groups.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The  potential  for  DDIs  has  been  extensively  evaluated  in  non-clinical in  vitro studies,  showing  that TOL/TAZ has minimal potential for  cytochrome  P450-  and  transporter  mediated  DDIs  in  humans  at clinically relevant concentrations. A clinical study to evaluate the potential of TOL/TAZ to influence the PK of substrates metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 or transported by OAT1/OAT3 showed minimal impact on the PK profiles of these substrates. Inhibition of OAT has been shown to increase the half-life of TAZ by 71%. Overall, based on these evaluations, the potential for clinically-relevant DDIs with TOL/TAZ and any consequent impact on safety is low.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total of 79 (11.0%) subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. The proportion of discontinuations was similar between the 2 treatment groups. The majority of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug were AEs that resulted in death.

The SOCs with the highest percentage of TEAEs that lead to discontinuation from study drug therapy were infections and infestations (2.2% of subjects overall) and nervous system disorders (2.2% of subjects overall),  each  with  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  2  treatment  groups.  TEAEs  that  lead  to discontinuation from study drug therapy reported in &gt;1% of subject in either treatment group were septic shock and brain edema, which occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group, and renal failure acute, which occurred in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group.

Among  the  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  drug-related  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in incidence and similar between the 2 treatment groups.

## Post marketing experience

Current post-marketing experience with TOL/TAZ (ceftolozane/ tazobactam) relates to the approved dose of 1.5 g administered every 8 hours in populations with cIAI and cUTI. While there are differences in the dose and patient population between these currently approved indications and the proposed NP indication, available post-marketing data are summarized below to provide overall context for the current known safety profile of TOL/TAZ.

TOL/TAZ was first approved for use for cIAI and cUTI in the U.S. on 19-DEC-2014 and is registered in 66 countries as of 01-AUG-2018. There have been no records of any registration being revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A cumulative review of post-marketing adverse events was conducted through 30-JUN-2018 and did not identify new safety issues.

## Post marketing Exposure

The number of vials of TOL/TAZ (1 vial=1 g TOL and 0.5 g TAZ) distributed worldwide cumulatively since market introduction (19-DEC-2014 to 30-JUN-2018) was approximately 1,535,761. The usual dose of TOL/TAZ is 1 vial administered every 8 hours. The number of patient treatment-days for the cumulative period is 511,920 [1,535,761 vials ÷ 3 vials/day]. The usual duration of therapy is from 4 to 14 days, depending on the type of infection. This would imply that the estimated number of treatment courses would theoretically range between 36,566 (511,920 patient treatment days ÷ 14 days) and 127,980 (511,920 patient treatment days ÷ 4  days).  These  treatment courses represent an estimate of the number of patients receiving TOL/TAZ in the post-marketing environment.

## Post marketing Adverse Events

A total of 951 reports (159, 17% serious) containing 1,517 events (263, 17% serious) were identified. The  SOCs  in  which  AEs  were  most  commonly  reported  were  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural complications (925 events), General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (277 events), and Infections and infestations SOC (80 events).

The most commonly reported preferred terms in the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC were off label use (n=407) and product use in unapproved indication (n=279). Off label/unapproved use involved treatment of pneumonia or respiratory tract infections in the majority of the reports.

Because of extensive 'off-label' use the MAH has been instructed to provide a cumulative review of all cases including unapproved indication, prescribing error and incorrect drug administration duration. The worry  is  that  'off-label'  use  may  increase  the  risk  of  resistance  development.  Approval  of  the  new indication of nosocomial pneumonia has a potential to lower the widespread 'off-label' use.

The  most  commonly  reported  preferred  term  in  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  was  pathogen resistance  (n=25).  The  other  preferred  terms  reported  in  this  SOC  reflect  the  critically-ill  nature  of patients receiving TOL/TAZ or infections TOL/TAZ was being utilized to treat. For the resistance events, limited  clinical  and  microbiologic  data  precluded  thorough  assessment  of  reports.  Risk  factors  for development of resistance were often present including use of multiple antimicrobial agents to treat infections  caused  by  multidrug  resistant  organisms  and  failure  to  properly  remove  infected  foci.  In addition, the dosing regimen for off label use of TOL/TAZ for NP was often not provided. In some of the reports where dose was included, 1.5 g was administered instead of the 3 g dose used in the clinical trial for NP (PN008). Insufficient antimicrobial levels are also a risk factor for development of antimicrobial resistance.

In addition to the most commonly reported events described above, events known to be associated with TOL/TAZ,  including  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  CDAD,  were  reviewed.  One  report  coded  to  the preferred term anaphylaxis was retrieved. Available data in the case was limited and the event described redness and skin eruption with no other signs or symptoms. For CDAD, 6 reports, all serious, were retrieved. These reports described patients who had been administered other broad spectrum antibiotics and had significant comorbid conditions. Of the 5 CDAD reports containing outcome information, outcome was recovered in 2, recovering in 1, and not recovered in 2.

Other events which have been reported following exposure to the cephalosporin class, including severe cutaneous reactions and renal impairment, were also reviewed. No reports of severe cutaneous adverse reactions were identified. Cumulatively, a total of 21 events, including 18 SAEs, have been reported in the Renal  and  urinary  disorders  SOC.  These  reports  either  contained  limited  information  or  the  events occurred in patients with underlying high morbidity due to medical history and/or concurrent conditions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which precluded a meaningful drug-event causality assessment. No new safety signals were identified based upon review of these data.

The applicant has an established process for continuous monitoring of medication errors for its products. Evaluation of the data on medication errors received for TOL/TAZ identified a potential for dosing errors following approval of TOL/TAZ in the U.S. The presentation of the strength statement on the vial label was cited as a cause of confusion which could lead to administration of more drug than was prescribed. The vial label was subsequently updated and a Dear Health Care Provider letter was distributed in the U.S. in JUN-2015. No further reports of this type of potential for medication error have been received. Review of AEs reported cumulatively through 30-JUN-2018 for preferred terms related to medication use issues do not indicate a new safety concern, and associated AEs were generally consistent with the known safety profile of TOL/TAZ.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The dose of 3 g (every 8 hours) was used in three phase 1 studies and a single phase 3 study. Only 71 subjects were exposed in the three phase 1 studies, 35 healthy subjects and 36 critically ill. Because of low numbers and variable disease status of subjects in the phase 1 studies, safety is only reported for the phase 3 study in this report and no pooling of data was performed, which is considered adequate.

Number of subjects randomized/treated/ongoing/discontinued in study PN008:

- In the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, 362 subjects were randomized, 361 (99.7%) were treated, 263  (72.7%)  completed  and  98  (27.1%)  discontinued  trial  treatment,  and  245  (67.7%) completed and 117 (32.3%) withdrew from the study.
- In  the  meropenem  group,  364  subjects  were  randomized,  359  (98.6%)  were  treated,  271 (74.5%) completed and 88 (24.2%) discontinued trial treatment, and 250 (68.7%) completed and 114 (31.3%) withdrew from the study.

The population consisted of seriously ill subjects. Subjects were hospitalized for a mean duration of 10 days prior to randomization and 49% were ventilated for ≥5 days prior to randomization. A total of 35.6% had renal impairment at baseline, 21.9% were ≥75 years of age, and 12.8% had failed prior therapy for the  current  episode  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia.  Ventilator-associated  bacterial  pneumonia accounted  for  71.5%  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia  diagnoses,  and  14.5%  of  subjects  were bacteremic  at  baseline.  Mortality  was  as  high  as  28-29%  and  88%  of  subjects  received  non-study antibiotic treatment within 14 days prior to study drug treatment.

Only adults 18 years or older were included in the study for this indication.  No data on paediatric patients have been submitted for the 3 g dose used for this indication.  The median age was 62 years, minimum and maximum  18  years  and  98 years, with 160 (44%)  being 65 years or older in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group. The number of patients exposed to ceftolozane/tazobactam at the 3 g dose recommended for nosocomial pneumonia is considered acceptable for safety evaluation.

A complicating factor in evaluating the relation between study drug and adverse reactions is the high use of  concomitant  non-study  antibiotics  (58%  of  ITT  population).  The  majority  of  those  on  non-study antibiotics  received  concomitant  antibiotics  after  discontinuing  study  drug,  while  21.3%  received non-study antibiotics while on study drug therapy. In addition, 94% received gram-positive adjunctive therapy  (according  to  protocol).    Gram-negative  adjunctive  therapy  was  allowed  at  baseline  for  a maximum of 72 hours according to protocol at sites with meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. A total of 29% of patients received gram-negative adjunctive therapy.

A total number of 84% of patients reported any TEAE, of which 17% were mild, 28% moderate and 38% severe. TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included anemia,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and increased ALT and AST. Drug-related TEAEs were reported in 10% of the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 7% of the meropenem group. Drug-related TEAEs that were considered severe in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included bradycardia, diarrhoea, hepatic failure, systemic candida, increased ALT, AST, and γ -glutamyl transferase.

The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs were cardiac disorders (10.0% of subjects overall) and infections and infestations (9.0% of subjects overall). Septic shock and multi-organ failure were the most commonly reported serious TEAE preferred terms (&gt;3% of subjects overall), and all occurred in a similar proportion in each treatment group. Cerebral hemorrhage, which occurred in 5 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and no subjects in the meropenem group, was the only serious TEAE preferred term with a 95% CI for risk difference that did not include 0. In 4 of these 5 subjects, the cerebral hemorrhage represented a worsening of underlying intracranial hemorrhage that was present as a diagnosis on medical history

More subjects experienced serious TEAEs in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group (8) compared to the meropenem group (2). Only C. difficile colitis was reported by more than 1 subject as a treatment-related serious TEAE ( C. difficile colitis was reported by 2 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group). All treatment-related serious TEAEs had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study. Two patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group reported serious drug-related TEAE of C. difficile colitis, while none of these  were  reported  as  severe  drug-related  TEAEs.  Also  hepatic  cholestatic  is  reported  as  serious drug-related TEAE in one patient, while hepatic failure but not hepatic cholestatic is reported as severe TEAE from the same group. During the procedure the applicant has described the use of classification of severity and seriousness for some of the TEAEs related to C. difficile colitis and hepatic events. A large proportion of patients discontinued the study, 32% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 31% in the meropenem group. The majority discontinued study because of adverse event (86-91%).  Also, the proportion of patients that discontinued study drug was high, 27% for the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 24% for the meropenem group. The most common reason for discontinuation of study drug was adverse event (36% ceftolozane/tazobactam and 47% meropenem) and insufficient therapeutic effect (23%  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  and  17%  meropenem).  The  majority  of  TEAEs  that  led  to discontinuation of study drug were AEs that resulted in death. The high proportion of discontinuation from the drug and study mirrors the severity of disease in this population with high mortality.

Among  the  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  drug-related  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in incidence and similar between the 2 treatment groups (1.1 and 1.4%).

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The applied extension of indication for ceftolozane/tazobactam is:

' Treatment  of  adults  with  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP),  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia (VAP) '.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia is a severe disease, and can be a life-threatening condition. The mortality risk increases when the NP infection is caused by MDR bacteria and in patients with concurrent bacteraemia. The mortality rate attributable to NP ranges from 33% to 50%.

Due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, few antibiotic agents are broadly active against the gram-negative organisms frequently isolated from NP infections. The WHO (2017) identified carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa as a critical threat with an urgent need of new antibiotics. Recent data show an increase in the prevalence of NP caused by MDR pathogens, most commonly P. aeruginosa , with  documented  resistance  to  β-lactams,  carbapenems,  aminoglycosides,  and  fluoroquinolones. Although increasing drug resistance has diminished the utility of established antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotics, there are still some antibacterial agents that are effective in treatment of NP/VAP patients. However,  considering  the  high  prevalence  and  severity  of  these  infections,  as  well  as  increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, effective treatment options are still needed. Particularly, there is an unmet medical need for treatment of patients infected with certain pathogens such as MDR-resistant

P. aeruginosa .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The clinical program for ceftolozane/tazobactam comprises one pivotal phase 3 clinical study ( PN008 ).

The pivotal study PN008 is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 study, comparing the efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam to meropenem in adult patients with NP (including VAP and ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia [HAP]). Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was demonstrated for the primary endpoint clinical response in the ITT population at the Test-of Cure (TOC) visit (54.4%, 197/362 in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm  vs. 194/364,  53.3%  in the meropenem  arm).  Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was also demonstrated for the key secondary endpoint Day 28 all-cause mortality in the ITT population (87/362, 24.0% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 92/364,  25.3%  in  the  meropenem  group).  For  both  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  key  secondary endpoint, the lower limits of the stratified 97.5% CIs were within the non-inferiority margin of -12.5% ( i.e. 1.1% [-7.20, 9.31] and 1.1% [-6.03, 8.28], respectively).

The above-mentioned results were supported by the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy outcomes and of the findings in the secondary endpoint of clinical response at TOC for the clinically evaluable (CE) population.

In the microbiologically Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population, at the TOC visit, 193/264 (73.1%) patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and 168/247 (68.0%) subjects in the meropenem arm had a favourable microbiological response. The corresponding results achieved for the Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) population were in support of the findings in the mITT population.

For  the  most  commonly  isolated  pathogens  ( i.e. Enterobacteriaceae, K.  pneumoniae , E.  coli , P. aeruginosa ) the per-pathogen clinical and microbiological response rates in the mITT population were, in general, comparable between the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and the meropenem arm. However, for P. aeruginosa the microbiological response rates were higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm compared to the meropenem arm (47/63, 74.6% vs. 41/65, 63.1%, respectively).

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Approximately 30% of the patients in the ITT population had at least one important protocol deviation during the study. These deviations included mainly issues such as not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria (in  total  64/229,  8.8%),  lack  of  safety  reporting  (in  total  18/229,  2.5%)  and  not  following  trial procedure/study interventions (in total, 190/229, 26.2%). Approximately 40% of the important protocol deviations led to exclusion of patient data from the CE population.

The Day 28 All-cause mortality rate in the subgroup of patients with P.  aeruginosa as  baseline  LRT pathogen, was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm (16/63, 25.4% vs. 12/65, 18.5%, respectively). The same tendency of higher mortality rates was also observed for the subgroups of patients that were bacteremic at baseline 'all respiratory pathogens' (14/29, 48.3% vs. 7/21, 33.3%) and bacteremic at baseline 'all gram-negative respiratory pathogens' (13/25, 52.0% vs. 7/19, 36.8%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.

Clinical cure rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem were lower in patients ≥ 75 years of age (35/83, 42.2% vs. 42/76, 55.3%), patients who had no prior antibiotic therapy (19/44, 43.2% vs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

23/41, 56.1%) and patients who had baseline gram-negative adjunctive therapy (47/103, 45.6% vs. 64/112, 57.1%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.

The microbiological response rates for ESBL+ K. pneumoniae were 33/53, 62.3% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm compared to 38/52, 73.1% in the meropenem arm. Although the results in the ME population was overall consistent with the results in the mITT population, the microbiological response rates for ESBL+ K. pneumoniae were similar between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in this population (20/30, 66.7% vs. 18/27, 66.7%, respectively).

Although  higher  microbiological  response  rates  were  observed  in  the  mITT  population  for  Amp  C  producing P. aeruginosa in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. the meropenem group, the number of isolates was limited to 15 in total.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The dose of 3 g (every 8 hours) was used in three phase 1 studies and a single phase 3 study. Because of low numbers and variable disease status of subjects in the phase 1 studies, safety is reported only for the phase 3 study in this report.

The population consisted of seriously ill subjects. Subjects were hospitalised for a mean duration of 10 days prior to randomization and 49% were ventilated for ≥5 days prior to randomization. A total of 35.6% had renal impairment at baseline, 21.9% were ≥75 years of age, and 12.8% had failed prior therapy for the  current  episode  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia.  Ventilator-associated  bacterial  pneumonia accounted  for  71.5%  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia  diagnoses,  and  14.5%  of  subjects  were bacteremic  at  baseline.  Mortality  was  as  high  as  28-29%  and  88%  of  subjects  received  non-study antibiotic  treatment  within  14  days  prior  to  study  drug  treatment.    A  large  number  of  patients discontinued study treatment or did not complete the study:

- In the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, 362 subjects were randomized, 361 (99.7%) were treated, 263  (72.7%)  completed  and  98  (27.1%)  discontinued  trial  treatment,  and  245  (67.7%) completed the study.
- In  the  meropenem  group,  364  subjects  were  randomized,  359  (98.6%)  were  treated,  271 (74.5%) completed and 88 (24.2%) discontinued trial treatment, and 250 (68.7%) completed the study.

A total number of 84% of patients reported any TEAE, of which 17% were mild, 28% moderate and 38% severe. TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included anemia, decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and increased ALT and AST. Drug-related TEAEs were reported in 10% of the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 7% of the meropenem group. Drug-related TEAEs that were considered severe in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included bradycardia, diarrhoea, hepatic failure, systemic candida, increased ALT, AST, and γ -glutamyl transferase.

The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs were cardiac disorders (10.0% of subjects overall) and infections and infestations (9.0% of subjects overall). Septic shock and multi-organ failure were the most commonly reported serious TEAE preferred terms (&gt;3% of subjects overall), and all occurred in a similar proportion in each treatment group.

More subjects experienced serious TEAEs in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group (8) compared to the meropenem group (2). Only C. difficile colitis was reported by more than 1 subject as a treatment-related serious TEAE ( C. difficile colitis was reported by 2 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group). All treatment-related serious TEAEs had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A large proportion of patients discontinued the study, 32% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 31% in the meropenem group, the majority because of adverse event (86-91%).  Also, the proportion of patients that discontinued study drug was high, 27% for the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 24% for the meropenem group and the most common reason was adverse event (36% ceftolozane/tazobactam and 47% meropenem) and insufficient therapeutic effect (23% ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 17% meropenem). The majority of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug were AEs that resulted in death.  Drug-related  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in  incidence  and  similar  between  the  2 treatment groups (1.1 and 1.4%).

No  new  safety  signals  have  been  detected  from  the  study  supporting  the  nosocomial  pneumonia indication.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

A complicating factor in evaluating the relation between study drug and adverse reactions is the high use of concomitant non-study antibiotics (58% of ITT population), defined as non-study antibiotics received from the first  dose  of  study  therapy  to  the  Late  follow-up.  The  majority  of  these  subjects  received non-study antibiotics after discontinuing study drug, while 21.3% received non-study antibiotics while on study drug therapy. In addition, 94% received gram-positive adjunctive therapy (required per protocol). Gram-negative adjunctive therapy was allowed at baseline for a maximum of 72 hours according to the protocol at sites with meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa .

Based on the current guidelines, the removal of the important identified and potential risks as well as missing information is supported.

Tazobactam crosses the placenta, while this is not known for ceftolozane. As described in the SmPC reproductive toxicity has been shown in an animal study (rat) with tazobactam. Also, with ceftolozane there was a finding of decreased auditory startle response in rat pups.  The clinical significance of these animal data is not known as there are no data in pregnant or lactating woman. Pregnant women might be exposed if the prescriber considers 'benefit outweighs the possible risks to the pregnant woman and foetus' and the new indication for Zerbaxa combined with a doubling of the dose will increase exposure in pregnant and lactating woman. It is considered important to focus on obtaining experience from pregnant and lactating women, which could be through routine PV and reporting in PSURs. There is a critical gap in knowledge for use in pregnant and lactating women; such use should be reported in the PSUR.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam to meropenem has been clearly demonstrated for both the primary  and  the  key  secondary  endpoints  in  the  patients  with  NP/VAP  that  is  considered  to  be representative  of  the  target  population.  The  similar  rates  of  clinical  cure  achieved  for  the  primary endpoint at TOC for ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem indicate that ceftolozane/tazobactam has the potential to be an alternative to meropenem in the treatment of NP/ VAP.

The Day 28 All-cause mortality rate in the subgroup of patients with P.  aeruginosa as  baseline  LRT pathogen, was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm (16/63, 25.4% vs. 12/65, 18.5%, respectively). The same tendency of higher mortality rates was also observed for the subgroups of patients that were bacteremic at baseline 'all respiratory pathogens' (14/29, 48.3% vs. 7/21, 33.3%) and bacteremic at baseline 'all gram-negative respiratory pathogens' (13/25, 52.0% vs. 7/19, 36.8%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.

There were differences in the demographics of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem: a higher percentage of subjects ≥ 75 years old in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group (23.8%) compared to the meropenem group (16.9%), a higher rate of subjects that had failed prior antibiotic therapy (17.5% vs. 6.2%) and of subjects that were bacteremic at baseline (27.0% vs. 10.8%). In addition, there was a higher proportion of subjects with different co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes, congestive heart failure) in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  than  in  the  meropenem  group.  It  is  agreed  that  these  differences  in demographic factors between the treatment groups might have affected the study results.

Clinical cure rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem were lower in patients ≥ 75 years of age (35/83, 42.2% vs. 42/76, 55.3%), patients who had no prior antibiotic therapy (19/44, 43.2% vs. 23/41, 56.1%) and patients who had baseline gram-negative adjunctive therapy (47/103, 45.6% vs. 64/112, 57.1%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.

Increased failure rate in patients &gt;75 years of age as well as patients who did not receive any antibiotic therapy prior to study entry may be attributed to the differences in demographics of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem-treated subjects in this subgroup as ceftolozane/tazobactam subjects displayed more high-risk characteristics at baseline. The rates of susceptibility to study therapy were lower in the subjects with Enterobacteriaceae in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared to the meropenem group (84.4% vs. 100%) and this might also have contributed to a lower clinical response rate in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group.

It  is  acknowledged  that  given  the  small  number  of  patients  studied  overall  and  in  the  individual subgroups, definite conclusions are difficult to draw both in terms of efficacy and safety.

Despite not being allowed according to the study protocol, concomitant administration of carbapenems (including meropenem) as 'any non-study concomitant antibiotic medication' was given to the patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm. This might have impacted the clinical and microbiological success rates. However, the results from a sensitivity analysis in which patients receiving concomitant carbapenems were regarded as clinical failures were comparable to the results in the overall study population. It is therefore agreed that the use of concomitant carbapenems before TOC probably have not affected the clinical outcome of the study.

No new safety signals have been detected from the study supporting the NP indication.

It  should  be  emphasized  that  ceftolozane/tazobactam  does  not  address  an  unmet  medical  need  for treatment of all resistant pathogens against meropenem such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR P.  aeruginosa .  Nevertheless,  it  might  likely  be  efficacious  in  some  patients  infected  with P. aeruginosa that is resistant to several other antibacterial drugs, including carbapenems. Ceftolozane/tazobactam  with  comparable  efficacy  and  safety  to  meropenem,  including  efficacy  in patients with infections caused by beta-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa , would be a clinically relevant and useful addition to the available treatment options.
