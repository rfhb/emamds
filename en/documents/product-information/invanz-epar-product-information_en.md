## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

INVANZ 1 g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each vial contains 1.0 g ertapenem.

Excipient(s) with known effect

Each 1.0 g dose contains approximately 6.0 mEq of sodium (approximately 137 mg).

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. White to yellowish of f -white powder.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Treatment

INVANZ is indicated in paediatric patients (3 months to 17 years of age) and in adults for the treatment of the following infections when caused by bacteria known or very likely to be susceptible to ertapenem and when parenteral therapy is required (see sections 4.4 and 5.1):

- Intra-abdominal infections
- Community acquired pneumonia
- Acute gynaecological infections
- Diabetic foot infections of the skin and sof t tissue (see section 4.4)

## Prevention

INVANZ is indicated in adults for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection following elective colorectal surgery (see section 4.4).

Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Treatment

Adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) : The dose of INVANZ is 1 gram (g) given once a day by the intravenous route (see section 6.6).

Infants and children (3 months to 12 years of age) : The dose of INVANZ is 15 mg/kg given twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day) by the intravenous route (see section 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prevention

Adults: To prevent surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery, the recommended dosage is 1 g administered as a single intravenous dose to be completed within 1 hour prior to the surgical incision.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of INVANZ in children below 3 months of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Renal impairment

INVANZ may be used for the treatment of infections in adult patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients whose creatinine clearance is /uniF03E 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , no dosage adjustment is necessary. There are inadequate data on the safety and eff icacy of ertapenem in patients with severe renal impairment to support a dose recommendation. Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these patients (see section 5.2.). There are no data in children and adolescents with renal impairment.

## Haemodialysis

There are inadequate data on the safety and eff icacy of ertapenem in patients on haemodialysis to support a dose recommendation. Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these patients.

## Hepatic impairment

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.2).

## Elderly

The recommended dose of INVANZ should be administered, except in cases of severe renal impairment (see Renal impairment ).

## Method of administration

Intravenous administration : INVANZ should be infused over a period of 30 minutes.

The usual duration of therapy with INVANZ is 3 to 14 days but may vary depending on the type and severity of infection and causative pathogen(s). When clinically indicated, a switch to an appropriate oral antibacterial agent may be implemented if clinical improvement has been observed.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- Hypersensitivity to any other carbapenem antibacterial agent.
- Severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam antibacterial agent (e.g., penicillins or cephalosporins).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with ertapenem, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactams and other allergens (see section 4.3). If an allergic reaction to ertapenem occurs (see section 4.8), discontinue the therapy immediately. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Superinfection

Prolonged use of ertapenem may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

## Antibiotic-associated colitis

Antibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with ertapenem and may range in severity from mild to lif e-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Discontinuation of therapy with INVANZ and the administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be given.

## Seizures

Seizures have been reported during clinical investigation in adult patients treated with ertapenem (1 g once a day) during therapy or in the 14-day f ollow-up period. Seizures occurred most commonly in elderly patients and those with pre-existing central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) and/or compromised renal function. Similar observations have been made in the post-marketing environment.

## Encephalopathy

Encephalopathy has been reported with the use of ertapenem (see section 4.8). If ertapenem-induced encephalopathy is suspected (e.g., myoclonus, seizures, altered mental status, depressed level of consciousness), discontinuation of ertapenem should be considered. Patients with renal impairment are at higher risk of ertapenem-induced encephalopathy and the resolution may be prolonged.

## Concomitant use with valproic acid

The concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/sodium valproate is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Sub-optimal exposure

Based on the data available it cannot be excluded that in the few cases of surgical interventions exceeding 4 hours, patients could be exposed to sub-optimal ertapenem concentrations and consequently to a risk of potential treatment f ailure. Theref ore, caution should be exercised in such unusual cases.

## Considerations for use in particular populations

Experience in the use of ertapenem in the treatment of severe infections is limited. In clinical studies for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, in adults, 25 % of evaluable patients treated with ertapenem had severe disease (defined as pneumonia severity index &gt; III). In a clinical study for the treatment of acute gynaecologic infections, in adults, 26 % of evaluable patients treated with ertapenem had severe disease (defined as temperature ≥ 39 /uniF0B0 C and/or bacteraemia); ten patients had bacteraemia. Of evaluable patients treated with ertapenem in a clinical study for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, in adults, 30 % had generalised peritonitis and 39 % had inf ections involving sites other than the appendix including the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon, and gallbladder; there were limited numbers of evaluable patients who were enrolled with APACHE II scores ≥ 15 and efficacy in these patients has not been established.

The efficacy of INVANZ in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia due to penicillinresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has not been established.

Efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of diabetic foot infections with concurrent osteomyelitis has not been established.

There is relatively little experience with ertapenem in children less than two years of age. In this age group, particular care should be taken to establish the susceptibility of  the infecting organism(s) to ertapenem. No data are available in children under 3 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains approximately 137 mg sodium per 1.0 g dose, equivalent to 6.85 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interactions caused by inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated clearance or CYP-mediated clearance of medicinal products are unlikely (see section 5.2).

Decreases in valproic acid levels that may fall below the therapeutic range have been reported when valproic acid was co-administered with carbapenem agents. The lowered valproic acid levels can lead to inadequate seizure control; therefore, concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/sodium valproate is not recommended and alternative antibacterial or anti-convulsant therapies should be considered.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-f oetal development, parturition or post-natal development. However, ertapenem should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the possible risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

Ertapenem is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions on the inf ant, mothers should not breast-feed their infants while receiving ertapenem.

## Fertility

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies regarding the effect of ertapenem use on f ertility in men and women. Preclinical studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been perf ormed.

INVANZ may influence patients' ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that dizziness and somnolence have been reported with INVANZ (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety prof ile

## Adults

The total number of patients treated with ertapenem in clinical studies was over 2 200 of which over 2 150 received a 1 g dose of ertapenem. Adverse reactions (i.e., considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported in approximately 20 % of patients treated with ertapenem. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 1.3 % of patients. An additional 476 patients received ertapenem as a single 1 g dose prior to surgery in a clinical study for the prophylaxis of surgical site infections following colorectal surgery.

For patients who received only INVANZ, the most common adverse reactions reported during therapy plus f ollow-up f or 14 days after treatment was stopped were: diarrhoea (4.8 %), infused vein complication (4.5 %) and nausea (2.8 %).

For patients who received only INVANZ, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities and their respective incidence rates during therapy plus follow-up f or 14 days after treatment was stopped

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were: elevations in ALT (4.6 %), AST (4.6 %), alkaline phosphatase (3.8 %) and platelet count (3.0 %).

## Paediatric population (3 months to 17 years of age):

The total number of patients treated with ertapenem in clinical studies was 384. The overall safety profile is comparable to that in adult patients. Adverse reactions (i.e., considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported in approximately 20.8 % of patients treated with ertapenem. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 0.5 % of patients.

For patients who received only INVANZ, the most common adverse reactions reported during therapy plus f ollow-up f or 14 days after treatment was stopped were: diarrhoea (5.2 %) and inf usion site pain (6.1 %).

For patients who received only INVANZ, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities and their respective incidence rates during therapy plus follow-up f or 14 days after treatment was stopped were: decreases in neutrophil count (3.0 %), and elevations in ALT (2.9 %) and AST (2.8 %).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

For patients who received only INVANZ, the following adverse reactions were reported during therapy plus follow-up f or 14 days af ter treatment was stopped:

Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); Very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific information is available on the treatment of  overdose with ertapenem. Overdosing of ertapenem is unlikely. Intravenous administration of ertapenem at a 3 g daily dose for 8 days to healthy adult volunteers did not result in signif icant toxicity. In clinical studies in adults, inadvertent administration of up to 3 g in a day did not result in clinically important adverse reactions. In paediatric clinical studies, a single intravenous (IV) dose of  40 mg/kg up to a maximum of  2 g did not result in toxicity.

However, in the event of an overdose, treatment with INVANZ should be discontinued and general supportive treatment given until renal elimination takes place.

Ertapenem can be removed to some extent by haemodialysis (see section 5.2); however, no information is available on the use of haemodialysis to treat overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

## General properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, carbapenems, ATC code: J01DH03

## Mechanism of action

Ertapenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis following attachment to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). In Escherichia coli , af f inity is strongest to PBPs 2 and 3.

## Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship

Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that the plasma concentration of ertapenem exceeds the MIC of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in pre-clinical PK/PD studies.

## Mechanism of resistance

For species considered susceptible to ertapenem, resistance was uncommon in surveillance studies in Europe. In resistant isolates, resistance to other antibacterial agents of the carbapenem class was seen in some but not all isolates. Ertapenem is eff ectively stable to hydrolysis by most classes of betalactamases, including penicillinases, cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases, but not metallo-beta-lactamases.

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci are resistant to ertapenem, owing to PBP target insensitivity; P. aeruginosa and other non-fermentative bacteria are generally resistant, probably owing to limited penetration and to active eff lux.

Resistance is uncommon in Enterobacteriaceae and ertapenem is generally active against those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance can however be observed when ESBLs or other potent beta-lactamases (e.g., AmpC types) are present in conjunction with reduced permeability, arising by the loss of one or more outer membrane porins, or with up-regulated efflux. Resistance can also arise via the acquisition of beta-lactamases with signif icant carbapenem-hydrolysing activity (e.g., IMP and VIM metallo-beta-lactamases or KPC types), though these are rare.

The mechanism of action of ertapenem differs from that of other classes of antibiotics, such as quinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracyclines. There is no target-based cross-resistance between ertapenem and these substances. However, micro-organisms may exhibit resistance to more than one class of antibacterial agents when the mechanism is, or includes, impermeability to some compounds and/or an efflux pump.

## Susceptibility testing breakpoints

MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for ertapenem and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-inhibitoryconcentration-mic-breakpoints\\_en.xlsx

The prescribers are informed that local MIC breakpoints, if available, should be consulted.

## Microbiological susceptibility

The prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species and local information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. Localised clusters of infections due to carbapenem-resistant organisms have been reported in the European Union. The information below gives only approximate guidance on the probability as to whether the micro-organism will be susceptible to ertapenem or not.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Plasma concentrations

Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 1 g dose in healthy young adults (25 to 45 years of age) were 155 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hours postdose (end of infusion), 9 micrograms/mL at 12 hours postdose, and 1 microgram/mL at 24 hours postdose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of ertapenem in adults increases nearly doseproportionally over the 0.5 to 2 g dose range.

There is no accumulation of ertapenem in adults following multiple intravenous doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g daily.

Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 15 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 3 to 23 months of age were 103.8 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hours postdose (end of infusion), 13.5 micrograms/mL at 6 hours postdose, and 2.5 micrograms/mL at 12 hours postdose.

Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 15 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 2 to 12 years of age were 113.2 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hours postdose (end of infusion), 12.8 micrograms/mL at 6 hours postdose, and 3.0 micrograms/mL at 12 hours postdose.

Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 20 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 13 to 17 years of age were 170.4 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hours postdose (end of infusion), 7.0 micrograms/mL at 12 hours postdose, and 1.1 microgram/mL at 24 hours postdose.

Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 1 g dose in three patients 13 to 17 years of age were 155.9 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hours postdose (end of infusion), and 6.2 micrograms/mL at 12 hours postdose.

## Distribution

Ertapenem is highly bound to human plasma proteins. In healthy young adults (25 to 45 years of age), the protein binding of ertapenem decreases, as plasma concentrations increase, from approximately 95 % bound at an approximate plasma concentration of &lt; 50 micrograms/mL to approximately 92 % bound at an approximate plasma concentration of 155 micrograms/mL (average concentration achieved at the end of infusion f ollowing 1 g intravenously).

The volume of distribution (Vdss) of ertapenem in adults is approximately 8 litres (0.11 litre/kg) and approximately 0.2 litre/kg in paediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age and approximately 0.16 litre/kg in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age.

Concentrations of ertapenem achieved in adult skin blister f luid at each sampling point on the third day of 1 g once daily intravenous doses showed a ratio of AUC in skin blister fluid: AUC in plasma of 0.61.

In vitro studies indicate that the eff ect of  ertapenem on the plasma protein binding of highly protein bound medicinal products (warfarin, ethinyl estradiol, and norethindrone) was small. The change in binding was &lt; 12 % at peak plasma ertapenem concentration following a 1 g dose. In vivo , probenecid (500 mg every 6 hours) decreased the bound fraction of ertapenem in plasma at the end of infusion in subjects administered a single 1 g intravenous dose f rom approximately 91 % to approximately 87 %. The effects of this change are anticipated to be transient. A clinically significant interaction due to ertapenem displacing another medicinal product or another medicinal product displacing ertapenem is unlikely.

In vitro studies indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin or vinblastine and that ertapenem is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.

## Biotransformation

In healthy young adults (23 to 49 years of age), after intravenous infusion of radiolabelled 1 g ertapenem, the plasma radioactivity consists predominantly (94 %) of ertapenem. The major metabolite of ertapenem is the ring-opened derivative f ormed by dehydropeptidase-I-mediated hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the six major CYP isoforms: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4.

## Elimination

Following administration of a 1 g radiolabelled intravenous dose of ertapenem to healthy young adults (23 to 49 years of age), approximately 80 % is recovered in urine and 10 % in faeces. Of the 80 % recovered in urine, approximately 38 % is excreted as unchanged ertapenem and approximately 37 % as the ring-opened metabolite.

In healthy young adults (18 to 49 years of age) and patients 13 to 17 years of age given a 1 g intravenous dose, the mean plasma half-life is approximately 4 hours. The mean plasma half-life in children 3 months to 12 years of age is approximately 2.5 hours. Average concentrations of ertapenem in urine exceed 984 micrograms/mL during the period 0 to 2 hours postdose and exceed 52 micrograms/mL during the period 12 to 24 hours post-administration.

## Special populations

## Gender

The plasma concentrations of ertapenem are comparable in men and women.

## Elderly

Plasma concentrations following a 1 g and 2 g intravenous dose of ertapenem are slightly higher (approximately 39 % and 22 %, respectively) in healthy elderly adults ( ≥ 65 years) relative to young adults ( /uniF03C 65 years). In the absence of severe renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.

## Paediatric population

Plasma concentrations of ertapenem are comparable in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and adults following a 1 g once daily intravenous dose.

Following the 20 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum dose of 1 g), the pharmacokinetic parameter values in patients 13 to 17 years of age were generally comparable to those in healthy young adults. To provide an estimate of the pharmacokinetic data if all patients in this age group were to receive a 1 g dose, the pharmacokinetic data were calculated adjusting for a 1 g dose, assuming linearity. A comparison of results show that a 1 g once daily dose of ertapenem achieves a pharmacokinetic profile in patients 13 to 17 years of age comparable to that of adults. The ratios (13 to 17 years/adults) for AUC, the end of infusion concentration and the concentration at the midpoint of the dosing interval were 0.99, 1.20, and 0.84, respectively.

Plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval f ollowing a single 15 mg/kg intravenous dose of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age are comparable to plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a 1 g once daily intravenous dose in adults (see Plasma concentrations). The plasma clearance (mL/min/kg) of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age is approximately 2-fold higher as compared to that in adults. At the 15 mg/kg dose, the AUC value and plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval in patients 3 months to 12 years of age were comparable to those in young healthy adults receiving a 1 g intravenous dose of ertapenem.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. Due to the limited extent of  hepatic metabolism of  ertapenem, its pharmacokinetics are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.

## Renal impairment

Following a single 1 g intravenous dose of ertapenem in adults, AUCs of total ertapenem (bound and unbound) and of unbound ertapenem are similar in patients with mild renal impairment (Clcr 60 to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) compared with healthy subjects (ages 25 to 82 years). AUCs of total ertapenem and of unbound ertapenem are increased in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr 31 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) approximately 1.5-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared with healthy subjects. AUCs of total ertapenem and of unbound ertapenem are increased in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr 5 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) approximately 2.6-fold and 3.4-fold, respectively, compared with healthy subjects. AUCs of total ertapenem and of unbound ertapenem are increased in patients who require haemodialysis approximately 2.9-fold and 6.0-fold, respectively, between dialysis sessions, compared with healthy subjects. Following a single 1 g intravenous dose given immediately prior to a haemodialysis session, approximately 30 % of the dose is recovered in the dialysate. There are no data in paediatric patients with renal impairment.

There are inadequate data on the safety and eff icacy of ertapenem in patients with advanced renal impairment and patients who require haemodialysis to support a dose recommendation. Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these patients.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. Decreased neutrophil counts, however, occurred in rats that received high doses of ertapenem, which was not considered a significant safety issue.

Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ertapenem have not been performed.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If  you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of  illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side ef f ects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What INVANZ is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given INVANZ
3. How to use INVANZ
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store INVANZ
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What INVANZ is and what it is used for

INVANZ contains ertapenem which is an antibiotic of the beta-lactam group. It has the ability to kill a wide range of bacteria (germs) that cause infections in various parts of the body.

INVANZ can be given to persons 3 months of age and older.

## Treatment:

Your doctor has prescribed INVANZ because you or your child has one (or more) of the following types of inf ection:

- Infection in the abdomen
- Infection aff ecting the lungs (pneumonia)
- Gynaecological infections
- Skin infections of the foot in diabetic patients.

## Prevention:

- Prevention of surgical site infections in adults f ollowing surgery of the colon or rectum.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given INVANZ

## Do not use INVANZ

- -if  you are allergic to the active substance (ertapenem) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- -if  you are allergic to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems (which are used to treat various inf ections).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking INVANZ.

During treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), tell your doctor straight away as you may need urgent medical treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While antibiotics including INVANZ kill certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may continue to grow more than normal. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you for overgrowth and treat you if necessary.

It is important that you tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea before, during or af ter your treatment with INVANZ. This is because you may have a condition known as colitis (an inflammation of the bowel). Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor.

Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (see Other medicines and INVANZ below).

Tell your doctor about any medical condition you have or have had including:

- -Kidney disease. It is particularly important that your doctor knows if you have kidney disease and whether you undergo dialysis treatment.
- -Allergies to any medicines, including antibiotics.
- -Central nervous system disorders, such as localised tremors, or seizures.

## Children and adolescents (3 months to 17 years of age)

Experience with INVANZ is limited in children less than two years of age. In this age group your doctor will decide on the potential benefit of its use. There is no experience in children under 3 months of age.

## Other medicines and INVANZ

Tell your doctor if  you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraines, or schizophrenia). This is because INVANZ can affect the way some other medicines work. Your doctor will decide whether you should use INVANZ in combination with these other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

INVANZ has not been studied in pregnant women. INVANZ should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor decides the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk to the f oetus.

Women who are receiving INVANZ should not breast-feed, because it has been found in human milk and the breast-fed baby may therefore be affected.

## Driving and using machines

Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how you react to the medicine. Certain side ef f ects, such as dizziness and sleepiness, have been reported with INVANZ, which may aff ect  some patients'  ability to drive or operate machinery.

## INVANZ contains sodium

This medicine contains approximately 137 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each 1.0 g dose. This is equivalent to 6.85 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## 3. How to use INVANZ

INVANZ will always be prepared and given to you intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or another healthcare professional.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The recommended dose of INVANZ for adults and adolescents 13 years of age and older is 1 gram (g) given once a day. The recommended dose for children 3 months to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg given twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day). Your doctor will decide how many days' treatment you need.

For prevention of surgical site infections following surgery of the colon or rectum, the recommended dose of INVANZ is 1 g administered as a single intravenous dose 1 hour before surgery.

It is very important that you continue to receive INVANZ for as long as your doctor prescribes it.

## If you are given more INVANZ than you should

If you are concerned that you may have been given too much INVANZ, contact your doctor or another healthcare professional immediately.

## If you miss a dose of INVANZ

If you are concerned that you may have missed a dose, contact your doctor or another healthcare professional immediately.

## 4. Possible side effects
