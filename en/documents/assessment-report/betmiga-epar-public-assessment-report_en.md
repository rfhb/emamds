## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

The International Continence Society defines Overactive bladder (OAB) as urgency, with or without urge incontinence associated with increased micturition frequency and nocturia. 1 Its aetiology is not completely clear, but involves detrusor overactivity, a status of increased sensitivity of the bladder to contraction-mediating transmitters and mediators originating from the urothelium 2  Detrusor overactivation involves afferent signalling conveyed as bladder sensations that are felt as urgency in patients with OAB. 3

The overall prevalence of OAB in Europe has been estimated to be 16.6% on the basis of a populationbased survey (15.6% for men and 17.4% for women). There is a female-to-male preponderance in the prevalence of OAB with urge urinary incontinence, while OAB without urge urinary incontinence is more prevalent in men.

The prevalence of OAB symptomatology increased with advancing age in both men and women (41.9% of men and 31.3% of women over the age of 75 years). Obesity relates also with an increase in the prevalence of OAB.

The functional integrity of the lower urinary tract, the kidneys, and the nervous system (predominantly under the control of the parasympathetic nervous system) are the key factors to maintain continence and bladder function. Bladder function involves a bladder filling and urine storage phase, which leads to a bladder emptying phase. A stable bladder wall muscle (detrusor) and a functional sphincter allow bladder filling during the storage phase.

Undesired bladder muscle contraction may occur as the result of a break in the neurological pathway from the brain to the bladder. It can also occur if the bladder is irritated and the normal neurological impulses to inhibit urination are insufficient to keep the bladder relaxed as it fills.

Although OAB is not life threatening, symptoms may affect quality of life. Patients consider urinary leakage, frequency and urgency to be bothersome. Complications and comorbidities include urinary tract infection (UTI), skin ulceration in OAB with urge incontinence, and a greater risk of bone fracture from a fall, although some research has found little association. Sleep disturbances, restricted mobility, isolation and depression are described as the psychological and lifestyle related consequences of OAB.

Treatment may be managed using nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies. Nonpharmacologic treatment includes lifestyle changes (controlled fluid intake), behavioural therapies, pelvic floor electrical stimulation, and surgical procedures.

The pharmacotherapeutic treatment options indicated for OAB are aimed at reducing or suppressing the intensity of involuntary detrusor contractions. Anticholinergic agents such as solifenacin, oxybutynin, trospium, darifenacin, tolterodine and fesoterodine are the most commonly used. Non pharmacologic treatment options contain behavioural techniques, neuromodulaton and surgery.

## About the product

Mirabegron is a selective agonist for human beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) which is dominant in the human detrusor muscle. Activation of beta-AR in the bladder trigone facilitates urine storage through flattening and lengthening of the bladder base. 4

<!-- image -->

Mirabegron dose-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations in bladder tissues isolated from rats and showed a potent relaxant effect in isolated rat and human bladder strips precontracted with carbachol at low contraction tonus.

The drug product is formulated as prolonged release film coated tablets. The tablets are formulated as a hydrophilic gel-forming matrix tablet formulation, designed for continuous drug release throughout the GI tract.

The claimed and approved indication for Betmiga is for the symptomatic treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency and/or urgency incontinence as may occur in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome.

The proposed posology is 50 mg once daily with or without food. In patients with severe renal impairment or with moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended dose of mirabegron is 25 mg orally once daily with or without food.

## Type of application and aspects on development

This application is submitted as a centralised procedure according to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC (i.e. a dossier with administrative, quality, pre-clinical and clinical data).

The initial clinical development program examined an indication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was subsequently discontinued due to the absence of efficacy demonstrated in this population based on proof of concept studies. A total of 29 phase 1 studies and 12 phase 2 and 3 studies (9 in patients with OAB, 1 in patients with LUTS/BOO and 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus) have been conducted globally in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia/New Zealand and South Africa.

The primary studies to support efficacy of mirabegron were designed consistent with Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidance for the clinical investigation of medicinal products for urinary incontinence. Further, the company received national scientific advice from the Competent Authorities in the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain during the development programme. In general, the recommendations from the authorities were followed.

A Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for mirabegron was submitted to the EMA Pediatric Committee (PDCO), and a positive opinion was fowarded to the applicant in August 2010; the measures of the agreed PIP were deferred at the time of the submission of the MAA.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product is presented as prolonged released film coated tablet containing 25 and 50 mg of mirabegron as the active substance. The composition is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC.

The product is available in the primary packaging as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

## 2.2.2. Active substance

Mirabegron is a white crystalline powder, not hygroscopic and freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, soluble in methanol and soluble in water between neutral to acidic pH. The chemical name is 2-(2Amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)-N-[4-(2-{[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2- phenylethyl]amino}ethyl)phenyl]acetamide. The molecular formula is C21H24N4O2S and has the following structural formula:

<!-- image -->

Mirabegron exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The R enantiomer has been used in the manufacture of the finished product. The enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC -UV. Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. The polymorphic form α is routinely and consistently produced by the synthetic process and it is used in the manufacture of the finished product.

Full information on the active substance mirabegron is provided in the dossier.

## Manufacture

Mirabegron is synthesized in five main steps using commercially available and well defined starting materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. The manufacturing process is well described. The defined critical process parameters (CPPs) and proposed in-process tests are considered suitable. All relevant parameters are controlled within the specified ranges in order to maintain the quality of the active substance.

Two manufacturing sites are involved in the synthesis of this active substance.

The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented

For the manufacturing process development the applicant has applied the Quality by Design (QbD) approach based on the risk-assessment of the synthetic process. The risk-assessment has provided valuable information to understand the synthetic process. In summary, the QbD principles were used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

only during the drug development in order to optimise the manufacturing conditions. No design space has been established for manufacturing process of the active substance.

The  purified  active  substance  is  packed  in  double  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags,  closed  by cable-ties and placed inside sealed fiber drums.

## Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for: identification (UV, IR), heavy metals, impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), microbiology limit test (Eur.), Palladium content (ICP-AES) and assay (HPLC, 98.0- 102.0%).

A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.

Batch analysis data on eleven commercial batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## Stability

Six production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging (LDPE bags) from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up 24 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months.

The  active  substance  used  in  the  primary  stability  studies  was  manufactured  by  a  process  that  is representative  of  the  commercial  process.  The  following  parameters  were  tested  in  the  primary stability  studies:  appearance,  identification,  X-ray  diffraction,  thermal  analysis,  impurities,  water content, microbial contamination and assay.

Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch. The results showed that only the appearance of the active substance slightly changed when exposed to light for two months.

Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to high temperature, high humidity, acid, base, oxidative and high intensity light conditions. Based on the results only minor degradation of mirabegron was noted.

## Pharmaceutical development

Mirabegron prolonged released film coated tablets have been developed to control the drug release from the tablet, leading to a slower absorption rate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract compared to immediate release formulations, even in fasted conditions.

During the development several modified released formulations were evaluated. Based on the results of the experimental studies the OCAS was selected as a modified release platform that could achieve the quality target product profile.

The OCAS is a hydrophilic gel-forming matrix tablet formulation, composed of active substance and Macrogols. This matrix tablet formulation designed for continuous drug release in the human GI tract.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The solubility of the selected gel forming agent and gel-enhancing agent are pH-independent. Therefore, drug release from prolonged released film coated tablets is relatively unaffected by different pH dissolution media.

Mirabegron prolonged released film coated tablets were developed using QbD principles. The CQAs identified were dissolution, appearance, assay, uniformity of dosage units, impurities, stability Prior knowledge, risk assessment, design of experiments and mathematical models were applied to identify the and CPPs. The CPPs have been adequately established. The QbD approach was also used to optimise the manufacturing conditions.

It can be concluded that the QbD principles were used for optimisation of the final formulation as well as for the development of the manufacturing process, but no Design Space is claimed for the manufacturing of the finished product.

The primary packaging proposed is described as stated in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The material complies with Ph. Eur. requirements and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the medicinal product.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: mixing, granulation, pulverization, blending, compression, dispersing, coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.

The manufacturing process has been validated at commercial scale for both strengths and has been demonstrated to be capable to reproducibly produce a finished product of the intended quality. The inprocess controls are adequate.

## Product specification

The finished product release specification includes appropriate tests for appearance (visual), identification (UV, HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur), dissolution, water content (Ph. Eur), microbial limit test (Ph. Eur) and assay (95.0%-105.0%).

Batch analysis results in three commercial batches of 25 mg and four commercial batches of 50 mg batches confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

## Stability of the product

Stability data of three batches of each strength have been provided. The batches were stored under long term conditions at 25ºC/60%RH for up to 36 months and under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75%RH for up to 6 months according to ICH guidelines. These batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The stability samples were tested for appearance, impurities, dissolution, assay, water content, hardness, BHT content and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used were stability indicating.

Forced degradation tests were performed under high temperatures, high humidity and high temperature/high humidity. These tests demonstrated no major changes in the parameters specified of the finished product. Only the increase of the dissolution rate was observed.

In addition, the photostability of one batch of each strength was evaluated in accordance with ICH guideline Q1B (Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products). Based on the results there is no need to protect the finished product from light.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The Applicant used the Quality by Design principles in this application during the pharmaceutical development but a design space was not claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance neither for the finished product. Risk assessment was done to optimise the manufacturing conditions of the active substance. For the finished product, the Quality by Design approach was used for optimisation of the formulation as well as for the development of the manufacturing process. The control strategy and process validation follow the traditional approach. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.2.4. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.5. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

None

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

A comprehensive non-clinical programme has been performed covering studies to investigate pharmacology including safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics as well as toxicology including single and repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

development. The studies have been performed in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. Drug administration was performed IV. or per os , mimicking the human route of administration.

No scientific advice was received from the European Medicines Agency on non-clinical development.

Toxicology and some of the definitive safety pharmacology studies conducted by the applicant were reported to be GLP-compliant. The safety studies that were not conducted to GLP were conducted to appropriate scientific standards prevailing at that time.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

In vitro, mirabegron has substantially higher (150-and 33-fold) affinity for the β3 adrenoceptor, when compared to the β1 and β2 adrenoceptors, respectively. Intrinsic activities relative to the maximum response induced by the full agonist isoproterenol, for mirabegron were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.8, for human β1-, β2- and β3- ARs respectively. Functional studies to demonstrate agonism at the β-adrenoreceptors demonstrate that mirabegron is a selective β3 adrenoceptor agonist with EC50 values in the nanomolar range. It has been established that mirabegron has weak agonistic activity at the β1 and β2 receptors in most of the species studied. However, it was observed that in vitro no functional agonism at the β1 or β2 receptors occurred at concentrations that were at least 21-fold higher than that observed clinically.

The effect on bladder smooth muscle was assessed in vitro in bladder tissues isolated from rats and humans. The results suggest a relaxant effect mediated by β3-ARs in bladder strips precontracted with the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol with a maximum relaxant effect similar to isoproterenol.

In vivo studies in anesthetized rats revealed that mirabegron decreased the resting intravesical pressure and also decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contractions without affecting the contraction force. Mirabegron increased cAMP concentrations in the isolated bladder (rat) at ≥1 µM and relaxed pre-contracted bladder smooth muscle (rat and human) with EC50 values of 5.1 to 11 µM and 0.78 µM, respectively. The intracellular mechanisms for bladder relaxation in bladder strips precontracted with carbachol and KCl is likely to be via an increase in cAMP and activation of Ca 2+ -activated K + (BKCa) channels, respectively and it is noted that not all of the mechanistic aspects have been demonstrated experimentally. It is evident that the three β-adrenoceptor subtypes (i.e. β1, β2 and β3) are expressed in human detrusor muscle and with the aid of selective antagonists for the β1 and β2 adrenoceptors, the Applicant has demonstrated that the bladder relaxant effect of mirabegron in the rat may be mediated by the β3-receptor.

In vivo data from conscious water loaded cynomolgus monkeys reveal that mirabegron increased the micturition mean voided volume and decreased voiding frequency. Intravenously administered mirabegron reduced resting and elevated intravesical pressure in the rat (at ≥0.03 mg/kg) and dog (at ≥0.0003 mg/kg), respectively. In a rat model of hyperactive bladder (cerebral infarction model), mirabegron increased the mean voided volume per micturition. In rats with partial urethral obstruction, mirabegron decreased the frequency of non-voiding contractions without affecting the voided volume per micturition, voiding pressure, or residual urine volume. It was noted that mirabegron at 3 mg/kg had no effect on the voided volume in a rat model of partial urethral obstruction, while this dose was previously shown to be effective in the rat and monkey. The differences in the underlying pathology of and experimental methods for the animal models may be responsible for the observed differences in the effects on voided volume in the rat.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

The secondary pharmacology of mirabegron was studied. Mirabegron and the human metabolites M5 and M16 inhibited the binding of specific ligands to the α1A-receptor (rat), muscarinic M2 receptor (human), sodium channel site 2 (rat), dopamine transporter (human), and/or norepinephrine transporter (human) at 10 µM. The Applicant has suggested that any secondary pharmacological effects would be attributed to mirabegron as opposed to the M5 or M16 metabolite. The Ki values for the secondary targets listed above were at least ~22-fold higher than the clinical Cmax. Given the magnitude of the observed margin and the adverse event profile observed clinically, the observed interactions at the secondary targets do not appear to be clinically relevant.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that mirabegron possesses lipolytic activity at nanomolar concentrations. In vivo , mirabegron caused an increase in energy expenditure and body temperature and improved glucose intolerance in genetically obese rodents at doses known to have effects on bladder function. The effects of mirabegron on lipolysis do not translate to non-rodent species. Although mirabegron may affect non-esterified fatty acid levels following administration of a single dose, mirabegron has no discernable effect on lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism or body temperature upon repeated administration in healthy subjects and/or in diabetes mellitus patients.

## Safety pharmacology programme

Central nervous system findings in rats and mice included decreased locomotor activity, decreased grip strength, lateral position, palpebral closure, and at higher doses deep respiration, decreased muscle tone, prone position, and loss of righting reflex. CNS depression was reported at exposures close to clinical exposures. These findings were transient and no relevant CNS findings were identified in the cynomolgus monkey at significantly higher exposures than those proposed clinically.

Assessment of mirabegron on hERG current in HEK293 revealed an Ikr inhibition of 14.7% at 30 µmol/L although this concentration was more than 600-fold the unbound Cmax at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Mirabegron metabolites M5 and M16 inhibited hERG current, with respective IC50 values of 21 and 31 µmol/L, and 17.3% for M14, although at concentrations considerably higher than the human expected Cmax. The observed effects of mirabegron on cardiac muscle action potential were not significant, although M5 at 3 µmol/L prolonged slightly APD30 by 6.1% and shortened APD30-90 by 7.9%, while concentrations of 30 µmol/L prolonged APD30 by 5.6% and APD90 by 4.7%. M16 prolonged APD90 by 5.0% at 30 µmol/L. Assessment of mirabegron on the effect on arterially perfused canine ventricular wedge preparations did not reveal demonstrable pro-arrhythmic effects of mirabegron and its metabolites.

Following oral administration in the dog, a reduction in QT interval was observed at 10 mg/kg; when corrected for heart rate, an increase in QTc interval was apparent (at ≥0.3 mg/kg) upon application of Bazett's or Van der Water equations, while no effect on QTc was reported upon application of the Matsunaga equation. The Applicant has supplied references in order to support the use of the Matsunaga equation as opposed to the Van de Water equation (Matsunaga et al., 1998; Miyazaki, 2002). In the monkey, an increase in PR and QRS interval was noted at 100 mg/kg and no effects were reported on QT/QTcB/QTcF interval or body temperature following single oral administration of up to 100 mg/kg. However, the 52 week repeated dose study conducted in both males and females has demonstrated sporadic increases QTcB interval at 30 mg/kg. The corresponding Cmax (at Week 52) was ~11-fold higher than that proposed clinically; hence, these data do not indicate any potential for QT prolongation in man at the proposed clinical dose of 50 mg. A post authorisation safety study to further characterise the cardiovascular safety of mirabegron has been requested (see Clinical Safety), as detailed in the Risk Management Plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Oral administration to conscious dogs and monkeys showed that mirabegron caused an increase in heart rate. In the dog, mirabegron (at ≥0.03 mg/kg) increased heart rate (and shortened PR interval), at doses lower than those proposed clinically. Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were also significantly decreased at 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. In the cynomolgus monkey, mirabegron increased heart rate at 10 mg/kg (Cmax approx 29.6-fold higher than that observed at the MRHD).

Single intravenous administration of mirabegron to conscious dogs caused death due to ventricular fibrillation at 10 mg/kg) and ECG findings were reported from doses of 0.3 mg/kg (HED corresponds to 0.2-fold MRHD). Other findings included increased heart rate, decreased mean blood pressure, absent P-wave, prolonged QRS interval, and ventricular tachycardia. The Applicant suggests that increases in heart rate observed in rats, dogs, and monkeys are mediated via cross activation of the beta 1adrenoceptor (beta 1-AR). Heart rate increases and ECG changes together with histopathological findings were only reported in dogs at lethal doses while histopathological findings observed in the heart in monkeys were limited to the fat tissue surrounding the heart (small adipocytes and multivacuolated cytoplasm) with no histopathological findings in the cardiomyocytes. In humans at the MRHD the heart rate increase was limited to approximately 1 bpm. In non clinical studies at doses where smaller increases in heart rates were observed, no histopathological findings were noted.

Studies carried out in cynomolgus monkeys receiving a single oral dose of mirabegron, did not reveal effects on the respiratory system. Mirabegron administration to dogs increased respiratory rate and decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide in blood at 3 mg/kg. The mechanistic process underlying this event in dogs was not investigated as it was only reported in one species and was not observed in humans at doses up to 6-fold higher than the MRHD.

In vitro , mirabegron inhibited contraction of guinea-pig ileum at concentrations below the proposed clinical Cmax (free). There is evidence to suggest that the administration of β3 agonists (of comparable potency) is associated with a decrease in gastrointestinal motility, nonetheless the Applicant has demonstrated that although mirabegron inhibited contraction of the guinea pig ileum in vitro , no effects on gastrointestinal transit were reported in vivo , in the mouse, rat, dog or monkey. More importantly, repeated administration for 7 days at 50 or 100 mg/day had no effect on gastrointestinal transit in man.

Even though there was no effect on urine excretion in rats receiving single dose administration of mirabegron at low doses, higher doses of ≥ 10 mg/kg, revealed that urine volume and the amount of electrolytes excreted was variable with time and dosing. In the rat, mirabegron at ≥10 mg/kg (equivalent to ≥1.9-fold the human equivalent dose) reduced the levels of sodium, potassium and chloride excreted into the urine during the first 3 hours post-dose. In rat toxicity studies of a longer duration, (26 week) effects on electrolytes and urine volume were also observed. Given that the intrinsic activity of mirabegron for the β1-receptor is higher in the rat and the absence of effects in dogs and monkeys, the CHMP consider these effects to be due to cross activation of the β1 receptor.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted, which is accepted. The potential for pharmacodynamic interactions between mirabegron and concomitantly administered medicinal products has been addressed in the Clinical Dossier with clinical data.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The analytical methods used were validated and considered to be sufficiently accurate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Absorption

Mirabegron absorption was studied after single and repeated dose administration in fasted and non fasted males (rat, mouse and dog). The absorption profile in females was generally consistent with that observed in male rats after oral administration.

Mirabegron was well and rapidly absorbed in the species tested. In rats the mean in situ absorption into each loop of gastrointestinal tract was variable with the highest values reported in the small intestine accounting for duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were 55.5%, 61.7%, and 65.9% of absorption respectively and the lowest in the stomach and colon at 7.1% and 15.1%, respectively.

Mean peak plasma concentrations in a single dose administration study in fasted rats and monkeys were observed at 3 h and 0.25 h post-dose, respectively. The AUCinf of mirabegron in plasma was low for both species accounting for 18 and 5% of total radioactivity in plasma confirming that metabolites accounted for a significant proportion of the drug-related material.

Absolute bioavailability in rats was 23.0%, 48.4%, and 75.7% at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, respectively, and in dogs 41.8%, 64.6%, and 77.1% at doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg, respectively.

A single oral dose study in fasted and fed dogs revealed that the mean tmax value for mirabegron administered was independent of the feeding status; however, Cmax and AUCinf values under fed conditions were 78.5% and 65.8%, respectively, of those under the fasted conditions, suggesting that mirabegron absorption was reduced in the presence of food.

Repeated dosing of mirabegron in non fasted male rats for 21 days indicate that the AUC24h and Cmax increased with dose and that steady state was achieved by Day 17.

## Distribution

When single doses of mirabegron were intravenously administered to rats (1 mg/kg) and dogs (0.1 mg/kg), total body clearance (CLtot) was high for both species at 47.4 and 37.2 mL/min/kg, respectively. Also, the steady state distribution volume (Vss) was large in both species at 10.3 and 14.3 L/kg, respectively, indicating that mirabegron is extensively distributed.

Plasma protein binding of mirabegron in vivo in man was 71%. Albumin was estimated to be the main human plasma protein responsible for the binding of mirabegron, followed by alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.

Mirabegron distribution to erythrocytes was reported and the in vitro blood/plasma radioactivity concentration ratio of 14 C-mirabegron was fairly similar for all species; ranging from 1.41 to 1.43 in humans.

Radioactivity distributed to all organs with the lowest value reported in the GI tract. The highest was found in the liver and kidney and the lowest in the cerebrum and cerebellum remaining low after repeated administration. In albino and pigmented rats, at 168 and 360 hours post-dose, most tissues showed less than 10% of their peak radioactivity concentrations. Pigmented rats showed 18-fold higher peak values of radioactivity in the eyeball compared to that observed in albino rats and the elimination half-life of radioactivity from the eyeball was estimated to be 157 days. A high percentage of the radioactivity corresponded to metabolites (with no pharmacological activity).

In pregnant rats, low levels of mirabegron-derived components crossed the placental barrier and were transferred to the fetus. Mirabegron-derived components were excreted into the milk.

## Metabolism

Mirabegron is metabolized via multiple pathways involving dealkylation, oxidation, glucuronidation, and amide hydrolysis. The metabolic rate was faster in cynomolgus monkeys, followed by dogs and rats, then humans. Metabolites generated by human microsomes were also formed by at least one of the animal species examined. A total of 18 metabolites from mirabegron were identified in plasma, urine and/or bile from male mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys and humans. In human urine and plasma, ten and eight metabolites were identified respectively. All the metabolites found in human plasma were also observed either in rat or cynomolgus monkey plasma, suggesting that both species are relevant species for toxicity studies.

## Excretion

After oral administration of 14 C-mirabegron at 10 mg/kg in the rat, elimination of radioactivity accounted for 94.1% of the total radioactivity (18.8% in the urine and 75.3% in the feces). When the same dose was administered to the monkey, the overall radioactivity recovered accounted for 101% (46.8% in urine and 54.2% in feces) while in bile duct cannulated male rat, the excretion rate of radioactivity was 37.3% in the urine and 29.4% in the bile suggesting that enterohepatic circulation occurs in this species. In humans, urine and fecal excretion accounted for 55.0% and 34.2% respectively.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Mirabegron was administered to fasting rats at single oral doses of 300, 500, and 800 mg/kg and observed for mortality and general conditions for 14 days. The lethal dose of mirabegron was ≥ 800 mg/kg. Other findings reported in the study included hypoactivity, salivation and lacrimation in all groups. Chromodacryorrhea was observed at 300 mg/kg and prone position together with loss of body weight at ≥ 500 mg/kg, while clonic convulsion was reported at 800 mg/kg. Necropsy of one dead male at 800 mg/kg revealed a pale liver. Histopathological examination showed hepatocyte hypertrophy and vacuolar degeneration around the liver lobule.

Mirabegron was also administered to dogs as a single oral dose of 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg to one male and one female beagle dog per group. The lethal dose of mirabegron was ≥ 30 mg/kg. Skin reddening and increased heart rate was observed in all groups. Vomiting was reported in the 30 mg/kg group. Histopathological  examination  revealed  focal  acinar  dilatation/  disruption  in  the  zygomatic  gland  at 0.3 and 3 mg/kg while necrosis of the zygomatic gland was reported at 30 mg/kg.

## Repeat dose toxicity

Mirabegron was extensively studied in oral repeated dose studies in mice (two weeks), rats (26 weeks), dogs (two weeks) and monkeys (52 weeks). Additional short term studies were also carried out by intravenous repeated dose administration in rats and monkeys.

In the mouse, repeated oral administration of mirabegron for 5 days, resulted in the death of an animal at 300 mg/kg. The animal showed decreased spontaneous movement and clonic convulsion. Dose related increase of the frequency of reduced spontaneous movement was reported; a finding that was also reported during a 2-week study, tended to diminish with repeated administration. Plasma concentration increased dose proportionally up to 100 mg/kg but thereafter the increase was less than proportional with dose. Increased food consumption and increases in red blood cell count, haemoglobin and hematocrit were reported. Blood chemistry showed non-dose or gender related changes. Liver weight was increased. In males, heart, lung and spleen weights were also increased. Decreased lipid droplet size in the brown and reduced adipocyte size with multi-vacuolated cytoplasm in the white fat were reported. Extramedullary hematopoiesis was identified in both genders at 100 mg/kg and increased pale areas of hepatocytes were reported in males. A NOAEL was not identified. There were no marked differences in Cmax or AUC0-24h on repeated dosing.

Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats revealed enzyme increases in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels at dose levels of mirabegron of ≥ 30 mg/kg. In a 13-week study, hepatocyte necrosis was observed at doses of ≥100 mg/kg; however, these findings were not observed at the same dose levels following 26 weeks of daily administration.

Decreased locomotor activity was reported at high doses of ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in a 2 week study and prone position was noted at 3 mg/kg in males and 10 mg/kg in females (systemic exposures of 0.3 and 1.7-fold the human exposure at MRHD, respectively). Decreased platelet counts were seen in all rat studies at 100 mg/kg and alterations in reticulocyte counts at 300 mg/kg although the latter was only observed during a 2-week repeated dose study. Triglycerides were decreased in rat studies from doses of 10 mg/kg (2.7-fold of the exposure at the MRHD). Reversible eosinophilic changes were noted in liver hepatocytes of rats administered mirabegron. Electron microscopic evaluation of this finding suggested that the eosinophilic changes were the result of a decrease in the number of glycogen particles in the hepatocytes.

Renal effects of mirabegron were limited to changes in urine volume and electrolyte excretion in rats and were probably due to the pharmacological effects of the drug.

Studies in the dog were of short duration and the main findings were of a cardiovascular nature. Skin reddening and ventricular tachycardia (and subsequent death) at 20 mg/kg were reported. At ≥ 10 mg/kg, a clear increase in heart rate was reported, together with ECG increases in P wave duration, QRS interval and T wave amplitude prolongation and a reduction in P-R interval. Swelling around the eyes, ocular discharge and/or reddened sclera and the microscopic pathology findings of degeneration/inflammation of the zygomatic salivary gland were reported at ≥ 3 mg/kg. At 20 mg/kg, vacuolation in the liver was observed in males and myocardial degeneration of the left ventricle in females. Endocardial hemorrhage in the left ventricle of the heart, periportal vacuolation of the liver, focal areas of loss of blood in the red pulp of the spleen, and hemorrhage/congestion of the thymus were observed in females at 20 mg/kg that died during the treatment period. The implications of cardiovascular findings have been discussed previously. As the 20 mg/kg dose was lethal to some of the animals it could not be repeatedly administered to surviving animals. In a 3-day study in dogs, slight increases of liver enzymes and hepatocellular hypertrophy were noted at a lethal dose; these changes were reversible in surviving animals.

Repeated dose studies in the cynomolgus monkey demonstrated ventricular tachycardia at 60 mg/kg. In a 13-week study, ventricular tachycardia was reported in one animal at 30 mg/kg/day at one time point and was confirmed in a 52-week repeated-dose monkey study at the same dose. The PR interval tended to be prolonged in both males and females at ≥ 10 mg/kg. Following IV administration, transient ventricular tachycardia and prolongation of the PR interval was observed at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day, as well as a slight transient prolongation of the QRS interval at 3 mg/kg/day.

## Genotoxicity

Mirabegron as assessed by the bacterial reverse mutation test, the human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test and the rat micronucleus test was not genotoxic.

## Carcinogenicity

Repeated administration of mirabegron to mice and rats for 104 weeks did not reveal a potential to cause carcinogenicity at doses up to 100 mg/kg.

## Reproduction Toxicity

Studies to evaluate the effect of mirabegron on fertility and early embryonic development in the rat revealed no effects on male fertility up to 100 mg/kg, although it has been reported that 14 males at 300 mg/kg died. It should be noted that half of the untreated females that copulated with the males in this group were non-pregnant and the numbers of corpora lutea, implantations and live embryos were lower in 3 pregnant non treated females. In female rats at 300 mg/kg, prolonged diestrus was observed, as was a decrease in the number of corpora lutea, implantations and live fetuses. A reduction in the size of the prostate, seminal vesicles and uterus was noted during the repeated dose studies in the rat. In addition, regression of the X-zone adrenal glands in the female was noted following repeated oral administration for 13 weeks. The Applicant has clarified that the effects on reproduction are evident at lethal doses only and that fertility changes were reported at exposures that were 156- and 204- fold higher than the human exposure at MRHD in males and females respectively. Moreover, in the monkey, no effects on ovulation frequency or in male and female reproductive organs were reported in the 52-week study. The reduction in fertility and the effects on the seminal vesicles may be secondary to the general condition of the animals. The regression of the X-zone in the adrenal glands of the female rat, was a finding that could not be confirmed in any of the other studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reduced fetal body weight, delayed ossification, wavy ribs and other skeletal anomalies were noted in rat embryofetal studies at exposures that are higher than those proposed clinically. Reduced fetal body weight, dilated aorta, cardiomegaly and increased post-implantation loss were noted during the rabbit embryofetal development study. The exposures at the NOAEL for embryo development are below those proposed clinically. The applicant has conducted follow-up investigative studies and the data suggest the observed cardiovascular malformations and post-implantation loss may be due to the activity of mirabegron or its metabolites at the β1-adrenoceptor. Therefore Mirabegron is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. This is clearly labelled in the relevant parts of the SmPC.

In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, mirabegron had no effects on reproductive function of the dams at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, and up to 30 mg/kg/day for the offspring.

## Toxicokinetic data

See paragraphs above.

## Local Tolerance

Local tolerance studies suggest that mirabegron was not irritant to rabbit skin following dermal application, but was irritant to the ocular mucosa of rabbits. Following intravenous administration of mirabegron, edema and erythema were observed at the injection site.

In vitro studies revealed that mirabegron does not have the potential to cause hemolysis at the concentrations tested.

In vivo studies in guinea pigs indicate that mirabegron shows a moderate skin sensitizing potential in the adjuvant/patch test and the Buehler test.

Due to the characteristics and intended use of mirabegron, concerns related to dependence potential are not expected.

## Other toxicity studies

The assessment of impurities was outlined in the quality dossier. The specification limit for the major impurity, YM181687 was set to 1%. The Applicant performed a qualification study with levels of Impurity YM181687 as high as 1.51%, including a 2-week toxicity study in rats. The study is considered acceptable as an increasing level of impurity YM181687 neither increased the toxicity nor changed the toxicity profile of mirabegron. The Applicant has also provided additional data (DEREK analysis) which demonstrates that YM181687 does not display an alert for genotoxicity.

Mirabegron does not absorb light at the wavelengths in the range of 290-700 nm. Thus, there is no need for photosafety testing with this product.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Applicant has performed an environmental risk assessment for mirabegron. During the Phase I of the assessment, the calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) has resulted in a PECsurfacewater above 0.01 µg/L, and consequently a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis was carried out. The assessment of 'Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Systems' study (OECD 308) was not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

carried out according to OECD recommendations. Although the guideline requests to conduct both aerobic and anaerobic transformation the study only included data on aerobic transformation. The Applicant justified the lack of including an anaerobic assessment in the study as the 'Questions and Answers on 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010), states that this type of study would not be required for this type of medicinal product. This was considered acceptable and no further clarification with respect to the ERA is warranted.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The Applicant has carried out an extensive non clinical development program related to the requested indication.

In vitro , mirabegron has substantially higher affinity for the β3 adrenoceptor, when compared to the β1 and β2 adrenoceptors. No functional agonism at the β1 or β2 receptors occurred at concentrations that were at least 21-fold higher than that observed clinically. The results from studies with rat bladder strips suggest a relaxant effect mediated by β3-ARs.

In vivo studies in anesthetized rats revealed that mirabegron decreased the resting intravesical pressure and also decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contractions without affecting the contraction force. Given that the three β-adrenoceptor subtypes (i.e. β1, β2 and β3) are expressed in human detrusor muscle, the Applicant has provided some evidence that the observed relaxation in the human bladder may be mediated by the β3-receptor. However, not all of the mechanistic aspects have been demonstrated experimentally; hence, the CHMP recommended performing additional mechanistic studies post authorisation to elucidate whether human bladder relaxation induced by mirabegron is indeed mediated via the β3-receptor.

Oral administration to conscious dogs and monkeys showed that mirabegron caused an increase in heart rate. In the dog, mirabegron (at ≥0.03 mg/kg) increased heart rate (and shortened PR interval) at doses lower than those proposed clinically. Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were also significantly decreased at 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. In the cynomolgus monkey, mirabegron increased heart rate at 10 mg/kg (Cmax approx 29.6 fold higher than that observed at the MRHD).

After single intravenous administration of mirabegron to conscious dogs, heart rate increases and ECG changes together with histopathological findings were only reported in dogs at lethal doses while histopathological findings observed in the heart in monkeys were limited to the fat tissue surrounding the heart (small adipocytes and multivacuolated cytoplasm) with no histopathological findings in the cardiomyocytes. In humans at the MRHD the heart rate increase was limited to approximately 1 bpm.

Non clinical studies in dogs and monkeys did not indicate any potential for QT prolongation in man at the proposed clinical dose of 50 mg. However, as sporadic increases in QTCB were observed following repeated administration to the monkey (where the Cmax was ~11-fold higher than that proposed clinically) and as an increase in QT prolongation has been observed at supra therapeutic doses in man, the Applicant was requested to conduct a post-authorisation study to further evaluate cardiovascular safety in man (see Clinical Safety), details of which has been included in the Risk Management Plan.

Mirabegron absorption was studied after single and repeated dose administration in fasted and non fasted males (rat, mouse and dog). Mirabegron was well and rapidly absorbed in the species tested.

Repeated dosing of mirabegron in non fasted male rats for 21 days indicate that the AUC24h and Cmax increased with increasing doses and steady state was achieved by Day 17.

In pregnant rats, low levels of mirabegron-derived components crossed the placental barrier and were transferred to the fetus. Reduced fetal body weight, dilated aorta, cardiomegaly and increased postimplantation loss were noted during the rabbit embryofetal development study at exposures that are higher than those proposed clinically and occurred at doses associated with maternal toxicity. However, the exposures at the NOAEL for embryo development are below those proposed clinically. Furthermore, mirabegron-derived components were excreted into the milk of rodents; hence, the SmPC clearly states that mirabegron is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception, and that mirabegron should not be administered during breast feeding.

Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have shown no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential in vivo .

Based on environmental risk assessment studies, mirabegron is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical data which have been provided on the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of this application are sufficient to support the proposed indication. The SmPC adequately describes the information currently available. Regarding the mechanism of action, the CHMP recommends to carry out additional mechanistic studies in order to clarify whether mirabegroninduced bladder relaxation is mediated via the β 3-receptor in humans.

The cardiovascular safety will be further characterised through the measures identified in the risk management plan, particularly a post-authorisation safety study (see Clinical Safety). The observed embryofetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits occurred at doses higher than those proposed clinically and the observed malformations are thought to be mediated via activation of the β 1-receptor. As a precautionary measure, the SmPC clearly states that mirabegron is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The clinical development program consists of 41 studies in patients with OAB, patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/ bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. For a detailed description of the clinical data package relevant for the applied indication see chapter 2.5 Clinical efficacy.

The initial clinical development program examined an indication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was subsequently discontinued due to the absence of efficacy demonstrated in this population based on proof of concept studies. A total of 29 phase 1 studies and 12 phase 2 and 3 studies (9 in patients with OAB, 1 in patients with LUTS/BOO and 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus) have been conducted globally in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia/New Zealand and South Africa.

The primary studies to support efficacy of mirabegron were designed consistent with Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidance for the clinical investigation of medicinal products for urinary incontinence. Further, the company received national scientific advice from national Competent Authorities. In general, the recommendations from the authorities were followed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of mirabegron in plasma and urine were studied in healthy young and elderly volunteers, patients suffering from overactive bladder, diabetes mellitus, and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

A total of 29 studies were included to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron. Mirabegron and M5, M8, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15 and M16 metabolites were determined in plasma, urine, and feces. Standard procedures for non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis were applied. Three population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.

## Absorption

Mirabegron absorption is likely to be dose dependent. In the popPK analysis the total bioavailability of 50 mg of mirablegron (OCAS-M formulation) was reported to be around 20%. However, a more than proportional increase in the bioavailability as a function of dose was reported. The higher the dose, the higher the proportion of the dose that is absorbed probably due to the saturation of active transport enzymes, and Pg-P. The absolute bioavailability of mirabegron OCAS tablets was shown to decrease with decreasing in vitro release rate. Administration of OCAS tablets with three different dissolution rates (OCAS-H (fast release), OCAS-M (Phase 3 OCAS) and OCAS-L (slow release)) demonstrated that the absolute bioavailability was highest for the fast release tablet and lowest for the slow release tablet. Mean absolute bioavailability estimates for OCAS-H, OCAS-M and OCAS-L tablets were 43%, 35% and 30%, respectively, at a dose of 50 mg (study 178-CL-076).

The absolute bioavailability (F) of a single oral dose of mirabegron OCAS under fasted conditions increased with dose, resulting in a more than dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC with increasing oral dose from 50 to 150 mg. F averaged 24.3% for the 50 mg dose and 45.2% for the 150 mg dose (study 178-CL-033).

The food effect on mirabegron absorption is clear. With 50 mg tablets, the ratio and 90% CI values for AUCinf and Cmax of mirabegron were 17% lower (90% CI of the GM ratio: 74.16, 93.42) and 45% lower (90% CI of the GM ratio: 43.69, 68.65), respectively, after high-fat breakfast. Low-fat breakfast reduced the mean AUCinf and Cmax by 51% and 75%, respectively. The differential effect of a high-fat and low-fat meal on the bioavailability of mirabegron may be explained by a higher fraction that is adsorbed to contents of a low-fat breakfast, in particular cereal, compared with a high-fat breakfast. In addition, the differences in the specific constituents between high- and low-fat meals may differentially affect uptake and efflux transport of mirabegron from the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of food depends on the quantity of fat, and it is also different depending on the gender (women show a higher increase in bioavailability when the drug is taken with food).

There were no apparent differences in the magnitude of the food effect between Western and Japanese healthy volunteers or between males and females. There were no food restrictions in the primary phase 3 studies; efficacy and safety of the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg was established in these studies with the administration of mirabegron with or without food. Mirabegron can be taken with or without food.

## Distribution

Mirabegron has a large volume of distribution of approximately 1670 mL indicating extensive distribution. Mirabegron is moderately bound (approximately 71%) to human plasma proteins, including albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Small changes were observed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment and those observed for mild or moderate hepatic impairment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

however, it is not probable that these changes have any clinical relevance considering the relative change and the high volume of distribution of mirabegron.

Mirabegron distributes to red blood cells. However no clinical effect is expected even if the erythrocyte concentration decreases. The volume of distribution of mirabegron of around 1670 mL across studies indicates that mirabegron highly distributes in the organism.

## Elimination

The excretion process is independent of dose or administration route and is not altered with repeated dosing. Part of the renal excretion is through active secretion.

The total body clearance (CL) from plasma is estimated to be approximately 57 L/h. Blood clearance is estimated to be approximately 41 L/hr, which is about half the liver blood flow.

Based on population PK analysis the effective half-life of mirabegron was determined to be 19.0 hours. This is shorter than the estimates for the terminal t1/2 obtained in the clinical mass balance study and the studies which use a prolonged sampling schedule suggesting that the terminal t1/2 comprises a small fraction of the total AUCinf.

Renal clearance was decreased in subjects with renal impairment and in elderly subjects, in particular in elderly females, in comparison to the respective control groups, consistent with the generally lower renal capacity in these subjects.

All circulating mirabegron metabolites represented a larger percentage of the parent exposure after oral administration of mirabegron compared to IV administration, suggesting that mirabegron undergoes intestinal and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism following oral administration.

Metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios were relatively constant across multiple oral doses of 25 to 200 mg qd, indicating that the metabolism of mirabegron is not saturable over this dose range.

No studies have been performed to determine whether differences in the pharmacogenetics regarding the UGT, and CYP enzymes other than CYP2D6 would have any effect on the metabolism of mirabegron. it is predicted from the urinary excretion data that the UGT system metabolizes approximately 10% of the absorbed drug dose. Of the 10 metabolites observed in human urine, 6 metabolites were formed via glucuronidation, 3 primary (M11, M13 and M14) and 2 secondary glucuronides (M12 and M15) and one tertiary glucuronide (M17). An exploratory in vitro study with recombinant UGTs and a panel of human liver microsomes (correlation study) identified UGT2B7 as the primary UGT forming the major metabolite, M11, with limited contribution of UGT1A1, the UGT that has been associated with clinically relevant genotypic variations. Considering the unimodal distribution of the values of the ratios of the AUCs of M11 to parent (MRp) and the low percentage of mirabegron that could be metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases it is unlikely that pharmacogenetic variation in UGTs or inhibitors or inducers of glucuronidation have a significant effect on mirabegron pharmacokinetics.

The affinity of the metabolites detected in plasma for the beta-3-adrenoceptor was much smaller than that reported for mirabegron. Although no protein binding of the metabolites have been performed, considering the plasma concentrations and the affinity for the beta-3 adrenoceptor it is not likely that any of them contribute to the observed effect.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No deviations from dose proportionality in mirabegron PK parameters were observed after single-dose intravenous administration of mirabegron. After oral administration, a greater than dose-proportional

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increase in mirabegron Cmax and AUC was observed, due to an increase in absolute bioavailability with increasing dose.

In the overall population of males and females, a 2-fold increase in dose increased mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau by approximately 2.9- and 2.6-fold, respectively, within the dose range of 25 mg to 200 mg. Similar fold increases were obtained for males and females separately. Mirabegron metabolites also demonstrated a more than dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUCtau after multiple mirabegron doses (25 to 200 mg qd), similar to that observed with the parent compound, indicating that the greater than dose-proportional increase in mirabegron exposure is not caused by saturable first-pass metabolism.

Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved within 7 days of once daily dosing with mirabegron. Comparison between AUCtau values following a single dose and at steady state indicated a 2-fold accumulation of mirabegron with once daily dosing. No time-dependency was observed at the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg. At doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, a small increase (less than 20%) in AUCtau at steady state compared with single dose AUCinf was observed, suggesting that mirabegron may exhibit time-dependent PK at supratherapeutic doses. The changes are considered not clinically relevant.

## Special populations

## Impaired renal function

In patients with severe renal impairment there was an increase in Cmax and AUC; the increases were 92% (90% CI: -3%, 281%) and 118% (90% CI: 30%, 267%), respectively compared to the values estimated for healthy volunteers. The suggested reduction of the dose to 25 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment or in those patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and concomitant administration of potent CYP3A inhibitors is accceptable.

## Impaired hepatic function

In vitro and in vivo data suggested that mirabegron is cleared through multiple metabolic pathways and possibly biliary excretion of unchanged drug.

Study 178-CL-039 an open-label, single-dose parallel group study was conducted to assess the single dose pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 100 mg of mirabegron in 32 male and female subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment in relation to healthy subjects. The results showed that Absorption of mirabegron was delayed in subjects with hepatic dysfunction compared to those with normal hepatic function. The t1/2 was increased in mildly impaired subjects to about 68 hours compared to 57 hours in healthy controls. A similar finding was not observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment where the t1/2 was not substantially different from matched controls (mean values, 51 and 54 hours, respectively). No clear relationship was evident between individual Cmax and AUCinf values and the scores of the 5 parameters included in the Child-Pugh scale. In subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 9% and 19% relative to volunteers with normal hepatic function. In volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), mean Cmax and AUCinf values were 175% and 65% higher.

## Gender

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau were approximately 44% to 38% higher, respectively, in females compared with males. The magnitude of the gender differences is attenuated with correction for body weight. Weight-normalized values for Cmax and AUCtau were approximately 23% and 18% higher in females compared to those in males. This remaining increased exposure is attributed to a higher absolute bioavailability of mirabegron in females compared to males. The t1/2 tended to be longer in females (mean values, 59.0 to 67.9 hr) compared with males (mean values, 56.3 to 60.0 hr).

## Race

There are limited data regarding the influence of different ethnic origin on the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron However, results from the TQT study 178-CL-077 which included a similar number of White/Caucasian volunteers and Black or African American volunteers did not show an effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron.

## Genetic polymorphism

In spite of the low number of ultrarapid and poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, no dose adjustment appear to be necessary in poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, however AUC and Cmax in ultra-rapid metabolizers are reduced to half in intermediate and extended metabolizers. At doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg in Study 178-CL-077, mean AUCtau of mirabegron was approximately 30%, 43% and 9% lower, respectively, in volunteers with the UM phenotype compared to volunteers with the EM phenotype. Mean Cmax was approximately 30% and 47% lower, respectively, in volunteers with the UM phenotype compared to volunteers with the EM phenotype at doses of 50 and 100 mg, respectively, while for the 200 mg dose, mean Cmax values were similar.

## Elderly

The effect of age on mirabegron pharmacokinetics was specifically evaluated in Study 178-CL-031. A Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, exploratory study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of mirabegron OCAS-M in healthy young male and female subjects and healthy elderly male and female subjects. No relevant differences were notable between the young and elderly groups apart from the age.

No consistent differences in mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau were found in elderly versus young subjects. Terminal elimination half-life tended to be longer in elderly subjects (mean values, 60 to 68 hours) compared with young subjects (mean values, 55 to 60 hours), but the differences were generally not more than a few hours.

Population PK analysis of phase 2 and 3 data indicated that age affected mirabegron exposure. The typical AUC was predicted to be 11% higher in a subject aged 90 years compared to a typical OAB subject aged 60 years. Dose adjustment based on age is not necessary.

## Weight

The magnitude of the observed mirabegron exposure differences between male and female volunteers and between Japanese and Western volunteers was attenuated with correction for body weight. Population PK analysis of phase 2 and 3 data confirmed that body weight affected mirabegron exposure. Relative to a subject with a body weight of 70 kg, AUCtau was about 53% higher in a subject with a body weight of 30 kg and approximately 17% lower in a subject with a body weight of 100 kg. The increase in exposure with lower body weight is less than would be achieved if the dose were doubled (resulting in a 190% and 160% increase in Cmax and AUC, respectively). Given documented safety of mirabegron at a 100 mg dose (twice the proposed therapeutic dose), the effect of body weight on plasma exposure is considered not clinically significant. Dose adjustment based on body weight is not necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The influence of weight (including other body size measures such as body mass index, lean body mass and height) has been investigated across a number of population PK analyses using data from healthy subjects and patients with OAB who received IR or OCAS formulations [178-PK-003, 178-PK-012, 178PK-015]. In the population PK analysis of phase 2 and 3 data [178-PK-015], a 10% increase in weight was found to increase mirabegron CL and central volume of distribution by 5%. Relative to a subject with a body weight of 70 kg, AUCtau increased by 52.8 % for a body weight of 30 kg and decreased by 16.5% for a body weight of 100 kg. Dose adjustment based on body weight, according to this analysis is not necessary.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

In vitro data suggest that mirabegron is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, but also by CYP2D6 and UGT. CYP3A4 inhibitors reduce mirabegron metabolism. Studies of mirabegron using human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP enzymes showed that mirabegron is a moderate and timedependent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Mirabegron inhibited P-gp-mediated drug transport at high concentrations.

The coadministration of mirabegron with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors increases mirabegron plasma concentrations. Mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf values were increased when coadministered with ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) by 45% and 81%, respectively. However, these changes are not considered to have clinical relevance. Only when the mirabegron is coadministered with potent CYP3A inhibitor in patients with mildly impaired hepatic metabolism or mild / moderate renal impairment the concentrations of mirabegron increase in such a manner that a dose reduction from 50 mg to 25 mg seems appropriate.

Following coadministration of mirabegron with rifampin (CYP3A4 inductor) maximum concentration and AUC were decreased 35-40% with respect to the values obtained when mirabegron was administered alone. This reduction could be due to a decreased bioavailability of mirabegron through induction of intestinal and first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP and UGT enzymes. In addition, rifampin may have also induced intestinal P-gp efflux of mirabegron. The effect of rifampin on mirabegron exposure was generally greater in females than in males. No interaction with clinical relevance is likely between mirabegron and CYP3A4 inductors.

No dose adjustment is claimed for mirabegron when coadministered with inhibitors of CYP2D6, although no study has been performed using this type of drugs, it is based on the fact that in vitro data indicates a minor involvement of CYP2D6 and the lack of changes in the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron in PMs for this isoenzyme.

Two drug interaction studies were performed to investigate whether mirabegron inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in vivo (160 mg immediate release [IR] once a day [qd], Study 178-CL-005; and 100 mg OCAS qd, Study 178-CL-058). Coadministration of mirabegron with substrates of CYP2D6 (desipramine and metoprolol) resulted in small modifications of the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron. However Cmax and AUC of desipramine and metoprolol were increased by 79% and 241% respectively when coadministered with mirabegron. It is taken into account that both drug-drug interaction studies investigated supratherapeutic doses of mirabegron. Drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates are not expected to require dose adjustment, except for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are significantly metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore a cautionary statement reflecting this is included into the SmPC.

Considering the results obtained when co administering mirabegron with warfarin it is not likely an interaction between mirabegron and CYP2C9 substrates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to establish that there is no risk to patients who may take mirabegron in combination with drugs that utilize the P-gp transporter, the effect of mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a known substrate for P-gp, was studied in healthy volunteers. In the presence of mirabegron, mean increases in digoxin AUClast and Cmax of 27% and 29% were observed after a single digoxin dose (0.25 mg). The same results were obtained in an exploratory analysis when subjects were included as random effects instead of fixed effects. The confidence intervals for the ratios for both AUClast and Cmax exceed the pre-specified interval of 0.80 - 1.25, thus a clinically relevant effect of mirabegron on digoxin pharmacokinetics cannot be excluded. Since there was a 28% difference in plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) for mirabegron between males and females, the effect of sex on the interaction of mirabegron and digoxin was assessed. The ANOVA model which explored sex effects and treatment by sex interactions for ratios of AUClast or Cmax showed non-significant p-values for main effects of sex and for the interaction term. The potential for inhibition of P-gp by mirabegron is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

The PD effects of mirabegron were investigated throughout the clinical development programme in healthy volunteers and patients with overactive bladder. Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted to explore the cardiovascular effects and intra-ocular pressure effects of mirabegron. In addition, 2 Thorough QT (TQT) studies were conducted.

## Mechanism of action

Mirabegron is a selective agonist for human beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) which is dominant in the human detrusor muscle. Activation of the beta-AR in the bladder trigone facilitates urine storage through flattening and lengthening of the bladder base. Mirabegron dose-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations in bladder tissues isolated from rats and showed a potent relaxant effect in isolated rat and human bladder strips pre-contracted with carbachol at low contraction tonus. It decreased the resting intravesical pressure in a rat model and in anesthetised rats; mirabegron decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contractions without affecting the force of the rhythmic bladder contractions.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The relationship between plasma concentrations of mirabegron and its effects on the overactive bladder have been shown in three different PK/PD analysis (178-PK-005, 178-PK-009 and 178-PK015). In the three analyses individual plasma exposure to mirabegron were obtained from a previously developed pharmacokinetic model (study 178-PK-015). In all of them an Emax model best fitted the relationship between mirabegron AUC and the number of micturitions with respect to the baseline level and the modification of the volume of urine voided (with respect to baseline level). In those analyses it was shown that mirabegron reduces the number of incontinent episodes, although the effect is not related to the degree of exposure to mirabegron. The primary pharmacology study in male patients (≥ 45 years of age) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) showed bladder relaxation with mirabegron during the filling phase and inhibition of the frequency of non-voiding activity, without impairing voiding efficiency. This study provides supportive evidence of the mechanism of action in patients. Further the endpoints in the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, especially mean voided volume, demonstrate an effect on urine storage capacity. The CHMP acknowledges the data provided on the mechanism of action. However, the population where voiding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

urodynamic measurements were performed is different from the overactive bladder population and the data do not demonstrate an unequivocal mechanism of action on the human bladder in vivo. Therefore the applicant was asked to develop a plan for studies to unequivocally elucidate the mechanism of action of mirabegron post authorisation.

In healthy subjects mirabegron increased heart rate and reduced SV while CO remained essentially unchanged. Coadministration of propranolol or bisoprolol attenuated the mirabegron-stimulated decrease in SV. However, these two antagonists are not selective of beta3-AR and thus it is difficult to clarify whether the cardiac effects of mirabegron are mediate by beta 1, beta 2 or beta3-AR.

Regarding the QTC, a PK/PD model was developed including an effect compartment, plus linear relationship between changes in QTc and plasma concentrations in the biophase to explore the predicted change in the QTc after the administration of 100 and 200 mg of mirabegron in males and females. The drug is able to produce a change higher than 5 msec at both doses, in females. Predictions have been performed for 50 mg doses in females, and in patients suffering from different degrees of renal or hepatic impairment. According to the model women are more sensitive to changes in the QTc than men at similar plasma concentrations. TQT results are discussed under Clinical Safety Laboratory Findings - ECG.

Even though the exposure of mirabegron depends on the age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment and coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, under no conditions did the upper 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean ddQTc interval exceed 10 msec. Maximal ddQTc intervals did not increase more than 30 msec in any virtual subject under any conditions. 95% of subjects had maximal QTc intervals less than 500 msec for all simulation groups, except for 75 year old females with mild renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment and taking ketoconazole who had maximal ddQTc values of 500.4 msec (95th percentile). In conclusion mirabegron 50 mg dose does not raise safety concerns related to the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure to mirabegron) are considered under usual circumstances.

The population PK/PD analyses found small mean effects of mirabegron exposure on blood pressure in patients with overactive bladder, restricted to males in the case of systolic blood pressure and to younger patients in the case of diastolic blood pressure. Simulations of SBP showed that for 50 and 100 mg daily doses in male OAB patients, mean increases from baseline of 0.80 and 1.75 mmHg respectively could be expected at steady state. Simulations of DBP showed that for 50 and 100 mg daily doses in OAB patients aged 18 to 50 years, mean increases from baseline of 0.40 and 0.80 mmHg respectively could be expected at steady state. Simulations performed to predict the effect of mirabegron on SBP or DB in women over 55 years in situations mimicking possible renal or hepatic impairment showed that there will be no clinically significant changes in SBP and DBP unless mirabegron is coadministered with potent CYP3A inhibitors. In that case mirabegron dose reduction to 25 mg as labeled in the SmPC is reasonable.

Pharmocodynamic drug interaction studies with tamusolin, metformin and warfarin show that that PD interactions are unlikely when administered together with mirabegron. Results from specific ocular safety assessments in phase 1 studies, including a study performed with a non-contact air-puff tonometer [178-CL-031], do not demonstrate an effect on IOP and do not show clinically significant changes in visual acuity or fundoscopy at mirabegron doses up to 400 mg as a single dose or 300 mg/day as multiple doses over 10 consecutive days [178-CL-034].

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

After oral administration, a greater than dose-proportional increase in mirabegron Cmax and AUC was observed, due to an increase in absolute bioavailability with increasing dose. In the overall population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of males and females, a 2-fold increase in dose increased mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau by approximately 2.9- and 2.6-fold, respectively, within the dose range of 25 mg to 200 mg. Similar fold increases were obtained for males and females separately. The applicant indicates that the target exposure range of mirabegron is based on the plasma exposure observed with mirabegron 50 mg and is bracketed by the exposure observed with the 2 doses on either side evaluated in the program, namely 25 mg and 100 mg. The definition of this range is based on the demonstrated efficacy within this range in the absence of dose-dependent safety signals when the dose is varied between 25 mg and 100 mg. This indicates that the degree of difference in mirabegron exposure caused by an intrinsic or extrinsic factor that is of no clinical consequence is a 2.6-fold change in AUC or a 2.9-fold change in Cmax in either direction.

In vitro data suggest that mirabegron is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, but also by CYP2D6 and UGT. The coadministration of mirabegron with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors increases mirabegron plasma concentrations. Mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf values were increased when coadministered with ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) by 66% and 100%, respectively, in females. However, these changes are not considered to have clinical relevance.

Coadministration of mirabegron with substrates of CYP2D6 (desipramine and metoprolol) resulted in small modifications of the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron. However Cmax and AUC of desipramine and metoprolol were increased around 2 and 3 fold respectively when coadministered with mirabegron. Therefore cautionary statements were included into the SmPC for the concomitant use of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are significantly metabolized by CYP2D6.

With respect to Pg-P substrates, the interaction was studied with digoxin. Changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin were observed. Since digoxin is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug it was included into the SmPC that, for patients who are initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should be prescribed initially. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect.

Following single dose administration of 100 mg mirabegron in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 9% and 19% relative to volunteers with normal hepatic function. In volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), mean Cmax and AUCinf values were 175% and 65% higher. A reduction of the dose to 25 mg once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is recommended. Further the CHMP considered that also patients with mild hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitor could have mirabegron plasma exposure around or outside the acceptable upper boundary. Therefore, a dose reduction to 25 mg for patients with mild hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inihitors was included into the SmPC; use of mirabegron in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who concomitantly receive strong CYP3A inihitors is not recommended according to the SmPC.

Similarly patients with severe renal impairments showed an increase in Cmax and AUC superior to 100% with respect to the values estimated for healthy volunteers. Therefore recommendation for reduction of the dose to 25 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment or in those patients with mild or moderate renal impairment if concomitantly receiving a potent CYP3A inhibitors was included into the SmPC.

Regarding the QTC, a PK/PD model was developed. Even though the exposure of mirabegron depends on the age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment and coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, under no conditions did the upper 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean ddQTc interval exceed 10 msec. Maximal ddQTc intervals did not increase more than 30 msec in any virtual subject under any conditions. 95% of subjects had maximal QTc intervals less than 500 msec for all simulation groups,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

except for 75 year old females with mild renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment and taking ketoconazole who had maximal ddQTc values of 500.4 msec (95th percentile). In conclusion mirabegron 50 mg dose does not raise safety concerns related to the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure to mirabegron) are considered under usual circumstances.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

In terms of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions, mirabegron exposure increased when applied with CYP3A4 inhibitors and substrates of CYP2D6. Further with respect to interaction with Pg-P substrates, changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin were observed. Appropriate cautionary statements and, when applicable, dose reductions, were included into the SmPC. Although the available information on the mechanism of action is considered sufficient by the CHMP, the applicant is recommended to explore it further, particularly in light of the available clinical efficacy data. With regard to cardiovascular safety, the proposed dose does not raise safety concerns related to the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age are considered; further data will be generated as detailed in the risk management plan (see clinical safety).

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of mirabegron in the treatment of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), including urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency was evaluated in 9 studies, including:

- 1 phase 2a proof-of-concept study (178-CL-008),
- 2 supportive phase 2b studies (178-CL-045 and 178-CL-044),
- 3 primary phase 3 studies (178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074),
- 1 supportive phase 3 study (178-CL-048),
- 1 phase 3 active-controlled long-term safety study (178-CL-049), and
- 1 phase 3 open label, long-term safety study (178-CL-051).

The phase 3 program evaluated doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg mirabegron orally once daily.

Quantitative symptoms were the basis for the preliminary assessment of the efficacy and the doseresponse relationship. Little differences in terms of effect appear to be between 25 and 200 mg dosages, showing a flat dose effect curve. OAB patients experienced a reduction of 1.9 (25 mg) to 2.2 (200 mg) of daily micturitions and 1.2 to 1.3 (25-200 mg) of incontinence episodes. A similar pattern was followed by the other defining condition symptoms urgency and nocturia.

From the safety point of view the selection of the dose for Phase III appears to be driven by the adverse beta-adrenergic effects, in which a clearer dose-effect relationship was determined. This effect is mainly apparent on heart rate. A dose-dependent pulse rate increase was observed, being significant over 100 mg.

In conclusion, dose selection for Phase 3 was based on both tolerability and efficacy grounds, although the more clear relationship with the dose level is related to safety. As a consequence, mirabegron 200 mg was no longer tested. Doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg were selected for confirmatory studies.

## 2.5.2. Main study(ies)

Three pivotal Phase3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group 12-week studies support the use of mirabegron 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in the treatment of OAB (Studies CL-046, CL-047 and CL-074). Data from these three studies was integrated for pooled-analyses.

These studies had the following design features in common:

- Patients participated in a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period followed by a 12-week doubleblind, placebo-controlled treatment period.
- Patients completed a 3-day micturition diary during the 3 days prior to each study visit.
- Eligible patients were female and male adults who had symptoms of OAB (urinary frequency and urgency with or without incontinence) for at least 3 months and
- Eligible patients experienced frequency of micturition on average ≥ 8 times per 24-hour period and at  least  3  episodes  of  urgency  (grade  3  or  4)  with  or  without  incontinence  during  the  3-day micturition diary period collected during the run-in period.

The studies were conducted with similar statistical methodology. Including:

- The same co-primary efficacy endpoints
- -change from baseline to final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours based on a 3-day micturition diary and
- -change from baseline to final visit in mean number of micturition per 24 hours based on a 3-day micturition diary.
- The same key secondary efficacy endpoints including change from baseline to final visit in mean volume voided per micturition; change from baseline to week 4 in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours; and change from baseline to week 4 in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours.

## Study 178-CL-046

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was a phase III randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo- and active-controlled, multinational, multicenter study. A total of 189 sites in Europe and Australia enrolled patients for the study.

## Methods

## Study Participants

Male and female patients at least 18 years of age who had symptoms of OAB for more than 3 months were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had significant stress incontinence or mixed stress/urgency incontinence with stress as the predominant factor; an indwelling catheter; evidence of a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic inflammation, bladder stones, previous pelvic radiation therapy or previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs; or severe hypertension (defined as a sitting average systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or average diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 110 mm Hg). Additionally, patients were excluded if they practiced intermittent self-catheterization; received nondrug treatment including electro-stimulation therapy; or used medications intended to treat OAB, prohibited medications, or restricted medications without meeting conditions for use.

At baseline patients had to have experienced a micturition frequency on average ≥ 8 times per 24hour period during the 3-day micturition diary period, experienced at least 3 episodes of urgency (grade 3 or 4) with or without incontinence during the 3-day micturition diary period and had to continue to meet all screening eligibility criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an average total daily urine volume &gt; 3000 mL as recorded in the 3-day micturition diary period; they had serum creatinine of &gt; 150 mcmol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal range or gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal, as assessed in screening samples and considered clinically significant by the investigator; or severe hypertension (defined as a sitting average systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or average diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 110 mm Hg); or they had a clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG).

## Treatments

- Mirabegron tablets: 50 mg and 100 mg. One mirabegron tablet (and matching placebo for the other  dose)  was  administered  each  morning  (qd)  by  mouth  with  a  glass  of  water  with  or without  food  to  patients  randomized  to  receive  mirabegron  50  or  100  mg.  Lot  numbers: K0700248 (50 mg tablet); L0700011 (100 mg tablet).
- Two placebo tablets to match mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg were administered to patients randomized to placebo each morning (qd) by mouth with a glass of water with or without food. Lot number: K0700232 (placebo to match mirabegron 50 mg tablet); K0700243 (placebo to match mirabegron 100 mg tablet)
- an  active control,  and  placebo  tablets  to  match  tolterodine  SR  4  mg  capsules  were administered qd by mouth with a glass of water with or without food to patients randomized to receive  tolterodine  SR  4  mg.  Batch  number:  A705314A  (tolterodine  SR  4  mg  capsules); BX1000891 and BX1001013 (placebo to match tolterodine SR 4 mg capsules).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

Primary:  To  assess  the  efficacy  of  mirabegron  50  and  100  mg  versus  placebo  in  the  treatment  of patients with symptoms of OAB.

Secondary: To assess the safety and tolerability of mirabegron 50 and 100 mg versus placebo in the treatment of patients with symptoms of OAB and to place the efficacy and  safety of mirabegron in context with a standard treatment for OAB, tolterodine ER 4 mg.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The co-primary efficacy variables included:

- Change from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours based on a 3 day micturition diary
- Change from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours based on a 3 day micturition diary

The key secondary efficacy variables included; change from baseline to Final Visit in mean volume voided per micturition; change from baseline to week 4 in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours based on a 3 day micturition diary and change from baseline to week 4 in mean number of micturition per 24 hours based on a 3 day micturition diary.

Safety variables included; treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); events adjudicated by the independent cardiovascular adjudication committee; TEAEs of interest (i.e., hypertension, QTc prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, urinary retention/acute urinary retention, hypersensitivity, syncope, seizure, hepatic events and renal and urinary events); clinical laboratory evaluations (i.e., haematology and serum chemistry); Vital signs; ECGs and post-void residual volume (PVR)

Additional Secondary Endpoints

- Change from baseline to week 8 and week 12 in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours
- Change from baseline to week 8 and week 12 in mean number of micturition per24 hours
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, and week 12 in mean volume voided per micturition
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in mean number of urgency episodes (grades 3 or 4) per 24 hours
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in mean level of urgency
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in mean number of pads used per 24 hours

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, 2 responder analyses based on incontinence episodes were performed at week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit using the FAS-I data set. The 2 responder definitions were as follows:

- Zero incontinence episodes: A responder was defined as a subject with 0 incontinence episodes post-baseline
- Reduction in incontinence episodes: A responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours

Additional secondary efficacy variables which were not derived from the 3-day micturition diary were:

- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in Symptom Bother and HRQL scores as assessed by the OAB-q questionnaire
- Change from baseline to week 12 and Final Visit in scores as assessed by the WPAI:SHP questionnaire
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in scores as assessed by the EQ-5D questionnaire
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in scores as assessed by the EQ-5D VAS questionnaire
- Change from baseline to week 12 and Final Visit in PPBC
- Change from baseline to week 12 and Final Visit in the TS-VAS
- Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in number of physician visits for the subject's bladder condition (excluding study-related visits)

In addition, for change from baseline in PPBC, analyses were performed at week 12 and

Final Visit based on the following improvement from baseline definitions:

- Improvement: ≥ 1 point improvement from baseline
- Major improvement: ≥ 2 point improvement from baseline

## Sample size

The sample size of pivotal studies was planned to provide about 90% power to detect a reduction of 0.7 in the mean number of micturitions per 24 hours over placebo in the mirabegron group at a 2sided significance level of 0.05. Both mirabegron doses were compared with placebo by means of the Dunnett's test, which takes into account multiplicity, and the sample size calculation was based on this test. The standard deviation of the primary efficacy variable was assumed to be 2.7.

The sample size calculation for the mean  number  of incontinence episodes was based on nonparametric  methods  since  the  results  of  Study  178-CL-044  indicated  that  the  assumption  of normality might not be valid.

Only patients who were incontinent at baseline were included in the analysis of incontinence episodes. From  Study  178-CL-044,  it  was  estimated  that  this  constituted  about  65%  of  the  population.  The probability that a patient on mirabegron would respond better than a patient on placebo was 60.8%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since the 2 variables are positively correlated (Spearman rank correlation 0.31), the overall power is between 87% and 90%. A dropout rate of 20% during the placebo run-in period was assumed.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomized after all baseline assessments were performed and eligibility for randomization was established. Patient numbers and randomized treatment were allocated by the CIRT system.

Patients who met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria at the end of the singleblind, placebo run-in period, were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment groups (mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg, placebo, or tolterodine SR 4 mg) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization scheme prepared by Pierrel Research Europe GmbH. Randomization was stratified by country.

## Blinding (masking)

During the placebo run-in period, patients were blinded to the identity of study drug. During the double-blind treatment and follow-up periods, the investigator, study site personnel, patients, sponsor and the sponsor's representatives were blinded to the identity of the randomized drug assignment.

## Statistical methods

A full description of the planned statistical methodology was provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which was finalised before the treatment codes were unblinded. The SAP included a number of changes made to the statistical methods described in the protocol.

The following analysis sets were pre-specified:

- Run-in Period Analysis Set (RPAS): all patients who took at least one dose of the single-blind placebo run-in study drug;
- Randomized Analysis Set (RAS): all randomized patients;
- Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study drug and who had a micturition measurement in the baseline diary and at least one postbaseline visit diary with a micturition measurement;
- FAS Incontinence (FAS-I): all FAS patients who had at least one incontinence episode at baseline;
- Per Protocol Set (PPS): FAS patients who did not deviate from the list of pre-specified major protocol violations;
- PPS Incontinence (PPS-I): All PPS patients who had at least one incontinence episode at baseline;
- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study drug and who had a baseline diary with micturition measurements;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ITT Incontinence (ITT-I) Analysis Set: all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study drug and who had micturition measurements and at least one incontinence episode in the baseline diary;
- Safety Analysis Set (SAF): all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study drug.

As patients could be randomised without an incontinence episode in the baseline diary, a separate FAS definition based on micturition and incontinence episodes was defined as FAS-I. The populations for analyses of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and key secondary efficacy endpoints included the FAS and FAS-I.

Two-co-primary efficacy variables, both based on a micturition diary completed by the patients on the 3 study days immediately before visits at Weeks 4, 8 and 12, were defined as follows:

- Change from baseline to end of treatment (Final Visit) in mean number of micturition per 24 hours;
- Change from baseline to end of treatment (Final Visit) in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.

In addition three key secondary efficacy variables were:

- change from baseline to end of treatment (Final Visit) in mean volume voided per micturition;
- change from baseline to Week 4 in mean number of micturition per 24 hours;
- change from baseline to Week 4 in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.

The additional secondary endpoints of Treatment Satisfaction Visual Analog Scale (TS-VAS), HRQL scores as assessed by the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q), and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) were used to collect and analyse subjective outcome measures. A responder analysis was specified for the reduction in incontinence episodes with a responder being defined as a patient that had at least a 50% decrease from baseline in the number of episodes per 24 hours.

All statistical comparisons were made using two-sided tests at the 5% significance level and were testing the treatment difference compared with placebo. The primary comparisons for the co-primary and secondary efficacy variables were between each mirabegron group and placebo with a secondary comparison between tolterodine and placebo. No formal statistical testing was performed to assess the difference between the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups or between each mirabegron group and the tolterodine group.

Missing data for the Final Visit were handled using last observation carried forward (LOCF) methods. All efficacy analyses using Final Visit included data that were measured within 7 days of the last dose of study drug. For all efficacy analyses, to be included in an analysis at a specific time-point the patient needed to have a measurement at that time-point; therefore no values were imputed.

Since there were two co-primary efficacy variables and 3 key secondary efficacy variables, the multiplicity between the variables was controlled at the Type I error rate at the 5% significance level using a stepwise parallel gate-keeping procedure, a hierarchical testing procedure. At each of the five

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stages, the difference between a mirabegron dose group and placebo had to be statistically significant before that mirabegron dose group proceeded to the next stage. The stages and efficacy variables that were evaluated were as follows:

- Stage 1: incontinence episodes at the Final Visit
- Stage 2: micturition at the Final Visit
- Stage 3: volume voided per micturition at the Final Visit
- Stage 4: incontinence episodes at week 4
- Stage 5: micturition at week 4

Since two mirabegron treatment groups were compared with placebo, the Hochberg procedure was performed at the 5% significance level to adjust for multiplicity within each stage described above. If only one of the mirabegron dose groups proceeded to the next stage for any efficacy variable, then the comparison between mirabegron and placebo was assessed at the 2.5% significance level. Since the comparison between tolterodine and placebo was a secondary analysis, no adjustment for multiplicity was necessary.

The stratified rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for hypothesis testing and calculating the pair-wise p-values. The least squares mean estimates and two-sided 95% CIs for mean changes from baseline within treatment group, as well as the mean change from baseline in the difference between each mirabegron treatment group and placebo and between tolterodine and placebo, were derived from the corresponding ANCOVA model with all treatment groups in the model.

Change from baseline to Final Visit (co-primary efficacy variable) and to Week 4 (key secondary efficacy variable) in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was analysed using a separate stratified rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for each pair-wise treatment group difference of interest. The response variable was standardised ranks on change from baseline to Final Visit value for the stratified rank ANCOVA with baseline standardised ranks and gender as covariates and geographical region as a stratum.

Change from baseline to Final Visit (co-primary efficacy variable) and to Week 4 (key secondary efficacy variable) in mean number of micturition per 24 hours was analysed using an ANCOVA including treatment, gender and geographical region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. This ANCOVA model also was used to analyse the change from baseline to Final Visit in mean volume voided per micturition. Within the framework of this ANCOVA model, point estimates and two-sided 95% CIs for the mean change from baseline within each treatment group, as well as for the difference in mean change from baseline between each mirabegron treatment group and placebo and between tolterodine and placebo, were calculated.

To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis, the modelling of the co-primary efficacy variables was repeated using various sensitivity analyses using repeated measures methodology. These sensitivity analyses included investigation of outliers and where appropriate additional analyses were planned excluding outliers. An outlier was defined as an observation for which the residual is more than three interquartile ranges above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile.

The co-primary efficacy variables were also analysed for the following subgroups: race, age, gender and geographical region.

## Conduct of the study

Reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS and PPS-I comprised major protocol violations that affected the co-primary efficacy variables and the key secondary efficacy variable of volume voided per micturition. These included eligibility criteria that were not met, administration of incorrect study drug, poor study drug compliance (defined as &lt; 70% of study taken during the double-blind treatment period), inadequate duration of treatment during the placebo run-in period or double-blind treatment period (defined as &lt; 53 days recorded for the last diary day of the Final Visit), use of prohibited concomitant medication during the placebo run-in period or the double-blind treatment period, and unblinding of treatment for double-blind study drug. Approximately 11% of patients in the FAS and 12% of patients in the FAS-I were excluded from the PPS and PPS-I, respectively. The percentage of patients excluded from the PPS and PPS-I was comparable across all treatment groups. The most frequently cited reason for exclusion reflected an inadequate duration of treatment during the doubleblind treatment period (i.e., the last diary day of the Final Visit was &lt; 53 days); the percentage of patients excluded for this reason for the PPS and PPS-I was 3.8% and 4.1% for the placebo group, 6.1% and 6.5% for the mirabegron 50 mg group, 4.2% and 4.3% for the mirabegron 100 mg group and 3.8% and 3.0% for the tolterodine SR 4 mg group

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characteristics were consistent across treatment groups for patients in the SAF population. Overall, 72.2% of patients were female. The majority (62.9%) of patients were &lt; 65 years of age and 91.3% were &lt; 75 years of age. Overall, 99.1% of patients were white. Mean body mass index across all treatment groups was 27.8 kg/m2. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups in the FAS and FAS-I. 72.0% and 83.4% of patients were female (FAS and FAS-I, respectively). In the FAS, mean age was 59.1 years and 37.1% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The overall mean duration of OAB symptoms was 79.3 and 88.0 months in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively. Overall, approximately one-half of patients had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy (49.6% and 56.5% in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively).

The percentage of patients in each analysis set is based on the Randomized Analysis Set.

The percentage of patients randomised who had reported at least one episode of incontinence in the baseline diary is approximately 60%, similar across the treatment groups.

## Outcomes and estimation

Primary endpoints

Change from Baseline to Final Visit in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately 60% of patients in the FAS in each treatment group had 1 or more episodes of incontinence during the 3-day diary period at baseline. Mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups demonstrated statistically significant greater reductions from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (difference from placebo: -0.41 and -0.29, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg). The reduction in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (difference from placebo: -0.10) as compared to placebo for the tolterodine SR 4 mg group was not statistically significant.

Allrandomized patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and who had a micturition measurement and at least 1 incontinence episode in the baseline diary and at least 1 postbaseline visit diary with a micturition measurement (Full Analysis Set Incontinence [FAS-I]).

↑The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model included treatment group, sex and geographical region as fixed factors andbaselineasacovariate.

Nominal P-values were from pairwise comparisons vs placebo within the stratified rank ANCOVA,a nonparametric analysis.

#Statistically significantly superior compared to placebo at the 0.05 level with multiplicity adjustment.

## Change from Baseline to Final Visit in Mean Number of Micturition per 24 hours

Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit in mean number of micturition per 24 hours compared to placebo with the multiplicity adjustment. The magnitude of reduction in the mirabegron 100 mg group was lower than that observed in the mirabegron 50 mg group. The adjusted mean difference versus placebo for the tolterodine SR 4 mg group (-0.25) was not statistically significant.

After 12 weeks of treatment patients receiving mirabegron experienced a statistically significant reduction in the number of micturitions and the incontinence episodes. This positive effect was also translated into the main secondary endpoints. In general, effect size is deemed as modest. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg do not separate from each other in terms of efficacy. Exploratory comparison between mirabegron and tolterodine showed numerical differences in favour of mirabegron.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional secondary endpoints

- Statistically significant greater reductions from baseline to week 4, week 8 and week 12 compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and mean number of micturition per 24 hours were observed for mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg. The tolterodine SR 4 mg group only demonstrated statistically significant greater reductions from baseline to week 4 compared to placebo for these parameters.
- Statistically significant greater reductions from baseline to week 4, week 8 and week 12 compared to placebo in the mean volume voided per micturition were observed for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg.
- The mirabegron 50 mg group demonstrated statistically significant greater improvements from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours (using the patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale) and mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours for mirabegron 50 mg.
- The tolterodine SR 4 mg group also demonstrated statistically significant greater improvements from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours.
- For the TS-VAS, the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg groups demonstrated statistically significant greater increases from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo.
- For the OAB-q:
- -The mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg groups demonstrated statistically significant greater improvements from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the Symptom Bother scale.
- -The mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups demonstrated statistically significant greater improvements from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the HRQL dimensions of Coping, Concern and in mean total HRQL score. The mirabegron 100 mg group also demonstrated statistically significant greater improvements from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the HRQL dimension of Sleep and Social Interaction.
- -The tolterodine SR 4 mg group did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo for any of these OAB-q parameters.

## Ancillary analyses

## Ancillary analyses

Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analyses.

- -Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours, FAS-I

In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo and 95% CIs for both mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups at week 12 were similar to those at the Final Visit in the primary analysis. Both mirabegron groups demonstrated statistically significantly superior mean reduction of incontinence episodes compared to the placebo group as early as week 4 and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, FAS

In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of micturition per 24 hours, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo and 95% CIs for both mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups at week 12 were similar to those at the Final Visit in the primary analysis. Both mirabegron groups demonstrated statistically significantly superior mean reduction of micturition compared to the placebo group as early as week 4 and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12). The P-values at week 12 from the repeated measurement analysis were P&lt; 0.001 for the mirabegron 50 mg and P=0.006 for the mirabegron 100 mg group. Tolterodine SR 4 mg demonstrated a statistically significantly superior mean reduction of micturition compared to placebo at the week 4 and week 8 time points.

- -Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hour, PPS-I

In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours from baseline to Final Visit was -0.40 in the mirabegron 50 mg group and -0.29 in the mirabegron 100 mg group. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours]. In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours from baseline to Final Visit was -0.17 in the tolterodine SR 4 mg group, this was not statistically significant.

- -Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, PPS

One of the inclusion criteria was a mean of ≥ 8 micturition per 24 hours at baseline. The sensitivity analyses in the PPS excluded patients who did not meet this criterion at baseline. In this sensitivity analysis, the adjusted mean differences versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours were -0.71 and -0.50 for the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours (see table below). The adjusted mean differences versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours were -0.40 for the tolterodine SR 4 mg group. This was statistically significant.

## Responder Analysis

Reduction in Incontinence Episodes

At the Final Visit, the percentage of responders was greater in the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg groups than in the placebo group. The difference versus placebo was 11.9%, 7.5% and 8.2% for the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg groups. The corresponding odds ratio for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg was 1.75, 1.45 and 1.44, respectively; statistical significance was achieved for all 3 active treatment groups

## Zero Incontinence Episodes

The percentage of responders for zero incontinence episodes was greater in the active treatment groups than in placebo and the difference versus placebo in all active treatment groups at the Final visit was 4.5%, 3.2% and 6.8% for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg.

## Study 178-CL-047

This was a randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, multinational, multicenter study conducted in patients with symptoms of OAB syndrome (urinary frequency and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

urgency with or without incontinence) of at least 3 months' duration. The study was conducted at 132 sites in the United States (115 sites) and Canada (17 sites).

## Methods

After screening (day -21 to day -14), patients were enrolled in a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period that ended at baseline (week 0). At baseline, patients meeting inclusion criteria and not meeting exclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg or a matching placebo qd for a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period that consisted of visits at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and a 30-day follow-up telephone contact or visit.

## Study Participants

As in study 178-CL-046

## Treatments

- Mirabegron tablets: 50 mg and 100 mg. One mirabegron tablet (and matching placebo for the other dose) was administered each morning (q.d) by mouth with a glass of water with or without food to patients randomized to receive mirabegron 50 or 100 mg. Lot numbers: K0700248 (50 mg tablet); L0700011 (100 mg tablet).
- Two placebo tablets to match mirabegron 50 mg or 100 mg were administered each morning (q.d) by mouth with a glass of water with or without food to patients randomized to placebo. Lot number: K0700232 (placebo to match mirabegron 50 mg tablet); K0700243 (placebo to match mirabegron 100 mg tablet)

## Objectives

- The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of mirabegron 50 mg q.d and mirabegron 100 mg qd against placebo in the treatment of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB).
- The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of mirabegron 50 mg q.d and mirabegron 100 mg qd against placebo in the treatment of patients with symptoms of OAB.

## Recruitment

First Subject Enrolled - Last Subject Last Visit: 28 March 2008 - 22 April 2009

## Conduct of the study

Five patients were identified as having been enrolled into the study twice. Enrolment occurred at 10 unique sites for these patients. One patient was a screen failure at 1 site and a run-in failure at a different site and the other 4 patients were randomized twice and received 2 double-blind study drug treatment assignments. These 4 patients were therefore analyzed as 8 unique patients for both efficacy and safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS and PPS-I comprised major protocol violations that affected the co-primary efficacy variables and the key secondary efficacy variable of volume voided per micturition. These included eligibility criteria that were not met, administration of incorrect study drug, poor study drug compliance (defined as &lt; 70% during the double-blind treatment period) and inadequate duration of treatment. For the placebo run-in period, inadequate duration of treatment was defined as placebo treatment &lt; 9 days during the placebo run-in period until the last diary day before randomization. For the double-blind treatment period, inadequate duration of treatment was defined as last diary day of the Final Visit 3-day micturition diary &lt; 53 days during the double-blind treatment period.

Approximately 12% of patients in the FAS and 11% of patients in the FAS-I were excluded from the PPS and PPS-I, respectively. In all treatment groups, the most frequently cited reason for exclusion reflected an inadequate duration of treatment during the double-blind treatment period (i.e., last diary day of the Final Visit was &lt; 53 days); the percentage of patients excluded for this reason for the PPS and PPS-I was 6.5% in the placebo group (for both the PPS and PPS-I), 6.4% and 7.7% in the mirabegron 50 mg group and 3.4% and 3.7% in the mirabegron 100 mg group.

## Baseline data

Generally, demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups. Overall, approximately 75% and 82% of patients were female in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively. In the FAS, the mean age was 60.2 years and 39.7% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The overall mean duration of OAB symptoms was approximately 90 months in the FAS and FAS-I. The majority of patients had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy (approximately 56% and 60% in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively). Approximately 65% of patients in both analysis sets who had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy cited insufficient effect as a reason for discontinuation, while poor tolerability was cited by approximately 22% of these patients.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Change from Baseline to Final Visit in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours

Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in reduction from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours compared to placebo with the multiplicity adjustment. The mirabegron 100 mg group achieved a numerically greater adjusted mean difference in reduction from baseline to Final Visit versus placebo than the mirabegron 50 mg group.

## Change from Baseline to Final Visit in Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours

Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in reduction from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours compared to placebo with the multiplicity adjustment. The mirabegron 100 mg group achieved a numerically greater adjusted mean difference in reduction from baseline to Final Visit versus placebo than the mirabegron 50 mg group.

## Additional secondary endpoints

The mirabegron 50 and 100 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean level of urgency, mean number of urgency incontinence episodes and mean number of episodes of urgency grade 3 or 4. For the subjective improvement assessments, mirabegron 50 and 100 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in TS-VAS, PPBC, mean number of pads used per 24 hours, the Symptom Bother Score and HRQL Total Score.

## Ancillary analyses

- -Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours, FAS-I

In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo and 95% CIs for both mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups at week 12 were similar to those at the Final Visit in the primary analysis. Both mirabegron groups demonstrated statistically significantly superior mean reduction of incontinence episodes compared to the placebo group as early as week 4 and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12).

- -Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, FAS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12 were Both mirabegron groups demonstrated statistically significantly superior mean reduction of micturition compared to the placebo group as early as week 4 and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12). The P-values at week 12 from the repeated measurement analysis were P = 0.001 for the mirabegron 50 mg group and P &lt; 0.001 for the mirabegron 100 mg group.

- -Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hour, PPS-I

In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours from baseline to the Final Visit was -0.33 in the mirabegron 50 mg group and -0.53 in the mirabegron 100 mg group. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.

- -Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, PPS

One of the inclusion criteria was a mean of ≥ 8 micturition per 24 hours at baseline. The sensitivity analyses in the PPS excluded patients who did not meet this criterion at baseline. In this sensitivity analysis, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours was 0.74 and -0.82 for the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours.

## Responder Analysis

Reduction in Incontinence Episodes

At the Final Visit, the percentage of responders was greater in the mirabegron 50 mg (66.7%) and 100 mg (73.3%) groups than in placebo (59.4%). The difference versus placebo was 7.3% for the mirabegron 50 mg group and 13.9% for the mirabegron 100 mg group. Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were demonstrated for the mirabegron 100 mg group.

## Zero Incontinence Episodes

At the Final Visit, the percentage of zero incontinence responders was greater in the mirabegron 50 mg (40.7%) and 100 mg (49.0%) groups than in placebo (33.8%). The difference versus placebo was 6.9% for the mirabegron 50 mg group and 15.1% for the mirabegron 100 mg group. Statistical significance was achieved for the mirabegron 100 mg group

- Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); events adjudicated by the independent cardiovascular  adjudication  committee;  TEAEs  of  interest  (i.e.,  hypertension,  corrected  QT interval  (QTc)  prolongation,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  urinary  retention/acute  urinary  retention, hypersensitivity  type  events,  syncope  type  events,  seizure  type  events,  hepatic  type  events and renal and urinary events); Clinical laboratory evaluations (i.e., haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis  and  thyroid  analytes);  Vital  signs  (sitting  SBP,  sitting  DBP  and  pulse  rate);  ECGs; Post-void residual volume (PVR) and physical examination

## Sample size

The sample size was determined as in study 178-CL-046

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

After screening (day -21 to day -14), patients were enrolled in a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period that ended at baseline (week 0). At baseline, patients meeting inclusion criteria and not meeting exclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive mirabegron 25 mg, mirabegron 50 mg or a matching placebo qd for a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period that consisted of visits at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and a 2 week follow-up telephone visit at the end of treatment.

## Blinding (masking)

During the placebo run-in period, patients were blinded to the identity of study drug. During the double-blind treatment and follow-up periods, the investigator, study site personnel, patients, sponsor and the sponsor's representatives were blinded to the identity of the randomized drug assignment.

## Statistical methods

The statistical methods used were essentially the same as used in Study 178-CL-046. However there were three additional key secondary efficacy endpoints: mean level of urgency, mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean number of urgency episodes [grade 3 or 4] per 24 hours. These were also included in Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047 but were considered additional secondary endpoints and were not included in the hierarchical testing procedure for multiple endpoints.

Urgency endpoints were based upon the 5-point Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS).

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 2201 patients were screened, 2060 patients entered the placebo run-in period, 2030 patients took placebo run-in study drug, 1306 patients were randomized into the study, and 1305 patients received study drug.

## Recruitment

First Subject Enrolled - Last Subject Last Visit: 28 April 2009 - 27 April 2010

## Conduct of the study

19 patients (7 patients, 4 patients and 8 patients in the placebo, mirabegron 25 mg and mirabegron 50 mg groups, respectively) were discontinued due to taking medication that was considered exclusionary by the medical monitor. This circumstance occurred due to a more comprehensive application of the exclusion criterion with respect to concomitant medications by an interim medical monitor in the US during the study. The criterion was applied too broadly and not as intended per the protocol. Consequently, a number of medications (including CYP2D6 substrates) were disallowed that should not have been disallowed, which led to discontinuation of these patients from the study. The decision was reversed for future patients; however, the patients that were withdrawn from the study for this reason were not allowed to re-enrol. Additionally, 5 randomized patients were discontinued from the study due to protocol violations related to restricted or prohibited medications.

Nine patients were identified as having either been enrolled twice in 178-CL-074 (1 patient) or enrolled in other mirabegron studies in addition to 178-CL-074 (8 patients). Enrolment in previous mirabegron studies was an exclusion criterion in the protocol. These subjects were excluded from the PPS and PPSI.

- Three of the 9 patients were screening or run-in failures in 178-CL-074 and were not randomized into the study.
- Two of the 9 patients received mirabegron in 178-CL-074 and had not received double-blind study medication during the previous enrolment (1 patient was previously a run-in failure at a different site in 178-CL-074 and the other patient was randomized in 178-CL-047 but never received study medication).
- Two patients received study medication in other mirabegron studies but had no overlap in double-blind treatment during 178-CL-074.
- One patient received study medication in 2 additional mirabegron studies (178-CL- 047 and 178-CL-049) and had an approximately 3-month overlap in double-blind treatment during 178CL-074.
- One patient received mirabegron in 178-CL-074 and received placebo treatment in study 178CL-008. The patient completed study 178-CL-008.

Reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS and PPS-I comprised major protocol violations that affected the co-primary efficacy variables and the key secondary efficacy variable of mean volume voided per micturition. These included eligibility criteria that were not met, administration of incorrect study drug, poor study drug compliance (defined as &lt; 70% during the double-blind treatment period), inadequate duration of treatment, unblinding of study drug, use of prohibited or restricted concomitant medication and participation in a previous mirabegron study. For the placebo run-in period, inadequate duration of treatment was defined as placebo treatment &lt; 9 days until the last diary day before randomization. For the double-blind treatment period, inadequate duration of treatment was defined as last diary day of the final visit 3-day micturition diary &lt; 53 days. Approximately 9% of patients in the FAS and 10% of patients in the FAS-I were excluded from the PPS and PPS-I, respectively.

## Baseline data

Generally, demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups in the FAS and FAS-I. Overall, approximately 69% and 80% of patients were female in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively. The higher proportion of female patients was the most apparent difference in demographics and baseline characteristics observed between the FAS and FAS-I populations. In the FAS, mean age was 59.1 years and 37.2% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The overall mean duration of OAB symptoms was approximately 94 months in the FAS and 100 months in the FAS-I. More than half of the patients had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy (approximately 51% and 58% in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively). Approximately 67% of patients in the FAS and 66% of patients in the FAS-I analysis sets who had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy cited insufficient effect as a reason for discontinuation, while approximately 26% of patients in the FAS and 28% of patients in the FAS-I cited poor tolerability.

The percentage for each category was calculated using the number of patients with nonmissing values for the denominator.

OAB: overactive bladder.

↑ Types of OAB were defined as follows: urgency incontinence = urge incontinence only, mixed = mixed incontinence.

- Patients could choose &gt; 1 reason for discontinuation of previous OAB dnug.

Baseline characteristics are reasonable similar across the treatment groups. Majority of the subjects included were female and less than 65 years of age. The proportion of males included in this study is less than included in studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047.

The percentage of patients in each analysis set is based on the Randomized Analysis Set.

The percentage of patients randomised who had reported at least one episode of incontinence in the baseline diary is approximately 60%, fairly similar in each of the treatment groups.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the co-primary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 25 and 50 mg groups demonstrated statistically significantly greater reductions from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean number of micturition per 24 hours.

All randomized patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and who had a micturition measurement in thebaseline diary and at least 1 postbaseline visit diarywith amicturition measurement (Ful1 Analysis Set [FAS]).

ANCOVA:analysis of covariance.

↑The ANCOVA model included treatment group, sex and geographical region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.

P-values were from pairwise comparison vs placebo within the ANCOVA model, a parametric analysis

(HochbergProcedure).

## Key Secondary endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the key secondary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 50 mg group in the FAS showed statistically significantly greater increases from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean volume voided per micturition; mirabegron 25 mg was not statistically significant compared with placebo. Since the mirabegron 25 mg group did not meet significance for mean volume voided with multiplicity adjustment, subsequent key secondary endpoints for the mirabegron 25 mg group were excluded from further hypothesis testing as part of the gate-keeping procedure. Subsequent key secondary endpoints for the mirabegron 50 mg group were evaluated at the 0.025 significance level.

The mirabegron 50 mg group had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline to week 4 (the first measured time point) compared with placebo in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours. The mirabegron 50 mg group did not have a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline to week 4 compared with placebo in mean number of micturition per 24 hours. For all other key secondary efficacy endpoints, statistical significance was not achieved for either mirabegron treatment group due to the gate-keeping procedure which precluded further statistical testing on subsequent endpoints in the hierarchy once a dose group failed to reach statistical significance for an efficacy variable.

## Additional secondary endpoints

For the subjective improvement assessments, mirabegron 25 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement in change from baseline to final visit in TS-VAS. Mirabegron 25 mg did not demonstrate statistically significant improvement in change from baseline to final visit in Symptom Bother Score, HRQL Total Score, PPBC, or mean number of pads used per 24 hours. Mirabegron 50 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement in change from baseline to final visit in TS-VAS and in Symptom Bother Score, but not in HRQL Total Score, PPBC, or mean number of pads used per 24 hours.

## Ancillary analyses

- -Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours, FAS-I

In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, the adjusted mean change from baseline to week 12 for the placebo group was greater than that at the final visit in the primary analysis. Therefore, although the adjusted mean change (and 95% CI) from baseline to week 12 for the mirabegron groups in the repeated measurement analysis were similar to those at final visit in the primary analysis, the adjusted mean differences versus placebo for both mirabegron groups (mirabegron 25 mg: -0.32 [0.169]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.37 [0.169]) were slightly smaller compared to the primary analysis (mirabegron 25 mg: -0.40 [0.174]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.42 [0.173]). In the repeated measurement analysis, the reduction in the mean number of incontinence episodes was statistically significantly greater in mirabegron 25 mg group compared to placebo at week 4 (P = 0.048) and week 8 (P = 0.014) and approached statistical significance at week 12 (P = 0.058). The mirabegron 50 mg group demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the mean number of incontinence episodes compared to placebo at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (P-values of 0.003, 0.016 and 0.030, respectively).

- -Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, FAS

In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of micturition per 24 hours, the adjusted mean change from baseline to week 12 for the placebo group was greater than that at the final visit in the primary analysis. Therefore, although the adjusted mean change (and 95% CI) from baseline to week 12 for the mirabegron groups in the repeated measurement analysis were similar to those at final visit in the primary analysis, the adjusted mean differences versus placebo for both mirabegron groups (mirabegron 25 mg: -0.35 [0.171]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.32 [0.171]) were slightly smaller compared to the primary analysis mirabegron 25 mg: -0.47 [0.176]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.42 [0.174]). In the repeated measurement analysis, the mirabegron 25 mg group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the mean number of micturition compared to the placebo group at weeks 8 and 12 (P-values of 0.004 and 0.042, respectively). The reduction in the mean number of micturition was statistically significantly greater in the mirabegron 50 mg group compared to placebo at week 4 (P = 0.032) and week 8 (P = 0.006) and approached statistical significance at week 12 (P = 0.063).

- -Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hour, PPS-I

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours from baseline to the final visit was -0.32 and -0.39 in the mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg groups, respectively. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to final visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.

- -Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, PPS

In this sensitivity analysis, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours was -0.34 and -0.31 for the mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg groups, respectively. Compared to placebo, the reduction from baseline to final visit in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours for both mirabegron groups approached statistical significance [Table 19].

- -Other Sensitivity Analyses

The results of all other sensitivity analyses were consistent with those presented for the primary analyses of the co-primary efficacy variables.

## Summary of main study(ies)

The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). Of note, only results on co-primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint of mean volume voided are presented. Relevant results of secondary parameters are included in other sections of the report.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Primary Studies 178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074 were pooled for analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Methods for multiplicity adjustment for the pooled analyses are based on those established in the SAPs for Studies 178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074.

A stepwise parallel gatekeeping procedure was performed to control the Type I error rate at the 0.05 significance level for the coprimary efficacy endpoints of 1) change from baseline to final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and 2) change from baseline to final visit in mean number micturitions of per 24 hours; and the key secondary efficacy endpoints of 3) change from baseline to final visit in mean volume voided per micturition, 4) change from baseline to week 4 in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, 5) change from baseline to week 4 in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours, 6) change from baseline to final visit in mean level of urgency, 7) change from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours and 8) change from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours.

Statistical testing was performed in 8 stages, evaluating the primary and key secondary endpoints in the order indicated above. In each stage the endpoint was evaluated and the difference between a mirabegron dose group and placebo must have been statistically significant before that mirabegron dose group proceeded to the next stage.

For the pooled primary studies and Studies 178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074 individually, a stepwise paralll gate keeping procedure was perfommed to control the Type I enror rate at adjust for multiplicity within each stage.Since the comparison between tolterodine and placebo was a secondary analysis in Study 178-CL-046, no adjustment for multiplicity was necessary. In the pooled primary studies, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo for change from baseline and corresponding 95% CI were generated from an ANCOVA model with treatment group. gender and study as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. In Studies 178-CL-046, 178-CL-047, and 178-CL-074, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo for change from baseline and colresponding 95% CI were generated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, gender and geographical region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. Differences of the adjusted means were calculated by subtracting the adjusted mean of placebo from that of treatment groups.

## · Incontinence

All mirabegron treatment groups in the 12-week phase 3 primary studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours at final visit compared with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. While no study required incontinence at baseline, inclusion in the FAS-I required at least one episode of incontinence in the 3-day baseline micturition diary (equating to a minimum of 0.33 episodes per 24 hours).

The mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours at baseline was comparable across all treatment groups in the pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were -1.10, -1.49 and -1.50 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, respectively [Figure 1]. The adjusted mean differences versus placebo were -0.40 (mirabegron 50 mg) and -0.41 (mirabegron 100 mg). Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline to final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours compared with placebo with multiplicity adjustment.

## · Subjective Improvement Assessments

## Overactive Bladder Symptoms, Quality of Life and Treatment Benefit

The Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q), the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) and the Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analog Scale (TS-VAS) were the subjective outcome measures included in this study to evaluate treatment effects as perceived by the patient.

- -The OAB-q is a self-report questionnaire with 33 items that contain the dimensions Coping, Concern, Sleep, Social Interaction and a Symptom Bother scale with 8 symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 100 indicating the worst severity. A negative change indicates improvement.
- -Health-Related Quality of Life Total Score and Subscales (Coping, Concern Sleep and Social Interaction). Higher scores on the HRQL subscales and total score indicated a better QoL, and a positive change in the HRQL subscale scores and total score indicated improvement.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool using a 6-point Likert scale that asks patients to rate their subjective impression of their current bladder condition.
- -The TS-VAS is a visual analog scale (VAS) that asks patients to rate their satisfaction with the treatment by placing a vertical mark on a line that runs from 0 (No, not at all) to 10 (Yes, completely). Positive change from baseline indicates improvement.

Mirabegron 50 mg demonstrated a statistically significant decrease (improvement) from baseline to final visit in the Symptom Bother Scale total score compared with placebo in the pooled data set [Table 1]. Further, mirabegron 50 mg demonstrated a statistically significant increase (improvement) from baseline to final visit in the HRQL total score and all its subscales including coping, concern and sleep compared with placebo except for the Social Interaction subscale.

When patients were evaluated based on achieving a response both for the objective endpoint of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in incontinence episodes per 24 hours and being a responder based on one of the 3 patient reported indices (symptom bother score, total HRQL score or PPBC value) evaluated based on MID, mirabegron 50 mg consistently demonstrated a statistically significant greater improvement over placebo for each of these double responder analyses performed [Table 9].

The difference from placebo in the responder rates for each of the double responder analyses was higher than the differences observed in the single responder analyses.

## Clinical studies in special populations

The applicant has not performed specific clinical studies in special populations. The consistency of treatment effects across subpopulations was evaluated using the pooled FAS and FAS-I of the three primary studies. Comparisons of subpopulations were made for the coprimary efficacy endpoints change from baseline to final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and change from baseline to final visit in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours.

Pooled analyses of the coprimary efficacy endpoints by subpopulations of demographic and baseline characteristics included gender, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) group and geographical region.

Female subjects showed greater improvements than male subjects in mean numbers of micturitions, and incontinence episodes. This could be due to a smaller effect in men (who according to pharmacokinetic parameters exhibited a lower exposure than women) or be a consequence of the smaller numbers.

Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years; ≥ 75 years) experienced a greater reduction of micturitions and in incontinence episodes patient reported response than younger subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Non-White subjects showed a lower reduction of incontinence episodes as well as of frequency. However the infra-representation of non-Caucasian subjects and the higher variability do not allow drawing conclusions in this regard.

A more marked placebo effect for the different endpoints is observed among naïve patients, which may be responsible of the observed differences in response.

## Phase 2a Proof-of-Concept Study 178-CL-008

The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of mirabegron in patients with OAB in comparison with placebo. The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mirabegron in patients with OAB in comparison with placebo, to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of mirabegron with tolterodine, and to collect population pharmacokinetics data in patients with OAB. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in mean number of micturition per 24 hours.

## Method

After screening (day -21 to day -14), patients were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week placebo run-in period that ended at baseline (week 0). Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting exclusion criteria were randomized to receive mirabegron IR 100 or 150 mg twice daily, placebo, or tolterodine for 4 weeks. Subsequently, patients were followed for an additional 2 weeks with singleblind placebo treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results:

The mirabegron IR 100 and 150 mg twice daily groups showed statistically significant reductions in mean number of micturition per 24 hours compared with placebo. For the tolterodine group, the estimated adjusted mean difference vs placebo was -0.40 (P = 0.2332). Repeated measures analysis also showed statistically significant reduction in mean number of micturition per 24 hours in the mirabegron IR 100 and 150 mg twice daily groups compared with placebo, whereas the difference was not statistically significant for tolterodine.

## Study 178-CL-048

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of mirabegron 50 mg versus placebo in the treatment of patients with symptoms of OAB based on mean number of micturition per 24 hours and to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of mirabegron 50 mg. The study was also conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of mirabegron with tolterodine ER 4 mg without any formal testing for noninferiority or superiority of mirabegron. This study was conducted in Japan.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to final assessment in mean number of micturition per 24 hours.

## Results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mirabegron 50 mg group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean number of micturition per 24 hours in the FAS (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.86 [95% CI: -1.16, 0.57]). The adjusted mean difference between tolterodine and placebo was -0.61 [95% CI: -0.90, 0.32]).

For the secondary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 50 mg group showed statistically significant improvements in mean number of urgency episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.54 [95% CI: -0.90, -0.18] in the FAS), mean number of incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.42 [95% CI: -0.67, -0.17] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), mean number of urge incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.36 [95% CI: -0.59, 0.12] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), and mean volume voided per micturition (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: 14.775 mL [95% CI: 9.974, 19.576] in the FAS). For mean number of nocturia episodes, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo for mirabegron 50 mg was 0.12 (95% CI: -0.25, 0.01). The tolterodine group showed statistically significant improvements in mean number of urgency episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.41 [95% CI: -0.77, -0.05] in the FAS), mean number of incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.32 [95% CI: -0.57, -0.06] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), mean number of urge incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.32 [95% CI: -0.56, -0.08] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), and mean volume voided per micturition (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: 19.049 mL [95% CI: 14.246, 23.852] in the FAS). For mean number of nocturia episodes, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo for tolterodine was -0.10 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.03). In Study 178-CL-048, QOL scores were obtained from the King's Health Questionnaire, which patients completed covering the 2 weeks prior to each study visit. Compared with placebo, the mirabegron 50 mg group showed a statistically significant improvement in 7 of 9 QOL domain scores: domain 2 (incontinence impact [P &lt; 0.001]), domain 3 (role limitations [P &lt; 0.001]), domain 4 (physical limitations [P = 0.004]), domain 5 (social limitations [P = 0.005]), domain 7 (emotions [P = 0.009]), domain 8 (sleep/energy [P = 0.016]) and domain 9 (severity measures [P &lt; 0.001]).

## Study 178-CL-049

The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg in patients with symptoms of OAB. The secondary objectives of the study were to assess the efficacy of long-term treatment with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg in patients with symptoms of OAB and to place the long-term safety and efficacy of mirabegron in context with a standard treatment for OAB, tolterodine.

## Endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE). Efficacy analyses were secondary in this study. The efficacy endpoints assessed were change from baseline to months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and final visit in the following: mean number of micturition per 24 hours, mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean volume voided per micturition, mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours, mean level of urgency, mean number of pads used per 24 hours, and mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours.

## Results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg demonstrated numeric reductions from baseline to Final Visit in mean number of micturition per 24 hours (adjusted mean change from baseline: -1.27 and -1.41, respectively) and mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (adjusted mean change from baseline: -1.01 and -1.24, respectively) as well as numeric improvements in mean volume voided per micturition (adjusted mean change from baseline: 17.5 mL and 21.5 mL, respectively). the mean change from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) was -1.62, 1.80 for the mirabegron 50 mg, 100 mg. Numerical improvements in mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours were seen by month 1 and were maintained for the duration of the study. The mean change from baseline to final visit in the FAS was -1.01, -1.23 for the mirabegron 50 mg, and 100 mg. Numerical improvements in mean number of pads used per 24 hours in the FAS were seen by month 1 continued until month 9 and were maintained for the duration of the study. Numerical improvements in mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours from baseline to final visit were observed for mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg, (-0.46, and -0.39 episodes respectively. Numerical improvements were seen from baseline to final visit for the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron100 mg, and tolterodine groups in the TS-VAS, OAB-q scores, and the PPBC scale. Improvements in these symptoms were observed by month 1, with continued improvement until at least month 3 and maintenance of the effect through month 12. Both doses of mirabegron also showed numeric improvements on the additional secondary efficacy variables. Numerically similar results and a similar course of improvement over time were observed with tolterodine ER 4 mg.

## Study 178-CL-051

The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of long-term administration (52 weeks) of mirabegron at a dose of 50 mg in patients with OAB, with the possibility of dose escalation to 100 mg. Efficacy analyses were secondary in this study.

The efficacy endpoints assessed were change from baseline to weeks 4, 8, 16, 28, 40 and 52 and final visit in the following: mean number of micturition per 24 hours, mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours, mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours, and QOL domain scores on the King's Health Questionnaire.

## Results (efficacy)

At the final assessment, all patients demonstrated a reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes (-1.38), mean number of micturition (-2.01), mean number of urgency episodes (-3.16), mean number of urge incontinence episodes (-1.33) and the mean number of nocturia episodes (0.48). In the mirabegron 50 mg group, the reduction from baseline in all efficacy endpoints was maintained from the first assessment time point (week 8) to the final assessment (week 52). In the patients who received the increased dose of mirabegron 100 mg, the magnitude of improvements from baseline in all efficacy endpoints at week 8 was less than patients who remained on mirabegron 50 mg, but the improvements increased, and were comparable to those patients receiving mirabegron 50 mg from week 16 to final assessment. At final assessment, the respective changes from baseline in all efficacy endpoints assessed in the mirabegron 50 mg group and the group of patients who received the increased dose of mirabegron 100 mg were comparable and as follows: mean number of incontinence episodes (-1.30 and -1.56, respectively), mean number of micturition (-2.16 and -1.57, respectively), mean number of urgency episodes (-3.31 and -2.72, respectively), mean number of urge incontinence episodes (-1.32 and -1.33, respectively) and the mean number of nocturia episodes (-0.49 and -0.47, respectively). Normalization was defined as less than 8 micturition per day on average at the final assessment and resolution (0 episodes) of urge incontinence and nocturia at the final assessment. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

percentages of all mirabegron-treated patients that achieved normalization in mean number of incontinence episodes, micturitions, urgency episodes and nocturia episodes were 63.1%, 28.6%, 36.2% and 23.0% respectively. Improvements in QOL scores in all domains were observed from baseline to final assessment for all patients.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Three pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group 12-week studies support the use of mirabegron 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in the treatment of OAB (Studies CL-046, CL-047 and CL-074). Data from these three studies was integrated for pooled-analyses.

The study design including the objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and efficacy endpoints of the pivotal studies are acceptable and, in general in agreement with the CHMP Guideline (Note for Guidance on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of urinary incontinence, CPMP/EWP/18/01).

The population of subjects participating in this trial seems adequate and representative for patients with OAB. These studies enrolled male or female subjects (18 to 95 years of age inclusive) with symptoms or signs of overactive bladder with increased urinary frequency, urgency with or without incontinence. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable across the 3 treatment groups. Most of the subjects randomised were females (72-83%) and White (&gt;90%). Median ages overall ranged from 59 to 61 years. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar among treatment groups within each of these trials. Patients of moderate severity were preferably recruited. Subjects had a mean of 11 to 12 micturitions per 24 hours, 2 to 3 incontinence episodes (if they were incontinent) and experienced urgency of moderate to severe intensity. Between 49% and 60% of patients reported previous antimuscarinic treatment.

Patients were treated for 12 weeks. In addition to placebo control, one of the pivotal trials also included tolterodine as active control arm.

Efficacy was primarily based on the reduction in the urinary frequency (number of micturitions) and the number of incontinence episodes. Given that incontinence was not an inclusion criterion of the pivotal trials only a subgroup of the population fulfils the 'co-primary' condition. This is considered to be a deficiency in the design of the pivotal studies as when the analysis of the incontinence endpoints based upon the full ITT population (FAS) was performed the overall treatment effect was reduced.

Further the results for responder analyses (responders for zero incontinence episodes at final visit and responders for ≥ 50% reduction in incontinence episodes at final visit) in the individual studies did not always reach statistical significance. However, it is acknowledged by the CHMP that this may be due to inadequate statistical power as the studies were not planned to include sufficient patients for an analysis of responders. It is acknowledged by the CHMP that pooled results of responder analyses of studies 046, 047 and 048 showed statistical significance compared to placebo.

The perception of the patients was not part of the primary assessment of the efficacy of the product. These measures are meant to provide reassurance to the clinical relevance of the changes experienced by the quantitative outcomes. This is especially significant in such a non-life threatening condition in which the improvement of the impact of the disease on patient's daily lives should be among the main therapeutic objectives. The CHMP is of the view that the consideration of these outcomes as primary endpoint instead of 'additional secondary' outcomes would have been more appropriate.

The tools used for assessment were validated in the target population. Also, a clinically relevant change in pre-specified domains was defined.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

All studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the principal variables (number of micturitions in 24 hours, number of incontinence episodes in 24 hours). Most symptoms related to secondary variables also showed a statistically significant difference from baseline after 12 weeks treatment.

- -Regarding the number of micturitions the changes from baseline to final visit were -1.20 and -1.75 for the placebo and mirabegron 50 mg groups, respectively. The effect on urinary frequency shows a modest net benefit for mirabegron of 0.55 over pacebo.
- -The effect of mirabegron on incontinence was assessed in a subset (about 70%) of the recruited population. The net benefit was a reduction of 0.4 incontinence episodes more than placebo. When the effect is expressed in a more meaningful way (as responder analyses) mirabegron achieves equal or less than 10% responders than placebo.

No clear dose-dependent effect has been observed. The Dose of 100 mg did not globally work better than 50 mg. The 25 mg dose exhibited a lower effect (mostly in secondary measures) than 50 mg. When subgroup populations were compared female and elderly patients showed somewhat greater improvements. Urgency and nocturia albeit reaching statistical significance appear to be less sensitive to the action of mirabegron.

Indirect comparison of the effect observed with mirabegron 50 mg on the co-primary endpoint (incontinence and micturitions) and the ones seen for fesoterodine, solifenacin, trospium chloride, darifenacine and tolterodine from publicly available sources show that the effect of mirabegron is within the range of the means values for the other products.

In addition, a comparability exercise for the improvement in incontinence episodes between antimuscarinics and mirabegron was taken into account. Data for antimuscarinics where taken from a study recently published (Shamliyan et al, 20125) where the relative risk for the endpoint of

continence (zero incontinence) and clinically important improvement in incontinence (&gt;50% reduction in incontinence) have been calculated.

Results, again, show comparable data for the relative risk, and a slightly lower effect of mirabegron for the absolute risk difference. Limitations of such indirect comparison are acknowledged however this results suggest comparable efficacy as for other approved drugs for OAB.

In this respect, also comparative effects of mirabegron with tolterodine as shown in the development program reveals an effect of similar magnitude both in short and long term treatment.

Three main measures were used to capture the subjective perception of patients with respect to the benefit of the treatment with mirabegron and the potential improvement of the condition. These instruments were based on a Visual Analogue Scale (TS-VAS), a Likert scale (PPBC) and a questionnaire about relevant aspects of the disease in the quality of life (OAB-q): bother, coping, concern, sleep and social interaction. The minimally important difference (MID) for OAB-q is considered to be 10 points; for PPBC it is considered to be one and for TS-VAS a threshold of 1cm as the smallest integer value is utilised for assessing clinical impact.

At baseline patients scored their satisfaction level (TS-VAS) from 5 to 6. After 12 weeks they improved - 1.25 with placebo and -2.0 with mirabegron 50 mg (mean differences 0.76).

With respect to the perception of the disease (PPBC) the patients initially considered that their condition represented minor to moderate problems (baseline values 3.8). The treatment with mirabegron meant an improvement of -0.2 compared to placebo.

With respect to the impact on the quality of life (OAB-q) the greatest effect was seen in the 'bother' domain. However, in principle the changes from baseline with respect to placebo for the dosage finally

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chosen do not reach the minimal 10-point difference on any OAB-q subscale to be considered clinically meaningful.

With respect to the fact that the modest effect is not translated into a clear perception of improvement by the patients, the CHMP acknowledges that the instruments developed to study Patient related outcomes measure different components and different domains, that some of them are specific while others are overarching in their evaluation and related to a more broad assessment. Taking these observations in mind at least a consistent trend in the majority of the domains would be necessary to conclude on an effect of mirabegron treatment on patient's perception. For mirabegron indeed a trend is seen for most of the domains in all studies. The size effect seems not to be impressive (around 8% versus placebo when the responder rate is considered) but these findings are in line with the modest effect seen on clinical endpoints.

Some reassurance can also be obtained from the analyses of responders conducted where, with different definitions of responders, the responder rate is statistically significantly better (and in a consistent way) for mirabegron than for placebo. This is of greater clinical relevance when more stringent definitions of responder based on predefined minimal important differences are used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long-term efficacy data of mirabegron are based on a primarily aimed safety study. Efficacy outcomes have been measured as secondary endpoints and the main evidence comes from the non-formal comparison between mirabegron (50 mg and 100 mg) and tolterodine. Although the results obtained at 12 months do not suggest a loss of efficacy, the lack of a placebo control arm and the absence of a pre-determined statistical comparison hamper reaching sound conclusions regarding the maintenance of the effect of mirabegron. However in the comparative review from publicly available sources mirabegron does not show a distinct behaviour from other medicinal products approved for that condition (i.e. antimuscarinic drugs). In this respect, comparative effects of mirabegron with tolterodine help to put in context the results as the comparison reveals an effect of similar magnitude both in short and long (52 weeks) term treatment.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

As a summary, a consistent effect is observed in favour to mirabegron for both the co-primary and the secondary endpoints that in most cases is statistically significant. The comparison with tolterodine reveals an effect of similar magnitude. In addition, the effect size on incontinence episodes and number of micturitions per day observed in indirect comparisons with antimuscarinics helps put into context the clinical benefit of mirabegron. Therefore, the magnitude of the effect of mirabegron, although modest, can be considered enough to conclude on the clinically meaningful effect of this medicinal product in the treatment of OAB.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The clinical development program for mirabegron consisted of studies in 10,552 healthy volunteers, patients with OAB, male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms/bladder outlet obstruction (LUTS/BOO) or patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 29 phase 1 studies and 12 phase 2/3 studies (9 in patients with OAB, one in patients with LUTS/BOO and 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus) have been conducted globally in Europe, United States (US), Canada, Japan, Australia/New Zealand and South Africa. The entire clinical development program is comprised of 1800 volunteers and 8752 patients (8433 patients with OAB) in support of this application. The safety of mirabegron has been investigated in 1462 volunteers in phase 1 studies and 5863 patients (5648 patients with OAB) in the phase 2/3 studies. A total of 622 of the 5648 patients with OAB received mirabegron for at least 1 year. The immediate release (IR) formulation was used for the earlier phase 1 and proof of concept (POC) studies conducted in the clinical development program; all subsequent studies used the oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) formulation.

The Safety Analysis Set consists of all patients who took at least one dose of study drug. Overall, 5863 patients received at least one dose of mirabegron in the phase 2/3 clinical program. This total represents the number of unique patients in the Global Phase 2/3 Population who received mirabegron and includes the following:

4414 patients from the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population (including the subset of 2736 patients from the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population);

345 patients from other phase 2 studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus, OAB and LUTS/BOO;

901 patients from the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population who received mirabegron for the first time in Study 178-CL-049; and 203 patients from the Japan Long-term Uncontrolled Population.

Overall, 5016/5863 (85.6%) patients completed treatment with mirabegron and 847/5863 (14.4%) patients discontinued mirabegron.

The EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population comprises patients that were enrolled in Study 178-CL049, a 12-month, double-blind phase 3 study with an active-controlled tolterodine comparator arm. Patients who completed Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047 were allowed to participate in this study after a 30-day washout period; patients naive to the mirabegron program were also allowed to participate. In this study, 812 patients treated with mirabegron 50 mg, 820 patients treated with mirabegron 100 mg and 812 patients treated with tolterodine were randomized into the study and took double-blind study drug.

A total of 629/812 (77.5%) mirabegron 50 mg, 645/820 (78.7%) mirabegron 100 mg and 621/812 (76.5%) tolterodine patients completed double-blind treatment period while 183/812 (22.5%) mirabegron 50 mg, 175/820 (21.3%) mirabegron 100 mg and 191/812 (23.5%) tolterodine patients discontinued from the study.

## Adverse events

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, the most frequently reported TEAE (by PT) reported in the total mirabegron group were nasopharyngitis (mirabegron: 296/4414 [6.7%]; placebo: 141/2142 [6.6%]; tolterodine: 57/958 [5.9%]), hypertension (mirabegron: 221/4414 [5.0%]; placebo: 107/2142 [5.0%]; tolterodine: 43/958 [4.5%]) and blood glucose increased (mirabegron: 207/4414 [4.7%]; placebo: 115/2142 [5.4%]; tolterodine: 73/958 [7.6%]). One or more drug-related TEAE was reported by 906/4414 (20.5%) mirabegron, 389/2142 (18.2%) placebo and 275/958 (28.7%) tolterodine patients, with similar reporting in each of the mirabegron dose groups. The most frequently reported drug-related TEAE (by PT) in the total mirabegron group were hypertension (mirabegron: 142/4414 [3.2%]; placebo: 63/2142 [2.9%]; tolterodine: 33/958 [3.4%]), dry mouth (mirabegron: 73/4414 [1.7%]; placebo: 37/2142 [1.7%]; tolterodine:100/958 [10.4%]) and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

constipation (mirabegron: 68/4414 [1.5%]; placebo: 32/2142 [1.5%]; tolterodine: 21/958 [2.2%]). In the total mirabegron group, the maximum TEAE severity was mild for 36.9%, moderate for 18.0% and severe for 4.3% of patients. The most frequently reported severe TEAE were headache (13/5863 [0.2%]), nasopharyngitis (10/5863 [0.2%]) and supraventricular extrasystoles (10/5863 [0.2%]). TEAE with missing severity (not provided by the study site) were included in the severe category. A total of 38/5863 (0.6%) mirabegron patients reported at least one TEAE with missing severity that were counted as severe. TEAE with missing severity were primarily AE associated with clinically significant changes in ECGs (for which severity was not assessed in Japan studies) or AE associated with clinical laboratory findings.

For placebo, the maximum TEAE severity was mild for 38.3%, moderate for 13.8% and severe for 3.1% of patients; for tolterodine the maximum TEAE severity was mild for 44.7%, moderate for 12.2% and severe for 3.3% of patients. The proportion of patients reporting at least one severe TEAE was similar across dose groups.

## Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome

## Cardiovascular System

## Hypertension

In the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population, TEAE related to hypertension were similar for the total mirabegron (230/2736 [8.4%]), placebo (117/1380 [8.5%]) and tolterodine (48/495 [9.7%]) groups. The frequency of hypertension TEAE was comparable for mirabegron doses of 50 mg (120/1375 [8.7%]) or 100 mg (58/929 [6.2%]) and was highest in mirabegron 25 mg (52/432 [12.0%]). In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the occurrence of hypertension TEAE was comparable between mirabegron 50 and 100 mg (89/812 [11.0%] and 83/820 [10.1%]) and tolterodine (86/812 [10.6%]).

## QT prolongation or its sequelae

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, QTc prolongation-related TEAE were reported in 4/4414 (0.1%) total mirabegron patients, 2/2142 (0.1%) placebo patients and 2/958 (0.2%) tolterodine patients. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, QTc prolongation-related TEAE were reported in 3/812 (0.4%) mirabegron 50 mg patients, 2/820 (0.2%) mirabegron 100 mg patients and 3/812 (0.4%) tolterodine patients. TEAE in the torsades de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ was reported as SAE for 1/812 (0.1%) patient in the mirabegron 50 mg group (cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia; these concurrent CV events were adjudicated by the Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee for Clinical Trials with Mirabegron as a nonfatal myocardial infarction) and 1/812 (0.1%) patient in the tolterodine group (cardiac arrest, adjudicated by the Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee for Clinical Trials with Mirabegron to ventricular fibrillation).

## Cardiac Arrhythmia, Including Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, TEAE related to rapid pulse rate (cardiac arrhythmia, mostly tachycardia) were more frequently observed in all active treatments (2.4 to 6.6%) than placebo (1.8%). The frequency of TEAE in cardiac arrhythmia was comparable for all mirabegron doses of 100 mg or less (2.4 to 3.1%) and tolterodine (3.1%) and was highest in mirabegron 200 mg (6.6%). In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the occurrence of TEAE in the cardiac arrhythmia SMQ was comparable between mirabegron 50 and 100 mg (3.9 and 4.1%, respectively) and was less than tolterodine (6.0%). The overall occurrence of tachycardia events either based on TEAE or observations

of pulse rate ≥ 100 bpm captured by patient diary, was 28/812 (3.4%) mirabegron 50 mg, 50/820 (6.1%) mirabegron 100 mg and 55/812 (6.8%) tolterodine patients.

## Cardiac Failure

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, TEAE of CHF based on the SMQ of cardiac failure occurred in 14/2142 (0.7%), 4/811 (0.5%), 14/2131 (0.7%), 15/1305 (1.1%), and 5/958 (0.5%) patients in the placebo, mirabegron 25, mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine treatment groups, respectively; no events were observed for mirabegron 200 mg. The majority of cardiac failure TEAE were from the higher level term (HLT) of oedema not elsewhere classified (NEC) (29/33 patients in the total mirabegron group). In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, TEAE of CHF based on the SMQ of cardiac failure occurred in 10/812 (1.2%), 6/820 (0.7%) and 9/812 (1.1%) patients for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine, respectively. The majority of cardiac failure TEAE were from the HLT of oedema NEC (12/16 patients in the total mirabegron group).

## Syncope, Postural Hypotension and falls

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, one or more syncope, postural hypotension and falls events were reported by 90/4414 (2.0%) mirabegron, 35/2142 (1.6%) placebo and 14/958 (1.5%) tolterodine patients, with no apparent mirabegron dose response. The majority of events were under the category of falls; one or more syncope or postural hypotension events was reported by ≤ 0.1% of patients for both total mirabegron and placebo; there were no events reported with tolterodine. One or more events of falls was reported by 86/4414 (1.9%) mirabegron, 32/2142 (1.5%) placebo and 14/958 (1.5%) tolterodine patients, with no apparent mirabegron dose response. The most common TEAE (by PT) in the total mirabegron group under the category of falls was contusion (mirabegron: 13/4414 [0.3%]); placebo: 8/2142 [0.4%]; tolterodine: 4/958

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious adverse events

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, one or more SAE was reported for 77/4414 (1.7%) mirabegron, 38/2142 (1.8%) placebo and 16/958 (1.7%) tolterodine patients, with no apparent mirabegron dose response. The most common SAE in the total mirabegron group were atrial fibrillation (mirabegron: 5/4414 [0.1%]; placebo: 1/2142 [&lt; 0.1%]; tolterodine: 0/958), chest pain (mirabegron: 4/4414 [0.1%]; placebo: 2/2142 [0.1%]; tolterodine: 0/958) and pneumonia (mirabegron: 4/4414 [0.1%]; placebo: 1/2142 [&lt; 0.1%]; tolterodine: 0/958). One or more drug-related SAE was reported by 17/4414 (0.4%) mirabegron, 8/2142 (0.4%) placebo and 7/958 (0.7%) tolterodine patients, with no apparent mirabegron dose response. The most common drug-related SAE in the total mirabegron group was atrial fibrillation (mirabegron: 3/4414 [0.1%]); there were no SAE of atrial fibrillation for placebo or tolterodine patients In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, one or more SAE was reported by 93/1632 (5.7%) mirabegron patients (mirabegron 50 mg: 42/812 [5.2%]; mirabegron 100 mg: 51/820 [6.2%]) and 44/812 (5.4%) tolterodine patients. The most common SAE in the total mirabegron group were osteoarthritis (mirabegron: 3/1632 [0.2%]; tolterodine: 1/812 [0.1%]) and cerebrovascular accident (mirabegron: 3/1632 [0.2%]; tolterodine: 1/812 [0.1%]). A total of 11/820 (1.3%) patients in the mirabegron 100 mg group had one or more SAE in the neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) SOC; 1/812 (0.1%) in the mirabegron 50 mg group and 4/812 (0.5%) in the tolterodine group had SAE in that SOC.

## Deaths

There were 11 deaths in the mirabegron program, including 2 deaths in the ongoing 178-CL-090 study (one death on blinded treatment and one death that occurred prior to randomization). Nine deaths occurred in patients participating in completed trials (5 patients treated with mirabegron, one treated with placebo and 3 treated with tolterodine). All deaths were adjudicated for potential inclusion as a cardiovascular death by the Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee. The following is a brief listing of all 11 deaths presented by assigned dose group.

Overall, mortality per 1000 patients years of mirabegron exposure was comparable to placebo and tolterodine, except the mirabegron/tolterodine group in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population was higher than mirabegron alone (6.4 vs 2.5, mortality per 1000 patient-years of exposure). Of the 5 deaths that occurred in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, 3 patients received mirabegron and 2 patients received tolterodine at the time of death. The 2 patients who received tolterodine had prior exposure to mirabegron in a previous study.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

Across populations, there were 3/5863 (0.1%) mirabegron patients with a SAE from the SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders.

Safety analyses showed a reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils, and a positive correlation with mirabegron dose was observed.

In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the frequency of patients with clinical threshold of grade 2 lymphocytes was higher for the mirabegron 100 mg group (25/800 [3.1%]) compared with the mirabegron 50 mg group (14/792 [1.8%]) and the tolterodine group (11/790 [1.4%]), summarized in the table below [Module 5.3.5.3 ISS, End-of-Text Table 7.7.2].

Study included: 178-CL-049

Patients with at least 1 post-baseline measurement within 10 days of the last dose of study drug are included. ER: extended release; EU/NA: Europe, North America and Australia (for Study 178-CL-049, also includes New Zealand and South Africa)

Changes in haematological counts in the Phase 2/3 OAB population view were modest and transient and even being more apparent with 100 mg dose, these changes were quantitatively limited. Admittedly, the fact that a group of patients receiving 100 mg (two times the proposed dose) achieved the clinical threshold of grade 2 lymphocytes still represents an object of concern. The Applicant has attributed this fact to presence of decreased (or borderline) values at baseline for a number of patients. This justification dose not rule out a real relationship, mainly when this feature is also detected in the long term safety population.

In summary, whereas data for mirabegron 50 mg do not suggest being object of concern for lymphocytes a potential effect (at least with higher doses) cannot be considered totally discarded.

## Chemistry

## Liver

Overall,  1/5860  (&lt;  0.1%)  one  mirabegron  patient  experienced  a  PCS  hepatic  chemistry  laboratory abnormality of ALT and/or AST &gt; 3 x ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN and ALP &lt; 2 x ULN on the same date; the results are the same when values within 3 days are considered. Two patients were identified as having 3 fold or more transaminase elevation combined with 2 fold or more bilirubin elevation. One patient  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population  had  3  fold  or  more  transaminase  elevation combined with 2 fold or more bilirubin elevation Study 178-CL-049].

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, one or more hepatotoxicity TEAE was reported by 242/4414 (5.5%) mirabegron, 121/2142 (5.6%) placebo and 78/958 (8.1%) tolterodine patients. A total  of  3  patients  (one  each  in  the  mirabegron  25  mg,  mirabegron  50  mg and  tolterodine  groups)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experienced hepatotoxicity SAE. The mirabegron 25 mg patient experienced an SAE of liver function test abnormal, the mirabegron 50 mg patient experienced an SAE of hepatic enzyme increased and the tolterodine  patient  experienced  an  SAE  of  hepatitis.  In  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population, hepatotoxicity was reported as a TEAE for 36/1632 (2.2%) mirabegron patients (tolterodine: 15/812 [1.8%]), from laboratory data for 37/1632 (2.3%) mirabegron patients (tolterodine: 14/812 [1.7%]) and both as a TEAE and from laboratory data for 19/1632 (1.2%) mirabegron patients (tolterodine: 7/812 [0.9%]).

## Renal

A total of 3 mirabegron 25 mg patients and one mirabegron 200 mg patient had a potentially clinically significant  increase  in  serum  creatinine  (&gt;  177  mcmol/L)  on  at  least  one  measurement.  For  all  3 patients, the potentially clinically significant value for creatinine occurred on a single occasion. These patients had serum creatinine levels above the ULN at baseline and throughout the study. None of the 3 patients experienced a TEAE related to abnormal renal function. For BUN, the frequency of patients with  potentially  clinically  significant  increase  in  BUN  (&gt;  12.5  mmol/L)  was  comparable  across treatment groups

## Glucose and HbA1c (Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders)

Endocrine  and  metabolic  disorders  were  assessed  separately  as  AE  of  interest  in  the  mirabegron development  program  primarily  because  of  the  theoretical  potential  for  beta  3-AR  to  influence metabolic  function,  inclusive  of  glucose  regulation.  The  early  clinical  development  of  mirabegron included 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week phase 2a POC studies evaluating mirabegron in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Study 178-CL-003 examined the effect of placebo and mirabegron administered in addition to diet and exercise for 12 weeks in the treatment of 59 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mirabegron was administered as an IR formulation given once daily in the morning with 3 escalating dose levels (60 mg, 130 mg and 200 mg). The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in HbA1c. Fasting blood glucose values were measured throughout the study and showed no difference between the change from baseline to final visit in the mirabegron (0.34 mmol/L) and placebo (0.32 mmol/L) treatment groups. There were no reports of hypoglycaemia in this study.

Study  178-CL-004  examined  the  effect  of  placebo  and  mirabegron  administered  in  addition  to metformin,  diet  and  exercise  for  12  weeks  in  the  treatment  of  60  patients  with  type  2  diabetes mellitus.  Mirabegron  was  administered  as  an  IR  formulation  given  once  daily  in  the  AM  with  3 escalating  dose  levels  (60  mg,  130  mg  and  200  mg).  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  the change from baseline in HbA1c. Fasting blood glucose values were measured throughout the study and showed no difference between the change from baseline to final visit in the mirabegron + metformin (0.88 mmol/L) and placebo + metformin (0.87 mmol/L) treatment groups. There were no observations of hypoglycaemic events in this study.

The  frequency  of  hypoglycaemia  and  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  and  laboratory  measurements  of  blood glucose  and  HbA1c  in  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population  and  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term Controlled  Population  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3 Population,  the  frequency  of  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  by  31/4414  (0.7%)  mirabegron,  19/2142 (0.9%)  placebo  and  10/958  (1.0%)  tolterodine  patients.  No  patients  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term Controlled  Population  reported  a  hypoglycaemia  TEAE.  In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3 Population,  one  or  more  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  was  reported  by  249/4414  (5.6%)  mirabegron, 134/2142 (6.3%) placebo and 85/958 (8.9%) tolterodine patients. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, one or more hyperglycaemia TEAE was reported by 30/1632 (1.8%) mirabegron patients (mirabegron  50  mg:  16/812  [2.0%];  mirabegron  100  mg:  14/820  [1.7%])  and  13/812  (1.6%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tolterodine patients. No patient reported a hypoglycaemia SAE, hyperglycaemia SAE or hypoglycaemia TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3 Population,  one  patient  in  the  mirabegron  25  mg  group  reported  a  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  (blood glucose increased) that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug.

## Thyroid function

Two thyroid function-related serious adverse events were reported in the mirabegron clinical program (one with mirabegron 100 mg and one with tolterodine).

## Vital signs

Pulse rate

- Mirabegron administered at the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg once daily in the 12-week studies  was  associated  with  an  approximately  1  bpm  increased  adjusted  mean  change  from baseline pulse rate compared with placebo. The adjusted mean difference vs placebo for change from baseline pulse rate in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population receiving mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was 0.9, 1.0, 1.9 and 1.0 bpm for AM measurements and 0.6, 1.0, 2.3 and 2.1 bpm for PM measurements.
- In  the  EU/NA  OAB  Phase  3  Population,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  pulse  rate following mirabegron at doses of 50 to 100 mg once daily was similar to or less than the adjusted mean change from baseline pulse rate following tolterodine in the long term study. The adjusted mean  change  from  baseline  pulse  rate  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population  for  the mirabegron  50  mg,  100  mg  and  tolterodine  groups  was  0.9,  1.6  and  1.5  bpm  for  AM measurements and 0.4, 1.3 and 1.9 bpm for PM measurements.
- Categorical increases in pulse rate in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population were noted more frequently  at  various  cut-points  with  mirabegron  than  with  placebo.  Mirabegron  25  and  50  mg were roughly comparable to tolterodine while mirabegron 100 mg demonstrated more outliers at various cut-points than tolterodine. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg showed fewer outliers at the various cut-points than either tolterodine or mirabegron 100 mg.
- TEAE related to rapid pulse rate (cardiac arrhythmia, mostly tachycardia) were more frequently observed in all active treatments (2.4 to 6.6%) than placebo (1.8%) in the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population. The frequency of such events was roughly comparable for all mirabegron doses of 100 mg or less (2.4 to 3.1%) and tolterodine (3.1%). In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the occurrence of such events was comparable between mirabegron 50 and 100 mg (3.9 and 4.1%, respectively) and was less than tolterodine (6.0%).
- The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation TEAE was low (0.2%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.6% for placebo, mirabegron 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg, and tolterodine, respectively) and comparable for  mirabegron  and  tolterodine  in  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population.  In  the  EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation TEAE was low (0.7%, 0.5% and 0.9% for mirabegron 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine, respectively) and comparable for the mirabegron and tolterodine groups.
- Female  patients  demonstrated  a  generally  higher  increase  in  pulse  rate  compared  with  male patients,  consistent  with  the  approximately  40  to  50%  increased  exposure  in  female  patients, although  this  finding  was  inconsistent  across  treatment  groups  and  AM/PM  measurements.  In patients  who  received  the  proposed  mirabegron  therapeutic  dose  of  50  mg,  pulse  rate  changes from baseline compared with placebo were approximately 1 bpm or less and pulse rate changes

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from  baseline  were  similar  to  those  in  patients  who  received  tolterodine,  in  both  the  12-week studies and the long-term study, in both genders.

- Overall data suggest a greater effect of mirabegron on pulse rate in younger compared with older patients,  although  this  finding  was  inconsistent.  For  the  12-week  studies,  there  were  no  clear trends observed in change from baseline to final visit in pulse rate for patients &lt; 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years in  any  treatment  group,  while  in  the  long-term  study,  changes  from  baseline  AM  and  PM pulse rate were greater in patients &lt; 65 years of age than in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Pulse rate changes in the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups were similar or less than the changes in the tolterodine group in both age groups. In an additional analysis, stratifying patients into &lt; 45 years, ≥ 45 to &lt; 65 years and ≥ 65 years of age, change from baseline and difference vs placebo in change from baseline were generally smaller in older compared with younger patients receiving mirabegron, with the greatest change generally seen in patients &lt; 45 years of age in the 12-week studies, while in the long-term study, change from baseline for pulse rate was small and similar in older and younger patients. Patients who received mirabegron 50 mg, the proposed therapeutic dose, had a difference vs placebo in change from baseline pulse rate of approximately 1 bpm or less in all 3 age categories, except for a 3 bpm increase in PM but not AM pulse rate for patients &lt; 45 years of age in the 12-week studies. Pulse rate changes in patients who received mirabegron 50 mg were similar to those in patients who received tolterodine, in both the 12-week studies and the long-term study in all 3 age categories. This included greater increases in the placebo-difference change from baseline in PM but not AM pulse rate for patients &lt; 45 years of age in the 12-week studies.
- Overall, the increase in pulse rate in the OAB population associated with the proposed therapeutic mirabegron dose of mirabegron 50 mg was approximately 1 bpm, similar to tolterodine, and did not result in more outliers or tachycardia-related AE than observed with tolterodine.

## Blood Pressure

- Mirabegron administered at the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with an approximately 1 mm Hg or less adjusted mean difference for change from baseline SBP/DBP compared with placebo. The adjusted mean difference vs placebo for change from baseline SBP in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population in mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was -0.5, 0.6, 0.4 and -0.1 mm Hg for AM measurements and -1.0, 0.5, 0.9 and -0.0 mm Hg for PM measurements.  The  adjusted  mean  difference  vs  placebo  for  change  from  baseline  DBP  in  the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population in mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was 0.1,  0.4,  0.2  and  0.7  mm  Hg  for  AM  measurements  and  -0.3,  0.4,  0.5  and  1.0  mm  Hg  for  PM measurements.
- In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the adjusted mean changes from baseline SBP and DBP following mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine were generally similar. The adjusted mean change from baseline for SBP in mirabegron 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was 0.2,  0.4  and  -0.5  mm  Hg  for  AM  measurements  and  -0.3,  0.1  and  -0.0  mm  Hg  for  PM measurements, respectively. The adjusted mean change from baseline for DBP in mirabegron 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was -0.3, 0.4 and 0.1 mm Hg for AM measurements and -0.0, 0.1 and 0.6 mm Hg for PM measurements, respectively.
- Categorical increases from baseline in SBP and DBP for the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 and the EU/NA Long-term Controlled populations were generally comparable across all treatment groups.
- TEAE related to hypertension were similar for the total mirabegron (230/2736 [8.4%]), placebo (117/1380 [8.5%]) and tolterodine (48/495 [9.7%]) groups in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Population.  The  frequency  of  such  events  was  comparable  for  mirabegron  50  mg  (120/1375 [8.7%]) or 100 mg (58/929 [6.2%]) and was highest in mirabegron 25 mg (52/432 [12.0%]). In the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population,  the  occurrence  of  such  events  was  comparable between  mirabegron  50  and  100  mg  (89/812  [11.0%]  and  83/820  [10.1%])  and  tolterodine (86/812 [10.6%]).

- Male patients had generally larger changes from baseline in adjusted mean difference vs placebo in SBP/DBP in  the  12-week  studies  and  the  adjusted  mean  changes  in  SBP/DBP  in  the  long-term study, although this finding was inconsistent across treatment groups and AM/PM measurements.
- Overall data suggested a greater effect of mirabegron on SBP/DBP in younger compared with older patients,  although  this  finding  was  inconsistent.  No  consistent  trend  of  SBP/DBP  change  was evident in patients &lt; 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age. In the 12-week studies, changes in adjusted mean difference vs placebo were generally similar in both age groups. In the long-term study, adjusted mean changes in AM/PM SBP were larger in patients ≥ 65 years, while changes in AM/PM DBP were larger in patients &lt; 65 years of age. This trend in the long-term study was seen in both the mirabegron and tolterodine treatment groups. In an additional analysis, stratifying patients into &lt; 45 years, ≥ 45 to &lt; 65 years and ≥ 65 years of age, ch ange  from baseline and adjusted mean difference vs placebo in change from baseline SBP/DBP was generally smaller  in  older  compared  with  younger  patients  who  received  mirabegron,  with  the  greatest change generally seen in  patients &lt; 45 years of age. This trend was also seen in the adjusted mean change from baseline SBP/DBP measurements in the long-term study. Patients who received mirabegron 50 mg, the proposed therapeutic dose, had an adjusted mean difference vs placebo and an adjusted mean change from baseline SBP/DBP of approximately 1 mm Hg or less in the 12week studies and the long-term study, respectively, comparable to tolterodine in both younger and older patients.
- Objective blood pressure decreases and/or hypotension were similar across treatment groups

## ECGs

A brief summary of both the first and second TQT studies [Study 178-CL-037 and Study 178-CL-077, respectively]  and  events  potentially  suggestive  of  QTc  interval  prolongation  in  the  integrated  safety database are presented below. Excluding intervals related to rate (HR, RR interval) and QT, there are generally  no  trends  observed  in  the  remaining  ECG  intervals  (QRS  and  PR)  across  treatments  and subgroups in either the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population or the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population. The only exceptions are small and inconsistent baseline to end point changes of the PR interval (3.8 msec or less) observed for the mirabegron 100 mg treatment group. These trends were more apparent in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase Population than in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population and were more apparent in male than female patients and patients ≥ 65 years of age vs. those &lt; 65 years of age. This mean baseline to end point change generally did not manifest itself in more outliers  based  on  maximum  PR  interval  for  the  mirabegron  100  mg  dosage  group.  A  slightly higher  frequency  of  1st  degree  atrio-ventricular  (AV)  block  was  observed  among  ECG  treatmentemergent abnormalities for the mirabegron 100 mg treatment group (2.9% vs. 0.2% to 2.4% for the other treatment groups) in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population, but this tendency was not replicated in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population.

Study 178-CL-037 evaluated the effects of 100 mg once daily and 200 mg once daily oral doses of mirabegron  OCAS  at  steady  state  on  the  individually  corrected  QT  interval  (QTcI)  compared  with placebo. A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin or matching moxifloxacin placebo was incorporated into the  study  design  to  evaluate  assay  sensitivity.  The  study  included  25  healthy  male  and  23  healthy female volunteers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  the  pharmacodynamic  results  demonstrated  that  mirabegron  prolongs  QT  interval  dose dependently,  with  a  differential  effect  in  males  and  females.  Reanalysis  of  QT  data  revealed  the following:

- -Reduced variability,  increased  effect  size  relative  to  the  original  analysis,  and  larger  effects overall  and  by  gender  (although  the  dose-dependency  and  gender  differences  remained consistent)
- -Confirmation of the effect of mirabegron on QT interval with mirabegron 200 mg
- -A statistically significant effect of mirabegron 100 and 200 mg on QT interval in females

Study 178-CL-077 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel crossover, phase 1 TQT study. Healthy volunteers who were randomized to 8 treatment sequences (10 days of mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg or mirabegron 200 mg, or 9 days of placebo followed by a single dose moxifloxacin 400 mg).

- -The upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI was less than 10 msec at all evaluated time points for all  subjects  receiving  the  therapeutic  dose  of mirabegron 50 mg .  In  the  mirabegron  50  mg group, the largest treatment effect occurred at 3 to 4 hours with a mean (upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI) treatment difference of 3.66 (5.16) msec in all volunteers, 4.49 (6.81) msec in females and 2.96 (5.00) msec in males.
- -The  upper bound of the  1-sided 95% CI  was also less than 10 msec at all evaluated time points  for  all  subjects  receiving  the  supratherapeutic  dose  of mirabegron  100  mg that  is associated with an approximately 2.9- and 2.6-fold increase in Cmax and AUCtau relative to mirabegron 50 mg. In the mirabegron 100 mg group, the largest treatment effect occurred at 4-5  hours  with  a  mean  (upper  bound  of  the  1-sided  95%  CI)  treatment  difference  of  6.19 (7.65) msec in all volunteers, 7.70 (9.72) msec in females and 4.63 (6.45) msec in males.

Mirabegron prolonged the QTc interval at the supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg, a dose which increased Cmax and AUCtau by approximately 8.4- and 6.5-fold relative to mirabegron 50 mg. In the mirabegron 200 mg group, the largest QTcI treatment effect occurred at 4 to 5 hours with a mean (upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI) treatment difference of 8.21 (9.99) msec in all volunteers, 10.42 (13.44) msec in females and 7.33 (9.42) msec in males. The increased QTc in female volunteers was consistent with their approximately 30% to 60% higher mean Cmax and 40% to 50% higher mean AUCtau of mirabegron compared to male volunteers.

## Phase 2/3 results in OAB patients

The following key conclusions were noted for QTc in a subset of phase 2/3 studies in OAB patients:

- All  mirabegron  treatment  groups  had  a  decrease  in  mean  QTcF  from  baseline  to  12  weeks  of approximately 2 msec; the decrease observed for mirabegron 200 mg was slightly larger at 4.4 msec.
- There was a higher occurrence of maximum QTcF measurements &gt; 450 msec in the mirabegron 200 mg group compared with placebo and compared with the lower mirabegron dose groups; the same trends were not observed for mirabegron 200 mg for maximum changes in baseline QTcF ≥ 30  msec.  QTc  measurements  exceeding  these  thresholds  occurred  with  similar  frequency  in patients receiving mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and placebo.
- Maximum  QTcF  values  &gt;  450  msec  occurred  more  often  in  female  than  male  patients  with  a comparable frequency in all treatment groups except for mirabegron 200 mg. No differences were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed between male and female patients in the frequency of maximum change from baseline in QTcF of ≥ 30 msec.

- Elderly OAB patients (≥ 65 years) had a higher frequency of maximum QTcF values &gt; 450 msec; the frequency of maximum changes from baseline &gt; 30 msec were similar for patients &lt; 65 years and ≥ 65 years.
- There were few SAE, TEAE and CV adjudicated events that involved QT prolongation or ventricular arrhythmias and there was no difference between the frequency of these events in the mirabegron, placebo, and tolterodine groups. No events of torsades de pointes were reported in any patient in the mirabegron clinical program.

## Summary of ECG Data

- At  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose,  mirabegron  50  mg  did  not  have  a  clinically  meaningful treatment effect on QTc interval in females or males.
- Prolongation of the QT interval was seen for mirabegron in females at a supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg and this treatment effect could be attributed to higher mirabegron exposure in females. A 200 mg dose of mirabegron is associated with an 8.4- and 6.5-fold increased Cmax and AUCtau compared with a therapeutic 50 mg dose.
- In OAB patients, there was a higher frequency of maximum QTcF measurements &gt; 450 msec in the mirabegron 200 mg group compared with placebo and compared with the lower mirabegron dose groups. Female patients had higher frequency of maximum QTcF values &gt; 450 msec than male patients; however, the frequency in mirabegron dose groups lower than 200 mg was similar to that observed in placebo.

## Post-void residual Volume (PVR)

There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  treatments  groups  in  mean  changes  from baseline to any post-baseline visit in PVR volume or in overall categorical shifts from baseline to postbaseline PVR volume. Few patients had shifts from a baseline PVR volume &lt; 150 mL to a PVR volume ≥ 150 mL to &lt; 300 mL post-baseline (54/4482 [1.2%] for total mirabegron in the subset of the Global Phase 2/3 Population (all studies except Studies 178-CL-003, 178-CL-004 and 178-CL-049; 0.4% to 1.1%  across  all  treatment  groups  for  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population)  or  from  any baseline  value  to  a  PVR  volume  of  ≥  300  mL  post-baseline,  with  a  comparable  frequency  across treatment groups. In a urodynamic study in male patients with LUTS/BOO, mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg did not affect detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow rate or urinary flow rate in men with LUTS and BOO. Two TEAE of urinary retention were reported in this study; one in the placebo group and  one  in  the  mirabegron  100  mg  dose  group.  While  the  urinary  retention  event  in  the  placebotreated  patient  required  catheterization  and  the  event  resolved  without  invasive  intervention  in  the mirabegron 100 mg-treated patient, neither event was reported as an SAE. These events are expected in  the  patient  population  with  documented  BOO,  as  was  evaluated  in  this  study.  A  statistically significant increase in PVR volume was observed at week 12 with mirabegron 100 mg treatment that is considered not clinically meaningful;  no  changes  in  PVR  volume  were  observed  with  mirabegron  50 mg; this increase was &lt; 30 mL.

## Immunological events

A  total  of  34  plausible  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  in  mirabegron  patients  during  the clinical development (23 in the short-term trials and 11 during the long term trials). Nonimmediate, primarily  cutaneous  hypersensitivity  reactions  of  urticaria,  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis,  rash,  pruritus,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

purpura, and lip and eyelid edema were reported including SAE of cutaneous vasculitis (1 patient) and urticaria (2 patients). An  association of mirabegron, particularly at doses &gt;  100  mg,  with nonimmediate, primarily cutaneous reactions cannot be ruled out.

## Safety in special populations

## Gender

The overall frequency of TEAE was generally higher in female patients compared with male patients across treatment groups. In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population and the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, although TEAE were generally reported more frequently in female patients compared with male patients across treatment groups, the difference from placebo or from tolterodine was generally similar between genders. Hypertension was the most frequently occurring TEAE in males and females in the total mirabegron group and reported with a greater frequency in males compared with females. The frequency of SAE and TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was similar in male and female patients across treatment groups. Female patients had generally larger changes in pulse rate consistent with their higher exposure following oral administration of mirabegron in the 12-week phase 3 studies, although this finding was inconsistent across treatment groups and AM/PM measurements.

## Age Group 1 (&lt; 65 years, ≥  65 years)

In the 12-week and long-term studies, the overall frequency of TEAE was generally higher in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared with patients &lt; 65 years of age across treatment groups. The frequency of SAE and TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was lower in patients &lt; 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age across treatment groups. No consistent trend of SBP/DBP change was evident in patients &lt; 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age. In the 12-week studies, mean changes were generally similar in both age groups. In the long-term study, changes in morning and evening SBP were larger in patients ≥ 65 years and changes in AM and PM DBP were larger in patients &lt; 65 years of age. This trend in the long-term study was seen in both the mirabegron and tolterodine treatment groups.

## Age Group 2 (&lt; 75 years, ≥75 years)

In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, the frequency of TEAE was similar in patients &lt; 75 years of age and patients 75 years of age for the total mirabegron treatment group, but was numerically higher for patients ≥75 years in the tolterodine group. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the frequency of TEAE was numerically higher in patients ≥ 75 years of age compared with patients &lt; 75 years of age across treatment groups. In the 12-week and long-term studies, the frequency of SAE and TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was generally higher in patients ≥ 75 years of age compared with patients &lt; 75 years of age for the total mirabegron group.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

## Tamsulosin

The cardiovascular results from Study 178-CL-080 do not suggest a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interaction between tamsulosin and mirabegron. In addition, combination treatment of mirabegron and tamsulosin did not appear to affect the safety profiles of either of these drugs. The higher exposure to tamsulosin following combination treatment of mirabegron and tamsulosin HCl 0.4 mg is not reflected by an overt change in safety profile of tamsulosin. Similarly, the reduction of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure to mirabegron with combination administration of tamsulosin and mirabegron is not reflected by a change in safety profile in mirabegron. This is supported by the number of AE related to orthostasis showing a numerically similar frequency across treatments. There were also no SAE and no syncope events in either treatment arm during this study.

## CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Inhibitors [Study 178-CL-036]

Administration of mirabegron (100 mg single dose) with the potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily) in healthy volunteers resulted in higher mirabegron exposure (45% higher Cmax and 81% higher AUCinf).

## CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Inducers [Study 178-CL-070]

The effects of rifampin 600 mg once daily on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100 mg dose of mirabegron were investigated. A 35% decrease in Cmax and a 44% decrease in AUCinf of mirabegron were observed. No dose adjustment is needed for mirabegron when administered with therapeutic doses of rifampin or other potent CYP3A4 or P-gp inducers.

## CYP2D6 Substrates [Study 178-CL-005 and 178-CL-058]

In healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of mirabegron towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the CYP2D6 activity recovers over a period of 15 days. Multiple once daily dosing of 160 mg mirabegron IR resulted in a 90% increase in Cmax and a 229% increase in AUCinf of a single 100 mg dose of metoprolol. Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron 100 mg resulted in a 79% increase in Cmax and a 241% increase in AUCinf of a single 50 mg dose of desipramine. At 15 days after the last mirabegron dose, no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine was measured. Drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates are not expected to require dose adjustment when co-administered with mirabegron. Caution is advised if mirabegron is co-administered with medication with a narrow therapeutic index and significantly metabolized by CYP2D6.

## Digoxin [Study 178-CL-059]

With multiple dosing of mirabegron 100 mg once daily the Cmax of a single 0.25 mg dose of digoxin increased 29%, while AUClast increased 27%. For patients who are initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should initially be prescribed. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect.

## Solifenacin [Study 178-CL-069]

Co-administration of solifenacin (10 mg) with mirabegron (100 mg once daily) was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Mean mirabegron Cmax was not impacted by concomitant solifenacin; however, mean solifenacin Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 23% and 26%, respectively with concomitant mirabegron. No dose adjustment is necessary for mirabegron when administered with solifenacin.

## Oral Contraceptives [Study 178-CL-068]

With multiple dosing of mirabegron 100 mg once daily, no changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel; both CYP3A4 substrates) were observed.

## Warfarin [Study 178-CL-040]

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With multiple dosing of mirabegron 100 mg once daily, no effects on the pharmacokinetics of Rwarfarin (substrate for CYP3A4) or S-warfarin (substrate for CYP2C9) or on prothrombin time were observed. No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when co-administered with mirabegron.

## CYP2D6 Inhibitors [Study 178-CL-005]

In poor metabolisers for CYP2D6, used as a surrogate for CYP2D6 inhibition, mean Cmax and AUCinf of a single 160 mg dose of mirabegron IR were 14% and 19% higher than in extensive metabolizers, indicating that CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism has minimal impact on the mean plasma exposure to mirabegron. The interaction of mirabegron with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor was not studied. No dose adjustment is needed for mirabegron when administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers.

## Metformin [Study 178-CL-006 and 178-CL-004]

Co-administration of metformin (500 mg twice daily) with mirabegron IR (160 mg once daily) resulted in an approximate 20% decrease in mean Cmax and AUC of mirabegron. Multiple doses of mirabegron IR had no relevant effect on AUCtau and Cmax of metformin. No dose adjustment is needed when mirabegron is coadministered with therapeutic doses of metformin. In a 12-week study, in patients with diabetes mellitus, daily doses of mirabegron IR (up to 200 mg) in combination with metformin therapy had no effect on fasting plasma glucose levels or HbA1c in this patient population.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the Global Phase 2/3 Population, one or more TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 285/5863 (4.9%) mirabegron patients. The most common TEAE (by preferred term) leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were headache (20/5863 0.3%]), constipation (17/5863 [0.3%]) and hypertension (16/5863 [0.3%]). One or more drug-related TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 183/5863 (3.1%) mirabegron patients. The most common drug-related TEAE (by PT) leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were headache (18/5863 [0.3%]), constipation (14/5863 [0.2%]) and hypertension (14/5863 [0.2%]) One or more SAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 61/5863 (1.0%) mirabegron patients. The most common SAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were atrial fibrillation (3/5863 [0.1%]), liver function test abnormal (3/5863 [0.1%]) and prostate cancer (3/5863 [0.1%]).

In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, one or more TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 98/1632 (6.0%) mirabegron patients (mirabegron 50 mg: 48/812 [5.9%]; mirabegron 100 mg: 50/820 [6.1%]) and 46/812 (5.7%) tolterodine patients. The most common TEAE (by preferred term) leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug in the total mirabegron group were constipation (mirabegron: 9/1632 [0.6%]; tolterodine: 0/812), headache (mirabegron: 9/1632 [0.6%]; tolterodine: 3/812 [0.4%]), dizziness (mirabegron: 6/1632 [0.4%]; tolterodine: 0/812) and hypertension (mirabegron: 6/1632 [0.4%]; tolterodine: 3/812 [0.4%]). One or more drug-related TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 64/1632 (3.9%) mirabegron patients (mirabegron 50 mg: 35/812 [4.3%]; mirabegron 100 mg: 29/820 [3.5%]) and 31/812 (3.8%) tolterodine patients. The most common drug-related TEAE (by preferred term) leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug in the total mirabegron group were constipation (mirabegron: 8/1632 [0.5%]; tolterodine: 0/812) and headache (mirabegron: 8/1632 [0.5%]; tolterodine: 3/812 [0.4%]).

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The OAB safety database size is considered sufficiently self-standing for a proper safety evaluation. It is mainly based on exposure in 2858 OAB patients treated ≥ 12 weeks with mirabegron (1254 with the proposed 50 mg dosage) and 564 patients treated ≥ 12 months (294 with 50 mg). Additional data from a number of patients (n=345) from trials conducted in other indications (diabetes, LUTS) also offer further information to the general safety profile of the drug.

Although middle-aged women constitute the preferential group of patients represented in the clinical development of mirabegron the database size allows the characterisation of most of the population.

During the short term exposure, 53.4% of mirabegron patients reported TEAEs (55.2% placebo, 60.2% of tolterodine). The most frequently reported were nasopharyngitis, hypertension and blood glucose increase that were similar for mirabegron, tolterodine and placebo. No dose dependent pattern was observed.

For the intended 50 mg the reported incidences were naspharyngitis 7.4%, hypertension 5.2% and blood glucose increase 5.7%. Urinary sedment abnormal, (3.5%), CPK increased (3.3%), headache (3.1%), GGT increased (3%), constipation (2.1%), protein urine present (2.1%) and urinary tract infection (2%) were reported with lower frequency.

Regarding the severe TEAEs the most frequent were supraventricular extrasystoles, headache and nasopharyngitis without relevant differences among treatments (included placebo). Hypertension, dry mouth (much more frequent with tolterodine) and constipation were the most frequently drug-related TEAEs, with a similar incidence among the groups.

When looking at the long-term exposure, the percentage of patients with one or more TEAEs was 60.5% for mirabegron and 62.6% for tolterodine patients. The adverse event pattern (TEAEs, severe TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs) was similar.

There was an increase in the number of neoplasms in the mirabegron 100 mg group mainly due to subjects from study 178-CL-047, however the rates of the most frequent malignancies was similar to the age-adjusted population and it is considered biological implausible that the malignancies are linked to mirabegron as they were varied and no specific malignancy dominated. This explanation is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was similar among treatment groups (including placebo). No qualitative differences both in short- and long-term exposed populations were observed.

Overall 11 deaths occurred in the mirabegron development program. From the 5 patients treated with mirabegron 2 deaths were considered to be possibly due to mirabegron according to the investigator. Further, two of the deaths are noted to have occurred because of bladder cancer and cardiac failure. The narratives for these deaths were carefully assessed and don't appear to be related to mirabegron.

A total of 77 mirabegron-treated patients experienced at least 1 SAE in the OAB 12-week studies. No remarkable differences were observed among treatments (mirabegron 1.7%, tolterodine 1.7%, and placebo 1.8%). Similar incidences were reported for all mirabegron doses. More SAEs were reported after long-term treatment: Mirabegron 5.7% vs tolterodine 5.4%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Beta-3 agonists were initially developed for the treatment of diabetes and beta 3-adrenoceptors (AR) are known to be present in adipose tissue. Mirabegron does not appear to have any relevant effect on blood glucose levels or body weight. Results from non clinical studies also show an effect of mirabegron on lipid metabolism. Results from studies in which mirabegron was administered to diabetic patients at doses of 60, 130 and 200 mg (much higher than those intended in OAB condition) did not show any significant change in the lipid parameters. During OAB clinical development blood glucose increase was reported for mirabegron (4.7%) with similar or higher incidences reported for tolterodine (7.6%) and placebo (5.4%). Therefore, a relevant effect on the lipid profile of OAB patients is not expected.

A total of 34 plausible hypersensitivity reactions were reported in mirabegron patients during the clinical development (23 in the shor-term trials and 11 during the long term trials). Given that incidences of these events were 2-3 times higher with doses of mirabegron ≥ 100 mg than for tolterodine or placebo a potential relationship cannot be excluded. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients has been made contraindication in the SmPC and has been included as important identified risk into the RMP.

## Cardiovascular safety

Clinical pharmacology studies carried out in healthy volunteers (CL-037, CL-072, CL-031) showed an increase of the heart rate and the blood pressure. Females and younger subjects were more susceptible to pulse increases whereas male had larger changes in blood pressure. These effects were influenced by the dose, being maximal at 200 mg.

These findings were also observed in Phase II studies and partially determined the selection of doses to be tested in Phase 3 (where mirabegron 200 mg dose was discarded).

During the Phase 3 development, cardiac arrhythmia events, mostly tachycardia, were more frequently reported with mirabegron than with placebo (1.8%). Mirabegron at doses up to 100 mg reported frequencies from 2.1% to 3.1%, being the highest for mirabegron 200 mg (6.6%). For the proposed 50 mg dose only a modest not clinically significant, increment of pulse rate (1 bpm compared with placebo) and blood pressure (≤ 1 mm Hg compared to placebo) were reported. This effect was not translated into clinical adverse events (cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension) distinct from those reported for tolterodine or in most of cases for placebo. Therefore the primary safety concern arising from these findings is a risk of increased heart rate in patients who are exposed to doses that are greater than or equal to the supratherapeutic dose of mirabegron 100 mg.

The SmPC indicates to reduce the dose to 25 mg daily in patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are at risk for higher exposure at the therapeutic dose of 50 mg. Furthermore it is clearly labeled that increases in mirabegron exposure due to drug interactions may be associated with increases in pulse rate. Post marketing data on increased heart rate and tachycardia among initiators of mirabegron and comparator drugs indicated for OAB will be generated within a PASS, as detailed in the RMP.

In the TQT studies the effect of repeat oral dosing of mirabegron at 50 mg and two supra-therapeutic doses (100 and 200 mg) on the QTcI interval was evaluated. The supra-therapeutic doses represent approximately 2.6- and 6.5-fold the exposure of the therapeutic dose, respectively. At a mirabegron dose of 200 mg, the QTcI interval did not exceed 10 msec at any time point in males, while in females exceeded the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval did exceed 10 msec between 0.56 hours, with a maximum difference from placebo at 5 hours where the mean effect was 10.42 msec (upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI 13.44 msec). At the mirabegron 100 mg dose QTc interval changes were below 10 msec, although females showed greater mean change differences than males. Mirabegron 50 mg dose did have no remarkable effect on QTc interval (males and females).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results from a PK/PD analysis indicate a small effect of age on mirabegron exposure (about 11%). When the simulations considered the additive effect of moderate renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment or the concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) changes in mirabegron exposure remained being relatively small. In any case, plasma concentrations for mirabegron 50 mg do not reach the exposure observed with the 100 mg dose. However data from an ad hoc Pk/PD analysis conducted by the Applicant showed maximal ddQTc values of 500.4 msec (95th percentile) in the simulation group of 75 year old females with mild renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment and taking ketoconazole). Therefore circumstances of mild and moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment, each combined with the intake of a strong CYP3A4inhibitor, are taken into account in the SmPC recommending a dose reduction to 25 mg. The use of mirabegron concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in patients with severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment is not recommended.

Clinical trials in OAB population were mainly composed by females (&gt; 70%) with a median age about 60 years (35% ≥ 65 years). Analysis of the effect of mirabegron on QTc in Phase 2/3 studies did not show any signal of concern on QT for 50 mg or 100 mg dose. Changes observed (and also when gender or age were considered) were similar to those reported for placebo.

In conclusion mirabegron 50 mg dose does not appear to raise safety concerns related to the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure to mirabegron) are considered. However, in patients receiving the therapeutic dose of mirabegron 50 mg once daily who have a known history of QT prolongation or who are concurrently taking medications known to prolong QT interval a safety concern arises. Adequate warnings have been included into the SmPC. Furthermore, the planned post authorisation safety study will generate further data on the cardiovascular safety particularly in the elderly, as specified in the risk management plan.

A decrease of lymphocytes and/or neutrophils counts was reported (greater with higher doses) after both short and long- term exposure to mirabegron. It is acknowledged by the CHMP that these changes were modest and transient however a group of patients receiving 100 mg (two times the proposed dose) achieved the clinical threshold of grade 2. This may be due to the presence of decreased (or borderline) values at baseline for a number of patients and whereas it is acknowledged that data for mirabegron 50 mg are not object of concern for the decrease of lymphocytes a potential effect (at least with higher doses) cannot be considered totally discarded. In order to properly address this issue it was included into the RMP as important missing information.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The available safety data is adequate to characterise the safety profile of mirabegron for the intended indication and the proposed patient population. Overall, the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron show a favourable safety profile comparable to that commonly reported with antimuscarinic agents. The potential for hypersensitivity reactions with mirabegron and exipients is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

For the 50 mg dose small increments in pulse rate and blood pressure have been observed within the clinical development programme. This effect was not translated into clinical adverse events (cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension) distinct from those reported for tolterodine or in most of cases for placebo. Further mirabegron 50 mg dose does not appear to raise safety concerns related to

the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure to mirabegron) are considered. To prevent increases in mirabegron exposure and subsequent prolongation of the QTc interval due to drug interactions appropriate warnings have been included into the SmPC. Furthermore, the risk management plan specifies specific pharmacovigilance activites to further characterise the cardiovascular safety profile. This includes the conduct of a Post-authorisation Safety Study focusing on CV safety, especially in elederly patients. The protocol for this study will be provided for agreement and follow-up reporting will be performed, as specified in the Risk Management Plan.

The CHMP agrees to calculate the PSUR cycle based on the IBD. Therefore the first DLP for the PSUR submission will be 30 June 2013.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In the main clinical studies a statistically superior effect in comparison to placebo was shown for the co-primary endpoints. The pooled data from the three main studies showed after 12 weeks of treatment that the effect in terms of urinary frequency was -1.75 micturitions for the 50 mg dose versus -1.20 micturitions for placebo. Likewise, the effect of mirabegron on incontinence (assessed in a subset of the recruited population) was -1.49 incontinence episodes for the 50 mg dose versus -1.10 for placebo. When the effect was expressed in responder analyses mirabegron achieves equal or less than 10% responders more than placebo. Data for most of the secondary endpoints support this efficacy.

Patient-reported outcomes reported a positive trend in most of the domains, even if the size effect is not impressive. It is noteworthy that the perception of the patients is especially significant in such a non-life threatening condition to provide reassurance of the clinical relevance of the changes measured in the quantitative outcomes.

Reassurance on the efficacy of mirabegron can also be obtained from the double and triple responder rate analyses based on predefined minimal important differences where mirabegron was significantly better than placebo. It is of special relevance, that this has also been observed when a more stringent definition of responder was used.

Indirect comparison of the effect observed with mirabegron 50 mg on the co-primary endpoint (incontinence and micturitions) with products licensed in this condition shows that the effect of mirabegron is within the range of the mean values for the other products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

Long-term efficacy data of mirabegron are limited. Available data have been measured as secondary endpoints and the main evidence comes from the non-formal comparison between mirabegron (50 mg and 100 mg) and tolterodine. Although the results obtained at 12 months do not suggest a loss of efficacy, these data do not allow for sound conclusions regarding the maintenance of the effect of mirabegron. However in the comparative review from publicly available sources mirabegron does not show a distinct behaviour from other medicinal products approved for that condition (i.e. antimuscarinic drugs). In this respect, comparative effects of mirabegron with tolterodine help to put in context the results as the comparison reveals an effect of similar magnitude both in short and long (52 weeks) term treatment. The uncertainty with regard to long-term data specific for mirabegron is therefore acceptable at this point in time.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Overall mirabegron shows a comparable safety profile with respect to that commonly reported with antimuscarinics. The most frequently reported AEs with the intended 50 mg dosage were nasopharyngitis, hypertension, blood glucose increase, urinary sediment abnormal, CPK increased, headache, GGT increased, constipation, protein urine present, and urinary tract infection (2%). In general the incidences reported were similar to the ones for tolterodine and placebo. Some cases of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during the clinical development. Given that these events were 2-3 times higher with doses of mirabegron ≥ 100 mg than for tolterodine or placebo a potential relationship cannot be excluded. Therefore hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients has been added as a contraindication in the SmPC and has been included as important identified risk into the RMP.

With regard to cardiovascular safety, mirabegron at the proposed 50 mg dose shows a modest increment of pulse rate and blood pressure (1 bpm and ≤ 1 mm Hg compared with placebo). These effects appear to be dose dependant (up to 100 mg 2.1% to 3.1%, 200 mg 6.6%) and superior to placebo (1.8%). Adequate safety warnings with regards to arterial hypertension and tachycardia have been included into the SmPC. Concerning the potential effect on the QT interval the 50 mg dose was shown to be reasonably safe in the thorough QT studies and as well in the clinical development program. The SmPC contains adequate information regarding the observations related to cardiovascular safety. Furthermore, the RMP requires the conduct of a post-authorisation safety study to further explore the CV safety particularly in the elderly, as detailed in the RMP. The posology of the drug takes possible higher exposure due to impaired hepatic or renal impairment or due to the influence of relevant drug interactions into account and relevant safety warning for the use of mirabegron in these conditions and with regards to patients taking drugs with narrow therapeutic indices metabolized via CYP2D6 or P-gp have been included into the SmPC.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Based on findings during the development of mirabegron increased blood pressure and QT prolongation were considered important potential risks that merit further assessment of cardiovascular safety in a real-life setting, especially in elderly patients.

For the authorisation of this medicinal product these uncertainties are addressed by adequate risk management strategies and warnings in the Product Information. Further, as described above,

initiators of the treatment, especially elderly patients, with mirabegron will be monitored within a PASS for their cardiovascular parameters.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Overactive bladder is a chronic condition with an increased prevalence in advanced ages. It adversely impact on quality of life derived from the psychological and life-style consequences of the condition. Urinary tract infection, skin ulceration and a greater risk of fall and bone fractures in some reports have been described among the complications.

Mirabegron represents a new alternative in the treatment of this condition with a new mechanism of action. It has shown a significant effect in the main symptoms of overactive bladder.The reduction in the frequency of micturitions, in the number of episodes of incontinence, the volume voided per micturition or urgency episodes has been considered to be modest in terms of clinical relevance, although comparable to other agents approved for this indication. The results of the measures aimed at capturing the subjective perception of the benefit reflect also these findings.

Mirabegron appears to be well tolerated. In terms of cardiovascular safety a modest increment of pulse rate and blood pressure at the proposed 50 mg dose was shown. This risk is considered addressed with the relevant SmPC wordings and implemented RMP risk minimisation strategies.

## Benefit-risk balance

The available data indicate that except for the fact that mirabegron belongs to a new therapeutic class it falls within what is expected from other products authorised for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms (i.e. antimuscarinics) with an acceptable safety profile. The overall benefit-risk balance is considered positive.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

A consistent effect is observed in favour to mirabegron. The comparison with tolterodine (and indirectly, with other antimuscarinics) reveals an effect of similar magnitude in the quantitative measures and also when patients valued the subjective impact. The safety profile is comparable to that commonly reported with antimuscarinics and can be considered to be balanced through the relevant SmPC wordings and risk minimisation measures. Therefore, the effect, although modest, can be considered clinically relevant and sufficient to conclude on the positive benefit-risk balance of this medicinal product in the treatment of OAB.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Betmiga in the treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency and/or urgency incontinence as may occur in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is

favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## Risk Management System and PSUR cycle

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 1.5 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities
- Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
- at the request of the EMA

The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the standard requirements until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.
