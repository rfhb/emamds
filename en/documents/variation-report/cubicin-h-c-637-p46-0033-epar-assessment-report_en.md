## Introduction

The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

The  applicant  has  submitted  a  Critical  Expert  Overview  to  provide  information  from  a  recently completed  phase  IV  safety,  efficacy  and  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  study  (Study  DAP-PEDS-11-02) involving paediatric patients (aged 1 to 17 years old) with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) sponsored by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

## About the product

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide natural product that is active against Gram positive bacteria only. The  mechanism  of  action  involves  binding  to  bacterial  membranes  of  both  growing  and  stationary phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis. This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis.

Daptomycin pharmacokinetics are generally linear and time-independent at doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg administered as a single daily dose by 30-minute intravenous infusion for up to 14 days in healthy volunteers. Steady state concentrations are achieved by the third daily dose. Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney.

Cubicin was first authorised via the centralised route in 2006.

## Approved indication(s) and posology

## Indication

Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

- Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI).
- Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus .
-  Adult  patients  with Staphylococcus  aureus bacteraemia  (SAB)  when  associated  with  RIE  or  with cSSTI.

## Posology

## Adults

- cSSTI without concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: Cubicin 4 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours for 7-14 days or until the infection is resolved

-  cSSTI  with  concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia:  Cubicin  6  mg/kg  is  administered  once every 24 hours. The duration of therapy may need to be longer than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient.

- Known or suspected right-sided infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus : Cubicin 6 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours. The duration of therapy should be in accordance with available official recommendations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with renal impairment, dose adjustment is needed.

## Paediatric population

Cubicin is indicated in children between 1 and 17 years of age with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections and the posology is based on age bands. The safety and efficacy of Cubicin in children and adolescents aged below 18 years has not been established for other indications.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Clinical aspects

## Study Design

Study  DAP-PEDS-11-02  [P005]  was  a  Phase  4,  open  label  (Evaluator-blinded),  comparative,  multicentre,  multi-national  study  was  designed  to  describe  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  intravenous  (IV) daptomycin versus standard of care (SOC) comparator in paediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years with SAB.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of IV daptomycin versus SOC comparator antibiotics (hereafter referred to as comparator) in paediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years of age with SAB.

Key secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of IV daptomycin versus the comparator for bacteraemia caused by S. aureus and determining exposure by measuring plasma levels of daptomycin at pre-dose (Ctrough) and end of infusion (Cmax) to explore exposure-response safety analyses in the target population.

The  study  was  conducted  initially  in  paediatric  patients  between  the  ages  of  &gt;  4  and  17  years. Following  review  of  safety  data  by  an  independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee,  the  protocol  was sequentially amended to allow enrolment of paediatric subjects down to 1 year of age.

## Study Dates

06 March 2013 (FSFV) to 20 January 2016 (LPLV), with 65 sites eligible to enrol world-wide.

## Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria

Subjects were enrolled and study medication began based on a diagnosis of proven or probable SAB. Proven infections were considered those with S. aureus identified from at least one blood culture bottle by conventional culture methods or by a rapid diagnostic test within 3 days prior to the first dose of study  drug.  Probable  infections  were  those  with  a  preliminary  blood  culture  result  demonstrating Gram-positive cocci in clusters upon Gram stain, suggestive of a staphylococcal infection. If the final blood  culture  yielded  only  coagulase  negative  Staphylococci  (CoNS)  after  the  subject  was  enrolled, only high risk subjects with persistent bacteraemia documented by multiple cultures taken on separate days or from separate sites yielding the same organism could continue on study therapy. Subjects at high risk included, but were not limited to, immunocompromised children, cancer patients, or those with a potential source of infection from devices or IV catheters that were not intended to be removed. In such cases the Sponsor-designated Medical Monitor was contacted to continue treatment.

Subjects were excluded if they had previous systemic antimicrobial therapy effective against S. aureus exceeding 72 hours in duration administered anytime during the 96 hours prior to the first dose of study drug; with the exception: Subject was eligible if culture data demonstrated in vitro resistance to prior IV antibiotic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  this  study,  subjects  were  enrolled  into  three  age  groups  and  treated  with  daptomycin  or comparator, based on a 2:1 randomization, which was stratified by age group. The study was designed to enrol ~75 paediatric subjects, including ~50 assigned to the daptomycin arm and ~25 assigned to the  comparator  arm.  Subjects  between  the  ages  of  1  and  17  years  were  to  be  randomized  and stratified by age group, to receive either daptomycin or comparator (suggested as IV vancomycin, IV clindamycin,  IV  semi-synthetic  penicillins  [nafcillin,  oxacillin,  or  cloxacillin],  or  IV  first-generation cephalosporins) in a ratio of 2:1, respectively, according to the 3 age groups. Switch to oral therapy was discouraged, but was acceptable, if allowed by study site's practice standard.

## Study population

A  total  of  82  paediatric  patients  were  included,  55  paediatric  subjects  randomized  to  receive daptomycin and 27 randomized to receive SOC.

The analysis populations were as follows:

Safety  Population:  The  Safety  population  included  all  subjects  who  received  any  dose  of  IV  study medication (daptomycin or comparator).

Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT population included all randomized subjects including those who were not exposed to any test product, and were analysed based on the treatment to which they were randomized.

Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) Population: The MITT population included all randomized and treated subjects with at least one dose of study drug who met the clinical criteria for the study infection at Baseline (positive blood culture for S. aureus or  CoNS in high risk patients or probable bacteraemia [Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain at Baseline]).

Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (mMITT) Population: The mMITT population included all MITT subjects who had proven S. aureus bacteraemia at Baseline.

Clinically Evaluable (CE) Population: The CE population was a subpopulation of the mMITT including subjects who met specific criteria related to the required assessments:

o Received the correct drug, as randomized

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

o  Received  appropriate  duration  of  treatment  (minimum  and  maximum  treatment  durations  are outlined in the Clinical Evaluability Review Plan)

o Had the necessary clinical and microbiological efficacy evaluations performed at the TOC/Safety Visit and were not evaluated as 'non-evaluable'

o  Did  not  receive  effective  systemic  confounding  antibiotics  at  Baseline  (&gt;72  hours  administered duration anytime during the 96 hours prior to the first dose)

o Did not receive more than one dose of effective systemic on-study antibiotics from the first dose of study drug to the TOC/Safety Visit.

Exposure Response Population: The exposure response population included any subject with at least one peak or trough sample (of daptomycin plasma concentration).

## Dose justification

The  dosing  regimen  of  daptomycin  for  this  study  was  based  on  PK  data  in  paediatric  subjects, population PK modelling and simulation, and nonclinical effects in juvenile dogs. From observations in non-clinical studies with 7-week old juvenile dogs, it was judged possible that young children may be more sensitive to the adverse effects of daptomycin than adults, especially in the developing nervous system of young children. For skeletal muscle toxicity, which is driven by AUC, the no-observed-effectlevels  (NOEL)  exposure  for  7-week  old  juvenile  dogs  treated  for  14  days  was  1250  μg*h/mL.  For nervous system effects, which are driven by Cmax, the NOEL in 7- week old juvenile dogs treated for 14 days was 705 μg/mL. High doses of 12 mg/kg in adults were well tolerated with a mean steadystate Cmax value of 184 μg/mL and mean AUC of 1277 μg*hr/mL (Daptomycin IB).

Daptomycin exhibits concentration-dependent bactericidal effect and AUC/MIC is the main PK/Pharmacodynamic  (PD)  driver  of  efficacy.  The  dose  selection  for  this  study  was  based  on  the following key points:

-The intent of dose selection was to target exposures (AUC) in paediatric patients that are comparable to the exposures seen in adults treated with 6 mg/kg for SAB. In paediatric patients, this requires a higher mg/kg dose, since clearance in paediatric patients is higher than in adults.

-Higher doses increase the potential of an elevated Cmax. This possibility was mitigated by extending the duration of the infusion from 30 to 60 minutes for paediatric patients under 7 years of age, where a higher dose (12 mg/kg) was determined necessary to achieve efficacy in this indication.

-Doses  were  selected  to  ensure  AUC  exposures  in  paediatric  patients  within  the  range  of  safe  and efficacious exposures reported in adults treated with 6 mg/kg for bacteraemia (90% of adult subjects had AUC exposures between 270 to 1151μg*h/mL; mean 622 μg*h/mL; median 543 μg*h/mL). These exposures were well within the safety margin of the observed NOEL in the juvenile dog study.

Based on exposure matching with adults the following doses were selected for this study:

For ages 12-17 years: 7 mg/kg IV q24h

For ages 7-11 years: 9 mg/kg IV q24h

For ages 1-6 years: 12 mg/kg IV q24h

## Duration of Treatment

Maximum  total  duration  of  study  drug  therapy  was  not  to  exceed  42  days,  except  in  special circumstances per protocol.

Duration of therapy post randomization:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| 1-11          | Max: 28 days Mir: 5 days     | Max: 28 days Min: 7 days      |

a Some of this therapy could have been administered at home as per local practice. Switch to oral therapy was discouraged, but was acceptable, if allowed by study site's practice standard.

b Subjects with complicated bacteremia with osteomyelitis and positive blood cultures may have received a shorter duration of IV therapy (less than 7 days) after discussion with the Sponsor designated Medical Monitor.

c  Children  under 12  years of  age  who  were  classified  as  having  complicated bacteremia  after  IV  treatment  was started and who responded to treatment by Day 28 but who required additional IV treatment may have continued on IV daptomycin or SOC if benefit outweighed the potential safety risk.

## Criteria for Evaluation

Evaluation of Safety:

The  safety  of  daptomycin  and  SOC  were  evaluated  by  monitoring  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious adverse  events  (SAEs),  and  changes  in  physical  and  focused  neurological  examinations  and  serum chemistry  (including  serum  CPK  level),  haematology,  and  vital  signs.  Safety  was  assessed  for  the entire  study  period  from  the  administration  of  the  first  dose  of  study  medication  through  the  Last Follow-up Visit (25 to 35 days after the last dose of study drug).

Evaluation of Efficacy:

-Clinical  Outcome:  Clinical  outcome  was  based  on  a  blinded  Investigator's  (blinded  Evaluator) assessment of clinical  response  at the  TOC/Safety  Visit.  Outcomes  were  assessed  as  success  (cure, improved), failure,  or  non-evaluable  with  respect  to  resolution  or  improvement  of  clinical  signs  and symptoms.

-Microbiological Response: Microbiological response was determined as microbiological success, failure, or non-evaluable, based on evaluation of Baseline infecting pathogen at the TOC/Safety Visit.

-Overall  Outcome:  The  overall  outcome  was  determined  based  on  the  subject's  microbiological response and clinical outcome at the TOC/Safety Visit. Overall outcome was a success if both clinical and microbiological outcomes were successful.

Exposure Response Analysis:

Daptomycin exposures were determined by measuring plasma levels at pre-dose (plasma concentration in sample obtained just before dosing [Ctrough]) and end of infusion (maximum plasma concentration  [Cmax])  between  Days  3  and  6  of  IV  daptomycin  treatment  to  explore  exposure response safety analyses in all age groups. The correlation between exposure (peak and trough) and CPK levels was assessed graphically. The trough and Cmax values for all subjects with an AE in the Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) categories of Peripheral Neuropathy and the category of Rhabdomyolysis/Myopathy were evaluated.

## Results

## Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics :

A total of 82 subjects were randomized into the study. The ITT population included 55 subjects in the daptomycin  treatment  arm  and  27  subjects  in  the  SOC  comparator  treatment  arm.  The  study  was conducted  in  North  America,  Europe,  Central/South  America,  and  Australia/Asia.  The  majority  of subjects (76.8%) were enrolled in the United States (36 subjects) and Ukraine (25 subjects). Overall, the study completion rate was high; (96.3%) subjects completed the study through the TOC/Safety Visit, which included 54 (98.2%) daptomycin-treated subjects and 24 (92.3%) SOC-treated subjects. Similarly, IV study drug completion rates were high (85.5% and 88.5% in the daptomycin and SOC treatment arms, respectively). The most common reasons for premature discontinuation of IV study drug were AEs, persistently positive blood cultures, subject/parent/legal guardian's decision, or other reasons.

In general, the Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment arms and consistent across age groups and analysis populations. The majority of the subjects were White (75.3%) and non-Hispanic or Latino (71.6%). The percentage of males (66.7%) was higher than females, but balanced between the 2 treatment arms. The mean age was 8.7 years (range 2.0 to 17.6 years). Mean weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were typical of the enrolled age groups and were generally similar between the treatment arms across age groups.

Majority  of  subjects  (77.8%)  had  methicillin-susceptible S.  aureus (MSSA)  as  the  Baseline  infecting pathogen.  The  majority  of  randomized  subjects  (N=73)  had  proven S.  aureus infection  (51  on daptomycin and 22 on SOC comparator), with a similar distribution of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S.  aureus (MSSA)  in  each  treatment  arm.  MSSA  infections  were noted in 80.0% of the daptomycin arm and 73.1% of the SOC arm, while MSRA infections were noted in 12.7% of the daptomycin arm and 11.5% of the SOC arm. Among the subjects whose bacteraemia was classified, bacteraemia was classified as complicated in 51.9% in the daptomycin arm and 66.7% in the SOC arm.

## Summary of Safety :

Eighty-one of the 82 subjects (98.8%) in the ITT population received study drug. Hence, the Safety population  includes  81  subjects;  55  daptomycin-treated  subjects  and  26  SOC-treated  subjects. Daptomycin administered at doses of 7 to 12 mg/kg once daily for up to 6 weeks to paediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years, respectively, with S. aureus bacteraemia was generally safe and well tolerated.

The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  65.5%  and  76.9%  subjects  in  the  daptomycin  and  SOC (comparator) arms, respectively. Treatment-related TEAEs were noted in 14.5% and 15.4% subjects in the daptomycin and SOC arms, respectively. The safety profile was comparable across age groups and similar to the SOC.

The type, incidence, and severity of TEAEs reported for daptomycin were comparable to SOC. Most TEAEs were reported as mild or moderate in severity and were typical for this subject population.

The most common AEs in the daptomycin treatment arm were diarrhoea (6 subjects, 10.9%), vomiting (6 subjects, 10.9%), and pyrexia (5 subjects, 9.1%). The most common AEs reported in the SOC arm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  diarrhoea  (5  subjects,  19.2%),  followed  by  osteomyelitis  (4  subjects,  15.4%),  pyrexia  (3 subjects, 11.5%), and arthritis bacterial (3 subjects, 11.5%).

It  is  stated  that  these  AEs  are  expected  events  when  antibiotic  treatments  are  administered  to paediatric subjects with S. aureus bacteraemia. There were no reported cases of drug hypersensitivity, eosinophilic  pneumonia,  or  bone  marrow  toxicity  among  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  the daptomycin group.

Overall, the incidence of SAEs was balanced between the 2 treatment arms (23.6% for daptomycintreated subjects and 26.9% for SOC-treated subjects), and there were no drug-related SAEs or deaths.

The  rates  of  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  were  uncommon,  and  rates  were  similar between the 2 treatment arms. Three (5.5%) daptomycin-treated subjects and 2 (7.7%) SOC-treated subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE.

Review of the SMQ of Peripheral Neuropathy and Rhabdomyolysis/Myopathy with a broad or narrow relationship showed there were 6 subjects overall who experienced TEAEs that fell into this category, including  5  subjects  (9.1%)  in  the  daptomycin  treatment  arm  and  1  subject  (3.8%)  in  the  SOC treatment arm; no events were considered SAEs and only one event (blood CPK increased) which led to  study  drug  discontinuation.  The  most  commonly  reported  SMQ  term  was  blood  CPK  increased reported in 4 (7.3%) of daptomycin-treated subjects. One TEAE was identified by SMQ for peripheral neuropathy  (muscle  weakness).  The  observed  events  were  consistent  with  the  prior  treatment experience in adult patients with bacteraemia and do not indicate a difference in frequency, severity, or outcomes of skeletal muscle adverse reactions in paediatric patients.

No new safety signals were apparent from the review of clinical laboratory results.

The pattern of skeletal muscle toxicity observed in this study was consistent with previous experience in adults. Most post Baseline elevations of blood CPK fell between 1 and 2.5 × ULN (13 [24.1%] of subjects  in  the  daptomycin  group  and  5  [19.2%]  of  SOC  group).  Sustained  CPK  elevations  were reported  in  14.5%  of  the  subjects  receiving  daptomycin  versus  11.5%  receiving  SOC.  Blood  CPK increased was reported by the investigators as a TEAE in 4 (7.3%) and 0 subjects in the daptomycin and SOC groups, respectively. CPK elevations &gt;2.5 times the ULN were uncommon in both treatment groups (2 on daptomycin and 0 on SOC). One patient discontinued daptomycin therapy due to blood CPK increased.

No  safety  signals  were  apparent  from  review  of  vital  signs,  neurological  examinations,  or  physical examination findings.

## Summary of Efficacy Results

The  efficacy  results  in  paediatric  subjects  aged  1  to  6  years,  7  to  11  years,  and  12  to  17  years receiving daptomycin at doses of 7, 9, or 12 mg/kg once daily, respectively, in the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia are as follows.

Overall,  the  proportion  of  daptomycin-treated  subjects  with  a  favourable  clinical  response  at  the TOC/Safety Visit in the mMITT population was 88.2% in the daptomycin arm and 77.3% in the SOC arm. Similar efficacy was observed at the TOC/Safety Visit in daptomycin-treated subjects irrespective of  methicillin  susceptibility  in  the  mMITT  population  (88.6%  versus  85.7%  for  MSSA  versus  MRSA, respectively).  Among  the  40  subjects  with  complicated  bacteraemia  in  the  mMITT  population,  the clinical  success  rate  was  generally  similar  in  the  2  treatment  arms  at  the  TOC/Safety  Visit.  At  the TOC/Safety  visit,  88.5%  of  subjects  with  complicated  bacteraemia  in  the  daptomycin  group  had  a favourable clinical response.

No significant  difference  was  found  in  the  time  to  clearance  of  the S.  aureus bacteraemia  between daptomycin and SOC-treated subjects in the mMITT population. Median times to clearance were 2.5 and 2.0 days in the daptomycin and SOC arms, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Microbiological  success  rates  at  the  TOC/Safety  Visit  for  the  mMITT  population  were  similar  in  the daptomycin (76.5%) and SOC (77.3%) treatment arms. The proportion of subjects with a favourable overall outcome at the TOC/Safety Visit in the mMITT population was 72.5% in the daptomycin arm and 59.1% in the SOC arm.

## Summary of Pharmacokinetics:

The median Cmax and Ctrough values observed with the age-specific, weight-based doses ranged from 73  to  95  ug/mL  and  4.3  to  5.6  ug/mL,  respectively.  The  median  peak  concentrations  were  95.40 μg/mL for the 1 to 6 year olds who received 12 mg/kg of daptomycin, 83.75 μg/mL for the 7 to 11 year  olds  who  received  9  mg/kg  of  daptomycin,  and  73.05  μg/mL  for  the  12  to  17  year  olds  who received 7 mg/kg of daptomycin. The median trough concentrations were 4.32 μg/mL for the 1 to 6 year olds who received 12 mg/kg of daptomycin, 5.63 μg/mL for the 7 to 11 year olds who received 9 mg/kg of daptomycin, and 4.93 μg/mL for the 12 to 17 year olds who received 7 mg/kg of daptomycin. The  median  Ctrough  appears  to  be  comparable  across  the  different  age  groups  with  age-specific, weight-based dosing regimens, and the median Cmax appears to be higher for the youngest age group (1 to 6 years of age) compared to older patients ranging from 7 to17 years of age.

Results suggest that there was no apparent correlation between peak daptomycin concentrations and CPK elevations or SMQ adverse events in the categories of Peripheral Neuropathy or Rhabdomyolysis/Myopathy.

## Conclusions

The applicant concludes that Daptomycin was effective in the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia.

## Rapporteurs comments:

No new adverse events of concern were identified and the safety data from the paediatric patients in this  study  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  daptomycin.  The  efficacy  data  showed daptomycin to achieve outcomes similar to other SOC treatments while PK data were as expected.

## 1.1.1. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant has submitted a clinical overview and the complete CSR for this paediatric study.

There were no new or unexpected safety findings from the 82 paediatric patients enrolled in study, although the incidence of short bowel syndrome was higher in the daptomycin vs control group. There were a large number of SAEs in both groups, reflecting the serious condition of these patients.

The number of patients in each age band were generally quite small, and considering the high number of major protocol violations, it is not clear how robust the results are.

While the doses selected for each age band based on PK considerations appear appropriate, it is noted that  the  doses  are  different  from  those  recommended  for  paediatric  patients  with  CSSTIs.  This  will have  to  be  justified  and  taken  in  to  account  when  extending  the  paediatric  indications,  to  prevent confusion and under exposure.

On the basis of the results of this  paediatric  study,  there  is  currently  no  change  in  the  benefit-risk profile of Cubicin for the existing indications. The clinical safety and efficacy findings remain consistent with  the  information  in  the  Company  Core  Data  Sheet  and  prescribing  information  for  Cubicin. Therefore, no SmPC changes are needed based on the results of this study at present.

## 4. Assessment of Responses

QUESTION 1: The incidence of short bowel syndrome was higher in the daptomycin vs control group. Please provide details and provide further comment.

COMPANY RESPONSE 1:

Demographics

In the DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 trial, the proportion of subjects (n=81 overall) in the Safety population with a prior medical history of short bowel syndrome was greater in the daptomycin group (14.5%; [8/55]) than in the comparator group (3.8% [1/26]). The majority (7 of 9) of the subjects with a history of short bowel syndrome was reported in the younger children (1 to 6 years of age); the remaining 2 cases were reported in subjects in older children (7 to 11 years).

Safety

No subject in the Safety population experienced a TEAE of short bowel syndrome during the trial. Of the  9  subjects  in  the  Safety  population  with  a  prior  medical  history  of  short  bowel  syndrome,  8 (88.9%)  subjects  reported  at  least  1  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Event  (TEAE)  and  5  (55.6%) subjects experienced at least 1 serious AE (SAE). None of the TEAEs or SAEs experienced by these 9 subjects  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  medication  and  none  were  considered  related  to  study medication  (by  the  investigator).  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  (88.9%)  and  SAEs  (55.6%)  in  these  9 subjects was higher than those in the overall Safety population (TEAEs: 69.1%; SAEs: 24.7%); this observation  should  be  taken  in  context  of  the  limited  number  (n=9)  of  subjects  with  short  bowel syndrome and the  potential  contribution  of  the  underlying  short  bowel  syndrome  to  the  overall  AE profile of such subjects.

Of the 5 subjects with a prior history of short bowel syndrome that experienced 1 or more SAEs, 2 subjects experienced SAEs that were deemed unrelated to study treatment but related to the existing condition of short bowel syndrome (Gram-negative bacteraemia in one subject and broken central line in another subject who required chronic central line for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy). Such complications of short bowel syndrome are not unexpected given the altered gastrointestinal structure and  function as well as the clinical requirement  for long-term  central line  access  and  TPN administration.

Efficacy

In general, subjects with short bowel syndrome are at increased risk for compromised absorption of oral  drug  formulations.  However,  in  this  trial,  all  subjects  with  a  reported  medical  history  of  short bowel syndrome were treated with only intravenous (IV) study medication throughout the duration of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  trial  (Table  1).  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  numerical  imbalance  in  the  proportion  of  short bowel syndrome reported in the daptomycin versus comparator arm had any clinically relevant impact on the efficacy evaluation of the study medication across treatment groups. The proportion of subjects in the daptomycin group with a history of short bowel syndrome who achieved clinical cure at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit (75%; 6 out of 8 subjects) was similar to that of the overall trial population (88% for  the  microbiological  modified  intent-to-treat  (mMITT)  population).  The  one  comparator-treated subject with short bowel syndrome also achieved clinical cure.

*Subject    received  8  days  of  IV  daptomycin,  was  discharged  and  given  15  days  of  IV cefazolin (only available in IV formulation) 350mg every 8 hours for a total of 22 days of IV therapy. In Listing 16.2.5.4 and Listing 16.2.5.5, the subject is noted as receiving oral therapy; however,  the  investigator  noted  the  cefazolin  as  an  'oral  switch'  as  the  subject  was  being removed from study medication to be sent home but was unable to be treated with oral therapy due to short bowel disease.

## Conclusions

There is no evidence to suggest that the numerical imbalance in the proportion of subjects reporting a Medical  History  of  short  bowel  syndrome  in  the  daptomycin  group  as  compared  to  the  comparator group impacted the overall safety or efficacy conclusions of the DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 trial. Moreover, short bowel syndrome was not reported as a TEAE during the trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rapporteur's  comments:  The  short  bowel  condition  was  pre-existing  in  all  subjects  and  was  not  a TEAE. The safety and efficacy results in these subjects were similar to the rest.

Response is accepted. Point resolved.

QUESTION 2: There were a high  number of major protocol violations.  Please  comment  on  whether these had any impact on the safety/ efficacy conclusions.

## COMPANY RESPONSE 2:

A review of the major protocol deviations (MPDs) reported during the conduct of the DAP-PEDBAC-1102 trial did not reveal any impact of MPDs on the overall safety or efficacy conclusions.

Overview of Major Protocol Deviations Reported in the DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 Trial Using the criteria in the  Protocol  Deviation  Review  Process  (a  Cubist  Legacy  process  which  was  predefined  and  finalized before  database  lock  and  before  deviations  were  categorized  as  major  or  minor),  each  protocol deviation in the DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 trial was assessed as major (i.e., fulfilled at least 1 MPD criterion) or minor; a subject may have had more than one MPD reported during the trial. Protocol deviations were predefined and reported by sites as outlined by the Cubist Legacy processes (Protocol Deviation Entry Guidance and Protocol Deviation Reporting Guidelines). The Protocol Deviation Review Process was primarily for Sponsor's oversight and review of protocol deviations.

Among  the  81  subjects  who  were  randomized  and  received  study  therapy  in  this  study  (i.e.,  55 daptomycin-treated and 26 comparator-treated subjects included in the Safety population), a total of 169  MPDs  were  reported  in  55  subjects.  This  includes  108  MPDs  among  38  daptomycin-treated subjects and 61 MPDs among 17 comparator-treated subjects. The total number of MPDs includes two MPDs  of  Visit  Window  category  that  occurred  in  two  subjects  in  the  comparator  group  and  were inadvertently  not  included  in  Table  10-3  in  the  CSR  due  to  an  editing  issue;  the  two  MPDs  are documented in the formal Listing 16.2.2.3) . The 169 MPDs were further categorized as follows:

-Study  Assessment  (n=132),  which  included  protocol-specified  evaluations  either  not  conducted  or conducted  with  errors  and  included  assessments  of  chemistry  and/or  haematology  laboratory parameters,  neurological  exam,  motor  skills questionnaire, vital signs, physical  exam,  and/or microbiologic  susceptibility.  Based  on  the  Protocol  Deviation  Review  Process,  any  missing  protocolspecified  assessments,  including  those  for  a  single  laboratory  test  on  a  single  trial  visit,  were categorized as a MPD.

-  Study Medication (n=16), which involved treatment duration (e.g., extending beyond the protocol defined duration) or compliance (e.g., oral medication not taken as prescribed).

- Inclusion Criteria Violated (n=2), which involved Inclusion Criterion #7 (full disease criteria were not met).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Visit Window (n=2), which involved collection of samples outside the pre-specified visit window.
- Withdrawal (n=1), for which one subject in the comparator group was not properly withdrawn from the trial after not meeting Inclusion Criterion #7.
- Other (n=16), which included issues involving delays in SAE reporting, consent, or unblinding of the blinded Evaluator.

Following the categorization of each MPD into one of the above categories, there were no further subcategorizations of MPDs performed on a programmatic basis. For example, the MPDs categorized as Study  Assessments  were  not  sub-categorized  in  a  systematic  manner  with  respect  to  the  type  and timing of the affected protocol-specified assessments. Of the 55 subjects in the Safety Population that had  one  or  more  MPDs,  48  were  included  in  the  Microbiologic  Modified  Intent-to-Treat  (mMITT) population, and 31 in the Clinically Evaluable (CE) population. The distribution of subjects with one or more MPDs by treatment group in the Safety population and the categories of MPD are shown in Table 2.

MPDs and Safety Assessments in the Trial

In  the  DAP-PEDBAC-11-02  trial,  all  subjects  that  received  any  amount  of  study  medication  were included  in  the  Safety  Population  and  the  corresponding  safety  data  were  used  for  safety  analysis, regardless  of  whether  MPDs  were  reported  for  such  subjects.  Of  the  81  subjects  in  the  Safety Population, 55 (67.9%) subjects reported at least one MPD (Table 2). A total of 38 (69.0%) out of the 55 daptomycin-treated subjects and 17 (65.4%) of the 26 comparator-treated subjects experienced

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

one or more MPDs. The most commonly reported category of MPDs (132 out of 169 events; 78.1%) was Study Assessments and was reported in 47 out of 81 (58.0%) subjects in the Safety Population (daptomycin  group:  34  out  of  55  (61.8%)  subjects;  comparator  group:  13  out  of  26  (50.0%) subjects).

Overall, the daptomycin- and comparator-treated groups had similar distribution of MPDs by category and proportion of subjects with one or more MPDs (by all categories and Study Assessment category). These data are in accord with the safety conclusions of the trial (CSR Section 12.6), in which the safety profile  of  the  daptomycin  group  was  similar  to  that  of  the  comparator  group.  Given  the  type  of observations  and  the  distribution  of  these  observations  across  the  2  treatment  groups,  the  MPDs reported in this trial were unlikely to impact the overall safety conclusion of the trial or the overall safety outcomes in an individual subject.

## MPD and Efficacy Assessments in the Trial

## Efficacy populations

In the DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 trial, the efficacy populations were programmatically defined as follows:

Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) Population: The MITT population was composed of all randomized and treated subjects with at least one dose who met the clinical criteria for the study infection at Baseline (positive blood culture for S. aureus or CoNS (coagulase-negative Staphylococci) in high-risk patients or probable bacteraemia [Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain at Baseline]).

Microbiological  Modified  Intent-to-Treat  (mMITT)  Population:  The  mMITT  population  consisted  of  all MITT subjects who had proven S. aureus bacteraemia at Baseline.

Clinically  Evaluable  (CE)  Population:  Subpopulation  of  the  mMITT  subjects  who  met  specific  criteria related to the required assessments: Received the correct drug, as randomized; Received appropriate duration  of  treatment  (minimum  and  maximum  treatment  durations  are  outlined  in  the  Clinical Evaluability Review Plan); Had the necessary clinical and microbiological efficacy evaluations performed at the TOC/Safety Visit and were not evaluated as 'non-evaluable'; Did not receive effective systemic on-study antibiotics at Baseline (&gt;72 hours administered duration anytime during the 96 hours prior to the first dose); Did not receive more than one dose of effective systemic non-study antibiotics from the first dose of study drug to the TOC/Safety Visit.

As described above, the sequentially selective assignment of subjects from the MITT to mMITT and CE populations  was  based  on  progressively  more  rigorous  set  of  factors  that  would  potentially  affect efficacy (e.g., mMITT population = MITT subjects with proven S. aureus bacteraemia at Baseline) and not  based  on  safety  assessments.  The  efficacy  of  study  medications  was  primarily  assessed  in  the mMITT population. Efficacy was also assessed in the CE population, which was limited to subjects that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  compliant  with  pre-specified  protocol  requirements  with  the  potential  to  impact  the  efficacy outcome. Clinical success rates in the CE population (daptomycin: 90.0%; comparator: 75.0%) were comparable or higher than those for the mMITT population (daptomycin: 88.2%; comparator: 77.3%) at the Test of Cure (TOC)/safety visit.

Of the 55 subjects with MPDs, 48 were included in the mMITT population and 31 were included in the CE population. Additional details are provided below.

MPDs in the mMITT population

Of the 73 subjects in the mMITT Population, 48 (65.8%) subjects reported at least one MPD (Table 3).

| Visit Window                                                    | 0                 | 2                 | 2             |

The overall distribution of MPDs by categories was similar between the two treatment groups. A total of 34 (66.7%) out of the 51 daptomycin-treated subjects and 14 (63.6%) of the 22 comparator-treated subjects experienced one or more MPDs. The most commonly reported category of MPDs (117 out of 148 events; 79.1%) was Study Assessments and was reported in 41 out of 73 (56.2%) subjects in the mMITT Population (daptomycin group: 31 out of 51 (60.8%) subjects; comparator group: 10 out of 22 (45.6%)  subjects).  These  observations  suggest  that  the  MPDs  noted  among  subjects  in  the  two treatment  groups  of  the  mMITT  population  are  similar  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  MPD categories and the proportion of subjects with one or more MPDs (overall and by Study Assessment category). Given that the primary efficacy results that demonstrate slightly higher cure rates at TOC visits for the daptomycin group as compared to the comparator group in the mMITT population, it is unlikely  that  the  MPDs  had  any  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  efficacy  assessments  in  this subpopulation.

To further examine the potential effect of MPDs on the efficacy assessments for the mMITT population, a post-hoc analysis on the clinical success rates for the 48 mMITT subjects with MPDs relative to those

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for the 25 mMITT subjects without MPDs by treatment group was performed. In the daptomycin group, the clinical success rates were 82.4% (28/34) and 100.0% (17/17) for subjects with MPDs and without MPDs,  respectively.  In  the  comparator  group,  the  clinical  success  rates  were  78.6%  (11/14)  and 75.0% (6/8) for subjects with MPDs and without MPDs, respectively.

For each of the two treatment groups in the mMITT population, there was no appreciable difference between  the  clinical  success  rates  of  the  subgroups  with  and  without  MPDs.  Moreover,  the  clinical success rates of MPD-based subgroups were similar to the overall efficacy rate of the corresponding treatment group. These results demonstrate that MPDs did not affect the efficacy results in the mMITT population.

MPDs in the CE population

To further assess the potential effects of MPDs on efficacy results of the trial, a similar analysis was performed  for  the  CE  population,  the  most  selective  efficacy  population  that  was  programmatically defined (Table 4). Of the 52 subjects in the CE Population, 31 (59.6%) subjects reported at least one MPD (Table 4).

The proportion of subjects with at least one MPD across the two treatment groups was numerically higher  in  the  daptomycin  group  (27  out  of  40;  67.5%)  than  the  comparator  group  (4  out  of  12; 33.3%).  The  most  commonly  reported  category  of  MPDs  (66  out  of  85  events;  77.6%)  was  Study Assessments and was reported in 26 out of 52 (50.0%) subjects in the CE Population (daptomycin group: 24 out of 40 (60.0%) subjects; comparator group: 2 out of 12 (16.7%) subjects). Within the CE  population,  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  daptomycin  group  with  one  or  more  MPDs  (all categories and Study Assessments category) was higher than in the comparator group.

The numerical imbalance of MPDs across treatment groups in the CE population should be taken in the context  of:  (1)  the  rigorous  definition  of  MPDs,  i.e.,  any  missing  protocol-specified  assessments, including those for a single laboratory test on a single trial visit, were categorized as a MPD; (2) the programmatic definition of the CE population as a subset of the mMITT population that was limited to subjects that were compliant with pre-specified protocol requirements with the potential to impact the efficacy outcome; and (3) the efficacy assessment of the CE population, which was comparable to that of  the  mMITT population (which had a more balanced distribution of MPDs across treatment groups than the CE population). Taken together, these observations suggest that the potential effect of Study Assessment MPDs on the efficacy assessments of the CE population was unlikely to be substantial.

To further examine the potential effect of MPDs on efficacy assessments for the CE population, a posthoc analysis on the clinical success rates for the 31 CE subjects with MPDs relative to those for the 21 CE subjects without MPDs by treatment group was performed. In the daptomycin group, the clinical success rates were 85.2% (23/27) and 100.0% (13/13) for subjects with MPDs and without MPDs, respectively. In the comparator group, the clinical success rates were 75.0% (3/4) and 75.0% (6/8) for subjects with MPDs and without MPDs, respectively.

For  each  of  the  two  treatment  groups  in  the  CE  population,  there  was  no  appreciable  difference between the clinical success rates of the subgroups with and without MPDs. Furthermore, the clinical success rates of MPD-based subgroups were similar to the overall efficacy rate of the corresponding treatment group. As was the case in the mMITT population, these results demonstrate that MPDs did not affect the efficacy results in the CE population.

Rapporteur's comments: The applicant has reviewed the causes of the major protocol deviations on the safety and efficacy of daptomycin and it is concluded that there was no evidence of MPDs impacting safety and efficacy results in the study subjects.

Response is accepted. Point resolved.

## 5. Rapporteur's updated overall conclusion and recommendation

The benefit/risk balance remains positive in the approved indications at present.
