## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for botulinum toxin b, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

At  the  time  of  the  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation,  an  additional  risk  minimisation measure (Health Care Professionals and Patient educational materials) was imposed for the important identified risks off-label use and toxin spread.

Having into consideration the poor response rate (1%) to the questionnaires, that the product is on the market for several years, the decrease in sales and patient exposure, as well as the low number of ADR reported,  the  PRAC  recognises  that,  at  this  stage,  routine  risk  minimisation  measures  and  routine pharmacovigilance activities would be sufficient. Therefore, the educational materials are consequently discontinued and should be removed as a condition to the marketing authorisation. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) On the basis of the scientific conclusions for botulinum toxin b the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing botulinum toxin b is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
