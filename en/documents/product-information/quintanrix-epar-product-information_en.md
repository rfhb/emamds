The primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses of 0.5 ml to be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks within the first six months of life in accordance with local official recommendations. The first dose can be administered at 6 weeks of age.  The following schedules have been studied in clinical trials:  2-4-6 months, 3-4-5 months and 6-10-14 weeks. The 3-5-12 month schedule was not evaluated.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION After reconstitution, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: Diphtheria toxoid 1 not less than 30 International Units Tetanus toxoid 1 not less than 60 International Units Inactivated Bordetella pertussis 2 not less than 4 International Units Hepatitis B surface antigen (rDNA) 2, 3 10 micrograms Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate) 2 2.5 micrograms conjugated to tetanus toxoid as a carrier 5-10 micrograms 2 adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 3 produced in Saccharomyces cerevisae cells by recombinant DNA technology For excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder and suspension for suspension for injection The liquid diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whole cell), hepatitis B (DTPw-HBV) component is a turbid white suspension. The lyophilised Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) component is a white powder. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Quintanrix is indicated for primary immunisation of infants (during the first year of life) against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b and for booster immunisation of young children during the second year of life. The use of Quintanrix should be determined on the basis of official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Primary vaccination:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Quintanrix can be given to children who have received hepatitis B vaccine at birth.

The immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B should not be modified for children born to hepatitis B virus carrying mothers.  This may require separate administration of hepatitis B vaccine and should follow official recommendations.

Quintanrix should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. A fine needle can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least two minutes following administration.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Booster vaccination: After the completion of the primary series, a booster should be administered preferably before the end of the second year of life. Booster administration should be in accordance with official recommendations. Quintanrix may be used to boost responses to DTP, HBV and HIB antigens if its composition is in accordance with official recommendations for boosting. The booster dose should preferably be given at least 6 months after the last primary dose. Method of administration Quintanrix is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Quintanrix is contra-indicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these circumstances the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and HIB vaccines. As with other vaccines, the administration of Quintanrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for vaccination. 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events). As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.  For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for at least 30 minutes. If any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Quintanrix, the decision to give subsequent doses of a vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered: · Temperature of ≥ 40.0 °C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. · Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. · Persistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. · Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh possible risks.

Quintanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other pathogens known to infect the liver such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E virus.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised The HIB component of the vaccine does not protect against diseases due to capsular serotypes other than type b of Haemophilus influenzae or against meningitis caused by other organisms. A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Quintanrix. Vaccinees with a history of febrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post vaccination. HIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. Since the capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine a positive urine antigen test can be observed within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm HIB infection during this period. Antipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines. The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when administering immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction In paediatric vaccination it is often practice to co-administer different injectable vaccines at separate injection sites, during the same session. Limited data show that there is no interference with the response to Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) and OPV antigens. Although no data are available on the immune response to the Bacille-CalmetteGuérin (BCG) antigen, no interference is expected. As with other vaccines it may be expected that an adequate response may not be achieved in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation As Quintanrix is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used during pregnancy or lactation is not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not relevant. 4.8 Undesirable effects Quintanrix was administered to approximately 1,340 healthy infants from 6 weeks of age as a primary vaccination course in several clinical trials.

In these trials, the most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were pain at the site of injection, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) and irritability, which were associated with about 50% of the doses administered.

As shown with other vaccines, the booster dose is potentially associated with an increased incidence of minor adverse events such as fever and local reactions. Adverse reactions reported after booster vaccination are listed below. Psychiatric disorders very common: irritability Nervous system disorders: very common: drowsiness Gastrointestinal disorders: very common: loss of appetite General disorders and administration site conditions: very common: pain, redness and swelling, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) common: fever (axillary &gt; 39°C; rectal &gt; 39.5°C) uncommon: induration Allergic  reactions,  including  anaphylactoid  reactions  and  urticaria,  have  been  reported  very  rarely following vaccination with DTP, hepatitis B and HIB containing vaccines. During post marketing surveillance studies with other hepatitis B containing vaccines, serum sickness like disease and thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely.

## 4.9 Overdose

Medicinal Product no longer authorised No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code JO7CA10 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties The immune response after a three-dose primary vaccination course was evaluated in five trials: 297 infants were evaluated after vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, 685 after vaccination at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and 107 after vaccination at 3, 4 and 5 months of age. Results from different studies show that, overall, 95.5% and 99.9% of subjects had anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus titres ≥ 0.1 IU/ml one month after completion of the primary vaccination course. At this time, the percentage of infants with anti-PRP titres ≥ 0.15 µg/ml was &gt; 99% and the percentage with anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 mIU/ml was 97.3%. More than 99% of subjects were considered to have responded to the pertussis component of the vaccine, which was defined as the appearance of antibodies in initially seronegative subjects (i.e. subjects with pre-vaccination titres &lt; 15 ELU/ml) or a post-vaccination titre at least equal to pre-vaccination levels in subjects initially seropositive due to maternallyderived antibodies. Seroprotection and vaccine response rates were similar for the three schedules used, with the exception of anti-HBs.  The seroprotection rates for anti-HBs ( ≥ 10 mlU/ml) observed with the 6, 10, 14 week schedule was lower as shown in the table below, but is unlikely to be clinically relevant due to the small sample size: 2, 4, 6 months schedule N = 672 98.9% Limited information exists on the persistence of the immune response after primary vaccination with Quintanrix as well as on the immunogenicity of booster doses. Results from one pilot study showed that, for 63 infants primed according to a 6, 10, 14 week schedule, &gt; 80% still had antibodies to diphtheria, tetanus, HBs and PRP at levels considered to be protective. Forty-one percent had antibodies to pertussis. Data from clinical trials show that Quintanrix, when given as a booster dose in the second year of life, induces a greater than 10-fold increase in mean antibody titre with respect to prebooster levels for all vaccine components. It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with Quintanrix as hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal Product no longer authorised The vaccine is reconstituted by withdrawing the contents of the vial containing the DTPw-HBV component by means of a syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the HIB powder. After the addition of the DTPw-HBV component to the HIB powder, the mixture should be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved. The reconstituted vaccine is a homogeneous turbid white suspension. Remove and discard the needle used for reconstitution and replace it with a second needle to administer the vaccine. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be injected promptly. When using a multidose vial, each 0.5 ml dose of the reconstituted suspension should be taken with a sterile needle and syringe. As with other vaccines, a dose of vaccine should be withdrawn under strict aseptic conditions and precautions taken to avoid contamination of the contents. 7.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Quintanrix is a vaccine used in children to prevent five infectious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a type of bacteria). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these infectious diseases.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · Diphtheria : Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. · Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. · Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often accompanied by a 'whooping' sound, hence the common name 'whooping cough'.  The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death. · Hepatitis B : Infection with the hepatitis B virus may cause the liver to become swollen (inflamed). The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people. Signs of the disease may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people who have been infected do not look or feel ill.  Others have signs of mild flu, but  some people can become very ill.  They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice), and other signs of the disease possibly requiring hospitalisation. Most adults fully recover from the disease.  But some people, particularly children, who may not have shown signs of the disease can remain infected.  They are called hepatitis B virus carriers. Hepatitis B carriers can infect others throughout their lives. Hepatitis B carriers are at risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer. · Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) : HIB infection most frequently causes brain inflammation (swelling).  There will be some type of serious complications such as: mental retardation, cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial blindness.  HIB infection also causes inflammation of the throat. It occasionally causes death by suffocation. Less commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, heart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes and mouth. Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. The vaccine cannot cause diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b infections. The hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b components of Quintanrix can only help to protect your child against infections with hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b viruses. It cannot protect your child against other infections that can affect the liver or against infections due to other bacteria than Haemophilus influenzae type b or against meningitis caused by other organisms. 2. BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES QUINTANRIX

## In the following cases, Quintanrix should not be given to your child.  You must tell your doctor:

- if your child has experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Quintanrix, or any ingredient contained in this vaccine.  The active substances and other ingredients in Quintanrix are listed at the beginning of the leaflet.  Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · if your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases. · if your child experienced problems of the nervous system (such as repetitive fits, decrease of consciousness) within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease. · if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  In these cases, the vaccination will be postponed until your child has recovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. · if your child has any known allergies. In the following cases, your doctor can determine the right time and scheme of vaccination for your child.  Tell your doctor: · if after previously having Quintanrix or another vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease, your child had any problems, especially: ♦ A high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ A collapse (floppiness) or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ Persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ Seizures/fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination · if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily · if your child has a tendency to seizures/fits due to a fever, or if there is a history in the family of this · if your child is taking any other medicine or has recently received any other vaccine.  Your doctor will be able to tell you what to do if Quintanrix is to be given with another vaccine or medicine. Important information about some of the ingredients of Quintanrix This medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may experience an allergic reaction.  Tell you doctor if your child has any known allergies. 3. HOW QUINTANRIX IS GIVEN Your child will receive a total of three injections with an interval of at least one month between each one. Each injection is given on a separate visit. The first injection can be given from the age of 6 weeks onwards.  You will be informed by the doctor or nurse when you should come back for subsequent injections. The doctor or nurse will give Quintanrix as an injection into the muscle. Your doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses. If your child misses the visit scheduled for the second or third injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit as soon as possible. Make sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course of three injections.  If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. The vaccine should never be given into a vein.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Any vaccine can have some side effects.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Side effects that occurred during clinical trials with Quintanrix were as follows: ♦ Very common (more than 1 per 10 doses of vaccine): · Pain, redness or swelling at the injection site · Fever (more than 37.5°C) · Irritability · Loss of appetite · Drowsiness ♦ Common (less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 doses of vaccine): · Induration (hard lump) · Fever (more than 39°C) ♦ Rare (less than 1 per 1000 but more than 1 per 10 000 doses of vaccine): · Bronchitis · Coughing · Vomiting · Collapse (floppiness) or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness · Fits Bleeding or bruising more easily than normal due to a drop in a type of blood cell called platelets have been reported very rarely (less than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine) with the hepatitis B component of Quintanrix. As with all injectable vaccines, there is an extremely small risk of allergic reactions.  These may be local or widespread rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Such reactions may occur before leaving the doctor's surgery.  However, you should seek immediate treatment in any event. If these events continue or become severe, tell your doctor. This medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may experience an allergic reaction. If you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.  It is possible that your child will have no side effects from vaccination. 5. STORING QUINTANRIX Store in a refrigerator (2 ° C - 8 ° C). Store in the original package in order to protect from light. Do not freeze.  Freezing destroys the vaccine. Keep out of the reach and sight of children.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Not all pack sizes may be marketed. Quintanrix is a vaccine used in children to prevent five infectious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a type of bacteria). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these infectious diseases. · Diphtheria : Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. · Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. · Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often accompanied by a 'whooping' sound, hence the common name 'whooping cough'.  The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death. · Hepatitis B : Infection with the hepatitis B virus may cause the liver to become swollen (inflamed). The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people. Signs of the disease may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people who have been infected do not look or feel ill.  Others have signs of mild flu, but  some people can become very ill.  They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice), and other signs of the disease possibly requiring hospitalisation. Most adults fully recover from the disease.  But some people, particularly children, who may not have shown signs of the disease can remain infected.  They are called hepatitis B virus carriers. Hepatitis B carriers can infect others throughout their lives. Hepatitis B carriers are at risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer. · Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) : HIB infection most frequently causes brain inflammation (swelling).  There will be some type of serious complications such as: mental retardation, cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial blindness.  HIB infection also causes inflammation of the throat. It occasionally causes death by suffocation. Less commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, heart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes and mouth. Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. The vaccine cannot cause diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b infections.

The hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b components of Quintanrix can only help to protect your child against infections with hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b viruses. It cannot protect your child against other infections that can affect the liver or against infections due to other bacteria than Haemophilus influenzae type b or against meningitis caused by other organisms.
