## 2. Introduction

The  Scope  of  this  variation  is  to  revise  the  existing  indication  for  Keytruda  as  monotherapy  for  the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

This variation follows the Keytruda PAM ANX/018 procedure, which was triggered by the MAH's decision on February 2018 to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects whose tumours have a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) &lt;10 in the KEYNOTE 361 study, based on external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) recommendation.

KEYNOTE-361 (KN-361) is a Phase III randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first line treatment in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma; this study is an Annex II condition (PAES) for Keytruda.

The CHMP's conclusions (April 2018) of the PAM ANX/018 procedure were the following:

- revise the wording for Section 4.1 of the SmPC to exclude patients with a PD-L1 expression CPS &lt; 10 from the indication of Keytruda in locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma adult patients who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy

- amend the current wording of Section 4.4 of the SmPC to provide appropriate information to prescribers on  factors  to  be  taken  into  account  when  considering  pembrolizumab  use  for  patients  eligible  for  a carboplatin-based chemotherapy

-  further  elaborate  on  potential  factors  that  could  be  associated  with  early  risk  of  death  (including hyperprogression?)  in  1L  cisplatin-ineligible  urothelial  cancer  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab monotherapy

-  comment on the exclusion of patients  ineligible  to  all  platinum-containing products  (Carboplatin and Cisplatin) in the currently authorised indication.

-  propose  a  communication  plan,  including  a  draft  DHCP  to  inform  prescribers  about  the  change  of product information

## 3. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 3.1. Introduction

Urothelial  carcinoma  (UC)  arises  from  the  urothelial  endothelium,  which  lines  the  renal  pelvis,  ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra. More than 90% of urothelial tract tumours pertain to bladder, being the fifth most common cancer in men in Europe. Approximately 70% of patients with bladder cancer are &gt;65 years of age, for a median age at diagnosis of 73 years.

Cisplatin-based  combination  chemotherapy  is  the  standard  first-line  treatment  for  advanced  UC,  for  a median survival of 13-15 months (NCCN Guidelines, ESMO guidelines).

About 50% of patients are unfit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy due to a poor performance status (PS), impaired renal function and/or comorbidity. First-line treatment options for these patients include carboplatin-based combinations, that are associated with inferior outcomes, (median OS of 8-10 months), or platinum-free treatments or single agent chemotherapy (NCCN Guidelines, ESMO guidelines, De Vos 2010, De Santis 2012, Sonpavde 2014).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In general, long-term survival with combination therapy has been reported only in good-risk patients (i.e. good PS, no visceral or bone disease, normal LDH or ALP levels), while poor risk patients (i.e. poor PS or visceral  disease),  have  shown  poor  tolerance  to  multiagent  combination  and  few  complete  remission. According to the so-called Bajorin risk model, patients are placed into 3 prognostic groups depending on their  number  of  adverse  prognostic  factors  (Bajorin  risk  groups  0,  1,  or  2)  which  includes  poor performances status (Karnofsky performance status &lt; 80% which aligns with ECOG PS ≥ 2) and visceral disease (Bajorin, JCO 1999). NCCN guidelines underlines that the presence of both visceral (non-nodal) metastatic disease and ECOG PS ≥ 2 strongly predict poor outcome with chemotherapy, and that patients without these adverse prognostic factors have the greatest benefit from chemotherapy. NCCN guidelines noted also that the impact of these factors in relation to immune-checkpoint inhibitors is not fully defined, but they remain poor prognostic indicators in general (NCCN guidelines, v3.2018).

Haemoglobin level has been considered as a further predictor of overall survival for metastatic urothelial cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and was included in other published prognostic models (Apolo, JNCI 2013).

There are no clear guidelines to define cisplatin-ineligibility. A proposed definition of unfit patients with metastatic US was elaborated with the goal of establishing uniform eligibility criteria for clinical trials: ECOG PS of 2 or Karnofsky PS of 60%-70%, creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) &lt;60 mL/min, CTCAE v4 grade ≥ 2 audiometric hearing loss, CTCAE v4 grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy, NYHA Class III heart failure (at least one of the above criteria) (Galsky, JCO 2011).

Keytruda clinical development plan in UC is including the following clinical trials:

The same action was taken for the pembrolizumab/epacadostat combination in other indications (HNSCC, RCC). This was presented by the MAH as a strategic decision based on the negative  results  of  the  combination  pembrolizumab/epacadostat  in  melanoma  from  study  KEYNOTE252/ECHO 301, while it was not related to the finding of KN-361 study in UC.

## 3.2. KEYNOTE-052

KEYNOTE-052 (KN-052) is a Phase II single arm trial of pembrolizumab in first-line cisplatin-ineligible advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This study has been the basis for the approval of pembrolizumab in UC  patients previously untreated and not eligible to cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (Keytruda Variation II/23-G, EC decision on 24/08/2017).

Within this submission, the MAH presented updated efficacy and safety results from KN052 study based on a data cutoff date of 30-NOV-2017 (data available in the previous variation II/23-G had a cutoff date of 09-MAR-2017).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

Patients enrolled in KN-052 study had a diagnosis of advanced/unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic urothelial cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra, with measurable disease. Patients were enrolled regardless their PD-L1 tumor status. No prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced/ metastatic urothelial cancer was allowed (with the exception of adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based treatment with  recurrence  &gt;12 months  since completion  of  therapy.  Patients  had  ECOG  PS  0,  1  or  2. Cisplatinineligibility definition was based on at least one of the following criteria:

- ECOG Performance Status of 2 (the proportion of these subjects will be limited to approximately 50% of the total population)
- -Creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) &lt;60 mL/min but ≥30 mL/min
- -CTCAE v.4, Grade ≥2 audiomet ric hearing loss (25dB in two consecutive wave ranges)
- -CTCAE v.4, Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy
- New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure

A total of 370 patients were enrolled. All patients received a fixed dosing regimen of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W.

The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR based on RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed by independent radiology review  that  was  estimated  for  all  subjects,  for  subjects  with  PDL1 expression (CPS) ≥ 1%, and for subjects with strongly positive CPS exp ression (CPS) ≥ 10. DOR and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review, and OS were secondary endpoints.

In the table above, a comparison between baseline characteristics of KEYNOTE-052 and KEYNOTE-361 has been presented. The population enrolled in KN-361 is substantially different from that of study KN052. In particular, only patients fit to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) are included in KN-361, due to the presence of a chemotherapy-doublet arm. While patients covering the full spectrum of cisplatin-ineligibility, including also patients unfit to receive any platinum-based combination chemotherapy, not enrolled in KN-361, were enrolled in KN-052. Patients in the KEYNOTE052 study appeared to be older, more frequently with ECOG-PS 2, with visceral metastases and with 2 Bajorin risk Factors compared to cisplatin-ineligible population of KN-361.

## Risk factors analysis of OS in patients with PD-L1 CPS&lt;10

The influence of baseline prognostic factors on the risk of early death (within 3 months after first dose of pembrolizumab) in subjects with PD-L1 CPS &lt;10 was evaluated by univariate and multivariate predictor analysis using Cox regression models. Prognostic factors were tested in separate univariate Cox models and then entered into a multivariate model selection process. Prognostic risk factors tested in the models were age (&lt;75 years vs ≥75 years), ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs 2), liver metastasis (yes vs no), haemoglobin level (&lt;10 g/dL vs ≥10 g/dL), and Bajorin risk group (0/1 vs 2).

In  KEYNOTE-052,  the  Bajorin  risk  groups  were  determined  on  the  basis  of  ECOG  PS  and  visceral metastases; ECOG PS 0 and 1 were transformed into Karnofsky performance status 80% and ECOG PS 2 into  Karnofsky  performance  status  less  than  80%.  When  adding  presence  or  absence  of  visceral metastases, patients  were  regrouped  into  3  prognostic  groups  depending  on  their  number  of  adverse prognostic factors (Bajorin risk groups 0, 1, or 2).

Two factors that had significant influence on the risk of early death were identified in the multivariate model, Bajorin risk group 2 HR 2.40 (1.41, 4.08) p = 0.001) and baseline haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL (HR 3.75 (2.07, 6.82), p &lt;0.001) in KEYNOTE-052 subjects with PD-L1 CPS &lt; 10 (see table below):

Subjects  in  the  PD-L1  CPS  &lt;10  subgroup  who  had  at  least  1  risk  factor  (Bajorin  risk  score  2  or haemoglobin  &lt;10  g/dL)  experienced  worse  OS  outcome  compared  to  subjects  with  no  risk  factors: indeed, median OS values were 6.3 (4.3, 9.7) months for PD-L1 CPS &lt;10 subgroup who had at least 1 risk factor and 11.7 (9.5, 14.6) months for subjects with PD-L1 CPS &lt;10.

For  subjects  with  PD-L1  CPS  &lt;10  and  at  least  one  poor  prognostic  feature  (Bajorin  risk  group  2  or haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL), ORR was 15.9% (95% CI: 9.5%, 24.2%) and 24.3% (95% CI: 17.6, 32.1) for subjects with PD-L1 CPS &lt;10 with no poor prognostic risk factors.

## Results - Safety

The MAH presented an overview of the safety data of the KN-052 study at the updated cut-off date of 30NOV-2017. Safety results were compared with the standard reference safety dataset for pembrolizumab (n=2799 patients, in melanoma KN001, KN002 and KN006 trials and in NSCLC KN001 and KN010 trials).

No  new  safety  signal  was  identified  when  safety  data  from  KN-052  data  cutoff  30-NOV-2017  were compared to the safety data from cutoff 09-MAR-2017.

In general, the updated safety profile of pembrolizumab in the KN-052 population is consistent with the previously established safety profile for pembrolizumab. A slight increase in the frequencies of Adverse Events is seen compared to the previous dataset, likely related with the additional 8 months of follow-up. The  nature  and  frequency  of  immune-mediated  events  in  KN-052  were  consistent  with  the  reference safety dataset and no new immune-mediated event was identified for pembrolizumab.

KN-052 safety analyses support that, in general, the tolerability of pembrolizumab in the 1L urothelial cancer  population  is  acceptable  and  consistent  with  the  tolerability  observed  in  the  pembrolizumab reference safety dataset. The key discrepancies are likely related to the fact the KN-052 population is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

older, and has more than 40% of subjects with ECOG 2 in comparison to the reference safety dataset, or related to the underlying medical condition urothelial cancer.

Exposure: Median exposure was 3.40 months and median number of administrations was 5. A total of 192 (51.9%) subjects received pembrolizumab for ≥ 3 months, 132 (35.7%) subjects for ≥ 6 months, and 78 (21.1%) for ≥ 12 months. Exposure to pembrolizumab was similar compared to the reference safety dataset.

Adverse events: The overall frequency of AEs was similar between the KEYNOTE-052 population and the reference safety dataset. Subjects in KN-052 population, in comparison to the subjects in the reference safety dataset, experienced more Grade 3-5 AEs (62.7% vs 45.5%), drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (20.3% vs 13.8%), SAEs (50.5% vs 37.2%), AEs leading to discontinuation (17.0% vs 11.9%), and AEs leading to a fatal outcome (6.5% vs 3.9%), but similar or less drug-related AEs (67.6% vs 73.7%), drug-related SAEs (11.1% vs 10.0%), drug-related AEs leading to a fatal outcome (0.3% vs 0.4%).

Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included.

Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Database Cutoff Date: 30NOV2017

The frequencies of each of the commonly reported AEs in KN-052 were, in general, consistent with the frequencies  for  the  same  AEs  in  the  reference  safety  dataset  with  3  major  exceptions:  urinary  tract infection  (24.3%  in  KN-052  vs  5.8%  in  the  reference  safety  dataset),  haematuria  (16.5%  vs  1.4%), blood  creatinine  increased  (14.6%  vs  3.9%).  Medical  review  of  the  available  data  for  those  3  events indicated they were more likely related to the underlying medical condition (urothelial cancer), with its clinical  complications  or  procedures  performed  due  to  the  underlying  medical  condition  and  did  not indicate a specific safety issue.

The most commonly reported Grade 3-5 AEs in KN-052 were the following (frequencies in KEYNOTE-052 vs  reference safety  dataset):  urinary  tract  infection  (10.8% vs  0.5%),  anaemia  (7.8%  vs  3.2%), and fatigue (5.4% and 2.5%). Urinary tract infection and anaemia events were considered likely related to the  underlying  medical  condition  urothelial  cancer.  The  frequencies  of  drug-related  Grade  3-5  AEs reported 1% or higher in KN-052 are consistent with the frequencies of the same events in the reference safety dataset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Serious  adverse  events: The  frequency  of  SAEs  in  KN-052  was  50.5%  (vs  37.2%  in  the  reference safety  dataset).  The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  were  the  following  (KN-052  vs  reference  safety dataset): urinary tract infection (7.0% vs 0.5%), urosepsis (3.5% vs 0.1%), acute kidney injury (3.5% vs 0.8%), and hematuria (3.0% vs 0).

Deaths :  Twenty-four  (6.5%)  subjects  experienced  a  fatal  AE  in  KN-052  (cutoff  30Nov2017),  which includes  4  additional  fatal  events  reported  since  9-MAR-2017:  colonic  fistula,  death  (unknown  cause), embolism, and urosepsis. No new drug-related deaths were reported compared to previous cut-off date.

AEs leading to treatment discontinuation: A total of 63 (17.0%) subjects experienced an AE resulting in  treatment  discontinuation,  9.7%  considered  drug-related.  Pneumonitis  (5  events,  1.4%),  colitis  (3 events, 0.8%), diarrhea (3 events, 0.8%), and tubulo-interstitial nephritis (2 events, 0.5%) were drugrelated AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation reported more than once.

Adverse events of special interest: The frequency of subjects in KN-052 who experienced AEOSIs was similar  to  the  frequency  observed  in  the  reference  safety  dataset:  24.6%  vs  21.4%.  The  nature  and frequency of AEOSIs in KN-052 were consistent with the nature and frequency of AEOSIs observed in the reference safety dataset.

## 3.3. KEYNOTE-361

KEYNOTE-361 (KN-361) is an ongoing Phase III randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial  to  determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pembrolizumab  with  or  without  chemotherapy  versus chemotherapy alone as first line treatment in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

Following a recommendation from the eDMC in February 2018 taken based on early review of safety data, the MAH decided to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects whose tumors have a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) &lt;10. The clinical trial protocol has been amended accordingly.

The  study  is  powered  to  evaluate  the  potential  benefit  of  the  combination  of  pembrolizumab  + chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for the first line treatment of urothelial carcinoma in all subjects  regardless  of  PD-L1  CPS  status,  primary  endpoints  being  PFS  using  RECIST  1.1  assessed  by BICR and OS.

As of 8-MAY-2018, the study has enrolled 930 of the targeted 990 subjects.

KEYNOTE-361 data provided to EMA have a data cut-off date of 22-DEC-2017. No additional data analysis has  been  planned  by  the  MAH  other  than  the  Interim  Analysis,  results  of  which  are  expected  to  be available in September/October 2018.

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

To evaluate the baseline characteristics that may predict the risk of early death in the pembrolizumab arm in KN-361, the MAH has been requested by EMA to provide:

1) Descriptive statistics of characteristics at baseline and statistical comparison between the two arms for patients having an OS event.

2) The interaction term and p-values between treatment and each clinical variable by using Cox model and the corresponding HR for each subgroups (including also Bajorin risk factors and haemoglobin), as well as Kaplan Meier curves.

## 3.4. Discussion - review of interim results of KEYNOTE-361

Keytruda  is  currently  approved  in  EU  for  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial carcinoma (UC) in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

In February 2018, the MAH decided to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects whose tumours have a PD-L1 CPS&lt;10 in the KEYNOTE 361 study, an ongoing phase III trial of pembrolizumab  with  or  without  chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone  as  first  line  treatment  in subjects with advanced or metastatic UC (Annex II study for Keytruda), following eDMC recommendation.

In  order  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  on  the  currently  authorized  Keytruda  indication,  the  CHMP requested  and  analyzed  early  data  from  KEYNOTE-361.  The  MAH  provided  also  updated  results  from KEYNOTE-052 study,  the  single  arm  study  which  led  to  pembrolizumab  approval  in  cisplatin-ineligible patients. Following the assessment of the totality of data (Keytruda PAM-ANX018 procedure), the CHMP concluded  that  a  revision  of  the  current  Keytruda  indication  in  cisplatin-ineligible  UC  patients  was warranted, in order to exclude subjects with a PD-L1 expression CPS&lt;10. In addition, an amendment to Section 4.4 of the SmPC and a draft DHPC to inform prescribers about the change of product information were requested, together with further discussion on the exclusion of patients ineligible to all platinumcontaining  products  and  on  potential  factors  that  could  be  associated  with  early  risk  of  death  with pembrolizumab.

## Wording of the indication

The MAH's proposed revised indication was the following:

'KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  in  adults  who  are  not  eligible  for  cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy  and  whose  tumours express PD-L1 with a c ombined positive score (CPS) ≥10. Keytruda is also indicated for patients who are ineligible  for  cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy  whose  tumours  express  PD-L1  CPS&lt; 10 and who are without poor prognostic features (2 Bajorin risk factors and haemoglobin&lt; 10 g /dL), or for patients who are unfit for any chemotherapy (including carboplatin) regardless of PDL1 status (see section 5.1).'

The proposal to submit a variation to exclude patients with a PD-L1 expression CPS&lt;10 was based on the early  findings  from  KEYNOTE-361  study  and  the  decision  not  to  enrol  CPS&lt;10  patients  in  the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of the study upon DMC recommendation.

Therefore, the MAH was also requested to clarify if it was possible to identify factors associated to the increased risk of early progression and death.

The MAH should commit to provide KN-361 IA results as well as the requested comprehensive analysis on potential predictive variables when available.

Based  on  all  available  data  of  pembrolizumab  in  urothelial  cancer  and  on  the  provided  analyses,  the MAH's proposal for the restriction of indication is not considered acceptable as not supported by sound evidence.

Following the review of the data provided by the iDMC and the MAH, the CHMP agreed with the changes of section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to restrict the indication as follows:

KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10 (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration'

## PD-L1 testing for patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma

Patients  with  NSCLC  or  previously  untreated  urothelial  carcinoma  should  be  selected  for treatment  based  on  the  tumour  expression  of  PD-L1  confirmed  by  a  validated  test  (see section 5.1).

## · Section 4.4 'Warning and precautions'

## Disease-specific precautions

Use of pembrolizumab in urothelial cancer for patients who are considered ineligible for cisplatincontaining chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥ 10

The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the study population of KEYNOTE-052 included a proportion of patients eligible for a carboplatin-based combination, for whom the benefit is being assessed in a comparative study, and patients eligible for mono-chemotherapy, for whom no randomized data are available. In addition, no safety and efficacy data are available in frailer patients (e.g., ECOG performance status 3) considered not eligible for chemotherapy. In the absence of these data, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis.

## · Section 5.1 'Warning and precautions'

Please refer to the Attachment 1 to see the changes.

In addition, a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to communicate on the restriction of indication after agreement of the translations local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities.

The  DHPC  should  be  sent  by  9  July  2018  to  Prescribing  Oncologists/Oncology  clinics/Oncology departments/Pharmacists as per country-specific distribution channels. The DHPC and the communication plan are provided as attachment II to this report.

## 3.5. Conclusion

Based on the data provided by the iDMC and the MAH, the CHMP agreed with the SmPC changes to restrict the  1 st   line  indication  in  urothelial  carcinoma  in  patients  not  eligible  for  cisplatin-based chemotherapy based on the preliminary data from on ongoing clinical trial (KEYNOTE-361) which showed reduced survival with Keytruda monotherapy compared to standard chemotherapy when used as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose tumour has low expression of PD-L1.

A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to communicate on the revised indication for Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

The draft DHPC and the draft communication plan are provided in Attachment 2.

The MAH agreed the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities. The  DHPC  should  be  sent  by  12 th   July  2018  to  prescribing  oncologists,  oncology  clinics,  oncology departments, pharmacists as per country-specific distribution channels.

## 4. Clinical Safety aspects

The safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy is as expected. The lower OS performance of pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy observed in KEYNOTE-361 study does not appear to be related to a safety issue.

## 5. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The  Scope  of  this  variation  is  to  revise  the  existing  indication  for  Keytruda  as  monotherapy  for  the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) in adults who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, following the assessment of early data from the ongoing clinical trial KEYNOTE-361 (phase  III  randomized  open  label  study  of  pembrolizumab  with/without  platinum-based chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first line treatment in advanced or metastatic UC), which was recently amended to stop the randomization into the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of subjects whose tumours have a PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) &lt;10, based on external Data Monitoring Committee recommendation.

Thus, a restriction of indication is warranted.

The MAH applied for a variation to update section 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1.

The CHMP agreed with the update of section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) was considered necessary to communicate on the modification of the indication.

The benefit-risk  balance of  Keytruda,  remains  positive  in the other  authorised  indications  and  2 nd   line urothelial carcinoma indication. As for the 1 st  line urothelial indication, the benefit risk remains positive in patients whose tumours have a PDL-1 expression ≥ 10.

The MAH should provide KN-361 IA results as well as the requested comprehensive analysis on potential predictive variables when available.

## 6. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I                  |

Restriction of indication in cisplatin-ineligible urothelial carcinoma patients to exclude patients whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) &lt;10, based on the review of interim analysis data by the independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) from study KEYNOTE- 361 listed as a PAES in the Annex II; this is a Phase III randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first line treatment in subjects with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been revised accordingly. A DHPC was considered necessary to communicate on the restricted indication.

is recommended for approval by consensus.
