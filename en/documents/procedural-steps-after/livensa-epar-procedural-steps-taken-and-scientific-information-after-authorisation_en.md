| R/0016 | Renewal of the Marketing Authorisation | 19/05/2011 product                  | 18/07/2011 no                               | II, PL Based on the CHMP review of the available information and on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the benefit risk profile of Livensa continues to be favourable. The CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds is required. The reason for an additional five-year renewal is that the off-label use is a safety risk. It is worrying that the data from the THIN (The Health Improvement Database) study suggests that approx 70% of the users are outside indication. The MAH has been asked to consider how to prevent the off-label use and present it in the next PSUR (6 month). Therefore based upon the safety profile of Livensa, which requires the submission of 6 monthly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. |

The MAH has applied to include \"Abdominal Pain\" in section 4.8 within the frequency \"Common\". Moreover, following the outcome of the 2nd PSUR, more restructuring of section 4.8 of the SPC was proposed, including an update of the SPC table and the addition of information on \"hirsutism\", as undesirable effect. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. |
