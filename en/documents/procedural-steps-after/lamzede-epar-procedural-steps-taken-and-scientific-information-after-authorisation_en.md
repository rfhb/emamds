| II/0018             | Update of sections 4.4, 4,8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to amend an existing warning on immunogenicity, update the summary of the safety profile, add cyanosis to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency 'common', add the information that the safety profile observed in children under age 6 is consistent with what was observed in previous studies, update the pharmacodynamic properties. These proposed SmPC updates are based on the final results of rhLAMAN-08 study, which is listed as an Annex II study in the RMP, and is a 24-month multi-centre, open-label phase II trial investigating the safety and efficacy of repeated velmanase alfa (recombinant human alpha- mannosidase) treatment in paediatric patients <6 years if age with alpha-mannosidosis, The Package Leaflet is being update accordingly. The RMPv8.1 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with QRD template v10.1 and v10.2. | 16/09/2021   | 03/11/2021 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Based on the final results of rhLAMAN-08 study, which was a 24-month open-label phase II trial investigating the safety and efficacy of repeated velmanase alfa treatment in paediatric patients below 6 years of age with alpha- mannosidosis, SmPC sections 4.4, 4,8 and 5.1 are being updated to amend an existing warning on immunogenicity, update the summary of the safety profile and add cyanosis as an ADR with frequency 'common', and update the pharmacodynamic properties in children below 6 years of age.
