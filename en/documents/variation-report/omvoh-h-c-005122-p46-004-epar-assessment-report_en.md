## 1. Introduction

On 16/02/2024, the MAH submitted a final clinical study report (CSR) for a completed paediatric study for mirikizumab, I6T-MC-AMBU, which is part of a PIP, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview statement was provided as part of this application.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Mirakizumab (Omvoh) is a humanised immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) isotype monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL-23), a naturally occurring proinflammatory cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.

On the 30/3/2023, the CHMP granted a positive opinion for mirakizumab for the indication:

Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic treatment.

The EC decision was received on 26 May 2023 and mirikizumab (Omvoh) was authorised two pharmaceutical forms:

- 300mg sterile concentrate mirikizumab for IV use after dilution
- Omvoh 100mg injection mirikizumab SC

At time of submission, the Applicant had included the EMA Decision P/0088/2022 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan.

Two indications were initially targeted within the PIP; Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns disease. For the Ulcerative Colitis indication, one of the agreed studies, was Study 7: A Multicentre, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK) study of mirikizumab in children and adolescents from 2 years to less than 18 years of age with ulcerative colitis (AMBU).

As a post-authorisation measure, the MAH has now submitted a final study report and OUS addendum for this clinical study which is part of the PIP, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended:

I6T-MC-AMBU: A Multicenter, Open-Label PK Study of Mirikizumab in Pediatric Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (AMBU).

Of note, no regulatory consequences have been identified with this submission.

The pivotal study to potentially support a future extension of indication in a paediatric population, Study I6T-MC-AMBA is currently ongoing and will be part of a future submission.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Concentrate for solution for infusion in vial and solution for injection in prefilled syringes.

The MAH confirmed the pharmaceutical formulations used in Study AMBU are the same as the OMVOH adult formulations currently authorised in the EU for treatment of UC in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Omvoh 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, each vial containing 300mg mirakizumab in 15ml solution
- Omvoh 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe, each PFS containing 100mg mirakizumab in 1 mL of solution

It is understood that Study 1 of the PIP to develop a PFS for subcutaneous use is currently deferred and that a specific paediatric formulation has thus not yet been developed.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report and OUS addendum for:

- Study I6T-MC-AMBU: A Multicenter, Open-Label PK Study of Mirikizumab in Pediatric Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## I6T-MC-AMBU: A Multicenter, Open-Label PK Study of Mirikizumab in Pediatric Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (SHINE-1/ Study AMBU)

## Description

Study AMBU, also known as SHINE-1, was a Phase 2 open label multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical response to mirikizumab and to establish the induction and maintenance doses to evaluate in Phase 3 in children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis aged 2 to less than 18 years.

Study AMBU was also conducted to comply with a requirement from the European Union pediatric investigational plan (Study 7 in EMEA-002208-PIP01-17-M02 from 11 March 2022).

This study was conducted at 19 centers that screened participants in Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and United States.

The study was initiated in May 2020 and completed in March 2023. The analyses in the final study report are based on a database lock of 25 April 2023.

Study AMBU included 12 weeks of open-label IV treatment with mirikizumab (induction period), followed by:

· 40-week open-label SC treatment with mirikizumab (maintenance period) to evaluate long-term safety and durability of clinical response and remission in participants who achieved clinical response at Week 12, or

· extended induction period (12 additional weeks of IV treatment for participants who did not achieve response at Week 12) to explore the effect of additional IV dosing on clinical response at Week 24.

Participants were also eligible for rescue treatment with mirikizumab for LOR once in the maintenance period between Weeks 16 and 40.

Approximately 60 participants with moderately to severely active UC were planned to be screened to enroll approximately 30 participants in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Upon completion of the maintenance period (Week 52), participants who achieved clinical benefit were offered continued treatment in a separate 3-year long-term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAZ (AMAZ). Participants who did not meet enrollment criteria for Study AMAZ or chose not to continue into Study AMAZ entered the post-treatment follow-up period (12 weeks following SC administration or 16 weeks following IV administration).

The study population included pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC, who had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or were intolerant to nonbiologic therapy for UC (biologicnaive), and/or those who had been exposed to at least 1 biologic and/or JAK inhibitor therapy for UC (biologic/ JAK inhibitor-experienced).

At Weeks 0, 4 and 8 participants received a mirikizumab IV infusion induction dose.

Participants weighing:

- &gt;40 kg received 300 mg, and
- ≤40 kg received 5 or 10 mg/kg.

Participants who met the clinical response criteria at Week 12 received SC maintenance doses via PFS (100 mg/mL) from Weeks 12 to 48:

- &gt;40 kg received 200 mg Q4W as two 1-mL PFS injections
- &gt;20 kg to ≤40 kg received 100 mg Q4W

o at the start of the study, as two 0.5 mL injections using two 1-mL PFSs, carefully expelling the entire contents of each PFS into a sterile, pre-sealed empty glass vial, attaching a 21G needle, and withdrawing 0.5 mL of solution from the vial and injecting using a 27G needle, or o beginning with amendment (c), as one 1-mL PFS injection.

- ≤20 kg received 50 mg Q4W

o as one 1-mL PFS, carefully expelling the entire contents of the syringe into a sterile, presealed empty glass vial, attaching a 21G needle, and withdrawing 0.5 mL of solution from the vial and injecting using a 27G needle.

Participants who did not achieve clinical response at Week 12 either received extended induction treatment or were discontinued.

In cases where there was no higher dose, participants could receive extended induction dosing at the current dose.

The 12-week IV dosing induction period was chosen in order to allow sufficient time for participants to achieve clinical remission and endoscopic healing. The 40-week maintenance period enabled the evaluation of continued maintenance of clinical benefit. The timing of the induction and maintenance endpoints was chosen based on characterization of the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab through 52 weeks of continuous treatment in Study I6T-MC-AMAC (AMAC) (Phase 2, placebo controlled, doubleblind adult clinical trial of mirikizumab in moderately to severely active UC), as well as consistency with the timing of the induction and maintenance endpoints of the ongoing Phase 3 adult program Studies I6T-MC-AMAN (AMAN) and I6T-MC-AMBG (AMBG).

## Methods

## Assessor comments

For subjects weighing &gt;20kg and &lt;/= 40kg eligible to receive 100mg SC, initially they received two 0.5 mL injections using two 1-mL PFS, withdrawing 0.5 mL from each vial, but that beginning with amendment c in October 2021, they instead received one injection of a 1 mL PFS. The amendment was prompted by study site feedback indicating that injecting 1 mL SC in participants weighing 20 kg to ≤40 kg was acceptable and, importantly, avoided 2 injections in a child. Therefore, the maximum volume limitation was removed. Three participants receiving 100 mg SC during the maintenance period were dosed with two 0.5 mL injections (prior to amendment c), and 9 participants were dosed with one 1 mL prefilled syringe after the amendment.

## Assessor comments

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the PK of mirikizumab treatment in pediatric participants. The PK of mirikizumab following induction and maintenance treatment was characterized using a population PK approach. Potential impact of participant factors on the PK of mirikizumab was evaluated. The relationship between key efficacy responses and mirikizumab exposure was also explored.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study included a large number of efficacy-related secondary objectives and endpoints, focused on clinical remission and responses (MMS, PUCAI), symptomatic and endoscopic remission and response amongst others.

The study objectives and endpoints are considered standard and acceptable for a Phase 2 study with intent to assess mirikizumab and establish dosing for Phase 3 in children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis.

## Sample size

According to the PIP at least 25 subjects were required to be evaluable for the primary analysis.

Approximately 60 participants with moderately to severely active UC were planned to be screened to enroll approximately 30 participants in the study.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical Methods

No multiplicity adjustments were made due to the nature of the open-label study with no comparison arm or formal statistical hypothesis tests.

Additional analyses were conducted using the mITT population for secondary endpoints in the subgroup of previous biologic therapy failure status. The 2 categories are 'biologic failed,' and 'biologic not failed.' The 'biologic not failed' category includes

- biologic naive participants, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- participants who may have started and discontinued a biologic but did not fail or lose response to the biologic.

## Results

## Participant flow

This study was conducted at 19 centers that screened 49 participants in Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and United States and enrolled 26 participants in Israel, Japan, South Korea and the United States.

Of 23 participants that had screen failure, 5 were later rescreened and met all eligibility criteria to be able to enrol in the study. At the time of their initial screening, 3 of these participants did not have moderately to severely active UC as defined by an MMS of 4 to 9 with ES ≥2. The other 2 of the 5 participants had Clostridium difficile or tested positive for Clostridium difficile or other intestinal pathogens within 30 days of the screening endoscopy in the initial screening period. The remaining 18 of the 23 screen failures did not meet the eligibility criteria or consent was withdrawn prior to enrolment. The reasons for their screen failure are provided:

## Screening Period

The screening period occurred less than or equal to 28 days prior to the start of study drug. A total of 49 participants entered the study; among which 23 failed screening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Induction Period

The remaining 26 participants were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups based on current body weight. All participants completed the Week 12 Induction Period.

## Maintenance Period

All participants who achieved a MMS clinical response at Week 12 or Week 24 (non-responders at Week 12 who received extended IV induction dosing for 12 more weeks) were eligible for the Maintenance Period.

All 26 participants entered the maintenance period and were assigned to 1 of 3 mirikizumab SC treatment groups based on current body weight.

Nineteen of the 26 (73.1%) participants completed the Week 52 maintenance period and 7 (26.9%) participants discontinued the study treatment.

A total of 13 (50.0%) participants reported important protocol deviations during the study. The most frequent protocol deviations were related to:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study procedures (n=6 [23.1%])
- Investigational product (n=5 [19.2%])
- Eligibility (n=3 [11.5%])
- Informed consent (n=2 [7.7%])
- Safety (n=2 [7.7%])

Study procedures violations were unique site errors including missing minimum diary entries required for MMS evaluation, use of prohibited medications and failure to verify central lab results before randomization. Investigational product violations were inclusive of pharmacy preparation dosing errors using the participants current weight at that visit versus the study design noting induction period dose weight is per baseline/Week 0 weight and maintenance period dose weight is per participants Week Visit 6/Week 12 weight.

The sponsor concluded that these deviations did not impact the efficacy or safety results of the study in a clinically meaningful manner as the procedures were without specific trends and the dosing preparation errors were under 1.5× or matching the highest dose per treatment arm.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted from 18 May 2020 until 15 March 2023. Participants were enrolled in 4 countries:

- United States (n=17, 65.4%)
- Korea, Republic of (n=4, 15.4%)
- Japan (n=4, 15.4%), and
- Israel (n=1, 3.8%).

## Assessor comments

All subjects were enrolled at sites outside of the EU. 49 subjects were screened of which there were 23 screen failures. The majority of these were due to not meeting specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 26 subjects were enrolled in the study.

19 subjects (73.1%) completed the Week 52 maintenance period and 7 (26.9%) subjects discontinued the study treatment. 5 subjects discontinued due to lack of efficacy, 1 subject for an adverse event and for 1 subject it was reported as withdrawal by parent or guardian.

All the subjects (N = 26) were compliant to the study treatment, meaning they had at least 80% treatment compliant visits (i.e., received planned infusion/SC doses) before treatment discontinuation.

13 subjects (50%) had &gt;/=1 important protocol deviation. It is noted 5 subjects (19.2%) had a dosing error. The sponsor concluded this did not impact study results in a clinically meaningful manner.

For some of the other deviations, e.g. not obtaining informed consent, not reporting SAEs within 24 hours, the MAH confirmed that site education and training were provided to address these issues and their occurrence in future studies

## Pharmacokinetic results

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the PK of mirikizumab treatment in pediatric participants .

As provided in Protocol AMBU Section 5.5. Justification of Dose, dose regimens, and weight categories are based on analyses of

- [ ]  PK

- [ ]  exposure-response, and

- [ ]  safety data from the Phase 2 adult Study I6T-MC-AMAC (AMAC) in participants with UC.

Based on adult data from Study AMAC, paediatric participants with a body weight greater than 40 kg were expected to have comparable PK to adults, and therefore, evaluation of an IV dose of 300 mg was planned for the Induction Period dose in participants with body weight greater than 40 kg.

For paediatric participants less than or equal to 40 kg, participants were expected to provide comparable systemic exposures to Study AMAC and Phase 3 Studies I6T-MC-AMAN (AMAN) and I6T- MC-AMBG (AMBG), where

- [ ]  5 mg/kg IV was planned for the Induction Period dose, and

- [ ]  10 mg/kg IV was evaluated as dosing comparable to a 600 mg IV dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These doses were not expected to produce exposures higher than those evaluated in adults in Study AMAC. The dose regimens selected for the Maintenance Period were expected to provide comparable maintenance exposures to the 200 mg SC Q4W regimen in Study AMAC, which was subsequently evaluated in the Phase 3 adult Study AMBG.

## Population PK Model Development

A previously developed 2-compartment model with first-order absorption based on data from the adult Studies AMAN and AMBG with allometric relationship incorporated for clearance and volume of distribution was used for PK modelling for AMBU. The use of fixed versus estimated exponent was considered. The population PK model with fixed allometric scaling of 0.8 for clearance and 1.0 for volume of distribution was selected as the Final Base Model as shown in PK Insert 1 in Appendix 2.

After the Final Base Model was selected, a covariate search using Stepwise Covariate Modelling approach was conducted for relevant covariates included in the Population PK Analysis Plan of Study AMBU. The key covariate selection criteria are described in the analysis plan.

The only covariate identified during the Stepwise Covariate Modelling step was time-varying serum albumin effect on clearance. The effect size of population PK model-estimated clearance versus albumin concentration was described in Figure AMBU.5.3. of the Study AMBU CSR (See below).

## Summary of Population PK Analyses

A total of 232 serum mirikizumab concentration samples collected from 26 participants in induction and maintenance periods were included in the PK analysis. These concentration data were analyzed using population PK methods. A previously developed 2-compartment model with first-order absorption for the SC maintenance doses based on data from the adult Phase 3 studies (AMAN and AMBG) with allometric relationship incorporated for clearance and volume (central and peripheral volume) parameters was applied to the PK data in this study. Exponents of 0.8 for clearance and 1 for volume of distribution were used in the model to account for the weight effect.

A total of 6 samples (2.59%) were below the lower limit of quantification of the mirikizumab assay (0.1 μ g/mL). Excluding these samples was compared to standard imputation or conditional estimation methods in the PK modeling, and no impact on the estimated PK parameters was noted, so the final analysis excluded the samples. The estimated PK parameters are shown in Table AMBU.5.74.

The model estimated systemic clearance and subcutaneous bioavailability of mirikizumab was 0.0209 L/hr and 49.8%, respectively. These results were consistent with the adult UC Phase 2 Study AMAC and UC Phase 3 Studies AMAN and AMBG. The estimated systemic volume of distribution of mirikizumab was 0.069 L/kg, which was also consistent with the adult UC Phase 2 and 3 studies.

The population PK model was used to evaluate the impact of the following covariates: age, gender, BMI, body weight, ethnic origin, baseline albumin, time-varying albumin, baseline CRP, time-varying CRP, baseline fecal calprotectin, time-varying fecal calprotectin, baseline MMS, concomitant corticosteroid or immunomodulator use at baseline, prior biologic status, and immunogenicity (ADA+/-, TE-ADA+/-, ADA titer, neutralizing ADA+/-). Because weight was incorporated in the model structure, with the assumed allometric relationship, the only other factor that was found to have a statistically significant impact was time-varying albumin on clearance.

Participants with a lower albumin level tended to have higher apparent clearance (Figure AMBU.5.3). Although albumin had a statistically significant relationship with clearance, the magnitude of the model-estimated typical change in clearance for a participant with an albumin level of 30 g/L was only 33% higher than for a participant with an albumin level at the observed baseline median of 45 g/L, which is a small difference relative to the overall variation in clearance across participants. Including albumin in the population PK model reduced the estimated between-participant random variability in clearance only by 5% (41.9% to 37.1% inter-individual variability in CL). These results indicate that albumin didn't have a clinically relevant impact on the clearance of mirikizumab.

## Assessor comments

Full details on the PopPK model and its parameters were not provided in the originally submitted dossier and additional information was requested. The MAH subsequently submitted additional information including Control Stream and Summary of the NONMEM Output for the base and final models,, the covariate analysis and goodness-of-fit plots for the final model. The methods used for model development are acceptable. The provided goodness-of-fit plots suggest that the model describes the data reasonably well. Visual predictive checks of the final model were not provided. Therefore, the predictive performance of the model could not be assessed.

The MAH also confirmed that the same bioanalytical methods were used as in the adult studies AMAN and AMBG.

A summary of the provided pharmacokinetic results as presented in the CSR is outlined below.

Subject samples for mirikizumab concentration were collected at defined time points in both the induction and maintenance phases. In induction, the first sample was collected within 2 hours of completion of the first dose, and subsequent samples were collected at 4, 8, or 12 weeks prior to dose and represent Ctrough. At Week 8, a sample was also collected within 2 hours of completion of the dose and was considered a Cmax. In maintenance, samples were collected at Weeks 16, 24, 36, and 52 prior to dose administration and represent trough concentrations.

A PK model was developed using the 232 serum mirikizumab concentration samples collected from 26 participants in induction and maintenance periods. A previously developed 2-compartment model with first-order absorption for the SC maintenance doses based on data from the adult Phase 3 studies (AMAN and AMBG) with allometric relationship incorporated for clearance and volume (central and peripheral volume) parameters was applied to the paediatric PK data from this study

AMBU. Exponents of 0.8 for clearance and 1 for volume of distribution were used in the model to account for the weight effect.

Acknowledging the low number of subjects in each group, AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, Cavg values at steady state were almost twice as high in the 10mg/kg IV induction dose in 20-40kg group. The clinical relevance of this was not discussed in the report. The selected doses were expected to provide comparable exposure to adults. For paediatric participants less than or equal to 40 kg, participants were expected to provide comparable systemic exposures to Study AMAC and Phase 3 Studies I6T-MC-AMAN (AMAN) and I6T-MC-AMBG (AMBG), where

- [ ]  5 mg/kg IV was planned for the Induction Period dose, and

- [ ]  10 mg/kg IV was evaluated as dosing comparable to a 600 mg IV dose. The induction dose authorised in adults is 300mg by intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 4 and 8. Therefore the higher observed values at the 10mg/kg IV dose which would be comparable to the 600mg IV dose in adults is understood.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

## Observed Exposure-Response Relationships in Study AMBU for the Induction Period

Due to the narrow exposure range evaluated in this study, model-based analysis for the exposure/response (E/R) relationship was not conducted. The E/R relationship was explored using the observed efficacy endpoints and PK model estimated exposure parameters.

The relationship between the change from baseline value of MMS at Week 12 versus average mirikizumab concentration (Cavg) during induction is summarized in Figure AMBU.5.4. Mirikizumab induction treatment appeared to result in a decrease in MMS score from baseline and reached plateau at an average concentration around 40 ug/mL.

The E/R relationships between the binary clinical efficacy endpoints are shown in Figure AMBU.5.5 and Figure AMBU.5.6. These figures show the Week 12 clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic response achieved relative to Cavg during the induction period. The Cavg values for individual participants were divided into Cavg quartiles and the efficacy rates were summarized for each quartile. No clear pattern was identified in these figures. The observations for the binary efficacy endpoints should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small sample size.

## Observed Exposure-Response Relationships in Study AMBU for the Maintenance Period

The E/R relationship between the change in MMS following the 40-week maintenance period versus Cavg is summarized for all pediatric participants who completed the Week 52 MMS assessment in Figure AMBU.5.7. No trend for greater decreases in the change in MMS with increasing exposure was observed.

The E/R relationships between the binary clinical efficacy endpoints were assessed and are shown in Figure AMBU.5.8 and Figure AMBU.5.9. These figures show the Week 52 clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic response achieved relative to Cavg during the maintenance period. No clear E/R relationship was observed for any of these efficacy endpoints.

## Assessor comments

Given the narrow exposure range evaluated in this study, model-based analysis for the exposure/response (E/R) relationship was not conducted and instead the E/R relationship was explored using observed efficacy endpoints and PK model estimated exposure parameters.

Full assessment of the PK/PD endpoints will be conducted following submission of the outstanding documents.

Acknowledging the low number of subjects enrolled, no clear E/R relationship was observed for mirikizumab in paediatric subjects with UC.

## Pharmacokinetics Conclusions

The model estimated systemic clearance and subcutaneous bioavailability of mirikizumab was 0.0209 L/hr and 49.8%, respectively. These results were consistent with the adult UC Phase 2 Study AMAC and UC Phase 3 Studies AMAN and AMBG. The estimated systemic volume of distribution of mirikizumab was 0.069 L/kg, which was also consistent with the adult UC Phase 2 and 3 studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The only factor, in addition to weight, found to have a statistically significant impact on mirikizumab PK was serum albumin concentration. However, the magnitude of the impact was not considered clinically meaningful.

ADA was not identified to be a significant covariate on the PK of mirikizumab based on the population PK analysis.

The PK exposure estimates of mirikizumab were consistent between 300 mg induction for the &gt;40 kg group and 5 mg/kg induction for the &lt;40 kg group. They were also consistent in all weight groups for the maintenance treatment. These support the dosing strategy of weight group divided treatment of pediatric participants with UC.

## Assessor comments

Overall, it is agreed that the exposure estimates appeared similar between the weight-based 5mg/kg mirikizumab IV and fixed dose 300mg mirikizumab IV in induction. The MAH confirmed that the Study AMBU 5 mg/kg mirikizumab IV Q4W dosing regimen was selected for use in Phase 3 for participants weighing less than or equal to 40 kg in

- [ ]  Study I6T-MC-AMBA (AMBA) as induction dosing, and

- [ ]  Long-term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAZ (AMAZ) ISA #1 as rescue dosing.

In Studies AMBA and AMAZ ISA #1, a 300 mg mirikizumab IV Q4W dosing regimen is used for participants weighing more than 40 kg for induction and rescue dosing, respectively.

## Efficacy results

## Compliance with Intervention

Overall compliance with therapy is defined as having at least 80% treatment compliant visits (i.e., received planned infusion/SC doses as per eCRF) before treatment discontinuation. All the participants (N = 26) were compliant to the study treatment.

## Efficacy endpoints

Efficacy endpoints were secondary endpoints within this study. The main secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed for the induction period at Week 12 and for the maintenance period at Week 52.

For each of these endpoints, subgroup analysis by biologic failed and biologic not failed status was performed.

## Results following induction at Week 12

During the Induction Period, participants received the following at Week 0, 4, and 8:

- Participants weighing &gt;40 kg (300 mg mirikizumab IV)
- Participants weighing ≤40 kg (5 or 10 mg/kg mirikizumab IV).

PUCAI : The PUCAI is a 6-dimensional non-invasive tool, rating the severity of the following symptoms/disease characteristics of UC in children: abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, stool frequency, nocturnal stools, and assessment of limitations of activity of the patient. The sum of the score ranges from 0-85. The established cut-off scores for the PUCAI defined severity stages (&lt;10 points=remission; 10-34 mild disease; 3564 moderate disease; ≥65 severe disease). A reduction in PUCAI baseline score of &gt;/=20 points was considered Clinical Response. PUCAI clinical remission is defined as a PUCAI score of &lt;10 points.

## Assessor comments

The proportion of subjects in symptomatic remission increased from baseline at Weeks 2, 4 and 8. At week 8, 12 subjects (46.2%) were in symptomatic remission which remained stable at Week 12. The proportion in symptomatic remission at Week 12 was higher in the biologic not failed group.

## 8. Histologic- Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement at Week 12

HEMI was not a protocol-defined endpoint for this study, however, the endpoint was included in the SAP. HEMI was reported in the adult program and is also clinically relevant for pediatric gastroenterologists. The NRI analysis showed 4 (15.4%) participants achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement at Week 12, three (17.6%) participants in the biologic failed and only 1 (11.1%) participant in the not failed subgroup.

## Assessor comments

At 52 weeks, 13 subjects (50%) achieved PUCAI clinical remission at Week 52, with a higher proportion in the biologic not failed subgroup.

Of the 10 subjects who achieved PUCAI clinical remission at Week 12 (PUCAI induction remitters), 8 subject achieved PUCAI clinical remission also at Week 52, again with higher proportion in the biologic not failed.

Of the 20 subjects who achieved PUCAI clinical response at Week 12 (PUCAI induction responders), 13 subjects achieved PUCAI clinical remission also at Week 52, again with higher proportion in the biologic not failed.

## 2. PUCAI Clinical Response

The NRI analysis showed a total of 14 (53.8%) participants achieved PUCAI clinical response at Week 52.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

Study AMBU predetermined the following topics as AESIs:

- hepatic safety
- infections, including opportunistic infections and serious infections
- hypersensitivity
- infusion/injection site reaction
- cerebro-cardiovascular and peripheral vascular events
- malignancies
- suicidal ideation/behaviour and depression

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- immunogenicity

## Hepatic safety

For the induction period and the combined induction and maintenance periods, the frequency of participants reporting treatment-emergent hepatic disorders SMQ (narrow terms) was 3.8% (n=1). The specified SMQ was liver related investigations, signs and sympt oms.  One participant in the ≤40 kg 5 mg/kg treatment group reported TEAEs of increased ALT and increased AST in the Induction Period, based on local and central laboratory results. The ALT and AST elevations did not reach ≥3 × ULN and were not reported as an SAE. Study drug was not changed and the participant enrolled into the longterm extension study.

No cases meeting hepatocellular or cholestatic drug-induced liver injury criteria have been reported.

## Infections, including opportunistic infections and serious infections

The frequency of participants reporting treatment-emergent infections during the induction period was 3.8% (n=1). No opportunistic infections were reported. No infection SAEs were reported.

All infection TEAEs that occurred during the combined induction and maintenance periods were mild or moderate in severity. The frequency of participants reporting treatment-emergent infections was 65.4% (n=17). The most frequently reported infections were COVID-19 (23.1%, n=6) and Viral upper respiratory infection (15.4%, n=4). No opportunistic infections were reported. No serious infections were reported.

## Hypersensitivity

The frequencies of participants reporting immediate hypersensitivity reactions (broad and narrow terms) during the induction period was 3.8% (n=1).

An Infusion related reaction (narrow term) was initially reported for 1 participant in the &gt;40 kg 300 mg/kg treatment group, but follow up from the site clarified that this event was not a true hypersensitivity reaction.

There were no reports of immediate anaphylactic reaction or immediate angioedema.

There were no additional reports of hypersensitivity during the combined induction and maintenance periods. There were no reports of immediate anaphylactic reaction or immediate angioedema.

## Infusion/injection site reaction

The frequency of participants who reported at least 1 infusion site reaction (HLT) during the induction period was 3.8% (n=1).

The frequency of participants who reported at least 1 injection site reaction (HLT) during the maintenance period was 34.6% (n=9). The most frequently reported was Injection site pain (23.1% [n=6]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other AESIs

In the induction period and the combined induction and maintenance periods, no reports were identified for cerebro-cardiovascular events, major adverse cardiovascular events, or venous thromboembolic events, malignancies, or depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour.

## Assessor comments

Overall, the drug was well tolerated in the paediatric population enrolled to this study.

## Immunogenicity results

## Development of ADA

Of the 26 evaluable participants, 3 (11.5%) mirikizumab-treated participants had treatment-emergent ADA detected postbaseline. Of these, all 3 (11.5%) participants had neutralizing antibodies detected (Table AMBU.5.76). The data showed no meaningful differences in immunogenicity between the treatment groups.

TableAMBU.5.76. Summaryof TE-ADA andNAb

Abbreviations: ADA = anti-drug antibody; NAb = neutralizing antibodies; TE = treatment emergent. Source: Table AMBU.8.143.

- A baseline sample for one study participant was taken post-dosing and had very high drug level, making the ADA result inconclusive. All subsequent samples were negative for this participant; therefore this participant is considered to be TE ADA negative

## Analyses of TE-ADA on PK

Based on the PopPK analysis, ADA was not identified as a significant covariate on the clearance of mirikizumab.

During the induction period, TE-ADA had a minimal impact on mirikizumab concentration. One participant who developed TE-ADA with a titer of 1:160 at Week 12 appeared to have a slight decrease in mirikizumab concentration at Week 12. In the maintenance period, visual assessment of the mirikizumab concentration for participants with TE-ADA did not reveal any effect of TE-ADA on mirikizumab concentration.

## Analyses of TE-ADA on Efficacy

No association of TE-ADA status with reduced efficacy (MMS Clinical remission status) was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analyses of TE-ADA on Safety

Two of the 3 TE-ADA positive participants experienced either an infusion site reaction and/or an injection site reaction. However, in both cases the reactions occurred prior to the development of the TE-ADA. Further, 7 of the 9 participants that experienced injection-site reactions did not develop TEADA at any time. Based on this, no apparent association was observed between select AEs (infusionsite reactions, infusion -related reactions, and hypersensitivity events) and TE-ADA status.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

Among the mirikizumab treated participants, treatment-emergent abnormal values were noted in fewer than 2 participants in the following serum or whole blood analytes: sodium, chloride, potassium, protein, direct bilirubin, AST, Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urate, haemoglobin, erythrocytes, neutrophils (absolute), basophils, platelets, faecal calprotectin, and CRP.

Treatment emergent abnormal low laboratory values in 2 or more participants were observed for the following serum or whole blood analytes:  bicarbonate (n = 11), bilirubin (n=5), calcium(n = 3), ALP (n = 2), ALT (n = 2), glucose (n = 4 non-fasting and 2 fasting), cholesterol (n = 3), haematocrit (n = 3), mean red cell volume (n = 7), mean hemoglobin concentration (n = 3), leukocytes (n = 8), lymphocytes (n = 4), and monocytes (n = 6).

Treatment emergent abnormal high laboratory values in 2 or more participants were observed for the following serum or whole blood analytes:  ALP (n = 2), ALT (n = 2), calcium (n = 2), albumin (n = 11), creatine kinase (n = 5), haematocrit (n = 2), leukocytes (n = 2), eosinophils(n = 6) and CRP (n=3).

One participant reported elevated ALT and AST as TEAEs. The AST elevation was not associated with an elevated central lab value or flag listed above, the site reported it based on a local lab value. None of the other laboratory changes from baseline were reported as TEAEs.

Of the 26 enrolled participants, 8 (30.7%) presented low bicarbonate values at screening or baseline. Postbaseline, 11 (42.3%) participants presented treatment emergent bicarbonate shifts to low. Majority of the observed shifts to low were very mild and not clinically meaningful. This shifts to low were observed sporadically and there was no consistent trend to low along the 52-weeks of the treatment period.

## Vital Signs

Treatment emergent vital sign changes during the Induction and Maintenance Period were not meaningful and were consistent with the overall safety profile of mirikizumab to date.

## Height

Participants in the ≤40 kg weight class that received the 5 mg/kg induction dose showed an increase in height percentile and height z-score change at Week 24 that continued to increase at Week 52, indicating growth moving towards the mean of a normal population. Participants in the 10 mg/kg and 300 mg induction dose groups showed more variability and small changes over the treatment period indicating these participants maintained growth at a rate consistent with their baseline percentile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Weight

Participants in the ≤40 kg weight class showed an increase in weight percentile and weight z -score change at Week 24 that continued to increase at Week 52, indicating participants gained weight generally increasing in percentile moving towards the mean of a normal population. Participants in the &gt;40kg weight class showed a weight percentile increase at Week 12, however at Week 24 and Week 52 this increase in mean weight percentile was not maintained indicating these participants as a group maintained a growth rate consistent with their baseline percentile

Overall, all female groups and male participants in the ≤40 kg group who received the 5 mg/kg induction dose gained weight starting at Week 4 which continued through the treatment period. Male participants in the &gt;40kg weight group maintained their baseline weight or showed slight reductions at the group level through Week 24 but showed an increase from baseline by Week 52. The slight reductions in the group means were likely due to weight loss experienced by 1 participant (  ) who discontinued the study due to disease flare.

## Hormone levels

Hormone levels were collected at baseline, Weeks 12, 36 and 52 in study participants who had not reached puberty in an effort to evaluate pubertal development. Given the low numbers of female participants who had not reached puberty (n=5) and variability of the data, no conclusions can be drawn on female pubertal development.

Testosterone data was collected in 8 male participants. Throughout the study, testosterone levels increased over time except for 2 participants in 10 mg/kg dose group, where levels remained undetectable at baseline and throughout the treatment period.

## Assessor comments

3 participants developed ADAs during the clinical trial. The applicant states that there were no associations seen between the emergence of TE-ADAs and any PK, efficacy, or safety outcome. While this can be accepted, it is noted that the small numbers enrolled to this study make it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions in this regard.

No significant adverse effects were seen with regards to laboratory value changes from baseline, vital signs, height, weight, or hormone levels in treated patients.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The purpose of this submission was to comply with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, by submitting the clinical study report and OUS addendum for Study I6T-MC-AMBU .

Study AMBU, also known as SHINE-1, was a Phase 2 open label multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical response to mirikizumab and to establish the induction and maintenance doses to evaluate in Phase 3 in children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis aged 2 to less than 18 years.

Study AMBU included 12 weeks of open-label IV treatment with mirikizumab (induction period), followed by:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· 40-week open-label SC treatment with mirikizumab (maintenance period) to evaluate long-term safety and durability of clinical response and remission in participants who achieved clinical response at Week 12, or

· extended induction period (12 additional weeks of IV treatment for participants who did not achieve response at Week 12) to explore the effect of additional IV dosing on clinical response at Week 24.

Participants were also eligible for rescue treatment with mirikizumab for LOR once in the maintenance period between Weeks 16 and 40.

Approximately 60 participants with moderately to severely active UC were planned to be screened to enroll approximately 30 participants in the study.

Upon completion of the maintenance period (Week 52), participants who achieved clinical benefit were offered continued treatment in a separate 3-year long-term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAZ (AMAZ). Participants who did not meet enrollment criteria for Study AMAZ or chose not to continue into Study AMAZ entered the post-treatment follow-up period (12 weeks following SC administration or 16 weeks following IV administration).

The study population included paediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC, who had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or were intolerant to nonbiologic therapy for UC (biologic-naive), and/or those who had been exposed to at least 1 biologic and/or JAK inhibitor therapy for UC (biologic/ JAK inhibitor-experienced).

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the PK of mirikizumab treatment in paediatric participants. The PK of mirikizumab following induction and maintenance treatment was characterized using a population PK approach. Potential impact of participant factors on the PK of mirikizumab was evaluated. The relationship between key efficacy responses and mirikizumab exposure was also explored. The study included a large number of efficacies related secondary objectives and endpoints, focused on clinical remission and responses (MMS, PUCAI), symptomatic and endoscopic remission and response amongst others. Clinical safety and immunogenicity were also evaluated. The study objectives and endpoints are considered standard and acceptable for a Phase 2 study with intent to assess mirikizumab and establish dosing for Phase 3 in children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis. Due to the nature of the open label single arm study, no formal statistical testing was performed.

This study was conducted at 19 centers, that enrolled 26 participants in Israel, Japan, South Korea and the United States. Participants were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups based on current body weight. All 26 participants completed the Week 12 Induction Period.

All participants who achieved a MMS clinical response at Week 12 or Week 24 (non-responders at Week 12 who received extended IV induction dosing for 12 more weeks) were eligible for the Maintenance Period. All 26 participants entered the maintenance period and were assigned to 1 of 3 mirikizumab SC treatment groups based on current body weight. Nineteen of the 26 (73.1%) participants completed the Week 52 maintenance period and 7 (26.9%) participants discontinued the study treatment. 15 (57%) of subjects were female and mean age of subjects was 11.8 years. All subjects had received at least one prior treatment for UC, and 17 (65.4%) had prior biologic exposure.

The primary objective was to evaluate the PK of mirikizumab treatment in paediatric patients. Full details on the PopPK model and its parameters were not provided in the submitted dossier, and additional information was requested. The MAH subsequently submitted additional information including Control Stream and Summary of the NONMEM Output for the base and final models, the covariate analysis and goodness-of-fit plots for the final model. The methods used for model development are acceptable. The provided goodness-of-fit plots suggest that the model describes the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data reasonably well. Visual predictive checks of the final model were not provided. Therefore, the predictive performance of the model could not be assessed.

Only a summary of the provided pharmacokinetic results as presented in the CSR are thus outlined. A PK model was developed using the 232 serum mirikizumab concentration samples collected from 26 participants in induction and maintenance periods. A previously developed 2-compartment model with first-order absorption for the SC maintenance doses based on data from the adult Phase 3 studies (AMAN and AMBG) with allometric relationship incorporated for clearance and volume (central and peripheral volume) parameters was applied to the paediatric PK data from this study AMBU. Exponents of 0.8 for clearance and 1 for volume of distribution were used in the model to account for the weight effect. The MAH concluded that the model-estimated systemic clearance and subcutaneous bioavailability was consistent with the adult UC Phase 2 study AMAC and UC Phase 3 Studies AMAN and AMBG, and that albumin despite having a statistically significant impact on mirikizumab PK was not considered clinically meaningful. The MAH also concluded that the PK exposure estimates support the dosing strategy of weight group divided treatment of paediatric participants with UC. As stated, further information is required to evaluate the MAH conclusions regarding PK. Overall, however it is agreed that the exposure estimates appeared similar between the weight-based 5mg/kg mirikizumab IV and fixed dose 300mg mirikizumab IV in induction. The MAH confirmed thatthe 5 mg/kg mirikizumab IV Q4W dosing regimen was selected for use in Phase 3 for participants weighing less than or equal to 40 kg in

- [ ]  Study I6T-MC-AMBA (AMBA) as induction dosing, and

- [ ]  Long-term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAZ (AMAZ) ISA #1 as rescue dosingThe MAH evaluated a large number of secondary efficacy endpoints, including PUCAI, MMS, endoscopic and symptomatic remission. In general, the results showed demonstration of improvement across these endpoints for a proportion of subjects at Week 12 following induction and at Week 52 maintenance. At Week 52, 13 subject (50%) achieved PUCAI clinical remission, 14 subjects (53.8%) achieved PUCAI clinical response, 10 subjects (38.5%) achieved clinical remission on MMS and 14 subjects (53.8%) achieved clinical response on MMS. Thus, the efficacy results support further evaluation of mirikizumab in a randomized setting in a paediatric population with ulcerative colitis.

The medicine was generally well tolerated in the paediatric population. No significant immunogenicity was seen in the trial.

## 5. MAH Response to request for supplementary information

## Question 1

A critical expert overview statement should be provided as part of an application under Article 46. Please provide a short critical expert overview.

## MAH Response

Lilly has provided a short critical expert overview along with this response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of MAH Response

The MAH has now provided the critical expert overview as requested.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 2

The Applicant should confirm the two pharmaceutical formulations used in this study were the approved adult formulations.

## MAH Response

Lilly confirms that the 2 pharmaceutical formulations used in Study AMBU, are the same as the OMVOH adult formulations currently authorized by the EMA for the treatment of UC (EMA product number EMEA/H/C/005122, marketing authorization issued 26 May 2023).

## Assessment of MAH Response

The applicant has confirmed that the formulations used in the study are the same as the adult formulations currently authorized by the EMA for the treatment of UC.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved

## Question 3

The rationale for the original dosing and subsequent change for subjects &gt;20kg and &lt;/=40kg should be provided. In addition, the number of subjects who were dosed prior to and post amendment c should be provided.

## MAH Response

Protocol AMBU, AMBU(a), and AMBU(b) Section 7.1 contained the language: Subcutaneous administration of mirikizumab will be given in not more than 2 injections (maximum volume is 1 mL per injection for patients &gt;40 kg and 0.5 mL for patients ≤40 kg).

The primary purpose of Protocol AMBU(c) was to modify dosing instructions for the ≥20 -40 kg participants during the maintenance period. Amendment (c) meant that each participant would receive 1 injection of a 1 mL prefilled syringe instead of two 0.5 mL injections for SC maintenance dosing. In both cases, the total dose was 100 mg of mirikizumab.

The amendment was prompted by study site feedback indicating that injecting 1 mL SC in participants weighing 20 kg to ≤40 kg was acceptable and, importantly, avoided 2 injections in a child. Therefore, the maximum volume limitation was removed.

Three participants receiving 100 mg SC during the maintenance period were dosed with two 0.5 mL injections (prior to amendment c), and 9 participants were dosed with one 1 mL prefilled syringe after the amendment.

## Assessment of MAH Response

The response of the applicant is acceptable. The Applicant clarified that the amendment to change the dosing from two 0.5 mL SC injections to one 1.0 mL SC injection was prompted by study site feedback that injecting 1 mL volume SC was acceptable to subjects weighing 20 kg to &lt;/=40kg, avoiding two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

injections in a child. This rationale is understood.  The Applicant also clarified 3 participants were dosed prior to amendment c with two injections and 9 participants doses after the amendment with one 1 mL PFS.

## Question 4

Reasons for screen failure of 23 subjects should be provided.

## MAH Response

Of 23 participants that had screen failure, 5 were later rescreened and met all eligibility criteria to be able to enrol in the study. At the time of their initial screening, 3 of these participants did not have moderately to severely active UC as defined by an MMS of 4 to 9 with ES ≥2. The other 2 of the 5 participants had Clostridium difficile or tested positive for Clostridium difficile or other intestinal pathogens within 30 days of the screening endoscopy in the initial screening period. The remaining 18 of the 23 screen failures did not meet the eligibility criteria or consent was withdrawn prior to enrolment. The reasons for their screen failure are provided:

## Assessment of MAH Response

The Applicant has now provided the reason for screen failure of subjects as requested. Five patients who had initially failed at a screening visit but who subsequently met the screening criteria were included in the trial following rescreening.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 5

Considering the study objectives, the Applicant should provide additional information on the dosing errors and what impact this may have had on the PK conclusions

## MAH Response

## Induction

During the Induction Period, 4 participants were affected by dosing errors.

## Corrective actions

Site 172 was the initial dosing deviation found by the site monitor during a routine monitoring visit on 07 March 2022. The dosing issue prompted a Quality Issue assessment by the Clinical Research Organization and Lilly study teams. The actions from this Quality Issue included initiating action for the Clinical Research Associate to retrain the site staff on the dosing instructions in the latest protocol amendment. The issue also prompted the study team to update the Investigational Product Pharmacy and Preparation Instructions. The new version of the Pharmacy and Preparation Instructions was completed on 31 March 2022 and was released to all investigator sites by e-mail in early April 2022. Following the initial issue, additional dosing errors were found during routine monitoring visits of Sites 105, 107, and 180. The Clinical Research Associates were able to retrain the sites with the 31 March 2022 updated Pharmacy and Preparation Instructions along with the latest protocol amendment.

## Discussion

The largest differences in dosing errors were noted for



Participant AMBU- and

 Participant AMBU- in the Maintenance Period received 50% more than expected.



in the Induction Period received 23.9% more than expected,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Even if the participants had received the correct dose, the PK exposures would have been readily adjusted in the population PK model. Given the linear exposure changes between dose and exposures in mirikizumab, there would be no large effect on the AUCtau,ss and Cmax,ss exposure metrics that were provided in the AMBU CSR (Table AMBU.5.75).

With no large changes expected in the population PK model parameter estimates, the geometric mean estimate of 20-40 kg 5 mg/kg for the induction group 597 ug*day/mL (CV% 45%) would be largely unchanged with the 95% CI overlapping with the adult population 543 ug*day/mL (CV% 38%). Therefore, the dosing correction is unlikely to change the PK conclusion.

In addition, the exposure-matching metrics are dependent on the steady-state measure of the maintenance dosing. Therefore, the dosing error at Visit 8, which occurred earlier during the study, is unlikely to impact the exposure metrics provided in the Study AMBU CSR (Table AMBU.5.75) and has minimal impact on PK conclusions.

## Assessment of MAH Response

The MAH has provided further discussion on the dosing errors that occurred and considers that these had minimal impact on PK conclusions. In the induction period the dosing errors were due to incorrect calculation using the current visit weight rather than the baseline visit weight. The largest difference in induction was a 23.9% higher dose received. In the maintenance period, one dosing error occurred in a subject who received a 50% higher dose, 150mg instead of 100mg. In this case the reason was the investigator was looking at the incorrect study information.

The MAH highlights that given the linear exposure changes between dose and exposures in mirikizumab, there would be no large effect on the AUCtau,ss and Cmax,ss exposure metrics that were provided in the AMBU CSR based on the dosing errors. The MAH considers that as no large change is expected in population PK model parameter estimates that the geometric mean estimate of 20-50kg 5mg/kg for the induction group would be largely unchanged with the 95% CI overlapping with the adult population and therefore unlikely changing the PK conclusion.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 6

For some of the other deviations, e.g. not obtaining informed consent, not reporting SAEs within 24 hours, the MAH should confirm that site education and training were provided to address these issues and their occurrence in future studies.

## MAH Response

A Protocol Deviation Management Plan was followed which included actions to be taken for each type and category of protocol deviations. For key deviations such as informed consent violations and delays in reporting serious adverse events, site re-education was performed, and documented in the protocol deviation log. In addition to documenting the study protocol deviation logs, sites were also instructed to report the deviation to their respective Institutional Review Boards and to reconsent participants correctly at the next onsite visits.

## Assessment of MAH Response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH confirmed that site re-education was performed and documented in the protocol deviation log for above mentioned deviations.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 7

The Applicant should provide a clear summary of concomitant UC medications received during induction and maintenance.

## MAH Response

The Study AMBU CSR Section 4.5.3 states:

- [x] 'Stable doses of permitted UC concomitant medications (other than oral corticosteroids) were encouraged. Participants taking oral corticosteroids were to follow the corticosteroid taper instructions described in the protocol. Summaries of concomitant medications and therapies within class (i.e, corticosteroids, immunomodulators) for the mITT Population are provided for:

- [ ]  Induction Period (Table AMBU 8.9)

- [ ]  Combined Induction and Maintenance Periods (Table AMBU 8.10)'

A summary of concomitant UC medications received during induction and maintenance is presented in Section 5.1.2 of the critical expert overview that is provided with this response.

## Assessment of MAH Response

The MAH provide the requested summary of concomitant UC medications in the critical expert overview. The AR was updated accordingly.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 8

Full details on the PopPK model and its parameters were not provided in the submitted dossier, therefore additional information is required to enable full assessment of the primary PK objectives, the PK model and PK results. The Applicant is requested to submit the relevant data on PK/PD analyses and all referenced appendices stated to be included as per List of Appendices on Pg1535 of CSR.

## MAH Response

## Pharmacokinetics information

Lilly has also provided a response to an Other Concern that was present on Page 28 of the Assessment Report but was not included in the list of Other Concerns within Section 4 Request for supplementary information:

Acknowledging the low number of subjects in each group, AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, Cavg values at steady state were almost twice as high in the 10mg/kg IV induction dose in 20- 40kg group. The clinical relevance of this was not discussed in the report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As provided in Protocol AMBU Section 5.5. Justification of Dose, dose regimens, and weight categories are based on analyses of

- [ ]  PK

- [ ]  exposure-response, and

- [ ]  safety data from the Phase 2 adult Study I6T-MC-AMAC (AMAC) in participants with UC.

Based on adult data from Study AMAC, paediatric participants with a body weight greater than 40 kg were expected to have comparable PK to adults, and therefore, evaluation of an IV dose of 300 mg was planned for the Induction Period dose in participants with body weight greater than 40 kg.

For paediatric participants less than or equal to 40 kg, participants were expected to provide comparable systemic exposures to Study AMAC and Phase 3 Studies I6T-MC-AMAN (AMAN) and I6TMC-AMBG (AMBG), where

- [ ]  5 mg/kg IV was planned for the Induction Period dose, and

- [ ]  10 mg/kg IV was evaluated as dosing comparable to a 600 mg IV dose.

These doses were not expected to produce exposures higher than those evaluated in adults in Study AMAC. The dose regimens selected for the Maintenance Period were expected to provide comparable maintenance exposures to the 200 mg SC Q4W regimen in Study AMAC, which was subsequently evaluated in the Phase 3 adult Study AMBG.

A previously developed 2-compartment model with first-order absorption based on data from the volume of distribution was used for PK modelling for AMBU. The use of fixed versus estimated exponent was considered. The population PK model with fixed allometric scaling of 0.8 for clearance and 1.0 for volume of distribution was selected as the Final Base Model as shown in PK Insert 1 in Appendix 2.

After the Final Base Model was selected, a covariate search using Stepwise Covariate Modelling approach was conducted for relevant covariates included in the Population PK Analysis Plan of Study AMBU. The key covariate selection criteria are described in the analysis plan.

- Abbreviations: ADA = anti-drug antibody; AMBU =I6T-MC-AMBU; EFS=endoscopic finding by Mayo subscore; MMS =modified Mayo Score; PK =phanmacokinetic; RB =rectal bleeding by Mayo subscore; SF = stool frequency by Mayo subscore; TE-ADA = treatment emergent anti-dnug antibody
- Biologic failed ornot-biologic-failed

The covariates that came up during the Stepwise Covariate Modelling step were considered for manual forward addition and backward deletion. The only covariate identified was time-varying serum albumin effect on clearance, as shown in PK Insert 1 and PK Insert 2 in Appendix 2. The effect size of population PK model-estimated clearance versus albumin concentration was described in Figure AMBU.5.3. of the Study AMBU CSR.

## Assessment of Responses

The MAH provided some additional details on the covariate search in the popPK analysis, which are acceptable. The provided goodness-of-fit plots suggest that the model describes the data reasonably well. Visual predictive checks of the final model were not provided. Therefore, the predictive performance of the model could not be assessed. Study AMBU appendices were provided as requested.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 9

The MAH should confirm if the same bioanalytical methods were used as in the adult studies AMAN and AMBG and if not details of these should be provided.

## MAH Response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lilly confirms that the same bioanalytical methods were used for Study AMBU.

## Assessment of Responses

It has been confirmed that the same bioanalytical methods were used for Study AMBU.

## Conclusion

## Question 10

The MAH should confirm if the 5mg/kg mirikizumab IV induction dosing has been selected to be brought forward for subjects &gt;20kg to &lt;/=40kg in Phase 3, with other dosing the same as that evaluated in this study.

## MAH Response

Lilly confirms that the Study AMBU 5 mg/kg mirikizumab IV Q4W dosing regimen was selected for use in Phase 3 for participants weighing less than or equal to 40 kg in

- [ ]  Study I6T-MC-AMBA (AMBA) as induction dosing, and

- [ ]  Long-term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAZ (AMAZ) ISA #1 as rescue dosing.

In Studies AMBA and AMAZ ISA #1, a 300 mg mirikizumab IV Q4W dosing regimen is used for participants weighing more than 40 kg for induction and rescue dosing, respectively.

## Assessment of MAH Response

The MAH has clarified the doses selected for use in the Phase 3 study.

## Conclusion
