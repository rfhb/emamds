## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lumacaftor / ivacaftor, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on the risk of occurrence of depression and related events from spontaneous reports in post-marketing surveillance, including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge  and  re-challenge,  and  in  the  context  of  updates  made  to  the  product  information  for ELX/TEZ/IVA,  IVA/TEZ  and  IVA  mono-active  the  PRAC  considers  that  a  causal  relationship  between LUM/IVA and depression is at least a reasonable possibility.

In view of available data on breast-feeding from the literature, update of section 4.6 of the SmPC is warranted regarding breast-feeding.

The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lumacaftor / ivacaftor the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lumacaftor / ivacaftor is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
