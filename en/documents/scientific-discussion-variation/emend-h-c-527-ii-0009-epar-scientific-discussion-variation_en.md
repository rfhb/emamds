## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1. Introduction

Emend  is  an  oral  substance  P,  aka  human  neurokinin  1  (NK-1)-receptor  antagonist. Mammalian tachykinin substance P (SP) that binds to the NK-1 receptor has been associated with  numerous  inflammatory  conditions,  mediation  of  the  emetic  reflex  and  modulation  of central  nervous  system  disorders.  By  blocking  NK-1  receptors,  aprepitant  provides  a  novel mechanism of action for the prevention of induced nausea and vomiting.

On 12 November 2003, the European Commission issued a Marketing Authorisation  valid throughout the European Union. The currently approved indication is:

' Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. EMEND is given as part of combination therapy'.

The  purpose  of  this  variation  is  to  broaden  the  indication  to  encompass  emetogenic chemotherapies in general. It should be noted that this submission includes one pivotal study conducted in patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. No more data has thus been submitted in relation to 'highly emetogenic' regimens.

## 2. Clinical aspects

Rationale for the proposed change

Clinical  studies  of  therapy  for  Chemotherapy  Induced  Nausea  and  Vomiting  (CINV)  are classified according to either the degree of emetogenicity of the chemotherapy administered or, less frequently, the specific chemotherapy agent or regimen administered. The prototypic highly emetogenic chemotherapy is high-dose cisplatin (&gt;50 mg/m 2 ), which, in the absence of preventive  therapy,  causes ≥ 95%  of  patients  to  vomit.  Agents  generally  defined  as moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapy  include  doxorubicin,  epirubicin,  cyclophosphamide and carboplatin. It should be noted that regimens containing more than one emetogenic agent are more likely to induce symptoms than agents administered alone and that the distinction between highly and moderately emetogenic is not precisely or consistently defined.

A  combination  of  a  5-HT3-receptor  antagonist  and  a  corticosteroid  administered  prior  to chemotherapy  followed  by  administration  of  one  or  both  agents  for  several  days  is  a recommended  regimen  for  the  prevention  of  CINV  after  moderate  to  highly  emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. Despite this, the incidence of nausea and vomiting during an initial cycle of chemotherapy is at least 30%. In addition, the efficacy of antiemetic therapy tends to diminish over subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.

In  support  of  the  proposed  indication,  study  071  comparing  aprepitant  with  a  standard regimen  treatment  group  was  submitted  together  with  a  small  exploratory  study,  (044)  as discussed in the following sections.

## Clinical Pharmacology

Other  than  biopharmaceutic  studies,  no  new  clinical  pharmacology  data  were  needed  in support of this indication. In order to conduct Protocol 071 in double-blind fashion, the 8-mg tablets of Zofran (ondansetron) included in the comparator regimen were over-encapsulated and  placebo  ondansetron  capsules  were  made  available  for  the  study so, the active ondansetron capsules and the placebo ondansetron capsules were identical in appearance.

An  ondansetron  bioequivalence  study  compared  the  over-encapsulated  8-mg  tablet  of ondansetron with the unencapsulated 8-mg tablet of ondansetron in order to determine if overencapsulation altered the biopharmaceutic properties of ondansetron used in Protocol 071.

Results  demonstrate  that  the  over-encapsulated  tablet  and  the  unencapsulated  tablet  were bioequivalent with respect to the rate of absorption, but not bioequivalent with respect to the extent of absorption of ondansetron, because the lower limit of the 90% confidence limit (CI) for the geometric mean AUC0-∞ ratio for these 2 formulations (0.796) fell slightly below the lower bound of the bioequivalence limit of 0.80.

## Clinical Efficacy

Study  071  is  a  multi-centre,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group  trial  to  evaluate  the efficacy and tolerability of an aprepitant-containing regimen for the prevention of CINV in patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer requiring treatment with non-cisplatin moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens that included cyclophosphamide 750 to 1500 mg/m 2 ,  or cyclophosphamide 500 to 1500 mg/m 2 and  doxorubicin  ( ≤ 60  mg/m 2 )  or  epirubicin  ( ≤ 100 mg/m 2 ).

## Patient population

Patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, naive to chemotherapy Hesketh level ≥ 3, requiring treatment  with  one  of  the  following  moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapy  regimens:  I.V. cyclophosphamide (750 to 1500 mg/m 2 ), I.V. cyclophosphamide (500 to 1500 mg/m 2 ) and IV doxorubicin  ( ≤ 60  mg/m 2 ),  I.V.  cyclophosphamide  (500  to  1500 mg/m 2 )  and  IV  epirubicin ( ≤ 100 mg/m 2 ), were included.

The treatment groups were balanced with regard to demographics, type of malignancy, prior and concomitant medications, and chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were randomized to one of 2 treatment groups as shown in table 1.

Table 1: treatment regimens

| Treatment          | Day 1                                                                                                   | Days 2 to 3                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Aprepitant Regimen | Aprepitant 125 mg P.O. once daily Ondansetron 8 mg P.O. twice daily Dexamethasone 12 mg P.O. once daily | Aprepitant 80 mg P.O. daily       |
| Standard Regimen   | Ondansetron 8 mg P.O. twice daily Dexamethasone 20 mg P.O. once daily                                   | Ondansetron 8 mg P.O. twice daily |

## Study endpoints

One primary efficacy end point was defined in the protocol to compare the aprepitant regimen and  the  standard  regimen  with  respect  to  efficacy  in  the  first  cycle  of  chemotherapy.  The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with complete response, which was defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy to treat established nausea or vomiting during the 5  days  following  the  initiation  of  chemotherapy. Secondary  end  points were  the  effects  of aprepitant  during  the  acute  and  delayed  phase  of  the  emetogenic  cycle  as  well  as  the comparison of the aprepitant regimen and the standard regimen with respect to the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire in the first cycle of chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical response was evaluated with a patient diary that was completed daily for 5 days after the administration of chemotherapy. The diary captured all emetic episodes, all use of rescue therapy, and a daily nausea severity assessment. In an optional multiple-cycle extension, the patient  diary  was  used  to  capture  the  daily  nausea  severity  assessment  for  5  days  after  the administration of chemotherapy for each cycle that the patient entered.  In addition, on Day 6, the patient recorded whether or not any emetic episodes or nausea occurred since the initiation of chemotherapy as well as any use of rescue therapy (only taken for treatment of established nausea or emesis).

Primary statistical analyses were based on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) approach. In addition,  a  supportive  per-protocol  analysis  was  done  for  the  primary  efficacy  parameter. Results are displayed for each endpoint by treatment group and phase (overall, acute, delayed, as well as 0 to 72 hours for nausea endpoints). With 375 evaluable patients per regimen and assuming a true response rate with the standard regimen of 52%, this study would have ~80% power to detect the superiority of the aprepitant regimen, if the true aprepitant regimen effect was  10  percentage  points  higher  than  the  standard  regimen.  If  the  true  difference  was  12 percentage points, the power would be ~90%.

## Efficacy Results

Table 3 presents a summary of the key primary and secondary efficacy results by treatment regimen in cycle 1 .

| No significant nausea (VAS <25 mm) | 262/430 (60.9)   | 236/424 (55.7)   |   0.116 |

† Aprepitant regimen versus standard regimen based on a logistic regression model with  terms  for  treatment  group,  investigator  group,  and  age  category  (&lt;55 years, ≥ 55 years).  Because the endpoints for nausea are exploratory, the p-values shown for these endpoints are for summary purposes only.

No Vomiting = no vomiting or retching or dry heaves.

The complete response rate for the aprepitant regimen group was 50.8%, while a response rate of 42.5% was observed with the standard regimen (p = 0.015).

With  respect  to  complete  response  in  the  acute  phase  (0-24h),  there  was  an  almost  7percentage point difference between the treatment groups (75.7 vs. 69.0%, odds ratio=1.40, p=0.034). During the delayed phase, the advantage for the aprepitant group was smaller and did not reach statistical significance (55.4 vs. 49.1%, odds ratio=1.30, p=0.064).

In  the  delayed  phase  (&gt;24  hours  to  120  hours  post-chemotherapy  administration),  the complete  response  rate  for  the  aprepitant  regimen  was  numerically  higher  than  that  of  the standard regimen, with 55.4% for the aprepitant regimen group and 49.1% for the standard regimen group (p=0.064)

*The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for age category (&lt;55 years, ≥ 55 years) and investigator group, which were included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models.

The  aprepitant  group  had  a  better  outcome  with  respect  to  vomiting  during  both  the  acute phase  (87.5%  versus  77.3%;  odds  ratio=2.07,  p&lt;0.001)  and  delayed  phase  (80.8%  versus 69.1%; odds ratio=1.91, p&lt;0.001) (Table 4).

The proportion of patients with no impact of CINV on daily life by treatment group for the Cycle  1  mITT  population  is  shown  in  table  5.  Logistic  regression  analysis,  adjusted  for treatment  group,  investigator  group,  and  age  category  (&lt;55  year, ≥ 55  years),  was  used  to determine statistical significance of the treatment difference. As assessed by the FLIE total score, 63.5% of the patients in the aprepitant regimen group reported 'no impact on daily life' compared to 55.6% of the patients in the standard regimen group. The treatment difference was significant (p=0.019).

With regard to the percentage of patients with a complete response in cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 the relevant  Kaplan-Meier  curves  show  that  the  cumulative  percentage  of  patients  with  a sustained complete response over Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 was greater in the aprepitant regimen compared to the standard regimen (p=0.017, Log-rank test). However, as to be expected in the light of the introduced bias the efficacy of both aprepitant and standard treatment increased. Re-randomization prior to, e.g. cycle two would have been appropriate. Although the efficacy (and  superiority)  seemed  to  be  retained,  the  data  obtained  in  cycle  2-4  do  not  allow  any conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the two regimens. Results obtained in the cycles 2-4 are not mentioned in the SPC.

- Supportive study 044.

This is a small (n=55) exploratory study, which was conducted between September 1999 and February  2001.  The  study  was  originally  planned  as  a  three-armed  trial  including  a  dose comparative element (aprepitant 375 vs. 125 mg). The high dose group was closed early after the enrolment of 2 patients and the number of patients to be included was reduced from 900 to about 60. No meaningful information as regards efficacy and safety can be extracted.

## Clinical Safety

Protocol 071 randomized 866 patients: 438 patients received the aprepitant regimen and 428 patients  received  the  standard  regimen.  Of  the  438  patients  who  received  the  aprepitant regimen, 430 patients completed Cycle 1 and 334 Cycle 4 of chemotherapy. Only safety data from the women included in study 071, were presented.

## Adverse events (AE)

As  expected  in  a  population  receiving  chemotherapy,  most  patients  experienced  a  clinical adverse experience during the study. In Cycle 1 (Table 6), 73.1% of patients receiving the aprepitant  regimen  and  74.8%  of  patients  in  the  standard  regimen  experienced  a  clinical adverse experience. The treatment groups were similar with respect to the incidence of drugrelated adverse experiences (21.5% versus 19.6%), serious adverse experiences (3.4% versus 4.2%),  and  adverse  experiences  that  led  to  drug  discontinuation  (1.6% versus  1.2%)  in  the aprepitant regimen versus the standard regimen, respectively.

Among  the  most  commonly  reported  drug-related  events  (incidence  &gt;2%  in  one  or  more treatment groups), only fatigue was reported more frequently in the aprepitant regimen than in the standard regimen (2.5% and 1.6%, respectively). Those events reported more frequently in the standard regimen included constipation (7.7% and 5.7%) and headache (7.2% and 6.4%). There  was  no  increase  in  infectious  events  in  the  aprepitant  arm  (9.4%  vs.  11.7%).  With respect to febrile neutropenia, the incidence was identical cycle 1 (2.1%), but slightly higher cycles 2 to 4 (2.9% vs. 2.2%).

During  the  multiple  cycles  of  chemotherapy  (Cycles  2  to  4),  the  incidence  and  pattern  of drug-related clinical adverse experiences were essentially similar to those seen in Cycle 1.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

No patients in either treatment group died during Cycle 1. One patient receiving the aprepitant regimen died during Cycle 3. This patient died as a result of a serious infection that was not considered by the investigator to be drug related.

In  Cycle  1,  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  serious  adverse  experiences  was  reported  for  the patients receiving the standard  regimen  (4.2%)  compared  with  patients  receiving  the aprepitant  regimen  (3.4%).  Two  patients  in  the  aprepitant  regimen  had  serious  adverse experiences that were considered by the investigator to be drug related (febrile neutropenia and enterocolitis).

Twelve patients discontinued study therapy due to a clinical adverse experience during Cycle 1; 7 patients (1.6%) and 5 patients (1.2%) in the aprepitant regimen and the standard regimen, respectively.  Adverse experiences that led to discontinuation of the aprepitant regimen were enterocolitis, nausea, weight decreased, dehydration, headache, migraine, pruritus, rash, and flushing.  Adverse  experiences  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  the  standard  regimen  were diarrhoea, haematochezia, dehydration, headache, and deep vein thrombosis.

## Laboratory findings

During Cycle 1, 12 patients (aprepitant regimen: 4 patients, standard regimen: 8 patients) had a laboratory adverse experience that was deemed by the investigator to be drug related.  There were no laboratory adverse experiences that were serious during Cycle 1. No patients were withdrawn from the study (Cycles 1 to 4) due to a laboratory adverse experience. Laboratory adverse experiences during the multiple cycles were similar to those in Cycle 1 and between treatment groups.

The adverse events  profile  of  the  product  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  cytotoxic  treatment. The adverse events reported were balanced between treatment arms. No new or unexpected adverse  events  were  reported.  The  safety  profile  observed  in  trial  071  is  comparable  with those seen in the original application (studies 052 and 054).

## Overall Discussion and Benefit - Risk assessment

Although two studies were submitted, only protocol 071 was used in the assessment for this extension of indication. Protocol 071 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallelgroup trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of an aprepitant-containing regimen for the prevention  of  CINV  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  breast  cancer  requiring  treatment  with non-cisplatin moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens that included cyclophosphamide  750  to  1500  mg/m 2 ,  or  cyclophosphamide  500  to  1500  mg/m 2 and doxorubicin  ( ≤ 60  mg/m 2 )  or  epirubicin  ( ≤ 100  mg/m 2 ).  Due  to  methodological  difficulties study 044 was not assessable as pivotal nor as supportive study. Also the safety data from this study (044) could not be used in the safety assessment of the product. Therefore only study 071 was adequate for assessment of the benefit/risk of aprepitant in the applied indication.

The possible effect of aprepitant on cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics was discussed in the original application of Emend. Conclusion at that time was that the data suggest that CYP3A4 does not play a major role in cyclophosphamide metabolism, and that therefore no relevant effect  of  aprepitant  on  clinical  efficacy  of  cyclophosphamide  containing  regimens  is  to  be expected. However, additional data obtained from a recent combination study performed in the  Netherlands  (de  Jong et  al ,  2004 1 )  in  patients  receiving  high-dose  cyclophosphamide, thiotepa  and  carboplatin  indicated  that  aprepitant  decreased  the  rate  of  autoinduction  of cyclophosphamide activation  to  4-OH  cyclophosphamide  by  approximately  25%.  Although the active metabolite of cyclophosphamide, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide AUC  only decreased 5% in the presence of aprepitant, the exposure appears to be obtained via lower but sustained plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. It is should be acknowledged  that  the  study  group  in  the  de  Jong  publication  is  rather  small  and  that  the effect of aprepitant on the exposure to 4-HC was mild. However, concerns on the effect of aprepitant  on  the  efficacy  of  cyclophosphamide  treatment  of  breast  cancer  remain  due  to uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  estimated  effect  on  4-HC  and  the  impact  on  curative character of this treatment remain. Comparative efficacy data, of the standard and aprepitant regimen, in terms of CR and PR were not evaluated in study 071 butcomparative safety data, e.g. with respect to grade and duration of neutropenia did not indicate reduced cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in the aprepitant group.

Data on in vitro inhibition of CYP2B6 in the de Jong publication and in the MAH in house studies differ with IC50 1.3 µg/ml (2.5µm) reported by de Jong and IC50 45 µM reported by the  MAH.  IC50  values  are  difficult  to  compare  between  studies,  and  Ki  values  were  not reported. With a Cmax in the range of 3 µM the MAH data suggest a fairly low potential for in vivo inhibition  of  CYP2B6.  as  the  actual in  vitro studies  have  not  been  fully  assessed,  an effect on CYP2B6 in vivo cannot be excluded. In order to facilitate estimation of the possible effect  of  aprepitant  on  CYP2B6,  follow-up  data  (notably  to  determine  the  Ki  value)  are needed.

Though  the  patient  population  in  study  071  was  almost  exclusively  female  it  has  been questioned whether the efficacy of aprepitant in the prevention of emesis can be extrapolated to  men  across  the  spectrum  of  emetogenic  chemotherapy  regimens.  For  highly  emetogenic courses there is no gender effect. This conclusion was already reached by the CHMP during the  assessment  of  the  original  application.  The  problem  at  hand  is  the  extrapolation  of  the

conclusions  from  these  highly  emetogenic  therapies  to  moderately  emetogenic  treatments. Two new elements related to this issue are included in the dossier. First, is shown that the results  obtained  in  women  treated  with  highly  emetogenic  treatments  (Hesketh  5)  are  not different  from  those  treated  with  moderately  emetogenic  therapies.  Second,  in  general literature, a gender difference is not an issue in the discussions about the effects of the various anti-emetic treatment modalities. Although the female gender is accounted as a risk factor for development of vomiting and nausea, the female gender is never related to deviant relative efficacy of any anti-emetogenic treatment modality. Based  on this newly submitted information, it seems there is no indication that the product will not have an effect in men.

Study 071 only addresses efficacy and safety of Emend in moderately emetogenic schedules. Due to the small number of patients administered Hesketh level 5 chemotherapy regimens and the absence of glucocorticoid therapy after day 1, no conclusions can be drawn in relation to this  subgroup  of  patients.  As  no  new  data  concerning  highly  emetogenic  schedules  are submitted, the indication should specify that Emend is to be used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.

As  regards  moderately  emetogenic  chemotherapies,  however,  a  significant  benefit  was demonstrated  in  terms  of  overall  response  rate.  The  results  indicate  that  in  study  071  the 'aprepitant  regimen'  was  more  effective  than  the  standard  regimen  with  respect  to  the complete response endpoint, with statistical superiority for the primary end point (p=0.015). In the acute phase the results were also statistically superior (p=0.034) while in the delayed phase  no  statistical  significance  was  reached  (p=0.064).  Also  considering  that  the  standard therapy (not steroid-containing) was suboptimal to the usual used regimes the data indicate that the efficacy of aprepitant as single agent in the delayed phase is questionable.

Although the  effect  on  nausea  appears  to  be  less  than  that  on  vomiting  (i.e.  no  superiority could be demonstrated), there are insufficient reasons to distinguish in the indication between the two phenomena. However the data are presented in section 5.1 of the SPC.

Results  of  the  standard  therapy  were  within  the  expected  range  as  were  the  results  of aprepitant  in  the  overall  and  acute  phase.  Results  in  the  delayed  phase  seemed  inferior  as (indirectly) compared to the results reported in the high-emetogenic studies (in these studies dexamethasone  was  added  to  the  regimen  during  day  2-5),  but  this  may  also  indicate  that platina  induced  delayed  emesis  is  different  from  that  seen  with  moderately  emetogenic schedules.

No  superiority in use of rescue therapy, no nausea or significant nausea could be demonstrated.  Impact-on-daily  life  data  indicated  a  superiority  of  aprepitant  regimen.  The nausea data are more or less in line with the results reported in the previous application. The impact-on-daily-life  data  also  show  a  minor  effect  on  the  nausea  component.  However  the overall endpoints (primary and secondary) show  statistical significant superiority for aprepitant. These contrasting results are reflected in the SPC in section 5.1.

Efficacy  results  in  multiple  cycles  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  fact  that patients  may  have  chosen  whether  or  not  to  continue  into  the  next  cycle  based  on  their response in the previous cycle leading to a more favorable response rate in later cycles. Rerandomization prior to, e.g. cycle two would have been appropriate. Although numerical the found efficacy (and superiority) seemed to be retained, the data obtained in cycle 2-4 do not allow any conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the two regimens. Results obtained in the cycles 2-4 are not mentioned in the SPC.

The  adverse  events  profile  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  cytotoxic  treatment.  No  new  or unexpected  adverse  events  were  reported.  The  safety  profile  observed  in  trial  071  is comparable with those seen in the original application.

Based on the CHMP review of the above data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  extension  of indication for EMEND:

'Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy.

Prevention of  nausea and  vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.

EMEND is given as part of combination therapy.'
