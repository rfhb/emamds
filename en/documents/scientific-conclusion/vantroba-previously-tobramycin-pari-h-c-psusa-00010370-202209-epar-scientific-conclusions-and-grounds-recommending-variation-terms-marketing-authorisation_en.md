## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tobramycin (nebuliser solution) (centrally authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on the increased risk of ototoxicity in patients with particular mitochondrial rRNA mutations from the literature and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship  between  tobramycin  and  an  increased  risk  of  aminoglycoside-associated  ototoxicity  in patients  with  mitochondrial  mutations  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the product information of products containing tobramycin should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tobramycin (nebuliser solution) (centrally authorised product only) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tobramycin (nebuliser solution) (centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
