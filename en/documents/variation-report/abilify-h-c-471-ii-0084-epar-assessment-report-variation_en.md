## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Aripiprazole,  a  dihydrocarbostyril  (quinolinone)  derivative,  is  an  antipsychotic  agent.  Aripiprazole (Abilify) was  authorised in the European  Union  (EU) on 4 June 2004. Aripiprazole tablets, orodispersible  tablets  and  oral  solution  are  currently  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of schizophrenia in adults with recommended starting dose of 10 mg or 15 mg/day and target dose of 15 mg/day  administered  on  a  once-a-day  schedule  irrespective  of  meals.  These  formulations  are  also indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  disorder  and  for  the prevention  of  a  new  manic  episode  in  patients  who  experienced  predominantly  manic  episodes  and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.

Abilify tablets, orodispersible tablets and oral solution are also approved in the EU for the treatment of schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older.  The  recommended  dose  in  this  patient  group  is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule irrespective of meals. Treatment should be initiated at 2 mg (using Abilify oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional days to reach the  recommended  daily  dose  of  10  mg.  When  appropriate,  subsequent  dose  increases  should  be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg.

In  December  2012,  the  CHMP  recommended  a  variation  to  the  marketing  authorisation  to  add  the following  paediatric  indication:  'treatment  up  to  12 weeks  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older'.

Aripiprazole intramuscular (7.5mg/ml, solution for injection) is specifically indicated for the treatment of the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.

This variation refers to an update of section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to add  information  on  the  risk  of  suicidality  in  paediatric  patients  based  on  the  results  of  the epidemiological study CN138598.

Study CN138598 was submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006.

## 2.2. Clinical Safety aspects

As part of the variation to extend the indication of schizophrenia to adolescents aged 15 years and older, the MAH made the following commitment (FUM 50):

| Clinica! | From procedure EMEA/H/C/000471/Il/0048: to provide a protocol for an epidemiologic cohort study to assess suicide in all identified patients under the age of 18 years using aripiprazole. The study will be conducted once final protocol is agreed by the CHMP. | March2010  |

In January 2011, the protocol was agreed by the CHMP.

Within this variation application, the MAH submitted the final results of study CN138598.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main objective of Study CN138598 was to determine the combined incidence of suicidal events (attempted  or  completed  suicides)  in  patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  after  first  exposure  to  an atypical antipsychotic (i.e., in an inception cohort; no evidence of previous exposure to antipsychotics). Within this cohort, the event rates for aripiprazole users were compared to event rates for users of all other atypical antipsychotics.

## 2.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Three study sites were included in this study: (1) HealthCore Inc., (2) Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, and (3) Henry Ford Health System. Each study site had access to detailed automated patient level data (including cause of death data) and served as the source of the base population for 2 previous MAHsponsored observational studies of suicide events in adult patients.

While the electronic format of data from each site chosen was not identical, the principal investigators of  this  study  had  experience  compiling  data  from  these  multiple  sources  and  had  developed  sitespecific algorithms needed to construct a single, uniform analytic dataset.

All patients less than 18 years of age who received at least one prescription for a typical or atypical antipsychotic from 1 November 2002 through to 31 December 2009 were identified. The first atypical antipsychotic  prescription  filled  during  the  study  period  was  considered  as  the  index  prescription. Although  only  atypical  antipsychotics  were  evaluated  in  this  study,  patients  exposed  to  typical  or atypical antipsychotics before the index date were excluded to identify new users (inception cohort) not previously exposed to any antipsychotic. Any patient not continuously enrolled in the database/health  plan  for  at  least  90  days  before  the  index  date  was  excluded  from  the  study population. The study population was further limited to individuals with no previous prescription filled for any antipsychotic any time before the index date (all available historical data were used to exclude patients with previous antipsychotic exposure). All patients identified using this approach formed the base population for the inception cohort and were considered previously unexposed.

The  endpoint  for  this  study  was  the  combined  incidence  of  suicidal  events  (i.e.,  attempted  or completed suicide) recorded through the end of the follow-up period (31 December 2009). All health system encounters associated with serious suicide attempts (defined as hospitalization or emergency department encounter associated with a suicide attempt) were collected, and follow up continued for patients  who  attempted  suicide  until  one  of  the  censoring  events  occurred  e.g.  death  from  suicide, disenrollment from the database/health plan, death from any cause (other than suicide), attaining 18 years of age, or end of the study period.

## Statistical Analysis

Descriptive  statistics,  including  means  and  percentages,  were  calculated  according  to  demographics and clinical characteristics. Rates of suicide events were calculated as number of events among current users divided by current use person-time. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare rate of suicide events (i.e., attempted or completed suicides combined) in current users of aripiprazole to the rate of current users of all other atypical antipsychotics. Adjusted Hazard Ratios (HRs) controlled for  the  following  variables:  age,  gender,  previous  suicide  attempt,  indication  for  antipsychotic  use, comorbidity, health care encounters, study site, history of antipsychotic use, exposure to pharmacotherapy and year of index prescription.

In  this  population,  a  validation  substudy  was  also  conducted,  using  a  medical  record  review  on  a sample  of  charts  (n=386)  to  determine  the  validity  of  claims-based  diagnosis  codes  to  ascertain indication for antipsychotic use in paediatric/adolescent patients. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism  were  included  in  the  validation  substudy.  Descriptive  analyses  were  performed  to  compare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

claims  data  with  data  obtained  from  the  medical  record.  A  sensitivity/specificity  analysis  was performed for each of the behavioural diagnoses that were indicated for use according to the Product Information.

## Validation - Substudy Results

Results  from  the  substudy  evaluating  the  indication  for  antipsychotic  use  demonstrated  that,  in  a subset of this paediatric population (n=386), automated data accurately identified patients with bipolar disorder  and  schizophrenia.  Hyperkinetic  syndrome  of  childhood  or  ADHD  (claims-based  diagnoses: 35.2%;  chart-based  diagnoses:  28.2%),  disturbance  of  emotions  specific  to  childhood  adolescence (claims-based  diagnoses:  21.5%;  chart-based  diagnoses:  15.5%)  and  anxiety,  dissociative,  and somatoform disorders (claims-based diagnoses: 19.4%; chart-based diagnoses: 9.6%) were frequently coded behavioural diagnoses in this population.

However, the accuracy of identifying precise indication beyond the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder conditions was limited. The sensitivity for bipolar disorder was 81.3% and the specificity was 89.5%. The sensitivity for schizophrenia was 100.0%, and the specificity was 99.0%. The sensitivity for autism was 40.9%, and the specificity was 97.5%.

## 2.2.3. Additional Analyses

At the CHMP request, the MAH provided additional analyses per paediatric subgroups (schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder as defined by ICD9 diagnosis codes), taking into account other factors such as the comorbidities  and  concomitant  medication.  Furthermore,  an  analysis  related  to  the  occurrence  of suicide within the first 28 days following the initiation of treatment in the entire study population was performed by the MAH. Results are presented below.

## Schizophrenia population

Results of the subgroup analysis in paediatric patients with schizophrenia are presented in Tables 5-8.

## 2.2.4. Discussion

After reviewing the original analysis based on the overall population (see Table 1), the CHMP noted that  only  2.8%  of  the  patients  studied  had  schizophrenia.  Moreover,  the  mean  age  of  paediatric patients  was  12.9,  and  from  the  CHMP  viewpoint,  the  risk  of  suicide  is  generally  higher  in  older children. Therefore the CHMP considered that the presented results were not sufficient to evaluate the risk  of  suicide  in  the  authorised  paediatric  indication,  which  at  the  time  of  the  submission  of  this variation  application,  was  limited  to  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  aged  15  years  and  older.  At  the CHMP  request,  additional  analyses  were  performed  per  paediatric  subgroups  (schizophrenia  and Bipolar  Disorder  as  defined  by  ICD9  diagnosis  codes)  and  taking  into  account  other  factors  such  as comorbidities  and  concomitant  medications.  Furthermore,  an  analysis  related  to  the  occurrence  of suicide within the first 28 days following the initiation of treatment was performed in the entire study population by the MAH. All these analyses were based with an age cut off of 15 years, since at the time of  the  responses  to  the  CHMP  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  paediatric  indication  was limited to schizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older.

In schizophrenia patients aged 15 years and above, the studied population had a very high percentage of chronic pain and concomitant use of opiates, analgesics and corticosteroids (see Table 6). Presence of  ADHD and use of stimulants were also very high, 29.8% and 34.2% respectively. These aspects may differently  influence  the  risk  of  suicide.  Similar  findings  were  observed  in  the  Bipolar  Disorder population  with  frequent  presence  of  comorbidities  e.g.  ADHD,  anxiety  disorders  and  chronic  pain. Most suicidal events (4 out of 5) occurred in the schizophrenia population 15 years and above, with a rate  per  1,000  person-years,  almost  double  than  with  the  other  agents  (see  Table  7)  and  this  was considered by the CHMP of concern in spite of the large and overlapping confidence intervals. Even the adjusted hazard ratios comparing suicidal events in paediatric patients with ICD-9 codes indicative of Bipolar Disorder exposed to current use of aripiprazole to current use of other atypical antipsychotic agents showed an increased risk compared to other antipsychotics (see Table 12), although the CIs still were highly overlapping.  Hence, the CHMP was not in agreement with the MAH proposal to include a statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the results of this study, suggesting that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other treatment. The CHMP considered that the results of the study were not sufficiently robust to make such conclusion. In addition, although there was no sizeable database at the time of this variation that can contribute to an adequate EU sample size to evaluate the  risk of suicide in the paediatric population, the CHMP was of the opinion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that information in the SmPC should as far as possible relate to the intended (authorised) use, and no convincing arguments on the relevance of the available data to EU use had been provided by the MAH. On this basis, the MAH did not wish to pursue their initial proposed statement to reflect the results of this  epidemiological study and hence did not provide further analyses taking into account paediatric patients  with  Bipolar  Disorder  aged  13  years  and  older  and  the  launch  dates  of  the  antipsychotic agents, as requested by the CHMP. Subsequently, the MAH proposed to reflect in the SmPC that there are  insufficient  paediatric  data  to  evaluate  the  risk  of  suicide  with  aripiprazole  compared  to  other antipsychotics in younger patients (below 18 years of age). This proposal was considered acceptable by the CHMP and the MAH updated the Product Information in line with the final CHMP recommended wording (see 2.3).

Regarding  temporal  dispersion  on  suicide  events  rate  on  the  first  4  weeks  of  use  of  aripiprazole  in Bipolar Disorder patients only, the CHMP noted that suicide events occurring in the first 4 weeks were much  more  likely  to  occur  with  other  atypical  antipsychotics  than  with  aripiprazole,  with  no  CIs overlapping. The incidence rates (per 1,000 person-years) were respectively, 3.26 (0.40, 11.79) and 18.35 (12.92, 25.30) for aripiprazole and other atypical agents (see Table 13). The adjusted hazard ratios comparing suicide events in aripiprazole users versus other atypical agents users during the first 4 weeks were 0.17 (0.04-0.72) and 0.19 (0.05-0.81). Therefore the CHMP concluded that the risk of suicide events with aripiprazole appeared to have a different temporal pattern, with the risk being well more  distributed  over  the  time.  Whilst  acknowledging  that  the  presented  data  were  insufficient  to evaluate  the  risk  of  suicide  with  aripiprazole  compared  to  other  antipsychotics  in  younger  patients (below  18 years  of  age),  the  CHMP  recommended  to  include  in  the  SmPC  that  the  risk  of  suicide persists beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment for atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. This statement was agreed by the MAH (see 2.3).

## 2.3. Changes to the Product Information

The  MAH  initially  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI).New  text  is underlined:

## SmPC - Section 4.4

The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some  cases  has  been  reported  early  after  initiation  or  switch  of  antipsychotic  therapy,  including treatment  with  aripiprazole  (see  section  4.8).  Close  supervision  of  high-risk  patients  should accompany antipsychotic therapy. Results of an epidemiological study suggested that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Results of an epidemiological study in paediatric patients with any diagnosis suggested that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other atypical antipsychotics.

During the procedure, the CHMP requested amendments to the initially proposed PI, as discussed in detail above. The new text finally approved by the CHMP is as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SmPC- Section 4.4

The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some  cases  has  been  reported  early  after  initiation  or  switch  of  antipsychotic  therapy,  including treatment  with  aripiprazole  (see  section 4.8).  Close  supervision  of  high-risk  patients  should accompany antipsychotic therapy. Results of an epidemiological study suggested that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There are insufficient paediatric data to evaluate this risk in younger  patients  (below  18 years  of  age),  but  there  is  evidence  that  the  risk  of  suicide  persists beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment for atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

On the basis of the submitted data, the CHMP concluded that the update of the Product Information regarding the results of the paediatric epidemiological study (CN 138598) was adequate. The CHMP considered  that  the  changes  do  not  affect  the  benefit  risk  profile  of  the  product,  which  remains positive.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                                                | Type   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
