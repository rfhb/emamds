## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that An  Open-Label  Study  to  Assess  the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability,  and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Doses of ISIS 396443 Delivered Intrathecally to Subjects With Genetically Diagnosed and Presymptomatic Spinal Muscular Atrophy (NURTURE)Study Number 232SM201 is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final report for:

- 232SM201: An Open-Label Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Doses of ISIS 396443 Delivered Intrathecally to Subjects With Genetically Diagnosed and Presymptomatic Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Nusinersen (Spinraza; BIIB058, ISIS 396443) - An Open-Label Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Doses of ISIS 396443 Delivered Intrathecally to Subjects With Genetically Diagnosed and Presymptomatic Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

## Description

A Phase 2 open-label, multicenter, multinational, single-arm study to assess the long-term efficacy, safety,  tolerability,  PK,  PD,  and  immunogenicity  of  multiple  doses  of  nusinersen  in  participants  with genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA.

## Methods

## Study participants

This study planned to enroll up to 25 participants who were 6 weeks of age or younger at the time of the first dose administration and had genetic documentation of 5q SMA homozygous gene deletion or mutation  or  compound  heterozygous  mutation  and  2  or  3  copies  of  the SMN2 gene  and  were presymptomatic.

Participants permanently discontinued study treatment for any one of the following reasons:

- The participant's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdrew consent.
- The participant experienced a medical emergency that necessitated permanent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation of study treatment.

- At the discretion of the Investigator for medical reasons.
- At the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for noncompliance.

Participants were withdrawn from the study for any one of the following reasons:

- The participant's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdrew consent.
- The participant's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

The primary reason for discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study was recorded in the participant's CRF.

## Treatments

Nusinersen (12-mg, IT bolus LP injection) was administered using a loading regimen (dosing on Days 1, 15, 29, and 64), followed by maintenance dosing once every 4 months beginning on Day 183. In previous versions of the protocol (Versions 1 through 5), the volume of the injection, and thus the dose, were adjusted based on the participant's age on the day of dosing, such that each participant received a 12mg scaled equivalent dose based on CSF volume scaling. After implementation of Protocol Version 6, all participants were dosed with 12 mg (5 mL) of nusinersen, regardless of their age.

A summary of key information regarding the study treatment is provided in the Table below.

| Rationale for Study Dose   | The nusinersen dose and dose interval were selected based on nonclinical data, consideration of the target tissue concentration anticipated for drug pharmacology, and safety data in the completed and ongoing clinical studies of nusinersen to date. The loading dose and maintenance dose intervals were based on nonclinical PK and pharmacology data. The loading dose interval was intended to achieve and maintain nusinersen spinal cord tissue levels that were predicted to be within the upper end of the pharmacologically active range (predicted to be approximately 30 μg/g lumbar and 10 μg/g cervical tissue concentrations) while at the same time considering participant safety and convenience for repeated LP IT injections. The maintenance dose interval was intended to maintain the spinal cord tissue levels of nusinersen at a steady-state level within the estimated pharmacologically active range. Because results from PK models showed similar concentrations and potential for higher efficacy with higher concentrations, the dosing regimen was adjusted to 12 mg (5 mL) regardless of age, which in result lowered the risk for dosing errors while still maintaining favorable safety margins. In previous versions of the protocol (Versions 1 through 5), the volume of the injection and thus the dose were adjusted based on the participant's age on the day of dosing, such that each participant received a 12-mg scaled equivalent dose based on CSF volume scaling.   | Protocol 232SM201 V9 Section 4.5   |

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis population:

Analysis populations were defined as follows:

- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Set: all participants who received at least 1 dose of nusinersen. It should be noted that, in the protocol, the ITT Set was labeled as the Full Analysis Set but the definition has not changed.
- Per-Protocol Set (PPS): the subset of the ITT Set who completed the initial 4 doses of the drug, had a baseline and at least the Day 183 efficacy assessments, and had no notable protocol deviations that would be expected to affect the efficacy assessments.
- PK Set: participants who were dosed and for whom there was at least 1 evaluable post-dose PK sample.

## Efficacy:

Efficacy analyses are presented separately for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and those with 3 SMN2 copies as detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Primary endpoint and analysis:

- The primary endpoint was time to death or respiratory intervention (invasive or noninvasive ventilation for ≥ 6 hours/day continuously for ≥ 7 days or tracheostomy).
- The  time  was  the  age  of  the  participant  at  the  first  occurrence  of  either  a  respiratory intervention or death. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the time to respiratory intervention or death was presented and used to estimate the median time to event and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).

Secondary endpoints and analyses:

- The proportion of participants developing clinically manifested SMA as defined by age-adjusted weight, requirement for percutaneous gastric tube placement, and failure to achieve motor milestones  as  assessed  by  WHO  criteria  on  Days  365  and  700  was  presented  with  a corresponding 95% CI.
- A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was presented and used to estimate the proportion of participants alive at 13 months and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years of age. Corresponding 95% CIs were presented.
- The total number of HINE-2 milestones achieved was summarized by visit.
- The  proportion  of  participants  who  had  the  ability  to  perform  WHO  motor  milestones  was summarized by visit. The age at achievement of each milestone was reported by the caregiver and  confirmed  at  the  subsequent  in-person  assessment.  The  age  of  achievement  will  be summarized for each milestone.
- Change from baseline to each visit for the CHOP INTEND motor function was summarized using descriptive statistics. Once participants reached a score of 64, CHOP INTEND was no longer assessed.
- The HFMSE total score and change from baseline (first opportunity to perform) was summarized by visit and age using descriptive statistics.
- Change from baseline to each visit was summarized using descriptive statistics for the following

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

growth parameters: weight for age/length, head circumference, chest circumference, head-tochest circumference ratio, and arm circumference.

Exploratory endpoints and analyses are described in the clinical study report.

PK:

- Results of CSF and plasma nusinersen concentrations were summarized by sampling time.

PD/Biomarker:

- Results from the PD assessment of plasma/CSF NF-L concentrations were summarized at each visit.

## Safety:

All AEs were analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence. An AE was regarded as treatment emergent if it was present prior to the first dose of study treatment and subsequently worsened or was not present prior to the first dose of study treatment but subsequently appeared. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was summarized overall, by severity, and by relationship to study treatment. A participant having the same AE more than once was counted only once in the incidence for that event. The occurrence of the AE with the greatest severity was used in the calculation of incidence by severity; the occurrence of the AE with the strongest relationship to study treatment was used in the calculation of incidence by relationship to study treatment.

Clinical laboratory evaluations including hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis were summarized using shift tables, presenting changes relative to each parameter's normal range. Summary statistics for actual values and changes from baseline was also presented.

The analysis of vital signs was focused on clinically relevant abnormalities. The number and percentage of participants with clinically relevant postbaseline abnormalities were presented. Summary statistics for actual values and change from baseline was also presented.

For ECGs, the number and percentage of participants with shifts from baseline normal to each of the categorical values denoting normal, abnormal, and abnormal (not AE) were summarized.

The number and percentage of participants with clinical changes in echocardiogram readings from the first assessment were summarized.

For  immunogenicity,  descriptive  statistics  of  the  incidence  of  anti-nusinersen  plasma  antibody concentrations were presented.

## Results

## Disposition of Participants

Thirty participants were screened at 17 study sites. Of the 30 participants screened, 5 did not meet the eligibility criteria for the study (Figure 1):

- Three participants did not meet the inclusion criterion of having an ulnar CMAP ≥ 1 mV at baseline and 2 of these participants also had clinical signs or symptoms at Screening or immediately prior to the first dose (Day 1) that were, in the opinion of the Investigator, strongly suggestive of SMA.
- One participant did not meet the inclusion criterion of having genetic documentation of 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 .
- One participant did not meet the inclusion criterion of having genetic documentation of 5q SMA homozygous gene deletion or mutation or compound heterozygous mutation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The remaining 25 participants (15 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 10 participants with 3 SMN2 copies) were enrolled at 16 study sites. All 25 participants enrolled were dosed; these participants comprised the ITT Set. All completed the Day 183 Visit and met the criteria for inclusion in the PPS. Twenty-two participants (88%) completed the Day 2891/End of Study Visit. Three participants (12%) discontinued treatment and withdrew from the study. The first participant was treated on 20 May 2015, and the end of study date (last participant last visit) was 17 December 2024.

## Study Populations Analyzed

Safety and efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT Set (Table 1). The analysis of the primary endpoint was repeated using the PPS. The PPS and PK Set were the same as the ITT Set. A subgroup analysis was performed for participants with peroneal CMAP amplitude ≥ 2 mV and an absence of areflexia defined as HINE item for tendon reflexes &gt; 0, as described in Appendix 16.1.9, Statistical Analysis Plan, Section 5.11.

No participants, visits, or observations were excluded from the efficacy analysis.

## Demographics

Summaries of demographics at Screening are presented for participants in the ITT Set in Table 2. There were 12 males (48%; 8 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 4 participants with 3 SMN2 copies) and 13 females (52%; 7 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 6 participants with 3 SMN2 copies) in the ITT Set. Fourteen participants (56%) were White. Age at first dose ranged from 3 through 42 days, with a median of 22.0 days and a mean of 20.6 days. In participants with 2 SMN2 copies, age at first dose ranged from 8 through 41 days, with a median of 19.0 days; in participants with 3 SMN2 copies, age at first dose ranged from 3 through 42 days, with a median of 23.0 days. The majority of participants were from the US.

Demographic characteristics for the 16 participants (8 with 2 SMN2 copies  and  8  with  3 SMN2 copies) with baseline peroneal CMAP amplitude ≥ 2 mV and an absence of areflexia were consistent with the overall ITT Set.

## Baseline Disease Characteristics

All  25  enrolled  participants  had  genetic  documentation of 5q SMA homozygous gene deletion or mutation or compound heterozygous mutation but were presymptomatic. Of the 25 participants in the ITT Set, 15 had 2 SMN2 copies and 10 had 3 SMN2 copies by central laboratory testing. There was  1  set  of  twins  with  2 SMN2 copies.  Additionally,  1  participant  with  2  SMN2  copies  and  1 participant with 3 SMN2 copies had a twin; however, in both cases, the twin did not have SMA and was not enrolled in the study.

In the ITT Set, gestational age at birth ranged from 37 through 41 weeks, with a median of 39.0 weeks.  Birth  weight  ranged  from  2.14  through  4.36  kg,  with  a  median  of  3.290  kg.  Weight  at Screening ranged from 2.20 through 4.81 kg, with a median of 3.500 kg (the majority of participants (17 of 25 participants) were within the &gt; 25th and ≤ 75th percentiles for weight for age at Screening [WHO 2006; WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group 2006a, 2006b].

In participants with 2 SMN2 copies, the majority of participants (9 of 15 participants) were within the &gt; 25th and ≤ 75th percentile for weight for age at Screening. In participants with 3 SMN2 copies, the majority of participants (8 of 10 participants) were within the &gt; 25th and ≤ 50th percentile for weight for age at Screening. Two participants were below the 5th percentile for weight for age at Screening (1 participant with 2 SMN2 copies and 1 participant with 3 SMN2 copies). One participant (with 2 SMN2 copies) weighed above the 95th percentile for weight for age at Screening. Length ranged from 42.5 through 59.1 cm, with a median of 51.70 cm. The majority of participants (14 of 25 participants) were within the &gt; 10th and ≤ 50th percentiles for length for age at Screening. Two participants were below the 5th percentile for length for age at Screening (1 participant with 2 SMN2 copies and 1 participant with 3 SMN2 copies), and 2 participants (both with 2 SMN2 copies) were above the 95th percentile for length for age at Screening. Head circumference ranged from 30.0 through 40.0 cm, with a median of 35.60 cm. Chest circumference ranged from 29.0 through 38.7 cm, with a median of 34.40 cm. Head-to-chest circumference ratio ranged from 0.9 through 1.2, with a median of 1.04. Overall, anthropometric parameters for all participants were consistent with normal development.

Compared with participants with 2 SMN2 copies, participants with 3 SMN2 copies had higher median baseline values for the CHOP INTEND, HINE motor milestones, and CMAP amplitude assessments.

In the ITT Set, baseline CHOP INTEND total score ranged from 25 through 60 with a median of 50.0 (median of 45.0 for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 53.5 for participants with 3 SMN2 copies). Twenty-three  participants  (14  participants  with  2 SMN2 copies  and  9  participants  with  3 SMN2 copies) had a CHOP INTEND total score between 25 and 60, and 2 participants (1 participant with 2 SMN2 copies and 1 participant with 3 SMN2 copies) had scores between 60 and 64.

Baseline  motor  milestones  were  assessed  using  Section  2  of  the  HINE,  which  evaluates neuromuscular development in 8 motor milestone components (voluntary grasp, ability to kick [in supine], head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking). At baseline, participants with 3 SMN2 copies  exhibited  more  advanced  HINE  motor  milestones  than  participants  with  2 SMN2 copies. For example, 2 participants (20%) with 3 SMN2 copies and 1 participant (7%) with 2 SMN2 copies maintained their head upright all the time; 7 participants (70%) with 3 SMN2 copies and 9 participants  (60%) with 2 SMN2 copies had the ability to kick upward (vertically); 1 participant (10%) with 3 SMN2 copies and no participants with 2 SMN2 copies could crawl on elbow; and 3 participants (30%) with 3 SMN2 copies and 2 participants (13%) with 2 SMN2 copies could support weight, as would be expected based on their age at the time of the assessment. No participants in either SMN2 copy cohort achieved more advanced milestones, such as rolling to side, at baseline, and this would not be expected in healthy infants until 4 months or older.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the ITT Set, baseline ulnar nerve CMAP amplitude ranged from 1.0 through 6.7 mV with a median of 2.65 mV (median of 2.30 mV for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 2.90 mV for participants with 3 SMN2 copies). Baseline peroneal nerve CMAP amplitude ranged from 0.2 through 9.7 mV with a median of 3.30 mV (median of 3.20 mV for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 4.00 mV for participants with 3 SMN2 copies).

The median (range) total plasma (n = 14) and CSF (n = 21) concentrations of NF-L at baseline were 543.0 (7 through 1160) and 9720.0 (146 through 23,600) pg/mL, respectively. Median baseline concentrations of both plasma and CSF NF-L were higher in participants with 2 SMN2 copies (678.5 and 12,250.0 pg/mL, respectively) than in participants with 3 SMN2 copies (12.9 and 383.0 pg/mL, respectively).

For the 16 participants (8 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 8 participants with 3 SMN2 copies) with baseline peroneal CMAP amplitude ≥ 2 mV and an absence of areflexia, baseline CHOP INTEND total score ranged from 35 through 60 with a median of 54.5 (median of 54.5 for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 52.0 for participants with 3 SMN2 copies). Baseline ulnar nerve CMAP amplitude ranged from 1.5 through 6.7 mV with a median of 3.20 mV (median of 3.20 mV for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 3.40 mV for participants with 3 SMN2 copies). Baseline peroneal nerve CMAP amplitude  ranged  from  2.5  through  9.7  mV  with  a  median  of  4.0  mV  (median  of  3.55  mV  for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 4.20 mV for participants with 3 SMN2 copies).

## SMA Data Siblings

The collection of SMA data of affected siblings was added in Protocol Version 4. Data were available for a total of 25 evaluable siblings with SMA of 19 participants in the ITT Set. Sibling data related to SMN2 copy number, age at SMA symptom onset, age when enrolled in a clinical trial or initiated on commercial nusinersen, survival, ventilator use, and age when sitting and walking were achieved are presented in Appendix 16.2.6, Table 8.

SMN2 copy  number  was  available  for  17  untreated  siblings  of  14  participants  who  received nusinersen in this study. Eight of the 14 treated participants had 2 SMN2 copies, 5 participants had 3 SMN2 copies,  and  1  participant  had  3 SMN2 copies  at  exon  7  and  2  SMN2  copies  at  exon  8. Consistent with the concordance often observed in siblings with SMA [Jones 2020; Medrano 2016], the reported SMN2 copy number for the untreated siblings was the same as that of the treated participants.

## Baseline Medical History

In the ITT Set, 11 participants (44%) had a reported medical history finding. Baseline medical history by SOC and PT included the following:

- Pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions: jaundice neonatal (5 participants [20%])
- Congenital, familial, and genetic disorders: macrocephaly, polydactyly, and tethered oral tissue (1 participant [4%] each)
- Ear and labyrinth disorders: middle ear effusion (1 participant [4%])
- Hepatobiliary disorders: hyperbilirubinemia (1 participant [4%])
- Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hypoglycaemia (1 participant [4%])
- Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: short stature (1 participant [4%])
- Surgical and medical procedures: circumcision (1 participant [4%])

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prior and Concomitant Treatments

Dose modifications were not permitted.

## Concomitant Medications

All 25 participants received at least 1 concomitant medication during the study. The most commonly used concomitant medications were paracetamol and ibuprofen (24 participants [96%]); propofol (23  participants  [92%]);  lidocaine/prilocaine  and  sodium  chloride  (19  participants  [76%]); midazolam  (18  participants  [72%]);  amoxicillin,  ondansetron,  and  sevoflurane  (17  participants [68%]); and lidocaine and nitrous oxide (16 participants [64%]). Lidocaine was primarily used as a prophylactic for LP pain whereas paracetamol was used for a variety of reasons, including fever and pain. None of the concomitant medications were used under an experimental protocol.

## Ancillary Procedures

All  25  participants  underwent  at  least  1  ancillary  procedure.  By  PT,  the  most  common  ancillary procedures were chest X-ray and SARS-COV-2 test (15 participants [60%] each). Five participants (20%) had echocardiograms, and 5 participants (20%), all with 2 copies of SMN2, underwent an ancillary procedure of gastrostomy.

## Protocol Deviations

Deviations were departures from the currently approved version of the protocol. A list of potential protocol deviations was generated by the SMT after the protocol was finalized. Major deviations are considered changes from the protocol that can affect data integrity or participant safety.

All deviations (major and minor) were captured by the Clinical Monitors on a Protocol Deviation log during routine monitoring visits. Periodically during the course of the study, key study team members (e.g., Biostatistician, Statistical Programmer, Data Manager, and Medical Director) review protocol deviations identified  from  the  clinical  database  via  programmed  data  listings  and  edit  checks,  in addition  to  deviations  captured  in  the  Protocol  Deviation  log,  to  identify  trends  that  required retraining  at  study  sites  or  a  protocol  amendment  and  to  identify  major  protocol  deviations  and determine whether they affect the planned statistical analysis.

A summary of the major protocol deviations that occurred on study for participants in the ITT Set is presented  in  Section  14.1,  Output  13.  Protocol  deviations  were  mostly  minor  and  consisted  of deviations  in  laboratory  assessment  criteria,  study  procedures  criteria,  visit  schedule  criteria, informed consent, and other criteria. All 25 participants in the ITT Set had at least 1 major protocol deviation. The most common major deviations were laboratory assessment criteria, study procedures criteria, and visit schedule criteria. No participant discontinued study treatment due to the protocol deviations. The major protocol deviations did not affect data integrity.

## Serious Breaches of Good Clinical Practice

No serious breaches of GCP occurred during the study.

## Exposure and Study Treatment Compliance

## Exposure

Participants received loading doses of nusinersen (12 mg scaled equivalent) by IT injection on Days 1, 15, 29, and 64, followed by maintenance doses of nusinersen (12 mg scaled equivalent; upon implementation of Protocol Version 6, all participants received fixed 12-mg doses) by IT injection approximately every 4 months until Day 2801, for a total of 27 doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Twenty-two participants (88%) received all 27 doses, 2 participants (8%) received 20 doses, and 1 participant (4%) received 21 doses. The mean and median numbers of doses were 26.2 and 27.0, respectively. All participants were on the study for at least 5 years, 24 participants (96%) were on study for at least 6 years, 22 participants (88%) were on study for at least 7 years, and 2 participants (8%) were on study for at least 8 years. The mean (median) time on study was 2820.4 (2892.0) days (range: 2155 through 3024 days), corresponding to 7.72 (7.92) years (range: 5.9 through 8.3 years), with a total of 193.05 participant-years on study.

## Dose Modification

Dose modifications were not permitted.

## COVID-19 Impact

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 9 of the 25 participants (36%) were unable to be dosed as planned at their original study site. Four participants received at least 1 dose at an alternative study site, and 5 participants received commercial dose for at least 1 visit.

## Efficacy results

Efficacy analyses are presented separately for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and those with 3 SMN2 copies as detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Primary endpoint

- Five  participants  (all  with  2  SMN2  copies)  met  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  and  had respiratory  intervention  (defined  as  either  invasive  or  non-invasive ventilation  for  ≥  6 hours/day  continuously  for  ≥  7  days  or  tracheostomy).  No  participants  died  or  required tracheostomy.
- Four of the 5 participants who met the primary endpoint required respiratory intervention in the context of acute, reversible infections. All 5 of these participants continued to gain motor milestones
- None of the participants required permanent ventilation (≥  16 -hour ventilation/day continuously for &gt; 21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event or tracheostomy).
- Only the 5 participants who reached the primary endpoint of the study received ventilation for ≥ 6 hours/day continuously for ≥ 1 day or tracheostomy.

## Secondary endpoints

- Protocol-predefined symptoms of SMA were observed in 12 participants (10 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 2 participants with 3 SMN2 copies ) on Day 365 (13 months of age) and in 7 participants (all with 2 SMN2 copies) on Day 700 (24 months of age). The most common  reason  was  weight  &lt;  5 th percentile,  decrease  of  ≥  2  major  weight  growth  curve percentiles, or failure to achieve age-appropriate milestones. All of these participants continued to grow, gain weight, and achieve milestones over time.
- Five of the 6 participants who did not achieve WHO motor milestones on time on Day 700 also failed on another criteria of clinical manifestation of SMA.
- On Day 365, for participants with 2 SMN2 copies, 5 (33%) had weight below the 5th percentile and  5  (33%)  had  weight  dropping  2  or  more  major  percentiles  compared  to  baseline.  No participants with 3 SMN2 copies met either of these criteria. On Day 700, for participants with 2 SMN2 copies, 4 (27%) had weight below the 5th percentile and 5 (33%) had weight dropping 2 or more major percentiles compared to baseline. No participants with 3 SMN2 copies met either of these criteria.
- HINE motor milestones were only assessed and are reported up to Day 778. Achievement of HINE motor milestones increased from baseline to Day 659 and remained stable to Day 778. The mean total score in participants with 2 SMN2 copies was 23.9, ranging from 16 through 26. All  participants  with  3 SMN2 copies  reached  the  maximum  total  score  of  26  as  of  the  last assessment. All 25 participants achieved the maximum level for head control (i.e., all the time maintained upright), sitting (i.e., stable sit or pivot), voluntary grasp (i.e., pincer grasp), rolling (i.e.,  supine  to  prone  or  prone  to  supine),  and  kicking  (i.e.,  touches  toes).  Eleven  of  15 participants  (73%)  with  2 SMN2 copies  and  all  10  participants  (100%)  with  3 SMN2 copies achieved the maximum level for crawling and standing, and 10 of 15 participants (67%) with 2 SMN2 copies and all 10 participants (100%) with 3 SMN2 copies achieved the maximum level for walking .

- Achievement of WHO motor milestones increased steadily from baseline, and all participants who achieved a milestone on study were able to demonstrate the milestone at the last study visit. At the last observed visit, all 15 participants with 2 SMN2 copies achieved the WHO motor milestones of sitting without support and standing with assistance. The majority of participants with 2 SMN2 copies achieved hands-and-knees crawling (93%), walking with assistance (93%), standing alone (93%), and all walking alone (87%). All 10 participants with 3 SMN2 copies achieved all 6 WHO motor milestones.
- From baseline to the last study visit, all 15 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and all 10 participants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with 3 SMN2 copies in the ITT Set achieved improvements in the CHOP INTEND total score. Twelve of 15 participants (80%) with 2 SMN2 copies and 10 of 10 participants (100%) with 3 SMN2 copies) achieved the highest attainable CHOP INTEND score of 64 at any point during the study. Participants with 3 SMN2 copies had higher scores than participants with 2 SMN2 copies at most visits, but the final change from baseline was generally similar in both cohorts.

- HFMSE was collected from 2 years of age but could have been initiated at later visits depending on the ability of the participants. Baseline was defined as the first evaluable assessment. At first evaluable assessment after 2 years of age, the mean total HFMSE scores were 34.5 and 46.4 for participants with 2 SMN2 copies and 3 SMN2 copies, respectively. Forty-eight months after the first assessment, the mean score for participants with 2 SMN2 copies increased to 52.3 of a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maximum possible score of 66 (mean change from baseline of 18.7) and the mean score for participants with 3 SMN2 copies increased to 64.9 of a maximum possible score of 66 (mean change from baseline of 20.0). Considering the last study visit, on Day 2891 (rather than using the  baseline  of  the  first  evaluable  assessment),  the  mean  (minimum,  maximum)  score  for participants with 2 SMN2 copies was 56.1 (30, 66) of a maximum possible score of 66 and the mean score for participants with 3 SMN2 copies was 65.9 (65, 66) of a maximum possible score of 66.

- Five participants, all with 2 SMN2 copies, had a percutaneous gastric tube inserted during the study.
- Eight of 15 participants with 2 SMN2 copies had peroneal (anterior tibialis) measured at baseline ≥ 2 mV and reflex present on HINE-1 assessment. Eight of 10 participants with 3 SMN2 copies had peroneal (anterior  tibialis)  measured  at  baseline  ≥  2  mV  and  reflex  present  on  HINE -1 assessment.
- o One of the 8 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and none of the 8 participants with 3 SMN2 copies required respiratory intervention.
- o All of the 8 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and all of the 8 participants with 3 SMN2 copies achieved all WHO motor milestones.
- o None of the 8 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and none of the 8 participants with 3 SMN2 copies required a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube prior to 24 months of age.
- o One of the 8 participants with 2 SMN2 copies and none of the 8 participants with 3 SMN2 copies  displayed  clinically  manifested  SMA  symptoms  (as  per  secondary  endpoint)  by  24 months of age.
- Ulnar CMAP amplitudes at baseline had a wide range across participants with 2 and 3 SMN2 copies (1.0 through 6.7 mV and 1.8 through 4.9 mV, respectively). Mean CMAP amplitudes were 2.69 and 3.11 mV, respectively.
- Ulnar and peroneal mean CMAP amplitudes increased over the course of the study in participants with 2 and 3 SMN2 copies. Improvement in ulnar CMAP amplitudes in participants with 3 SMN2 copies was consistently higher throughout the study compared to those with 2 SMN2 copies. For peroneal CMAP amplitudes, mean values were similar in participants with 2 and 3 SMN2 copies up to Day 1611. After Day 1611, mean peroneal CMAP values stabilized in participants with 3 SMN2 copies while they continued to increase in participants with 2 SMN2 copies. Mean CMAP amplitudes  did  not  decrease  compared  with  baseline,  which  is  normally  associated  with  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

development of SMA.

- Participants were able to comply with and undertake 6MWT assessments at different times. Mean 6MWT distances, on average, increased with time and were higher in participants with 3 SMN2 copies compared to those with 2 SMN2 copies.
- Annualized rates of respiratory events over time were higher in participants with 2 SMN2 copies than in those with 3 SMN2 copies. Rates decreased over the study in participants with 2 SMN2 copies and remained low but constant in participants with 3 SMN2 copies.
- Serious respiratory events occurred in participants with 2 SMN2 copies but not in those with 3 SMN2 copies. Annualized rates decreased over the study in participants with 2 SMN2 copies.

- Choking, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure were the preferred terms (PTs) driving the AEs in participants with 2 SMN2 copies, and these terms are in keeping with symptoms of the SMA disease.
- Based on the HINE-1 item suck/swallow assessment up to Day 788, 12 of 15 participants with 2 SMN2 copies maintained a normal suck/swallow function from baseline to the last assessment. None of the participants with 3 SMN2 copies showed a decline in suck/swallow function.
- Five  participants  with  2 SMN2 copies  demonstrated consistent bulbar disability on the PASA questionnaire.

Other participants with 2 SMN2 copies demonstrated more consistent retention of normal function and did not require a gastric tube. Participants with 3 SMN2 copies maintained normal or nearnormal scores.

| Laboratory Parameters, ECGs, and Vital Signs | • Overall, results for haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, vital signs, and ECGs were not suggestive of any new safety concerns. • No participants had an AE of thrombocytopenia. No participants had an AE associated with coagulation disorders. • Two participants (8%) had an AE of protein urine present. Both events were mild in severity and assessed as possibly related to study treatment by the Investigator. Two participants (8%) had an AE of proteinuria. One event was mild in severity and assessed as possibly related to study treatment. The other event was moderate in severity assessed as unlikely related to study treatment. There were no AEs of acute kidney injury. |
| Neurological Examinations                    | Results for neurological assessments were not suggestive of any new safety concerns. The majority of AEs related to neurologic examinations were events expected in the natural history of SMA such as muscle weakness, gait disturbance, or hypotonia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Immunological Assessments                    | Five of 25 participants (20%) had treatment- emergent anti-nusinersen antibodies, of which 1 participant (4%) had transient anti-nusinersen antibodies and 4 participants (16%) had persistent anti-nusinersen antibodies. No discernible effects of ADAs on efficacy or safety were observed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Adverse Events

## Overall Summary of Adverse Events

All AEs were classified and coded using MedDRA version 27.1. If a participant had the same event more than once, it was counted only once in the incidence for that event. All AEs were analysed based on the principle of treatment emergence. An AE was regarded as treatment emergent if it was present prior to the first dose of study treatment and subsequently worsened or was not present prior to the first dose of study treatment but subsequently appeared.

All 25 participants experienced at least 1 AE.

The most common AEs  by  SOC  (≥  50%  of  participants)  were  Infections  and  infestations  (24 participants  [96%]  with  433  events);  Respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  (24 participants  [96%] with  218 events); General disorders and administration site conditions (23 participants [92%] with 140 events); Gastrointestinal disorders (22 participants [88%] with 121 events); Nervous system disorders (22 participants [88%] with 76 events); Investigations (20 participants  [80%]  with  62  events);  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (18 participants [72%] with 95 events); Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (18 participants [72%] with 58 events); and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (15 participants [60%] with 33 events).

By PT, the most common AEs (reported in &gt; 70% of participants) were pyrexia (22 participants [88%] with 120 events), upper respiratory tract infection (18 participants [72%] with 71 events), nasopharyngitis (18 participants [72%] with 68 events), and cough (18 participants [72%] with 61 events). In total, 1394 events were reported across all participants. The most common AE by number of events was pyrexia (120 events [9%] in 22 participants).

## Analysis by Severity

The  severity  of  each  AE  was  assessed  by  the  Investigator  as  mild,  moderate,  or  severe.  If  a participant experienced the same AE multiple times, the event with the maximum severity was counted.

Eight  of  the  25  participants  (32%)  experienced  a  severe  AE.  Thirteen  participants  (52%) experienced an AE with the maximum severity of moderate, and the remaining 4 participants (16%) experienced an AE with the maximum severity of mild.

The most common SOCs for severe AEs were Infections and infestations (5 participants [20%]) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3 participants [12%]). Severe events in all other SOCs were reported for individual participants only. By PT, the most common severe AE was pneumonia (2 participants [8%]), with all other severe AEs reported for individual participants only.

## Analysis by Relationship to Study Treatment

The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study treatment as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or related. If a participant experienced the same AE multiple times, the event with the most conservative assessment was counted.

No  participants  experienced  AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment,  as  assessed  by  the Investigator. Eleven participants (44%) experienced AEs considered to be possibly related to study treatment, 5 participants (20%) experienced AEs with the strongest relationship considered to be unlikely related to study treatment, and 9 participants (36%) experienced only AEs considered to be not related to study treatment.

The following AEs were considered to be possibly related to study treatment: hyperreflexia and protein urine present (2 participants [8%] each) and alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood calcium increased, clonus, dermatitis  allergic,  eosinophil  count  increased,  extensor  plantar  response,  lymphocyte  count increased, muscular weakness, musculoskeletal procedural complication, platelet count increased, post lumbar puncture syndrome, proteinuria, pyrexia, rash, tachycardia, and white blood cell count increased (1 participant [4%] each).

## Analysis by Relationship to Lumbar Puncture Procedure

The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to the LP procedure as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or related. In cases where 1 participant had multiple AEs related to LP, the AE with the strongest relationship to the LP procedure was used in the calculation of incidence by relationship to the LP procedure.

Twelve participants (48%) experienced an AE considered related to the LP procedure, as assessed by the Investigator. Three participants (12%) experienced an AE with the strongest relationship of possibly related to LP, 1 participant (4%) experienced an AE with the strongest relationship of unlikely related to LP, and 9 participants (36%) experienced only AEs considered not related to LP. AEs considered by the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  the  LP  procedure  included  post  lumbar  puncture  syndrome  (6 participants  [24%]);  procedural  pain  (5  participants  [20%]);  and  post  procedural  complication, musculoskeletal procedural complication, post procedural swelling, procedural vomiting, and subdural hematoma (1 participant [4%] each). All AEs considered by the Investigator to be related to the LP procedure resolved.

## Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Events

## Deaths

No deaths were reported during the study.

## Serious Adverse Events

Fourteen participants (56%) experienced at least 1 SAE, with a total of 71 SAEs reported. The most frequently reported SAEs were pneumonia (5 participants [20%]); respiratory syncytial virus  infection  and  choking  (3  participants  [12%]  each);  and  respiratory  syncytial  virus bronchiolitis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory distress, respiratory failure, dehydration, pyrexia, and tonsillectomy (2 participants [8%] each). All other SAEs were reported for 1 participant each (4%).

All SAEs resolved or downgraded to nonserious AEs. No treatment-emergent SAEs were assessed as possibly related or related to study treatment by the Investigator. No participants experienced SAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  from  study  treatment  or  withdrawal  from  the  study.  No participants experienced SAEs with a fatal outcome.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

There were no AEs of special interest specified in the protocol for this study.

## Discontinuation of Study Treatment Due to Adverse Events

No participants experienced AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment.

## Withdrawal From Study Due to Adverse Events

No participants experienced AEs that led to withdrawal from the study.

## Dose Modifications Due to Adverse Events

Dose modifications were not permitted.

## Clinical Laboratory Results

Laboratory  assessments,  including  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  urinalysis,  and  coagulation were conducted according to the Schedule of Activities. Results of laboratory assessments were summarized using shift tables, presenting changes relative to each parameter's normal range. Each participant's laboratory values were classified according to whether the test result was 'low' (i.e., below the lower limit of normal), 'normal' (within the normal range), or 'high' (i.e., above the ULN). If a participant was missing a baseline value but had a postbaseline value, then the baseline assessment was labelled as 'unknown.' Likewise, if a participant had a baseline value but had  no  postbaseline  values,  then  the  minimum  and  maximum  were  labelled  as  'unknown.' Postbaseline laboratory results are defined as any assessment taken after the first dose, including data collected from local laboratories.

Laboratory  actual  values  and  changes  from  baseline  were  also  presented.  Laboratory  values outside the normal range were identified in the listings.

## Haematology Results

Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes over time for the haematology analytes. In general, parameter shifts from baseline to abnormal values for individual participants were mild and transient.

AEs  associated  with  shifts  in  haematology  values  included  anaemia  in  7  participants  (28%); neutropenia, iron deficiency anaemia, lymphocyte count increased, neutrophil count increased, platelet count increased, and white blood cell count increased in 2 participants (8%) each; and eosinophilia,  hypochromic  anaemia,  lymphadenopathy,  lymphocytosis,  neutrophilia,  eosinophil count increased, and haemoglobin decreased in 1 participant (4%) each.

Of  the  7  participants  with  the  event  of  anaemia,  5  participants  experienced  events  with  the maximum severity of mild and 2 participants experienced moderate events of anaemia, with some participants experiencing &gt; 1 event. Six participants experienced events assessed as not related to study treatment, and 1 participant experienced an event assessed as unlikely related to study treatment). At the end of the study, events in 5 participants resolved and events in 3 participants were ongoing.

One event of neutropenia was assessed as mild in severity, and 1 event was assessed as moderate in severity. All other AEs associated with haematology parameters were mild in severity and were considered to be unlikely or not related to study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  participants  experienced  shifts  in  platelet  counts  and  platelet  count  increased  was reported as an AE in 2 participants, counts generally remained stable over time and there were no AEs of thrombocytopenia reported.

## Blood Chemistry Results

## Liver Function Tests

Examination of postbaseline values relative to ULNs for liver enzymes showed the following:

- Eleven of 25 participants (44%) had ALT values &gt; ULN. Two participants (8%) had ALT values &gt; 10 × ULN, and 1 participant (4%) had ALT values &gt; 20× ULN.
- Ten of 25 participants (40%) had AST values &gt; ULN. Two participants (8%) had AST values &gt; 5× ULN, and 1 participant (4%) had AST values &gt; 10× ULN.
- Seven of 25 participants (28%) had total bilirubin values &gt; ULN. Three participants (12%) had total bilirubin values &gt; 2 × ULN.
- No participants had AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN with concurrent total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN.
- Eight of 25 participants (32%) had alkaline phosphate values &gt; ULN. Three participants (12%) had alkaline phosphate values &gt; 1.5 × ULN.

AEs associated with changes in liver function test parameters were AST increased (2 participants [8%]),  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased  (2  participants  [8%]),  and  ALT  increased  (1 participant [4%]). All of these events resolved without the need for treatment discontinuation.

## Kidney Function Tests

Five of 25 participants (20%) had a shift in creatinine from baseline to high; however, there were no AEs of acute kidney injury reported. There was 1 AE of cystatin C increased; this event was mild in severity and assessed as unlikely to be related to study treatment by the Investigator. The dose was not changed, and the participant recovered.

## Other Blood Chemistry Tests

AEs associated with changes in clinical laboratory parameters were hypocalcaemia, blood calcium increased, blood glucose decreased, hypoglycaemia, and vitamin D deficiency. All events resolved without  the  need  for  study  treatment  modification,  with  the  exception  of  2  events  of  vitamin  D deficiency in 2 participants, which were ongoing as of the end of the study. Both ongoing events of vitamin D deficiency were mild and considered to be not related to study treatment.

## Urinalysis Results

Seventeen of 25 participants (68%) had at least 1 positive postbaseline urinary protein result, and 13 of 25 participants (52%) had at least 2 positive postbaseline urinary protein results. Eight of 25 participants (32%) had 2 or more consecutive positive urinary protein results.

Two participants (8%) experienced AEs of protein urine present; both events were mild in severity and assessed as possibly related to study treatment by the Investigator. Two participants (8%) experienced AEs of proteinuria; the event in 1 participant (4%) was mild in severity and assessed as possibly related to study treatment. The other event in 1 participant (4%) was moderate in severity and assessed as unlikely related to study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Coagulation Results

There were no clinically meaningful changes over time for the coagulation studies. No participants experienced an AE associated with coagulation disorders.

## Vital Sign Measurements, Physical Examination Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

## Vital Sign Measurements

With  the  exception  of  pyrexia,  AEs  associated  with  vital  sign  abnormalities  were  infrequently reported. Twenty-two participants (88%) had at least 1 AE of pyrexia, 6 participants (24%) had AEs of tachycardia, 4 participants (16%) had AEs of respiratory disorder, 3 participants (12%) had AEs of dyspnoea, and 2 participants each (8%) had AEs of respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and breath  sounds  abnormal.  All  other  events  were  reported  by  1  participant  (4%)  and  included hypertension, heart rate increased, body temperature increased, oxygen saturation decreased, and acute respiratory failure.

## ECG Findings

No clinically significant abnormal ECG results, including AEs of prolonged QT interval, were reported.

## Echocardiogram Findings

One  participant  (4%)  with  data  available  had  a  clinically  significant  abnormal  echocardiogram finding.  AEs  of  aortic  dilatation  and  pulmonary  artery  dilatation  were  reported  for  the  same participant.  Both  events  were  mild,  not  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  study treatment, and ongoing as of the end of the study.

## Neurological Examinations

The HINE (Sections 1 and 3) was conducted in all participants ≤ 24 months of age. This standard examination is a quantitative scorable method for assessing the neurological development of infants between 2 and 24 months of age. The examination includes assessment of cranial nerve functions, posture,  movements,  tone,  and  reflexes.  For  all  participants  &gt;  24  months  of  age,  standard neurological examinations were conducted, including mental status, level of consciousness, sensory function, motor function, cranial nerve function, and reflexes.

Results for neurological assessments were not suggestive of any new safety concerns. The majority of AEs related to neurologic examinations were events expected in the natural history of SMA such as muscle weakness, gait disturbance, or hypotonia.

## Immunological Assessments

Five  of  25  participants  (20%)  had  treatment-emergent  anti-nusinersen  antibodies,  of  which  1 participant (4%) had transient anti-nusinersen antibodies and 4 participants (16%) had persistent anti-nusinersen antibodies. No discernible effects of ADAs on efficacy or safety were observed.

The incidence of AEs selected by anaphylactic reaction SMQ, angioedema SMQ, and hypersensitivity SMQ was evaluated for participants by antibody status postbaseline. No new safety concerns were identified after comparing AE frequency in these SMQ results between participants with positive antinusinersen antibody status and participants with negative anti-nusinersen antibody status.

## Pharmacokinetic results

CSF and Plasma samples were collected at protocol designated times for ISIS 396443 pharmacokinetic assessments in the Pharmacokinetic Population. The Pharmacokinetic Population includes all subjects who  are  dosed  and  for  which  there  is  at  least  one  evaluable  post-dose  procedure  pharmacokinetic sample. The PK Set was the same as the ITT Set, thus considering all 25 enrolled participants.

## CSF Nusinersen Concentrations

The geometric mean nusinersen CSF concentrations are plotted over time in Figure 11. After 2 loading doses, nusinersen CSF concentrations accumulated approximately 2.0-fold with a predose mean (SD) of 29.40  (20.104)  ng/mL  on  Day  29.  With  additional  dosing,  predose  mean  (SD)  CSF  concentrations declined and were maintained at 14.62 (8.860) ng/mL on Day 183 and 14.49 (5.164) ng/mL on Day 1611. The mean values from Days 183 through 1611 ranged from 10.70 through 16.68 ng/mL. The mean (SD) predose CSF concentration on the last sampling day (Day 2801) was 19.07 (8.666) ng/mL.

<!-- image -->

Interparticipant variabilities (%CV) in nusinersen CSF concentrations (Days 15 through 2801) were low to high and ranged from 35% to 78%. Nusinersen CSF concentrations were similar between participants with 2 and 3 SMN2 copies.

## Plasma Nusinersen Concentrations

The geometric mean plasma nusinersen concentrations are plotted over time in Figure 12. As expected, there was no accumulation in plasma concentration of nusinersen after multiple doses. The highest mean (SD) plasma concentration (524.58 [387.425] ng/mL) was observed after the first PK sample at 4 hours postdose on Day 1 and approximated the maximum concentration observed at 2 hours postdose in previous studies. Mean (SD) plasma concentrations declined rapidly by Day 64 to 1.70 (0.736) ng/mL. The mean (SD) plasma concentration on the last sampling day (Day 2801) was 0.41 (0.155) ng/mL.

Interparticipant variabilities (%CV) plasma nusinersen concentrations (Days 64 through 2801) were low to  high  and  ranged  from  25%  to  61%.  Nusinersen  plasma  concentrations  were  similar  between participants with 2 and 3 SMN2 copies.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH has presented the final report for study 232SM201.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Regarding PK, although no definitive PK analysis was made and only a descriptive one was presented, the observed values are in accordance to what was previously known and described in the SmPC of Spinraza: A CSF steady state occurring at around 7-8 years of treatment and no accumulation of plasma concentrations over time. No major additional findings were observed.

## Efficacy

The use of Nusinersen in pre-symptomatic patients (or paucisymptomatic patients with SMN2 two copies, which as a group were lower performers at the time of enrolment as compared to patients with 3 SMN2 copies) has shown that it has a significant impact on the disease expression and prognosis. Only 5 out of 25 patients (and all in SMN2 two copies population) have achieved the primary endpoint, and four in relation to an intercurrent event, recovering afterwards.

All patients have acquired and retained milestones. For those with SMN2 two copies, ambulation without help  does  not  occur  according  to  natural  history  of  the  disease,  and  was  achieved  in  87%  of  these patients. In the SMN2 three copies population, all patients achieved the 6 (WHO) motor milestones and there were no signs of a halt or reversion of acquired milestones.

Dysphagia was observed in three of the SMN2 two copies population only, which would be expected in 100% of this population.

Overall, it is reasonable to consider that start of treatment in pre-symptomatic patients results in greater milestone acquisition than in natural history, with signs of sustained improvement or stabilisation and virtually no worsening not related to intercurrent illnesses.

There was no comparison to a delayed treatment start. However, if the results are compared to the patients who participated in the pivotal trials that led to MAH, it is evident that the achievement of milestones occurs earlier on average and the improvement is more sustained.

## Safety

The safety profile of nusinersen in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of nusinersen 12 mg and previous clinical findings. Overall, no new safety concerns were identified during the study, being most AEs and SAEs consistent with those commonly observed in paediatric or SMA populations.

In  this  small  study  (25  patients),  all  participants  experienced  at  least  1  AE;  the  most  common  AEs (reported  in  &gt;  70%  of  participants)  were  pyrexia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  cough,  and nasopharyngitis.  No  participants  experienced  AEs  considered  to  be  related  to  study  treatment,  as assessed by the Investigator. Eleven participants (44%) experienced AEs considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to study treatment, and 12 participants (48%) experienced AEs considered by the Investigator to be related to the LP procedure.

No  deaths  were  reported,  and  no  participants  experienced  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study treatment or withdrawal from the study. A total of 14 (56%) participants experienced at least 1 SAE, none of which were assessed as possibly related or related to study treatment by the Investigator. No participants experienced SAEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study. The SAEs that occurred in &gt; 5% of participants were pneumonia (20%); respiratory syncytial virus infection and choking (12% each); and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, upper respiratory tract  infection,  respiratory  distress,  respiratory  failure,  dehydration,  pyrexia,  and  tonsillectomy  (8% each).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  results  for  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  urinalysis,  coagulation,  vital  signs,  ECG,  and neurological assessments were not suggestive of any new safety concerns. No discernible effects of ADAs on safety were observed.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of study 232SM201 show that nusinersen is efficacious in the pre-symptomatic population with 2 or 3 SMN2 copies.
