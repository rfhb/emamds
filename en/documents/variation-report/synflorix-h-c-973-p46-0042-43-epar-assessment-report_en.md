10PN-PD-DIT-009; A  phase  II,  observer-blind  follow-up  study  with  two  groups  to  assess  the reactogenicity  and  immunogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK1024850A), when either given as a booster dose in primed children or as a two-dose catch-up immunization in unprimed children

##  Description

A  phase  II,  observer-blind  follow-up  study  with  two  groups  to  assess  the  reactogenicity  and immunogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine (GSK1024850A), when either given as a booster dose (at 20-23 months of age) in children previously primed with three doses of the study vaccine, or when given as a two-dose catch-up immunization (at 18-21 and 20-23 months of age) in unprimed children, all previously enrolled in the 10PN-PD-DIT-005 primary vaccination study. The study was conducted in Chile.

##  Methods

- Objective(s)

## Primary:

- To assess the reactogenicity of study vaccines in terms of the occurrence of adverse events with intensity grade 3.

## Secondary:

- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine after the administration of any vaccine dose.
- To  assess,  12  to  15  months  after  completion  of  the  3-dose  primary  vaccination  course,  the persistence  of  antibodies  induced  by  GSK  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate vaccine.
- To  assess,  one  month  post-booster,  the  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals'  10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in subjects primed with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
- To assess, one month after the second catch-up dose, the immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' 10- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in subjects primed with hepatitis A vaccine.
- To assess, three months after the hepatitis A dose, the immunogenicity of hepatitis A vaccine, when co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, in subjects unprimed with hepatitis A vaccine.
- Study design

Observer-blind follow-up study with two groups:

- Primed  10V  group  (referred  as  'HAV-Pn'  in  result  tables  and  figures):  approximately  120 subjects received hepatitis A + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (dose 1) and 10Pn-PD-DiT (dose 2).
- Unprimed  10V  group  (referred  as  'Pn-Pn'  in  result  tables  and  figures):  approximately  120 subjects  received  10Pn-PD-DiT  +  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  (catch-up  dose  1)  and  10Pn-PD-DiT (catch-up dose 2).

Booster vaccination study of the primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-005 (106208) at 18-21 and 20-23 months of age, with at least 2 months between the 2 vaccinations.

Two blood samples were collected: prior to dose 1 and one month post-dose 2.

- Study population /Sample size

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

- Male or female between, and including 18-21 months of age at the time of vaccination.
- Subjects who received 3 doses of study or control vaccines in the primary vaccination study 10PNPD- DIT-005 (106208).
- Written informed consent obtained from the parents or guardians of the subject.
- Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination before entering into the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The sample size was contingent on the number of subjects eligible after the primary course. In the primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-005 (106208), 240 subjects (120 subjects per group) were planned  to  be  enrolled.  Assuming  that  approximately  10%  of  these  subjects  might  not  enter  the booster  study,  one  could  consider  approximately  216  subjects  receiving  the  booster  doses  (108 subjects in each group).

- Statistical Methods

## Safety/reactogenicity:

## Descriptive analyses:

- Incidence of solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and  general  adverse  events  during  the  31-day postvaccination  follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and overall, according to the type of adverse event, the intensity and relationship to vaccination;
- Incidence of each local and each general solicited adverse events reported during the 4-day postvaccination  follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and overall, according to the type of adverse events, the intensity and relationship to vaccination;
- The  percentages  of  subjects  with  an  unsolicited  adverse  events  reported  within  the  31-day postvaccination  follow-up  period  were  summarized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA),  with  95%  CI  according  to  the  intensity  and  relationship  to vaccination;
- Prevalence of concomitant antipyretic/medication during the 4-day post-vaccination follow-up period was computed with 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall;

- SAEs recorded throughout the entire study period starting from Visit 1 up to the end of the extended 6 months safety follow-up were described in detail.

## Immunogenicity:

## Descriptive analyses:

- Geometric mean antibody concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.
- Seropositivity rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.
- The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed by using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution curves for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.
- Geometric mean of ratios of opsonophagocytic titres/ELISA antibody concentrations with 95% CIs  was  tabulated  for  each  appropriate  pneumococcal  serotype  at  each  applicable  blood sampling time point.

##  Results

- Recruitment/ Number analysed

## Demography:

Out of the 163 enrolled subjects, 155 completed the study. The mean age at the first visit (dose 1) was 18.3 months. Overall, 50.9% of the subjects were female and 99.4% were White/Caucasian.

## · Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity:

The  analysis  was  performed  on  the  ATP  cohort  of  antibody  persistence  or  on  the  ATP  cohort  of immunogenicity according  to  the  objective.  Data  on  OPA  analysis  and  the  immune  response  to  the hepatitis A vaccine need to be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small sample size of the groups. The results are summarized in Table 31 and 32 below.

## Persistence:

At least 88.9% of subjects in the HAV-Pn group remained seropositive (antibody concentrations  ≥  0.05  µg/mL)  to  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes  indicative  for persistence  of  the  antibodies  to  the  pneumococcal  vaccine  antigens  15  to  18  months  after completion of the three-dose primary vaccination course.

Before administration of dose 1 in the booster vaccination study, the percentage of subjects in the 10Pn group with opsonophagocytic activity ≥ 8 was at least 86.4% for serotypes 7F, 9V, 14 and 23F and between 38.9% and 65.0% for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 18C.

All  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn  group  remained  seropositive  for  antibodies  against  hepatitis  A indicative for persistence of the immune response to the hepatitis A vaccine 15 to 18 months after completion of the three-dose primary vaccination course (data not shown in this AR).

## Booster response to the pneumococcal vaccine:

One month following the 2-dose catch-up vaccination in the Pn-Pn group, the percentage of subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 µg/mL was high (over 94.0%) and in  the  same  range  compared  to  the  HAV-Pn  group  for  most  serotypes  except  serotype  6B

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(84.3% in the Pn-Pn group and 97.4% in the HAV-Pn group). The antibody GMCs were lower for serotypes 1, 5, 6B, 9V, 14, 19F and 23F in the Pn-Pn group compared to the HAV-Pn group (no  overlap  of  95%  CIs).  There  was  also  a  trend  for  lower  GMCs  for  the  other  vaccine pneumococcal serotypes in the Pn-Pn group compared to the HAV-Pn group. For the HAV-Pn group, for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, one month postdose 2, at least 96.2% of subjects had opsonophagocytic activity ≥8, except for serotype 6B (91.7%). One month post-dose 2, at least 95.2%  of the subjects in the Pn-Pn group had opsonophagocytic activity ≥ 8 except for serotypes 6B (48.1%), 1 (52.0%) and 5 (84.0%) and this percentage was lower for serotypes 1 and 6B compared to the HAV-Pn group (no overlap of 95% CIs). The OPA GMTs were lower for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 19F in the Pn-Pn group compared to the HAV-Pn group (no overlap of 95% CIs).

Assessor's comment: The OPA GMTs to serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 19F after two catch-up doses were considerably lower than the responses to a single booster dose in the previously primed infants. The percentage of subjects with OPA titers ≥8 were also low for serotypes 1 and 6B. Similarly low OPA responses  to  serotypes  1  and  5  were  seen  in  study  013,  assessed  in  the  original  MAA.  The  OPA responder rates after the primary three doses in group HAV-Pn were considerably higher for serotypes 1,  5  and  6B  compared  to  the  response  rate  after  2  catch-up  doses  the  Pn-Pn  group.  However,  the sample size is small and the 95% CI are wide in all cases, which preclude any firm conclusions. The MAH already has a FUM to evaluate the booster response following a 2-dose catch-up vaccination.

- Safety results

Safety/reactogenicity:

The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort.

Redness in the HAV-Pn group and pain in the Pn-Pn group were the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited  local  adverse  events  (maximum  15.3%)  whereas  pain  was the  most  frequently  reported  in both groups, regardless the injection site (51.5% and 66.0%, respectively).

No  increase  in  the  overall  incidence  of  local  adverse  events  was  observed  in  the  Pn-Pn  group  with consecutive doses of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine during the catch-up vaccination course.

The observed percentage of doses followed by at least one unsolicited adverse event, classified by the MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, was 35.3% in the HAV-Pn group and 41.3% in  the  Pn-Pn  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  adverse  event  in  both  groups  was bronchitis.

- MAH's conclusions
- Redness in the HAV-Pn group and pain in the Pn-Pn group were the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited local adverse events (maximum 15.3%). A low overall/dose incidence of most grade 3 solicited general adverse events (reported following maximum 5 doses and 12 doses in the HAV-Pn and Pn-Pn group, respectively) as well as those assessed by the investigator as causally  related  to  vaccination  was  observed  in  both  groups.  The  incidence  of  grade  3 unsolicited adverse events was low in both groups (reported following 4 doses and 3 doses in the  HAV-Pn  and  Pn-Pn  group,  respectively)  and  none  of  these  was  considered  as  causally related to vaccination.
- No  fatal  SAEs  were  reported.  One  subject  of  the  HAV-Pn  group  reported  a  SAE  during  the active phase of the study. The SAE was assessed by the investigator not to be causally related to the vaccination and resolved without sequelae.
- A  high  persistence  of  the  immune  response  to  the  pneumococcal  vaccine  antigens  and  the hepatitis  A  vaccine  15  to  18  months  after  completion  of  the  three-dose  primary  vaccination course was observed in the Pn group and HAV group, respectively.
- The immune response to the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine, one month following the 2-dose catch-up vaccination in the Pn-Pn group, was in the same range compared to the response observed one month following booster vaccination in group HAV-Pn for most serotypes except serotypes 1 and  6B  for  which  a  lower  percentage  of  subjects  with  opsonophagocytic  activity  ≥8  was observed.  All  subjects  in  each  group  had  measurable  antibodies  against  protein  D  (≥100 EL.U/mL).
- Three months after the administration of the hepatitis A vaccine in the HAV-Pn group, 94.7% of subjects were seropositive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The 10Pn-PD-DiT booster vaccination following a 3-dose primary vaccination course as well as a 2-dose catch-up vaccination in Chilean children in the second year of life were shown to be generally well tolerated and immunogenic.

Assessor's comments: See also specific comment on immunogenicity above. The MAH's safety conclusions are endorsed. The relatively low OPA responses to some serotypes, as seen in the original  MAA, enhances the concern that two catch-up doses may require a booster dose to provide protection. The MAH has a post-approval commitment to study booster vaccinations following the catch-up schedule.

10PN-PD-DIT-018; A phase IIIb, observer-blind, controlled study to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or  Prevenar  when  given  as  a  booster  dose  between  12-18  months  of  age  in  children  previously vaccinated  in  the  primary  study  10PN-PD-DIT-012  (107007)  with  either  GSK  Biologicals.  10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Prevenar.

##  Description

Phase  III,  multicentre,  multi-country,  double-blind  (observer-blind),  controlled  study  with  2  parallel groups that received the primary vaccination according to two different schedules (6-10-14 weeks of age schedule or 2-4-6 months of age schedule):

- -10Pn-PD-DiT group received GSK Biologicals. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
- -Prevenar group received Prevenar
-  Methods
- Objective(s)

Primary:

- To  demonstrate  that  a  booster  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate vaccine is non-inferior to Prevenar when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines, in terms of post-immunization booster reactions with rectal temperature &gt; 39.0°C in children at 12 to 18 months of age.

## Criteria for safety:

Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if one can rule out an increase, in terms of percentage of subjects with rectal temperature &gt;39.0°C (10Pn-PD-DiT group as compared to Prevenar group), above 5% + half  the  incidence  in  the  control  group  (=  the  null  hypothesis)  as  shown  by  a  one-sided  P-value  &lt; 2.5%.

Secondary:

- To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals  10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines at 12 to 18 months of age.
- To assess, one month post booster vaccination, the immunogenicity of a booster dose of GSK Biologicals  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine,  when  co-administered  with  DTPwHBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines at 12 to 18 months of age.
- To assess the antibody persistence, 7-12 months after completion of the 3-dose immunization course with GSK Biologicals. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT012 (107007).
- To assess the immunogenicity of a booster dose of GSK Biologicals DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV  vaccines  when  co-administered  with  GSK  Biologicals  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate vaccine or Prevenar at 12-18 months of age.
- Study design

Phase  III,  multicentre,  multi-country,  double-blind  (observer-blind),  controlled  study  with  2  parallel groups that received the primary vaccination according to two different schedules (6-10-14 weeks of age schedule or 2-4-6 months of age schedule):

- -10Pn-PD-DiT group received GSK Biologicals 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
- -Prevenar group received Prevenar

All  subjects  receiving  the  6-10-14  week  schedule  were  recruited  in  the  Philippines,  and  all  subjects receiving the 2-4-6 schedule were recruited in Poland.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study population /Sample size

Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

- Subjects  for  whom  the  investigator  believed  that  their  parents/guardians  could  and  would comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits).
- Male  or  female  between,  and  including,  12-18  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  booster vaccination.
- Male or female who previously participated in study 10PN-PD-DIT-012 (107007) and received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
- Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.
- Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination before entering into the study.

The  sample  size  was  contingent  on  the  number  of  subjects  eligible  after  the  primary  vaccination course.  In  the  primary  study  10PN-PD-DIT-012  (107007),  800  subjects  (600  in  10Pn-PD-DiT  group and 200 in Prevenar group) were planned to be enrolled. Assuming that approximately 15% of these subjects would not enter the booster study, one could consider approximately 680 subjects (510 in 10Pn-PD-DiT group and 170 in Prevenar group) receiving the booster dose.

## · Treatments

- Outcomes/endpoints

## Safety /reactogenicity:

- Occurrence of fever with rectal temperature &gt; 39°C within 4 days (days 0 to 3) after booster vaccination.
- Occurrence of solicited local symptoms (any and grade 3) within 4 days (day 0-day 3) after booster vaccination.
- Occurrence of solicited general symptoms (any and grade 3) within 4 days (day 0-day 3) after booster vaccination.
- Occurrence  of  unsolicited  adverse  events  within  31  days  (day  0-day  30)  after  booster vaccination.
- Occurrence of serious adverse events throughout the active phase of the study (Visit 1 to Visit 2).
- Occurrence of serious adverse events throughout the entire study period starting from Visit 1 up to the end of the extended 6-month safety follow-up (phone contact).

## Immunogenicity /efficacy:

- Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (22F-inhibition ELISA), prior to and one month post-booster dose.
- Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F, prior to and one month post-booster dose.
- Antibody concentrations to protein D (ELISA), prior to and one month post-booster dose.
- Antibody  concentrations  against  pneumococcal  cross-reactive  serotypes  6A  and  19A  (22F inhibition ELISA), prior to and one month post-booster dose.
- Statistical Methods

## Safety-inferential analysis:

- Standardized  asymptotic  95%  CIs  for  the  difference  between  groups  (10Pn-PD-DiT  group minus Prevenar group), in percentage of subjects reporting fever with rectal temperature &gt; 39.0°C after the booster vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The one-sided P-value for the null hypothesis that the increase in the percentage of subjects with rectal temperature &gt; 39.0°C (10Pn-PD-DiT group as compared to Prevenar group) was above 5% + half the incidence in the control group. The primary objective was reached if the P-value was below 2.5%.

## Safety-descriptive analysis:

- Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and/or  general  adverse  events  (AEs)  was calculated with exact 95% CI, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination.
- Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptoms reported during the 4-day (days 0-3)  follow-up  period  after  the  booster  vaccination  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination.
- The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited symptom reported up to 30 days after booster vaccination and classified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) were  summarized  with  exact  95%  CI.  The  same  tabulations  were  performed  for  unsolicited adverse events classified as grade 3, with causal relationship and with medically attended visit.
- Prevalence of concomitant medication during the 4-day (days 0-3) follow-up period after the booster vaccination was computed with exact 95% CI.
- Serious  adverse  events,  large  swelling  reactions  and  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  event(s) reported during the active phase of the study (Visit 1 to Visit 2) were described in detail.
- Serious adverse events recorded during the entire study period starting from Visit 1 up to the end of the extended 6 months safety follow-up were described in detail.

## Immunogenicity-descriptive analysis:

- Geometric mean antibody concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs), seropositivity/seroprotection/booster  immune  response  rates  were  calculated  with  their  95% CI for each group, each antigen/serotype and at each applicable blood sampling time point.
- Distribution  of  antibody  concentrations/titres  was  displayed  using  tables  and/or  reverse cumulative  curves  for  each  group,  each  antigen/serotype  and  at  each  applicable  blood sampling time point.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

Out  of  the  756  subjects  enrolled,  744  subjects  completed  the  active  phase  of  the  study  and  740 subjects were contacted during the extended safety follow-up. The mean age at booster vaccination was 16.7 months. Overall 46.7% of the subjects were female. All subjects in the 6-10-14 weeks + 1218 months of age schedule were Asian (Southeast Asian heritage) and all subjects in the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule were White/Caucasian.

- Efficacy results

## Persistence of antibodies against pneumococcal antigens and opsonophagocytic activity

A decline in antibody GMCs was observed in all groups in the time period between primary and booster vaccination for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes for which subjects were primed (Tables 35 and 36).

## Booster immune response to pneumococcal antigens

For each of the pneumococcal serotypes common to both vaccines, one month after the booster dose robust booster immune responses were observed in both groups for all serotypes (Tables 35 and 36).

## Immune responses to co-administered vaccines

Seropositivity/seroprotection/booster  vaccine  response  rates  for  antibodies  against  the  antigens contained  in  the  co-administered  DTPw-HBV/Hib  and  OPV  vaccines  were  in  line  with  previous observations for these co-administered vaccines (Data not shown in this AR).

## Confirmatory inferential analysis:

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  reached  as  the  upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  (5.59%)  of  the difference between groups (10Pn minus Prev) in terms of the percentage of subjects reporting fever with rectal temperature &gt; 39.0°C was below the pre-defined limit of 10.3% (P-value &lt; 0.1%). Thus a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine did not induce more fever with rectal temperature &gt; 39.0°C than Prevenar when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines (Table 18).

## Descriptive analysis:

6-10-14 weeks + 12-18 months of age schedule:

After booster vaccination, 85.7% of the subjects in the 10PnEPI group and 83.9% of the subjects in the PrevEPI group reported at least one adverse event (solicited or unsolicited, local or general).

The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  adverse  event  was  pain  in  both  groups  and  the  most frequently reported solicited general adverse event was irritability in both groups (Table 2).

Large swelling reactions were reported by 5 subjects (4 subjects in the 10PnEPI group and 1 subject in the  PrevEPI  group).  Four  of  these  large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  at  the  DTPw-HBV/Hib injection site and one at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site. All were local or diffuse swelling reactions not involving adjacent joints that resolved without sequelae.

No cases of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature &gt; 40° C) were reported in any of the groups (Table 3). Low incidences of grade 3 solicited general adverse events, assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination, were reported in both groups (maximum 4.3%).

The observed percentage of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited adverse event within 31 days after booster vaccination was 8.9% in the 10PnEPI group and 9.7% in the PrevEPI group. Up to 0.7% of  the  subjects  reported  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  with  grade  3  intensity.  None  of  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported  unsolicited  adverse  events  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to vaccination.

2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule: After  booster  vaccination,  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  (solicited  or  unsolicited,  local  or general) was reported in both groups compared to the incidence reported in the 6-10-14 weeks + 1218 months schedule. 99.3% of the subjects in the 10Pn246 group and 96.9% of the subjects in the Prev246 group reported at least one adverse event (solicited or unsolicited, local or general). The most frequently reported solicited local adverse event was pain in both groups with high incidences of solicited local grade 3 pain (up to 42.1%). Higher incidences of grade 3 pain were reported at the DTPw-HBV/Hib injection site (40.4%) compared to the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine injection sites (up to 26.3%) (Table 2). Large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  by  14  subjects  (12  subjects  in  the  10Pn246  group  and  2 subjects  in  the  Prev246  group).  Ten  of  these  large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  at  the  DTPwHBV/Hib injection site, 3 at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site and 1 at the IPV injection site. All were local or diffuse swelling reactions not involving adjacent joints that resolved without sequelae. The most frequently reported solicited general adverse event was irritability in both groups. One case of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature &gt; 40° C), assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination, was reported in the 10Pn246 group. (Table 3) Low incidences of grade 3 solicited general adverse events, assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination (up to 4.7%), were reported in both groups, except for irritability (up to 14.4%). The observed percentage of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited adverse event within 31 days after booster vaccination was 37.2% in the 10Pn246 group and 35.7% in the Prev246 group. A low percentage of subjects reported at least one adverse event with intensity grade 3 (up to 6.7%) or an adverse  event  which  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  (up  to

6.3%).

## Serious adverse events:

During the active phase of the study, 9 subjects reported at least one SAE: 2 subjects out of 280 in the 10PnEPI group, 5 subjects out of 285 in the 10Pn246 group and 2 subjects out of 98 in the Prev246 group. No fatal SAEs were reported. One of the reported SAEs in the 10Pn246 group (pharyngitis with febrile  condition)  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  All  SAEs resolved without sequelae.

During the extended safety follow-up of the study, 18 subjects reported at least one SAE: 4 subjects out of 280 in the 10PnEPI, 1 subject out of 93 in the PrevEPI group, 10 subjects out of 272 in the 10Pn246 group and 3 subjects out of 95 in the Prev246 group. One fatal SAE was reported in the PrevEPI group (subject 904 died from acute respiratory distress syndrome) but was not assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. None of the other reported SAEs were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all resolved without sequelae.

No subjects were withdrawn due to a SAE during the active phase or during the ESFU of the study.

- MAH's conclusions

## Immunogenicity

For the 6-10-14 weeks + 12-18 months of age schedule, high persisting antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL were observed prior  to  booster  vaccination  especially  in  the  10PnEPI  group.  Robust  booster immune responses were observed in both groups and were within the same range for all serotypes common to both vaccines. In the 10PnEPI group higher antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were observed for the common serotypes 18C and 19F compared to the PrevEPI goup.

For the 2-4-6- months + 12-18 months of age schedule persisting immune responses were observed prior  to  booster  vaccination.  Post-booster  vaccination,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL and the percentage of subjects with opsonophagocytic activity ≥ 8 was within the same range in both groups for each of the pneumococcal serotypes common to both vaccines. The antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher for most of the common serotypes in the Prev246 group compared to the 10Pn246 group except for serotype 19F (higher in the 10Pn246 group) and serotype 18C (within the same range for both groups).

## Safety

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  reached:  a  booster  dose  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine coadministered  with  DTPw-HBV/Hib  and  poliovirus  vaccines  did  not  induce  more  fever  with  rectal temperature &gt; 39° C than a booster dose of Prevenar co-administered with the same vaccines.

High overall incidences of adverse events (solicited and unsolicited, general and local) were reported in the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule with high incidences of grade 3 pain. Only one case of grade 3 fever was reported in the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule. Low incidences of unsolicited adverse events were observed in the 6-10-14 weeks + 12-18 months schedule (less than 9.7%). Large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  by  19  subjects  (5  subjects  in  the  6-10-14  weeks  +  12-18 months schedule and 14 subjects in the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule). Most of these large swelling reactions were reported at the DTPw-HBV/Hib injection site (reported by 14 subjects).

All were local or diffuse swelling reactions not involving adjacent joints that resolved without sequelae.

9  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  active  phase  of  the  study.  No  fatal  SAEs  were reported.  One  of  the  reported  SAEs  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae.

18  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  extended  safety  follow-up.  One  fatal  SAE  was reported.  None  of  the  reported  SAEs  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae.

Assessor's  comments:  The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  endorsed.  The  relatively  large  difference  in antibody  responses  (GMCs  and  GMTs)  and  reacotgenicity  between  the  EPI  schedule  and  the  2-4-6 months schedule could be explained by the different study populations (Philippines and Poland), and the design of this study does not allow any conclusion on the different priming schedules. The study generally confirms the previously shown results on persistence and booster at 12-18 months of age.

10PN-PD-DIT-029; A phase III, single group, open study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals.  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in Mexico when co-administered with GSK Biologicals. Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) vaccine as a 3dose primary immunization course at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and GSK Biologicals. Rotarix vaccine (HRV) as a 2-dose primary immunization course at 2 and 4 months of age.

- Objective(s)

## Primary:

To  compare  the  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals.  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in Mexico, one month post dose III, when co-administered with GSK Biologicals. Infanrix hexa and GSK Biologicals. Rotarix vaccines, to the immune responses as observed in the pivotal non-inferiority, lotto-lot consistency study 10PN-PD-DIT-001 in Europe.

## Criteria for non-inferiority:

Comparability to the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study in terms of non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the upper  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (95%  CI)  on  the  Geometric  Mean  antibody

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Concentration  (antibody  GMC)  ratio.s  (antibody  GMCs  from  study  10PN-PD-DIT-001  over  antibody GMCs of the current study) is below a limit of 2 for all of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and for protein D.

## Secondary:

To asses the safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in  Mexico,  when  co-administered  with  GSK  Biologicals.  Infanrix  hexa  and  GSK  Biologicals.  Rotarix vaccines.

- Study design

This was a phase III, multicentre, single-arm, open study:

-  10Pn-PD-DiT group ('10Pn' in result tables and figures): 10Pn-PD-DiT + DTPa-HBVIPV/ Hib + HRV Three-dose  primary  vaccination  course  starting  at  6  to  12  weeks  of  age  with  allowable  intervals between the primary vaccination doses of 49-83 days.

One  blood  sample  was  collected  one  month  post-dose  III  for  the  testing  of  antibodies  against pneumococcal serotypes.

Parents/guardians  were  invited  to  enroll  their  child/ward  in  a  separate  study  to  receive  a  booster vaccination during the child.s/ward.s second year of life.

- Study population /Sample size

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Male  or  female,  between  and  including  6-12  weeks  (42-90  days)  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  first vaccination.

Subjects for whom the investigator believes that their parents/guardians could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits).

Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.

Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination  before entering into the study.

Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive.

## Sample size

Comparability to the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study in terms of non-inferiority would be demonstrated if the upper  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (95%  CI)  on  the  Geometric  Mean  antibody Concentration  (antibody  GMC)  ratio.s  (antibody  GMCs  from  10PN-PD-DIT-001  study  over  antibody GMC  in  the  current  study)  was  below  a  limit  of  2  for  antibodies  against  all  of  the  10  vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D.

When comparing the local immunogenicity data with the immunogenicity data obtained from 10PN-PDDIT-001 study, 200 evaluable subjects provided at least 98% or 85% power (under equal mean or in case  of  1.2-fold  decrease  in  antibody  GMC,  respectively)  to  show  non-inferiority  (limit  of  2)  of  the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in the current study compared to the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT001 study with respect to ELISA antibody GMC ratios for the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D. Considering that up to 13% of the subjects enrolled would be excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity, 230 subjects were to be enrolled.

- Statistical Methods

## Immunogenicity:

Confirmatory inferential analysis

95% CIs for the ELISA antibody GMC ratio (antibody GMCs from 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study over antibody GMCs from current study), one month post-dose III, was computed for antibodies against each of the 10  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes  and  protein  D,  using  an  ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10 transformation of the concentrations (pooled variance).

The  primary  objective  of  comparison  of  immunogenicity  data  from  the  current  study  to  the  10PNPDDIT- 001 study would be reached if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) on the antibody GMC ratios (antibody GMCs from 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study over antibody GMCs in the current study) was below a limit of 2 for all of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D.

## Descriptive analysis:

Geometric mean antibody concentrations/OPA titres (antibody GMCs/OPA GMTs) and seropositivity/seroprotection rates were calculated with their 95% CI for each serotype/antigen, one month post-dose III.

Distribution  of  post-dose  III  antibody  concentrations/OPA  titres  was  displayed  using  tables  and/or reverse cumulative curves for each serotype/antigen.

## Safety /reactogenicity:

Descriptive analysis:

Incidence of solicited and/or unsolicited local and/or general adverse events during the 31-day (days 0-30) post-vaccination period was calculated with exact 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination.

Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 4-day (days 0-3) postvaccination period was calculated with exact 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination.

The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited symptom classified by the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  and  reported  within  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period  were summarized  with  exact  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and  overall.  The  same  tabulations  were performed  for  unsolicited  adverse  events  classified  as  grade  3,  with  causal  relationship  and  with medically attended visit.

Prevalence of concomitant antipyretic/medication during the 4-day (days 0-3) post-vaccination period was computed with exact 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall.

Serious  adverse  events  and  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  event(s)  reported  during  the  entire  study period were described in detail.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of non-inferiority of the immune response of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in Mexican children compared to the immunogenicity in the pivotal 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study in Europe was reached since the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for ELISA antibody GMC ratios (10Pn group in study 10PNPD-DIT-001 / 10Pn group in study 10PN-PD-DIT-029) was below the protocol defined limit of 2 for all of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D.

ELISA antibody GMCs from the 10Pn group in study 10PN-PD-DIT-029 were statistically significantly higher  than  for  the  10Pn  group  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-001,  for  all  of  the  10  vaccine  pneumococcal serotypes and protein D (upper limit of the 95% CIs of the GMC ratios below 1).

10Pn = 10Pn-PD-DiT + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib + HRV (2 doses). N= number of documented doses. n/%= number/percentage of doses followed by at least one type of symptom. 95%Cl= Exact 95% confidence interval; LL = lower limit, UL = upper limit

## Unsolicited adverse events

48.9%  of  administered  doses  were  followed  by  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE.  The  most  frequently reported unsolicited AE was nasopharyngitis. Low overall/dose incidences of unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination (maximum 3.8%) or grade 3 unsolicited AEs (maximum 4.8%) were observed.

## Serious adverse events

One  subject  experienced  a  fatal  SAE  (nasopharyngitis  and  bronchopneumonia)  which  was  not considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

14 out of 230 vaccinated subjects reported at least one non-fatal SAE during the entire study period. None was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. One subject reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

one  SAE  (convulsive  disorder)  which  was  still  ongoing  at  the  end  of  the  study.  The  same  subject reported 2 other SAEs which both resolved with sequelae.

Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events:

2 subjects were withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (SAE):

One  subject  was  diagnosed  with  an  infarction  of  the  germinal  matrix  of  the  brain  on  the  day  of administration of the second dose of study vaccines. The event resolved without sequelae and was not considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

One subject died 3 days after study vaccination due to nasopharyngitis and bronchopneumonia. An autopsy was not performed. The events were not considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

Assessor's  comment:  This  study  confirms  previously  reported  results.  No  further  action  is  required based on this study.

- Study population /Sample size

Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Male or female between, and including 6-8 weeks (42-62 days) of age at the time of first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the subject.

Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination  before entering into the study.

Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive.

- Treatments

Three-dose primary vaccination course with 10Pn-PD-DiT and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines starting at 6 to 8 weeks (42-62 days) of age with allowable intervals between the primary vaccination doses of 3563 days between visits 1 and 2, 77 to 110 days between visits 2 and 3 and 30 to 42 days between visits 3 and 4. HRV vaccine was administered as a 2-dose primary vaccination starting at 6 to 8 weeks (42-62  days)  of  age  with  allowable  intervals  between  the  primary  vaccination  doses  of  35-63  days between visits 1 and 2.

Two blood samples were collected: prior to dose I and one month post-dose III.

- Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (22F-inhibition ELISA), prior to dose I and one month post-dose III; Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F, one month post-dose III; Antibody concentrations against protein D, prior to dose I and one month post-dose III; Antibody  concentrations  against  diphtheria,  tetanus,  PT,  FHA,  PRN,  HBs  and  PRP,  one  month  postdose. Titres against polio type 1, 2 and 3, one month post-dose III. Serum rotavirus IgA antibody concentrations, four months post-dose II.

## Safety:

Occurrence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  (any  and  grade  3)  within  4  days  (days  0-3)  after  each vaccination dose. Occurrence  of  solicited  general  symptoms  (any  and  grade  3)  within  4  days  (days  0-3)  after  each vaccination dose. Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 31 days (days 0-30) after each vaccination dose. Occurrence of serious adverse events following the administration of the first dose of study vaccine throughout the entire study period up to Visit 4.

- Statistical Methods

## Immunogenicity:

Descriptive analyses: Geometric  mean  antibody  concentrations/OPA  titres  (antibody  GMCs/GMTs)  with  95%  CIs  were tabulated for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point. Seropositivity/seroprotection rates with exact 95%  CIs were calculated for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point. The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed by using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution curves for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.

## Safety/reactogenicity:

Descriptive analyses: Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and  general  adverse  events  during  the  31-day postvaccination  follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and  overall, according to the type of symptom, the intensity and relationship to vaccination; Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 4-day postvaccination follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and  overall,  according  to  the type of symptom, the intensity and relationship to vaccination; The percentages of subjects/doses with an unsolicited symptom  reported  within the 31-day postvaccination follow-up period were summarized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), with 95% CI according to the intensity and relationship to vaccination; Prevalence of concomitant antipyretic/medication during the 4-day post-vaccination follow-up period was computed with 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall; Serious  adverse  events  and  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  event(s)  reported  during  the  entire  study period were described in detail.

## Immune response to the co-administered DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and HRV vaccines

All  subjects  were  seroprotected/seropositive  for  antibodies  against  diphtheria,  tetanus,  each  of  the pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and PRN) and the hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigens one month post dose III. All subjects were seroprotected against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (titres ≥ 8). All subjects had seropositive anti-PRP antibody levels (≥ 0.15 μg/mL), whereas 96.6% of subjects had seroprotective anti-PRP antibody levels (≥ 1 μg/mL).

Four months post-dose II, 86.3% of subjects had a seropositive anti-HRV level (≥20 U/mL). Antibody GMC calculated for seropositive subjects at visit 4 was 273 U/mL.

A low overall/dose incidence of unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination (maximum 0.3% of overall doses) or grade 3 unsolicited adverse events (maximum 0.4% of overall doses) were observed.

Serious adverse events:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

15 out of 230 vaccinated subjects reported at least one SAE during the entire study period. No fatal SAE was reported during the entire study period.

None of the reported SAEs was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. Subject number 103 had one SAE (dermatitis atopic) which was still ongoing at the end of the study.

There was no withdrawal due to adverse events /serious adverse events.

Assessor's comment: This study confirms the previously reported results for Synflorix, and does not change the benefit risk balance. No further regulatory action is required following this study.

10PN-PD-DIT-032; A  phase III, randomized, open, controlled study to assess the immunogenicity, safety  and  reactogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate vaccine as a 3-dose primary immunization course at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in Sub-Saharan Africa, coadministered with GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV vaccines.

##  Description

A phase III, randomized, open, controlled study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as a 3dose  primary  immunization  course  at  6,  10  and  14  weeks  of  age  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  coadministered with GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib and HPV vaccines.

##  Methods

- Objective(s)

## Primary :

To  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in infants in Sub-Saharan Africa, one month post dose 3.

## Secondary:

o assess the safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.

To  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals'  Zilbrix  Hib  vaccine,  co-administered  with  GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

- Study design

This was a multi-center, open, randomized, controlled study with two parallel groups:

- 10Pn-PD-DiT  group  (referred  as  '10Pn'  in  results  tables  and  figures):  subjects  primed  with three  doses  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  co-administered  with  DTPw-HBV/Hib  and  OPV vaccines.
- Zilbrix Hib group (referred as 'Zilbrix' in results tables and figures): subjects primed with three doses of DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV vaccines.

Treatment allocation 2:1

Three-dose primary vaccination course at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

Blood samples were collected prior to vaccination and one month post dose 3.

- Study population /Sample size

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Male  or  female  between,  and  including  6-10  weeks  (42-76  days)  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  first vaccination.

Written or oral, signed or thumb-printed informed consent obtained from the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the subject. Where parent(s)/guardian(s) were illiterate, the consent form was to be countersigned by a witness.

Free  of  any  known  or  suspected  health  problems,  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical examination  before  entering  into  the  study,  that  would  contraindicate  the  initiation  of  routine immunizations outside a clinical trial context.

The target sample size was 345 enrolled subjects (230 in the 10Pn-PD-DiT group and 115 in the Zilbrix Hib group).

- Treatments

Vaccination schedule /site: The 10Pn-PD-DiT and DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the right and left thigh, respectively. The OPV vaccine was given orally. All vaccines were given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

Antibody concentrations against diphtheria, tetanus, B. pertussis, HBs and PRP.

## Safety /reactogenicity:

Occurrence  of  fever  (oral/axillary/tympanic  temperature  &gt;  38.5°C  or  rectal  temperature  &gt;  39.0°C) within 4 days (days 0 to 3) after at least one vaccination.

Occurrence  of  solicited  local  symptoms  (any  and  grade  3)  within  4  days  (days  0-3)  after  each vaccination.

Occurrence  of  solicited  general  symptoms  (any  and  grade  3)  within  4  days  (days  0-3)  after  each vaccination.

Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 31 days (days 0-30) after each vaccination.

Occurrence  of  serious  adverse  events  following  the  administration  of  the  first  dose  of  the  study vaccines throughout the entire study period up to Visit 4.

- Statistical Methods

## Immunogenicity:

Descriptive analyses:

Geometric mean concentrations/titers (GMCs/GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.

Seropositivity/seroprotection rates with exact 95%  CIs were calculated for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.

The  distribution  of  antibody  concentrations/titers  was  displayed  by  using  tables  and/or  reverse cumulative distribution curves for each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point.

Geometric mean of ratios of opsonophagocytic titers/ELISA antibody concentrations with 95% CIs was tabulated for each appropriate pneumococcal serotype at each applicable blood sampling time point.

## Safety/reactogenicity:

Descriptive analyses:

Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and  general  adverse  events  during  the  31-day postvaccination  follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and  overall, according to the type of symptom, the intensity and relationship to vaccination;

Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 4-day postvaccination follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and  overall,  according  to  the type of symptom, the intensity and relationship to vaccination;

The percentages of subjects/doses with an unsolicited symptom  reported  within the 31-day postvaccination follow-up period were summarized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), with 95% CI according to the intensity and relationship to vaccination;

Prevalence of concomitant antipyretic/medication during the 4-day post-vaccination follow-up period was computed with 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall;

Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the entire study period were described in detail.

##  Results

- Recruitment/ Number analysed

357  subjects  (239  subjects  in  the  10Pn  group  and  118  subjects  in  the  Zilbrix  group)  out  of  365 enrolled subjects were vaccinated. 347 subjects (231 subjects in the 10Pn group and 116 subjects in the Zilbrix group) completed the study.

- Efficacy results

## Immune response to the pneumococcal vaccine:

One month post-dose III, for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 97.2% of subjects in the 10Pn group had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL, except for serotypes 6B (82.0%) and 23F (87.6%). (Table 1). Although higher antibody GMCs were observed for serotypes 6B, 9V, 14, 18C and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

23F in Nigeria (no overlap of 95% CIs), the percentages of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL were in the same ranges for both countries.

One month post-dose III, all subjects in the 10Pn group had measurable antibodies against protein D (≥100 EL.U/mL). A higher anti-protein D GMC was observed in the 10Pn group in Mali than in Nigeria (no overlap of 95% CIs).

## Immune response to the co-administered DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine:

One month post-dose III, all  subjects  of  the  10Pn  group  and  all  subjects  except  one  in  the  Zilbrix group had anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/mL. 97.3% and 91.1% of subjects in the 10Pn group and Zilbrix group, respectively, had anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥1.0 µg/mL. All subjects were  seroprotected/seropositive  for  antibodies  against  the  other  antigens  in  the  DTPw-  HBV/Hib vaccine except two subjects in the 10Pn group who were not seroprotected for HBs. Antitetanus and anti-PRP antibody GMCs were higher in the 10Pn group than in the Zilbrix group (no overlap of 95% CIs).

## · Safety results

Similar incidences of solicited local and general adverse events were observed in each group during the 4- day (days 0-3) post-vaccination period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Solicited local adverse events:

Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event in each group.

Swelling  was  the  most  frequently  reported  grade  3  solicited  local  adverse  event  in  each  group (following 3.1% of doses). In the 10Pn group, higher incidences of pain, swelling and grade 3 swelling were reported at the DTPw-HBV/Hib injection site than at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site (no overlap of 95% CIs).

In general, there was no increase in the incidence of each solicited local adverse event with successive doses during the primary vaccination course.

## Solicited general adverse events:

Fever  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event  in  each  group.  The overall/dose incidence of fever &gt;39.0°C (rectal temperature) was within the same range in each group (maximum  6.2%).  One  subject  in  the  10Pn  group  reported  grade  3  fever  (rectal  temperature &gt;40.0°C).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Low overall/dose incidences of grade 3 solicited general adverse events were reported (ranging from 0% to 0.8%). All of these were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. In  general,  there  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  each  solicited  general  adverse  event  with successive doses during the primary vaccination course.

N=numberofdocumenteddoses n/%=number/percentageof dosesfollowedby at least onetypeofsymptom

95%Cl= Exact 95% confidence interval; LL = lower limit, UL = upper limit

## Unsolicited adverse events:

The percentage of administered doses followed by at least one unsolicited adverse event was 53.0% in the  10Pn  group  and  57.3%  in  the  Zilbrix  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  adverse events in each group were rhinitis and allergic bronchitis (both reported only in Mali). 5.7% and 9.7% of administered doses in the 10Pn group and Zilbrix group, respectively, were followed by at least one unsolicited adverse event assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

A low percentage of doses was followed by at least one grade 3 unsolicited adverse event (1.1% in each  group)  with  no  differences  observed  between  countries.  None  of  these  were  assessed  by  the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

## Serious adverse events:

Five subjects of the 10Pn group reported at least one serious adverse event. None of these serious adverse events were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all resolved without sequelae.

No fatal events have been reported in this study.

No subjects were withdrawn due to a non-serious adverse event. One subject (subject number 528 in the 10Pn group) was withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (bronchopneumonia).

Assessor's comment: The overall incidence of fever was very high in this study, but the incidence was similar in both groups and in most cases &lt;38.5°C. The incidence of high fever was not unusually high.

One month post-dose III, all  subjects  except one  (99.6%) in  the  10Pn  group  were  seropositive  for antibodies against protein D (≥100 EL.U/mL).

One month post-dose III, all subjects in both groups were seroprotected/seropositive for antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, B. pertussis, PRP and the hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigens (except one subject in the Hiberix group for PRP).

- Safety results

## Overall incidence of adverse events

During the 31-day post-vaccination period, 83.1% and 84.2% of documented doses in the 10Pn and Hiberix groups respectively were followed by at least one AE (solicited and unsolicited). Local AEs were more frequently reported than general AEs in both groups.

No increase in the incidences of any AEs (solicited and unsolicited) was observed with successive doses during the primary vaccination course.

## Solicited local adverse events

Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event in both groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Observed  overall/dose  incidences  of  any  solicited  local  AEs  were  within  the  same  ranges  in  both groups.

High  overall/dose  incidences  of  pain  (any  and  grade  3)  were  reported  in  both  groups  which  were however in the same range in both groups (i.e. 71.0% and 70.6% of doses in the 10Pn and Hiberix groups  respectively  for  any  pain  and  27.7%  and  24.9%  of  doses  in  the  10Pn  and  Hiberix  groups respectively for grade 3 pain). These rates of overall/dose incidences of pain (any and grade 3) are in line with those observed in other studies where 10Pn-PD-DiT was co-administered with DTPw combined vaccine (e.g. Poland, The Philippines).

The overall/dose incidences of grade 3 solicited local AEs ranged from 1.3% (for redness) to 27.7% (for pain) in the 10Pn group and between 0.8% (for redness) to 24.9% (for pain) in the Hiberix group, whatever the injection site.

There was no increase in the incidence of solicited local adverse events with successive doses during the primary vaccination course.

## Solicited general adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general AE in both groups (52.8% and 49.2% of doses in the 10Pn and Hiberix groups, respectively).

Except for any fever, the overall/dose incidences of any solicited general AEs were within the same ranges in both groups. Although any fever seemed to be reported more frequently in the 10Pn group than in the Hiberix group (no overlap of 95% CI), the incidences of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature &gt;40°C) were within the same range in both groups. Fever &gt;39°C (rectal temperature) was reported following 3.7% of doses in the 10Pn group and 1.4% of doses in the Hiberix group.

The overall/dose incidences of grade 3 solicited general AEs ranged from 0.0% (for fever) to 8.3% (for irritability), whatever the group. Except for drowsiness, most of the grade 3 solicited general AEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

There  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  solicited  general  AEs  with  successive  doses  during  the primary vaccination course.

## Unsolicited adverse events

6.0% and 4.8% of administered doses in the 10Pn and Hiberix groups, respectively were followed by at least one unsolicited AE, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term. The most frequently reported unsolicited AE was rhinitis and cough in the 10Pn group and rhinitis in the Hiberix group.

Low overall/dose incidences of grade 3 unsolicited AEs were observed in both groups (0.3% and 0.0% of  doses  in  the  10Pn  and  Hiberix  groups,  respectively).  None  of  the  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  was considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination.

## Serious adverse events:

One subject in the 10Pn group (subject number 680) died 14 days after the third dose of 10Pn-PDDiT vaccine co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine. The medical diagnosis for the cause of death was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aspiration  pneumonia.  An  autopsy  was  not  performed.  The  event  was  not  considered  by  the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

Four  subjects  out  of  240  vaccinated  subjects  in  the  10Pn  group  (1.7%)  and  1  subject  out  of  120 vaccinated subjects in the Hiberix group (1%) reported at least one non-fatal SAE during the entire study period. None of the non-fatal SAEs was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all resolved without sequelae.

One subject was withdrawn due to a SAE (subject number 680 in the 10Pn group) as described above.

Assessor's  comment: The results of this study  were in line with previously reported studies and no further regulatory action is  required.

10PN-PD-DIT-048 ;  A phase  III, multi-centre,  double-blind,  randomised  study  to  assess  the noninferiority  of  a  commercial  lot  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal conjugate  (10Pn-PD-DiT)  vaccine  compared  to  a  clinical  phase  III  vaccine  lot,  when  given  as  a threedose primary immunization course.

-  Description
-  Methods
- Objective(s)

## Primary :

To compare the immunogenicity of the commercial lot to the phase III clinical lot of GSK Biologicals' 10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (10Pn-PD-DiT),  one  month  following  a  3-dose  primary vaccination course.

## Secondary:

To assess the safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (clinical and commercial lots) and of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-combined and HRV vaccines.

To evaluate the immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-combined vaccines, one month following a 3dose primary vaccination course.

To  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals'  HRV  vaccine,  three  months  following  a  2-dose primary vaccination course.

- Study design

A phase III, multi-centre, randomised, controlled, double-blind primary vaccination study with two arallel groups:

Clin group: received the phase III clinical lot of 10Pn-PD-DiT co-administered with DTPa- HBV-IPV/Hib or DTPa-IPV/Hib and HRV.

Com group: received the commercial lot of 10Pn-PD-DiT co-administered with DTPa-HBVIPV/ Hib or DTPa-IPV/Hib and HRV.

One blood sample was collected one month post vaccination (Visit 4).

- Study population /Sample size

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Subjects for whom the investigator believed that their parent(s)/guardian(s) could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits).

A male or female between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination.

Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the subject.

Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination  before entering  into  the  study  that  would  contraindicate  the  initiation  of  routine  immunizations  outside  a clinical trial context.

Born after a gestation period of ≥36 to ≤42 weeks.

Comparability between the commercial lot and the phase III clinical lot in terms of noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 95% CIs on the adjusted GMC ratios [GMC of the phase III clinical lot over the GMC of the commercial lot] was below a limit of 2-fold for antibodies against all vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D as measured by ELISA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When  comparing  both  lots,  200  evaluable  subjects  per  group  would  provide  at  least  98%  or  85% power (under equal mean or in case of 1.2-fold decrease in GMCs, respectively) to show non-inferiority (limit of 2-fold) of the 10Pn-PD-DiT commercial lot compared to the 10Pn-PD-DiT phase III clinical lot with respect to adjusted ELISA GMC ratios for the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and for protein D.

Considering that up to 13% of the subjects enrolled could have been excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity, 230 subjects were planned to be enrolled in each group.

- Statistical Methods

## Immunogenicity

Confirmatory analysis:

95% CIs for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) adjusted GMCs ratio (GMCs of the phase III  clinical  lot  over  the  GMCs  of  the  commercial  lot),  one  month  after  administration  of  the  third vaccine dose, were computed for each of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and for protein D, using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the logarithm 10 transformation of the concentrations (pooled variance). The ANOVA model included the group and the country as fixed effects.

The primary objective was reached if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CIs on the adjusted GMC ratios [GMCs of the phase III clinical lot over the GMCs of the commercial lot] was below a limit of 2fold for antibodies against all vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D as measured by ELISA.

## Descriptive analysis:

GMCs/GMTs with 95% CIs were tabulated for each serotype/antigen overall and by country.

Seropositivity/seroprotection rates with exact 95%  CIs were calculated for each appropriate serotype/antigen overall and by country.

The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each serotype/antigen was displayed using tables and/or reverse cumulative distribution curves.

## Safety / Reactogenicity:

Descriptive analysis:

The  percentage  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  local  AE  (solicited  and  unsolicited),  with  at  least  one general  AE  (solicited  and  unsolicited)  and  with  any  AE  during  the  31-day  (day  0-day  30)  follow-up

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

period was tabulated with exact 95% CI after each vaccine dose and overall. The percentage of doses followed by at least one local AE (solicited and unsolicited), by at least one general AE (solicited and unsolicited) and by any AE was tabulated, over the whole vaccination course, with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were performed for symptoms rated as grade 3.

The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE during the 4-day (Day 0-Day 3) follow-up period were tabulated after each vaccine dose and overall, with exact 95% CI. The percentage of doses followed by each individual solicited local and general AE were tabulated, over the whole vaccination course, with exact 95% CI.

The  same  tabulation  was  performed:  for  grade  3  solicited  AEs  and  for  solicited  AEs  with  causal relationship to vaccination. For redness and swelling, grade 2 or 3 AEs were also tabulated.

Occurrence of fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative increments.

The proportion of subjects/doses with at least one report of unsolicited AE classified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and reported up to 30 days after vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI. The same tabulation was performed for grade 3 unsolicited AEs and for unsolicited AEs with a relationship to vaccination.

The proportion of AEs resulting in a medically attended visit was also tabulated.

The number and percentage of subjects who took concomitant antipyretic or other medication at least once during the 4-day (Day 0-Day 3) solicited follow-up period were tabulated after each vaccine dose and  overall,  with  exact  95%  CI.  The  number  and  percentage  of  doses  for  which  the  subjects  took concomitant antipyretic or other medication at least once during the 4-day (Day 0- Day 3) solicited follow-up period were tabulated over the full vaccination course, with exact 95% CI.

SAEs and withdrawal due to AE(s) were described in detail.

## Co-administered DTPa-combined and HRV vaccines - Descriptive analysis results

All  subjects  were  seroprotected/seropositive  for  antibodies  against  diphtheria,  tetanus,  each  of  the pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and PRN), the hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen (except one subject in the Clin group), poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 and PRP one month post-dose III.

Three months after the second dose of HRV vaccine, at least 81.9% of subjects in each group had seropositive anti-HRV levels ( ≥20 U/mL).

- Safety results

## Solicited local adverse events:

Within the 4-day post-vaccination period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE in each group (48.7% and 48.4% of overall doses in the Clin group and in the Com group, respectively).

The observed overall/dose incidences for each of the solicited local AE were in the same ranges across the groups.

The overall/dose incidence of grade 3 solicited local AEs ranged from 0.4% to 5.7%, for any injection site and group.

^ Diarrhoea and vomiting were solicited due to co-administered HRV vaccine

## Unsolicited adverse events:

The percentage of doses followed by at least one unsolicited symptom in the 31-day postvaccination period  was  16.2%  in  the  Clin  group  and  17.0%  in  the  Com  group.  The  most  frequently  reported unsolicited AE in each group was upper respiratory tract infection (5.0% in the Clin group and 6.0% in the Com group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of doses followed by at least one unsolicited symptom considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and the percentage of doses with grade 3 unsolicited AEs in the 31-day post-vaccination period was at most 1.0% in both groups.

No grade 3 unsolicited AEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

## Serious adverse events:

No fatal SAEs were reported in this study. A total of 36 non-fatal SAEs were reported for 25 (5.4%) out of 466 vaccinated subjects: 18 subjects (7.7%) in the Clin group and 7 subjects (3.0%) in the Com group. No SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. One SAE did not resolve (spinal muscular atrophy) and one SAE (tuberculous meningitis) was still ongoing at the end of this study.

No subjects were withdrawn due to an AE or SAE during this study.

Assessor's comment: The results of this study confirm the previously reported results for Synflorix. No further regulatory action is required based on this study.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The majority of the above described studies do not provide new results that change the overall benefit risk of Synflorix, or require any further regulatory action. Study 009 cause some concern regarding the relatively  low  responses  to  some  serotypes  following  the  catch-up  vaccinations  in  children  12-23 months of age. However, as the MAH already has a commitment to study booster vaccination after the catch-up schedule, no further action is currently needed.
