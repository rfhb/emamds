In addition, the CHMP agreed with the MAH proposal to complete the list of local representatives in the PL in order to include the 10 accession countries and amend the declarations of storage conditions in SPC section 6.4 (Special Precautions for storage), PL and labelling in accordance with EMEA/QRD templates. |
