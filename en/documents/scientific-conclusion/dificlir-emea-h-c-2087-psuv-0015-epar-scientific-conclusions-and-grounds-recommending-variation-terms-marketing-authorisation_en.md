## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Dificlir, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

Fidaxomicin is an antibiotic product belonging to a new class of macrocyclic antibacterial compounds. The medicinal product is bactericidal with a specific activity on clostridial RNA polymerases. The only indication is Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) or C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in adults. The posology is as follows: 200 mg of fidaxomicin is administered orally 2 times daily for 10 days; the absorption is very limited.

Fidaxomicin has been clearly established as clinically 'non-inferior' to vancomycin, the current standard of treatment for CDI.  Two large randomised phase 3 studies compared fidaxomicin with vancomycin.  A total of 1,147 subjects were included in the 2 studies. The crude average of the clinical response rates in fidaxomicin subjects for the two phase 3 studies was 88.0%. In addition, the risk of recurrence was lower for fidaxomicin than for vancomycin. The crude average of the recurrence rates for the two studies is 14.3% for fidaxomicin and 26.0% for vancomycin.

The safety profile obtained in clinical trials and from the post-marketing data is favourable. The important adverse events are various gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, dizziness and hypersensitivity. Three additional reports of possible hypersensitivity have been identified in the present PSUR, although they do not significantly alter the characterization of this risk. Hypersensitivity has been included in the company's core data sheet (CCDS) and local reference safety information for fidaxomicin in the USA, Canada, Australia, and the EU. In addition, the MAH proposed to add a warning to the SmPC in section 4.4 that fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with a known macrolide allergy, as some patients with hypersensitivity reactions reported a history of allergy to macrolides. As the antigenic determinants of macrolides and macrocycles, at which allergic immune reactions are directed, are unknown, the PRAC agreed to this proposal and recommended the variation of the MA within this PSUR.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Dificlir, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance fidaxomicin is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
