## 1. Introduction

On December 7, 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study EP0130 for lacosamide, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH submitted the EP0130 study 'Vimpat tablets 50mg, Vimpat tablets 100mg, Vimpat dry syrup 10% Specified drug use-results surveillance -Monotherapy for partial onset seizures in paediatric patients with epilepsy' is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Lacosamide has been approved as monotherapy and adjunctive treatment in patients with partial onset seizures (POS) in the EU (2 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and intravenous [iv] infusion), US (1 month of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv infusion), and Japan (4 years of age and older for tablets, dry syrup, and iv infusion). Lacosamide has also been approved as adjunctive treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in the EU (4 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv infusion), US (4 years of age and older for tablets, oral solution [syrup], and iv infusion), and Japan (for patients 4 years of age and older with epilepsy who have not obtained sufficient response to other antiseizure medications for tablets, dry syrup, and iv infusion).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted &lt;a&gt; final report(s) for:

- EP0130 study 'Vimpat tablets 50mg, Vimpat tablets 100mg, Vimpat dry syrup 10% Specified drug use-results surveillance -Monotherapy for partial onset seizures in pediatric patients with epilepsy'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

EP0130 study 'Vimpat tablets 50mg, Vimpat tablets 100mg, Vimpat dry syrup 10% Specified drug use-results surveillance - Monotherapy for partial onset seizures in pediatric patients with epilepsy'

## Description

EP0130 was a post-marketing surveillance study intended to detect the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), to evaluate effectiveness, and to evaluate factors that may have affected the safety and effectiveness during the actual post-marketing use of VIMPAT tablets 50mg, VIMPAT tablets 100mg, and VIMPAT dry syrup 10% (hereafter referred to as 'the Survey Drug') as monotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This surveillance was conducted as a non-interventional study to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this drug under daily clinical practice based on the approved indications and dosage and administration.

EP0130 was conducted using a central registration system. Investigators registered patients, who newly initiated the administration of the Survey Drug, within 14 days, including the date initiating the administration for the first time. The observation period was 26 weeks. In case the administration period was less than 26 weeks (caused by discontinuation/no-show, etc), the observation period ended on the date of the discontinuation of the administration. Additionally, if patients had surgical operations or vagus nerve stimulation therapies, etc, aimed at treating epilepsy, the observation period ended on the previous date of the procedure. For those patients who discontinued the administration, as much as possible, a surveillance was conducted 2 weeks after discontinuation to check for possible withdrawal symptoms and rebound phenomenon.

## Methods

## Study participants

The surveillance population included patients with POS (including secondary generalized seizures), who were 4 years to &lt;16 years of age on the start date of administration of the Survey Drug, and who had newly initiated treatment with the Survey Drug and received the Survey Drug as monotherapy.

## Treatments

EP0130 was conducted in Japan based on approved indications, dosage, and administration and included medical institutions where the Survey Drug had been delivered/adopted.

## Objective(s)

This surveillance is intended to detect the incidence of adverse reactions, to evaluate effectiveness, and to evaluate factors that may affect the safety and effectiveness during the actual post-marketing use of 'Vimpat® Tablets 50mg, Vimpat® Tablets 100mg, Vimpat® Dry Syrup 10%.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The prespecified time point for the evaluation of effectiveness under actual postmarketing use was Week 26 of the treatment with the Survey Drug (or upon discontinuation). Evaluable pediatric patients were those for whom global improvement rating was determined at the final evaluation time point. The acceptable time window for each evaluation time point was ±28 days.

Safety Specifications (serious and nonserious) for the safety analysis set included the following important identified risks: electrocardiogram PR prolongation-related events (eg, atrioventricular block, bradycardia, syncope); toxic epidermal necrolysis and mucocutaneous ocular (Stevens Johnson) syndrome; drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome; and agranulocytosis.

Effectiveness evaluations included:

Response rate based on global improvement rating

Global improvement rating: Evaluation on a 3-point scale, consisting of 'Improved,' 'Unchanged,' and 'Worsened' during the observation period. Pediatric patients rated as 'Improved' were considered as responders.

Seizure-free rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Seizure-free patients were defined as pediatric patients who had no seizures throughout the observation period.

Percent reduction in seizure frequency

Number of seizures noted within the past 4 weeks compared with Baseline seizure frequency.

## Sample size

A total of 150 patients were planned in the surveillance. The following rational for the sample size was provided:

In the phase III study of lacosamide oral formulation in adults (all population including Japanese subjects), the incidence of adverse drug reactions related to cardiac disorder was 2.27%. Assuming that cardiac disorder occurred at similar rate (3%) in the study of pediatrics population, target sample size is set to 100 cases to estimate the incidence rate with a power of 95%.

On the other hand, for effectiveness, in a Phase III clinical study of monotherapy in adult patients (all population including Japanese subjects), the proportion of 6-month seizure-free subjects was approximately 70%. Assuming a true 6-month seizure-free rate of 70%, the sample size in the surveillance is set to 150 to detect the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for seizure-free rate in the surveillance exceeding the threshold of 56% (calculated as 20% lower than the assumed true rate) at a power of 90%.

## Statistics

## Descriptive analysis

Summary statistics such as ratio, mean, standard deviation, two-sided 95% confidence interval, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum were calculated.

Statistical tests were performed in subgroup analyses for the safety and effectiveness. Categorical data in 2 x 2 tables were analyzed by Fisher's exact test, and those in larger than 2 Percent reduction in seizure frequency (%) = \"Baseline seizure frequency\"- \"Seizure frequency at each evaluation time point\" X 100 Baseline seizure frequency x 2 tables were analyzed by Monte Carlo estimation. Ordered scale data were analyzed by Cochran-Armitage test. Tests were performed with two-sided significance level of 5%.

Statistical measures were not used for other endpoints. Descriptive analyses were performed by calculating two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

## Results

## Recruitment

There were 204 pediatric patients enrolled and 194 pediatric patients with surveillance sheets collected in EP0130. Of these 194 pediatric patients with surveillance sheets collected, 183 pediatric patients were included in the safety analysis set (after excluding patients who met exclusion criteria for the safety analysis). Of these 183 pediatric patients included in the safety analysis set, 151 pediatric patients were included in the effectiveness analysis set (after excluding patients who met exclusion criteria for the effectiveness analysis).

## Safety results

A total of 183 pediatric patients were included in the safety analysis set.

The incidence of ADRs was 12.02% (22/183 pediatric patients); ADRs were most frequently reported in the system organ class (SOC) of Nervous system disorders (7.65%). The most commonly reported ADRs by preferred term (PT) were somnolence (7 pediatric patients [3.83%]) and dizziness (5 pediatric patients [2.73%]), which were within the SOC of Nervous system disorders. The incidence of serious ADRs was 1.09% (2/183 pediatric patients); serious ADRs by PT were epilepsy and leukopenia (1 pediatric patient each). No infections were reported.

Of the pediatric patients excluded from the safety analysis set, 2 pediatric patients experienced ADRs (by PT of anxiety, crying, and epilepsy [1 pediatric patient] and dizziness and headache [1 pediatric patient]). Of these ADRs by PT, epilepsy was considered serious in 1 pediatric patient.

None of the Safety Specifications were observed.

Data source: EP0130 final report Table 2

The MAH examined factors for potential impact on the incidence rates of ADRs (refer to the EP0130 final report [Module 5.3.5.4] for additional details).

There were statistically significant differences by age at Baseline (see Section 5.1.3.1 for additional details regarding the incidence rates of ADRs by age at Baseline). The incidence rate of ADRs tended to be higher in the older age groups. The incidence rate of pediatric patients with ADRs in the 12 years to &lt;16 years age group was 27.50%. The incidence rate of ADRs in the SOC of Nervous system disorders, including neurological events, which are the main, commonly observed ADRs for antiepileptic drugs, including this Survey Drug, tended to be higher in the older age groups.

The Survey Drug was administered to 1 pediatric patient with renal impairment. The Survey Drug was administered to 2 pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. No ADRs were observed in the pediatric patient with renal impairment or in the pediatric patients with hepatic impairment.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study EP0130 for lacosamide, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. The study EP0130 was a post-marketing surveillance study intended to detect the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), to evaluate effectiveness, and to evaluate factors that may have affected the safety and effectiveness during the actual post-marketing use of lacosamide as monotherapy.

This surveillance was conducted as a non-interventional study to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this drug under daily clinical practice based on the approved indications and dosage and administration.

The surveillance population included patients with POS (including secondary generalized seizures), who were 4 years to &lt;16 years of age on the start date of administration of LCM, and who had newly initiated treatment with the LCM and received it as monotherapy.

There were 204 pediatric patients enrolled and 183 pediatric patients included in the safety analysis set, and 151 pediatric patients were included in the effectiveness analysis set. The observation period was 26 weeks.

The mean age of pediatric patients was 8.85 years, and the mean body weight was 30.09kg. The mean duration of epilepsy was 1.19 years with the majority (73%) having a duration of less than 1 year. The most common seizure types reported by pediatric patients in the safety analysis set were complex partial seizures (56.28%) and secondarily generalized seizures (38.25%). The seizure frequency was relatively low with the mean Baseline seizure frequency of 4.26 seizures per 4 weeks. Approximately 88.5% have not been previously treated with any ASM. Thus, it could be considered that patients included into this survey were rather mild and early in their disease development.

The most common mean daily doses per body weight were between 2mg/kg and 4mg/kg (47,52%), and 4mg/kg and 8mg/kg (37.16%) for safety analysis set.

The effectiveness assessed as response rate based on global improvement rating, seizure-free rate and the mean percent reduction in seizure frequency was 85.43%, 55.63% and 79.79%, respectively. These exploratory data do not indicate any potential issues/differences of effectiveness of LCM treatment from the known effect in the population studied in real world setting.

The safety analyses set included 183 patients. The incidence of ADRs was 12.02%. The most common reported ADRs by preferred term were somnolence and dizziness in line with the information provided in the SmPC. The incidence of serious ADRs was 1.09% and included epilepsy and leukopenia (1 pediatric patient each). No infections were reported.

The MAH reported that the incidence rate of ADRs tended to be higher in the older age groups. The incidence rate of paediatric patients with ADRs in the 12 years to &lt;18 years age group was 26.86%. This observation that there were statistically significant differences in age at baseline in reporting the ADRs is difficult to interpret having in mind study design.

In summary, no new information regarding effectiveness of LCM when used as monotherapy according to approved indication and dosing was reported. Also, safety and tolerability of LCM in patients included into the study did not reveal any new safety concerns and can be considered to be consistent with the known safety profile. Thus, the MAH proposal not to update the SmPC could be endorsed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The benefit risk ratio of LCM treatment in paediatric patients when treated according to approved indications and dosage remains unchanged.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The safety and tolerability of LCM in paediatric patients with POS included into the study EP0130 did not reveal any new safety concerns. Thus, based on the results of the EP0130 study the MAH proposal not to update the SmPC of lacosamide could be endorsed.

The benefit risk ratio of LCM treatment remains unchanged.
