| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary name:   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Tysabri              | natalizumab                           | See Annex A      |

The following variations were requested in the group:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                         | Type   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a                  | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |
| C.I.6.a                  | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

The MAH applied for a grouped application containing 2 extensions of indication for the treatment of multiple sclerosis as follows:

- 1) extension of indication in RRMS population without high disease activity, those patients who are negative for anti-JCV Antibodies.
- 2) extension of indication in RRMS population with high disease activity with the introduction of glatiramer acetate as an additional example of treatment failure.

Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to update the warning on the risk of PML regarding anti-JCV antibody negative patients. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH proposed to include the paediatric deferral statement in accordance with QRD template version 8.

The group of variations proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

On 14 May 2013, on the basis that additional  data  were  required  and  these  were  considered  still provisional, the MAH withdrew the following variation:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                         | Type   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a                  | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Extension  of  indication  in  RRMS  population  without  high  disease  activity,  those  patients  who  are negative for anti-JCV Antibodies.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0252/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (P/0252/2012) was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the α 4 chain of the α 4β1 and α 4β7 integrins. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the rationale for natalizumab therapy is the reduction of leukocyte migration into the central nervous system (CNS) by specifically targeting α 4β1, or very-late-activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).

With  increasing  post-marketing  experience  and  duration  of  exposure  to  Tysabri,  the  continued reporting  of  MS  patients  diagnosed  with  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  raised concerns, especially since data suggest that the risk of developing PML increases significantly after two years of continuous exposure. On 22 October 2009, the CHMP requested a review of the benefits and risks  for  Tysabri.  In  view  of  this,  the  European  Commission  requested  the  opinion  of  the  CHMP  on measures necessary to ensure the safe use of Tysabri, and a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was initiated on 26 October 2009. By the end of this procedure on 20 January 2010, the CHMP concluded that the benefit still outweighed the risks related to Tysabri treatment, but the MAH committed to further activities for risk minimization.

PML is caused by JC virus (JCV) which is among the most prevalent viruses in the human population (Agostini 1996). Primary infection by archetype JCV is asymptomatic and occurs early in life, typically in childhood or adolescence. It appears as if a benign form of JCV remains asymptomatic in the kidney and in lymphoid organs throughout life. For the time being, it is not clear how variables, such as host factors (eg, genetics and immune status), presence of viral mutations, and therapeutic interventions (immunosuppressives, biologics) may contribute to the development of PML.

Since  infection  by  JCV  is  a  prerequisite  for  PML  development,  serologic  detection  of  past  infection allows for identifying patients at higher risk of developing PML (Gorelik 2010). While exposure to JCV can be confirmed by directly measuring JCV DNA in body fluids, the absence of detectable JCV DNA does not correlate with a lack of exposure to JCV, and viremia appears to be transient.

In the meantime, a validated 2-step ELISA antibody assay for the detection of anti-JCV antibodies in human  serum  and  plasma  has  been  developed  and  is  now  commercially  available  in  Europe.  In addition,  a  quantitative  risk  stratification  algorithm  which  added  anti-JCV  antibody  status  to  the previously established risk factors was included into the SmPC for Tysabri, and information on PML risk and  JCV  antibody  status  was  also  added  to  the  Physician  Information  and  Management  Guidelines (PID) and Treatment Forms. This included a recommendation for re-testing antibody negative patients every 12 months (EMEA/H/C/00603/II/41).

Subsequently, further information on the clinical utility and testing of the anti-JCV antibody status to stratify  the  risk  of  developing  PML  prior  or  during  treatment  with  Tysabri  were  introduced  into  the SmPC  including  a  reference  to  the  physician  information  and  management  guidelines  for  the quantification of PML risk in the different patient groups (EMEA/H/C/00603/II/54).

The CHMP also recommended to update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include recommendations on testing  frequency  for  anti-JCV  antibody  negative  patients  every  6  months  based  on  review  of  postmarketing  PML  cases  and  clinical  trial  data  in  relation  to  the  frequency  of  re-testing  of  anti-JCV antibody  status  in  anti-JCV  antibody  negative  patients  (EMEA/H/C/00603/II/57,  October  2012)  and that patients and healthcare professionals should continue to be alert for any new signs and symptoms that may be suggestive of PML for approximately 6 months following discontinuation of Tysabri since PML  has  been  reported  following  discontinuation  of  TYSABRI  in  patients  who  did  not  have  findings suggestive of PML at the time of discontinuation (EMEA/H/C/00603/II/58, January 2013).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within the present grouped variations application, the MAH initially applied for the following:

1) extension of indication in Relapsing Remitting Muliple Sclerosis (RRMS) population without high disease activity, those patients who are negative for anti-JCV Antibodies.

2) extension of indication in RRMS population with high disease activity with the introduction of glatiramer acetate as an additional example of treatment failure.

Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to revise the warning on the risk  of  PML  regarding  anti-JCV  antibody  negative  patients.  The  Package  Leaflet  was  proposed  to  be updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH proposed to include the paediatric deferral statement in accordance with QRD template version 8.

On  14  May  2013,  on  the  basis  that  additional  data  were  required  and  these  were  considered  still provisional, the MAH withdrew the variation for the extension of indication in RRMS population without high disease activity, those patients who are negative for anti-JCV Antibodies. Consequently, the scope of this assessment relates to the extension of indication in RRMS population with high disease activity with the introduction of glatiramer acetate as an additional example of treatment failure.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

The following clinical data are presented to support the proposed extension of indication for ' RRMS population with high disease activity with the introduction of glatiramer acetate as an additional example of treatment failure':

## 1) TOP (Tysabri Observational Program)

TOP, is an ongoing, observational study in the European Union (EU), Canada, and Australia that collects safety and efficacy data from patients prescribed Tysabri in the commercial setting.

The primary endpoint is long-term safety (incidence and pattern of serious adverse events  or SAEs) in patients receiving Tysabri. The secondary endpoints include MS disease activity as determined by the occurrence of clinical relapses (annualised relapse rate or ARR, distribution of the total number of relapses over 5 years, time to first relapse, proportions of patients with and without relapse), and disability progression as determined by Expanded Disability Status Scale or EDSS (based on neurological examination,  physical EDSS). Furthermore, baseline disease characteristics such as previous use of disease modifying therapy are evaluated as prognostic indicators for disease activity and disability progression over time.

The study population will include approximately 6,000 patients with RRMS, who are naïve to Tysabri at initiation of Tysabri treatment and most of whom have switched from a first line therapy to Tysabri after failing to respond to the first line therapy. Each patient is followed up for approximately 10 years. The collection of efficacy and safety data at 6-month intervals during the TOP observational period coincides with regular clinic visits and routine clinical practice.

An interim analysis of the ARR in 4,434 patients in TOP was conducted with a data cut-off of 01 June 2012.

## 2) The Swedish Tysabri Registry (IMSE)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In August 2006, at the launch of natalizumab in Sweden, a post-marketing surveillance study was established in Sweden as an academic initiative in collaboration with the Swedish regulatory authorities and industry. The objective of this study was to monitor and analyze the demographic/clinical characteristics together with collection of long-term safety and efficacy data of natalizumab in MS patients via the Swedish MS quality registry (SMS-reg). Nearly all patients prescribed Tysabri in Sweden are entered into the Swedish MS registry (IMSE), approximately &gt;95%, and safety and efficacy data are collected. Data was registered before start of treatment (baseline) and at every six months during treatment. Of the 1152 MS patients for whom information was available as of May 2012, the last disease modifying treatment (DMT) used prior to Tysabri was Avonex in 408 patients (22.7%), Betaferon in 143 patients (8%), Rebif in 230 patients (12.8 %), glatiramer acetate (GA) in 234 patients (13%) and other therapies in the remaining patients. The number of patients who received GA as the last MS therapy prior to starting Tysabri was similar in those patients who continued on Tysabri treatment and those who discontinued Tysabri. Data on the efficacy and safety of Tysabri in 1115 MS patients included in this registry have been published (Holmen et al. 2011).

## 3) The French Tysabri Registry (TYSEDMUS)

TYSEDMUS is a multicentre observational cohort study aiming at involving all French neurologists prescribing natalizumab and including all patients exposed at least once to Tysabri. Patients' characteristics under natalizumab (including pre-treatment data and clinical evolution), utilisation patterns and occurrence of adverse events are described. This observational study is run by independent investigators in France. A group of non-exposed patients, never treated with natalizumab, receiving or not immuno-active therapies, will be extracted later from the EDMUS databases for comparison. All the data are centralised in the EDMUS Coordinating Center in Lyon. The study duration is planned to be at least 5 years.

An interim analysis of data (as of November 3, 2011) from TYSEDMUS showed that of 3178 MS patients prescribed Tysabri in France, 766 patients (27%) received GA as their last treatment for MS just prior to starting Tysabri; many of these patients had also received other MS therapies in the past.

## 4) GLANCE

GLANCE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group Phase 2 study in which 110 MS patients (ranging in age from 19-55 years) with previous disease activity on GA were randomized to  continue  receiving  GA  (20  mg  subcutaneous)  or  to  receive  Tysabri  (300  mg  intravenous)  in combination with GA.

Although  this  was  primarily  a  safety  study,  the  primary  objective  was  to  determine  whether natalizumab in combination with GA lead to an increase in MS disease activity as measured by MRI and clinical  relapse or an increase in adverse events as compared to GA alone, whilst this study did not include a Tysabri-alone arm. The study therefore indirectly evaluates whether switching from GA alone to GA plus Tysabri may provide benefit.

## 5) Patient cohort studies

Several small, independent, patient cohort studies have been conducted in clinical practice to determine the impact of switching MS treatments on ARR. The following studies were analysed:

- -A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the MS Centre, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, USA (Memon et al. 2010) in 46 MS patients treated with Tysabri in clinical practice after previous treatment with GA or Interferon-beta (IFN-beta).
- -An observational study (Vokaer et al. 2010; Belachew et al., 2010) was conducted at the CHU Tivoli University Hospital, Liege, Belgium on a cohort of 45 MS patients 18-65 years of age, treated with Tysabri after therapy failure in clinical practice. The last DMT used was Avonex

Tysabri

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(42%), GA (27%), Rebif (16%), Betaferon (16%). Only patients who had initiated natalizumab at least 44 weeks before the beginning of this study were eligible. Monthly EDSS evaluation was prospectively planned in accordance with the standard procedures of the two centers.

- -In a prospective, multicentre, cohort study in German speaking countries, Austria, Germany, Switzerland (Putzki et al. 2009). Ninety-seven (97) MS patients were treated with Tysabri after therapy failure in clinical practice. The last DMT used was IFN-beta in 73 patients (75%), GA in 10 patients (10%) and other therapies in 14 patients (15%).
- -A retrospective multicentre cohort in Switzerland (Putzki et al. 2009) of 85 MS patients was treated with Tysabri after therapy failure in clinical practice. Some of the patients included in this cohort were also included in the 97 patient cohort study described above. The last DMT used was IFN-beta in 57 patients (67%), GA in 11 patients (13%) and other therapies in 18 patients (20%).

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1.1. Results

## 1) TOP (Tysabri Observational Program)

The interim data from TOP showed that in 25% of MS patients in normal clinical practice, the last MS therapy used immediately prior to the start of Tysabri treatment was GA. This was comparable to the usage of IFN-beta 1-b (18%), subcutaneous IFN-beta 1-a (23%) and intramuscular IFN-beta 1-a (18%). Overall, one-third of subjects in TOP had used GA at some time prior to starting Tysabri, but some of these patients switched to other MS therapies before beginning Tysabri treatment.

The patients enrolled in TOP had more baseline disease activity (mean baseline EDSS: 3.5, mean ARR in previous year: 2.00) than the patients enrolled in the pivotal AFFIRM (EDSS: 2.3, ARR: 1.53) and SENTINEL (EDSS: 2.4, ARR: 1.44) studies.

The ARR reduction in TOP was maintained over three to four years of treatment (see Figure 1). The efficacy outcomes with respect to the magnitude of the ARR reductions on treatment with Tysabri were similar and consistent with AFFIRM (see Figure 2) and SENTINEL.

Souuce: Table 11 and Polman et al (2006)

Overall,  the  subjects  dosed  in  this  study  at  the  time  of  the  analysis  had  received  a  mean  of  20.4 infusions of Tysabri (Standard Deviation or SD: 13.8) and a median of 19 infusions of Tysabri (range 1 to 63).

The efficacy outcome of ARR is summarised in Table 4 and Figure 3. The term DMT covers approved disease modifying treatments excluding Tysabri i.e. IFN-beta or GA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1 Comparison of ARR pre-and post-Tysabri treatment

| Subject Population Prior to Switch to Tysabri   |   Pre-Tysabri Mean ARR | Post-Tysabri Mean ARR   |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Overall TOP population (n=4426)                 |                   2    | 0.27*                   |
| No previous DMT (n=398)                         |                   1.95 | 0.16                    |
| IFN-beta was the only previous DMT (n=1991)     |                   1.96 | 0.21*                   |
| GA was the only previous DMT (n= 387)           |                   1.94 | 0.24*                   |
| GA to IFN or IFN to GA (n=798)                  |                   2.04 | 0.28*                   |

Figure 3. Baseline and post-baseline annualised relapse rates by baseline treatment history

<!-- image -->

Tysabri was associated with significant reductions in the ARR in all subsets of subjects, irrespective of a history of GA only use or IFN-beta only use or switching between these DMTs prior to Tysabri. The magnitude of the response was similar across populations.

## 2) The Swedish Tysabri Registry (IMSE)

Of the 1152 MS patients for whom information was available as of May 2012, the last DMT used prior to Tysabri was Avonex in 408 patients (22.7%), Betaferon in 143 patients (8%), Rebif in 230 patients (12.8 %), GA in 234 patients (13%) and other therapies in the remaining patients. The number of patients who received GA as the last MS therapy prior to starting Tysabri was similar in those patients who continued on Tysabri treatment and those who discontinued Tysabri.

RRMS patients (n=901) improved significantly in several parameters and the major changes occurred in the 12 month interval (see Figure 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 4

Figure I. Clinical data of mean EDSS, MSSS, MSIS-29 and SDMT over time in patients with RRMS (n = 901). From baseline untl 24 months of treatment with natalizumab, mean EDSS (10.7%), MSSS (20.4%), MSIS-29 physical (— 9.9%) and MSIS-29 psychological score (13.3%) all decreased significantly (p-values ≤ 0.05). Mean SDMT also showed significant increase with +10.7% from baseline until 24 months of treatment with natalizumab (p-values ≤ 0.05).

<!-- image -->

EDSS was on average 0.43 steps lower (decrease with 13.1%) at the end of the first year of treatment (p≤0.05). In those patients where EDSS data was complete at baseline, 12 months and 24 months, the  proportions  of  patients  free  from  EDSS  progression  were  89%  at  12  months  and  84%  at  24 months. Accordingly, average Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) decreased from 4.76 to 3.80 (decrease of 20.2%) in the first 12 months (p≤0.05). The patient-reported outcomes in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) decreased both in the physical and psychological domains (p≤0.05). The  performance  on  Symbol  Digit  Modalities  Test  (SDMT),  included  to  assess  cognitive  aspects, showed  a  consistent  improvement  from  49.65  to  54.33  (8.6%)  during  12  months  (p≤0.05).  The improvement in EDSS and MSSS did not continue during the second year of treatment (Holmen et al. 2011,  Multiple  Sclerosis  Journal  17:  708-719).  The  analyses  were  not  designed  to  differentiate between different types of prior disease modifying treatments.

## 3) The French Tysabri Registry (TYSEDMUS)

The study was launched in November 2007. An interim analysis of data (as of November 3, 2011) from TYSEDMUS  showed  that  of  3178  MS  patients  prescribed  Tysabri  in  France,  766  patients  (27%) received GA as their last treatment for MS just prior to starting Tysabri; many of these patients had also received other MS therapies in the past. See Figure 5.

<!-- image -->

The number of relapses in the year before inclusion and in the first year of follow-up was known for 2245 patients out of 2324. The annual relapse rate in the first year of follow-up was 0.34 (+/- 0.68), versus 1.97 (+/- 1.17) in the year before inclusion, i.e. a significant  reduction  by  83%  (p&lt;0.0001, paired t-test). One thousand seven hundred and sixty-one patients out of 2324 (76%) had no relapse during the first year of follow-up.

The number of relapses in the year before inclusion and in the first two years of follow-up was known for 1507 patients out of 1560. The ARR was 0.31 (+/- 0.52) in the overall two-year period, versus 2.03 (+/- 1,16) in the year before inclusion, i.e. a reduction of 85% (p&lt;0.0001, paired t-test). The annual relapse rate was 0.34 (+/-0.68) in the first year and remained low in the second year (0.27 +/-0.60). One thousand two hundred and thirty three out of 1560 (65%) had no relapse during the first two years of follow-up.

The initial  EDSS  score  (at  inclusion)  and  at  one  year  (+/-  3  months)  was  known  for  1553  patients among the 2324 treated at least one year. The mean EDSS significantly decreased between inclusion and the first year (3.7 ± 1.8, versus 3.3 ±1.9, p&lt;0.0001, paired t-test). The median EDSS score after one  year  was  significantly  lower  from  the  median  initial  EDSS  score  (4.0  versus  3.5;  p&lt;0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Five hundred and seventy six patients (37%) were stable after 1 year, 656 (42%) improved by at least 0.5 point, and 321 (21%) worsened by at least 0.5 point.

The initial EDSS score (at inclusion) and at three years (+/- 3 months) was known for 504 patients among the 815 treated at least 3 years. The mean EDSS between inclusion and the third year was significantly different (3.8 ± 1.8 versus 3.4 ± 2.0 (p&lt;0.0001, paired t-test). The median EDSS score after three years was significantly different from the median initial EDSS score (4.0 vs. 3.5, p&lt;0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). One hundred and thirty patients (26%) were stable, 228 (45%) patients improved by at least 0.5 point, and 146 (29%) worsened by at least 0.5 point.

Among the 2324 patients followed for at least 1 year, both baseline and one year (+/- 3 months) MRI with gadolinium were available in 682 patients. This small proportion could in part be explained by the initial absence of recommendations regarding a systematic MRI follow-up of patients treated with Tysabri. Since January 2010, a yearly MRI has been recommended both by the EMA and the AFSSAPS. Thirty-seven patients (5 %) presented an active lesion (gadolinium-enhancing) after one year, versus

380 (56 %) at the time of inclusion, i.e. a reduction of 90% of the number of active scans (p&lt;0.0001, Mc Nemar test).

Among the 1560 patients followed for at least 2 years, both baseline and two years (+/- 3 months) MRI with gadolinium were available in 419 patients. Twenty four patients (6 %) presented an active lesion  (gadolinium-enhancing)  after  two  years  versus  236  (56  %)  at  the  time  of  inclusion,  i.e.  a reduction of 90% of the number of active scans (p&lt;0.0001, Mc Nemar test).

Overall,  preliminary  data  confirmed  the  effectiveness  of  Tysabri  in  the  TYSEDMUS  population  as  a whole.  Although  no  sub-group  efficacy  analyses  were  available  of  last  MS  therapy  received  before starting Tysabri, the report did not suggest that the effectiveness of Tysabri differed depending on the last MS therapy received prior to Tysabri.

## 4) GLANCE

Based on data from monthly MRIs, the mean rate of development of new active lesions (the primary study  outcome)  was  0.03  with  combination  therapy  versus  0.11  with  GA  alone  (p  =  0.031). Combination therapy resulted in lower mean numbers of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (0.6 versus 2.3 for GA alone, p = 0.020) and new/newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions (0.5 versus 1.3, p = 0.029). In addition, approximately 43% fewer patients reported MS relapses in the Tysabri plus GA group as compared to GA alone. Similarly when the relapse rates were annualized, there was a 40% reduction in relapse rate on the Tysabri/GA combination versus GA alone. ARR in the GA group was 0.669 (95% CI: 0.338, 1.324) compared to 0.403 (95% CI: 0.195, 0.830) for the group that received GA in combination with Tysabri.

## 5) Patient cohort studies

- The results from the retrospective cohort study at the MS Centre, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, USA showed that there was no improvement in efficacy conferred following a switch from IFN-beta to GA, or from GA to IFN-beta; substantial efficacy was observed after switching from either DMT directly to Tysabri, as summarized in Table 2:

-  The  cohort  study  conducted  in  German  speaking  countries  showed  that  Tysabri  was  prescribed following first line treatment failure where the last DMT used was IFN-beta in 73 patients (75%), GA in 10 patients (10%) and other therapies in 14 patients (15%). Tysabri was associated with a reduction in  mean  ARR  from  2.3  to  0.2  ±  0.1  after  12  months  (P  &lt;  0.001),  and  80%  of  patients  remained relapse free during the observation period. The analyses were not designed to differentiate between different types of prior disease modifying treatments (Putzki et al. 2009). See Figures 12-13.

-  Some  of  the  patients  included  in  the  retrospective  multicentre  cohort  in  Switzerland  were  also included in the cohort study conducted in the German speaking countries described above. The last DMT used was IFN-beta  in  57  patients  (67%),  GA  in  11  patients  (13%)  and  other  therapies  in  18 patients (20%). Tysabri was associated with a reduction in ARR from 2.0 to 0.27, and 93% of patients were free of disability progression after 12 months (Putzki et al. 2009).

## 2.4.1.2. Discussion

In clinical practice both IFN-beta and glatiramer acetate (GA) are used as first line treatment in RRMS, with patients being changed from an IFN-beta to GA or vice versa if they are unable to tolerate or if they  fail  treatment.  More  recently,  two  randomized  studies  have  supported  this  practice  as  they confirmed  that  GA  has  comparable  efficacy  to  IFN-beta  (REGARD  and  BEYOND  studies)  with  ARR reductions to approximately 0.3.

Data from patients who have had an inadequate response to GA and switched directly to Tysabri have been  presented  from  several  observational  studies  including  TOP,  patient  cohort  data  from  MS treatment centers, the Swedish Tysabri Registry (IMSE), the French Tysabri Registry (TYSEDMUS), and the phase 2 study GLANCE. Overall, data indicated that Tysabri was effective as measured by relapses, EDSS, cognitive function, and other Quality of Life scales.

Interim data from TOP showed that in 25% of MS patients, the last MS therapy used immediately prior to the start of Tysabri treatment was GA. This was comparable to the usage of IFN-beta 1-b (18%), subcutaneous IFN-beta 1-a (23%) and intramuscular IFN-beta 1-a (18%). Tysabri was associated with significant reductions in the ARR in all subsets of subjects, irrespective of a history of GA only use or IFN-beta only use or switching between these DMTs prior to Tysabri. The magnitude of the response was similar across populations. The TOP data further indicated that patients who have not responded to a currently available first line treatment (IFN-beta or GA), rarely respond to the other second firstline treatment. However, switching to Tysabri in these patients was associated with significant clinical response.

Similar  findings  were  reported  from  patient  cohort  studies,  patient  registries  and  GLANCE,  although these programs were not designed to differentiate between different types of prior disease modifying treatments, as they did not include sub-group efficacy analyses based on the last MS therapy received before  starting  Tysabri.  However,  results  did  not  suggest  that  the  effectiveness  of  Tysabri  differed depending on the last MS therapy received prior to Tysabri.

Overall, these data indicate that Tysabri as a second line treatment is efficacious in patients that did not respond to a full and adequate course of GA.

The  benefit-risk profile of Tysabri has not been  established for (future) alternative first-line immunomodulatory  treatments.  The  CHMP  therefore  recommended  revision  of  the  initial  proposed wording for section 4.1 since the MAH proposal would not only have introduced glatiramer acetate as an  additional  example  of  treatment  failure,  but  would  have  broaden  the  indication  statement  to patients who have failed alternative immunomodulatory therapies (see 2.7).

## 2.4.1.3. Conclusions

On the basis of the available data, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy of Tysabri is demonstrated in the  RRMS  population  with  high  disease  activity  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of glatiramer acetate.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The safety results from the TOP study which have been summarized in prior PSURs. A recent analysis of TOP was performed using data as of June 1, 2012.

## 2.5.1.1. Results

The TOP interim report provided with the following safety summary information:

Overall 6.9% patients experienced an Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and 2.3% experienced an SAE that was  considered  related  to  Tysabri.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  Apart  from  infections (1.5%), no single SAE occurred in more than 1% of study patients. See Table 3.

|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Patients with at least 1 SAE                         | 308 (6.9 %)                         |
| Patients with at least 1 treatment-related SAE       | 100 (2.3%)                          |
| Deaths                                               | 8 (0.2%)                            |
| Patients diagnosed with PML                          | 12 (0.3%)                           |
| Patients hospitalized for an Opportunistic Infection | 1 (0.0%)                            |
| Patients hospitalized for other Infections           | 43 (1.0%)                           |
| Patients diagnosed with a malignancy                 | 20 (0.5%)                           |

Souuce: Table 16

There was a lower overall incidence of SAEs in therapy-naïve patients as compared with patients who received either ≥1 DMT (without prior immunosuppressant (IS) use) or IS therapy previously (naïve:

5.8%; ≥1 DMTs: 6.9%; IS: 7.8%). This was also true for infection SAEs (naïve:1.3%; ≥1 DMTs :1.5%; IS : 1.6%) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) SAEs (naïv: 0; ≥1 DMTs :0.3%; IS : 0.5%), although differences were not significant

Twelve patients were diagnosed with PML. The overall PML incidence rate was 2.71/1000 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.2). Median number of Tysabri infusion prior to the diagnosis of PML was 27 with doses ranging from 11-44. Three PML patients previously used IS (mitoxantrone in all cases).

The distribution of the type of malignancies in Tysabri-treated TOP patients is similar to that observed in a similarly aged general population. There were 20 patients diagnosed with 10 types of malignancies. The most frequently reported malignancies were breast cancer (n=5) and papillary thyroid cancer (n=3).

Eight deaths occurred during the study. Three were attributed to suicide, one each to sepsis (patient also had PML, which was ongoing at time of death due to urosepsis), pulmonary embolism, pathological fracture, drowning and lastly cause of death was unknown in one patient.

## 2.5.1.2. Discussion

Safety findings in TOP were generally consistent with previous studies of Tysabri. Safety results were not stratified for prior disease modifying treatment. However, previous experience with use of Tysabri does not indicate that the choice of prior disease modifying treatment, GA or beta INF, respectively, may influence the safety profile of Tysabri treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.1.3. Conclusions

On  the  basis  of  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  safety  profile  was  sufficiently characterised in the RRMS population with high disease activity who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of glatiramer acetate and is consistent to the known safety profile in the approved indication.

## 2.5.2. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

## 2.6.1. PRAC advice

The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. This advice follows the withdrawal of the variation related to RRMS population without high disease activity, for those patients who are negative for anti-JCV antibodies.

## PRAC Advice

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 16.1, the PRAC considers by consensus that the risk management system for natalizumab (TYSABRI) could be acceptable for the currently approved indication with the introduction of glatiramer acetate as an additional example of treatment failure provided an updated risk management plan is submitted and all references to the withdrawn indication are removed.

The currently approved indication is:

TYSABRI is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups:

- Adult patients aged 18 years and over with high disease activity despite treatment with a betainterferon.

These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

or

- Adult patients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

## Advice on conditions of the marketing authorisation

The PRAC do not advise any changes to the current conditions of the Marketing Authorisation.

This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication.

The PRAC also considered that all references to risk minimisation activities for the withdrawn variation should be removed from the risk minimisation plan which should be submitted in the new format within a month of the Commission Decision.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

The MAH initially proposed the following changes to the Product Information (new text= underlined, deleted text= strikethrough):

## Section 4.1

TYSABRI is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in adult patients aged 18 years and over with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis forin the following patient groups:

- Adult pPatients aged 18 years and who are negative for anti-JCV antibodies (see section 4.4) over with or without high disease activitydespite treatment with a beta-interferon.
- Patients who are positive for anti-JCV antibodies or have unknown anti-JCV antibody status (see section 4.4) with high disease activity, which may be defined as:
- ●PThese patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of alternative immunomodulatory therapies for example, beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

Or

- Adult pPatients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

## Section 4.4

Anti-JCV antibody testing provides supportive information for risk stratification of TYSABRI treatment. Patients who are anti-JCV antibody negative have a significantly lower risk of PML compared with antiJCV antibody positive patients. Testing for serum anti-JCV antibody prior to initiating TYSABRI therapy or in patients receiving TYSABRI with an unknown antibody status is recommended. Anti-JCV antibody negative  patients  may  still  be  at  risk  of  PML  for  reasons  such  as  a  new  JCV  infection,  fluctuating antibody status or a false negative test result. Re-testing of anti-JCV antibody negative patients every 6 months is recommended. Patients whose antibody status changes to anti-JCV antibody positive while on Tysabri should consider the benefit of continuing treatment in relation to the increase in risk of PML.

## Section 5.1

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Tysabri in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

Following the withdrawal of the variation related to RRMS population without high disease activity, for those patients who are negative for anti-JCV antibodies, the CHMP considered that the initial proposed wording for section 4.1 would not only have introduced glatiramer acetate as an additional example of treatment  failure,  but  would  have  broaden  the  indication  statement  to  patients  who  have  failed alternative  immunomodulatory  therapies.  However,  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  Tysabri  has  not  been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

established  for  (future)  alternative  first-line  immunomodulatory  treatments.  The  CHMP  therefore recommended a different wording to be implemented in section 4.1, which was accepted by the MAH. The final recommended wording of the indication is as follows:

TYSABRI is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups:

- Adult patients aged 18 years and over with high disease activity despite treatment with a betainterferon or glatiramer acetate.

These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'nonresponder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

or

- Adult patients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

In addition, the paediatric deferral statement has been included in the SmPC in accordance with QRD template version 8 (as shown above) and the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to add the contact details for the representative of Croatia.

Regarding the initial proposed changes in section 4.4, the CHMP noted that following the withdrawal of the  variation  related  to  RRMS  population  without  high  disease  activity,  for  those  patients  who  are negative for anti-JCV antibodies, the MAH submitted an update regarding the risk of PML for anti-JCV antibody negative patients in the context of the ongoing PSUR assessment (EMEA/H/C/000603/ PSU057).

In clinical practice both therapies, IFN-beta and GA, are used as first line treatment in RRMS. Recent data indicate that both treatments have comparable efficacy with ARR reductions to approximately 0.3 (REGARD and BEYOND studies). This reflects modest efficacy in slowing disease progression. Patients are  changed  from  an  IFN-beta  to  GA  or  vice  versa  if  they  are  unable  to  tolerate  or  if  they  fail treatment.

Data from patients who have had an inadequate response to either IFN-beta or GA and switched to Tysabri  indicate  that  Tysabri  is  equally  efficacious  is  these  two  patient  populations  as  measured  by relapses, EDSS, cognitive function, and other Quality of Life scales.

Moreover, TOP data indicate that patients who have not responded to a currently available first line treatment (IFN-beta or GA), rarely respond to the other second first-line treatment, while switching to Tysabri was associated with significant clinical response in these patients.

## 3.1.2. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

A  limitation  of  single-arm  observational  studies  like  TOP  and  data  from  patient  registries  versus randomized clinical trials is the lack of control groups and randomized treatment assignment.

However, the data form observational studies and registries presented here in support of extending the indication  to  RRMS  patients  who  have  failed  on  GA  therapy  are  in  line  with  previous  data  from controlled clinical trials. Although most analyses were not designed to discriminate between different prior  disease  modifying  therapies,  data  do  not  indicate  that  the  choice  of  prior  disease  modifying treatment, GA or beta INF, may influence the efficacy profile of Tysabri treatment.

## 3.2. Risks

## 3.2.1. Unfavourable effects

In TOP, safety findings were generally consistent with previous studies of Tysabri. No new safety concerns were identified.

## 3.2.2. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Safety results in TOP were not stratified for prior disease modifying treatment. However, the safety profile of Tysabri has been well characterized with over 6 years of marketing experience. Current data do not indicate new safety concerns.

## 3.3. Benefit-risk balance

## 3.3.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Current data do not indicate new safety concerns. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is considered to be similar in patients being switched from either of the two first line therapies, INF-beta or GA, with the same risk stratification algorithm applying to both patient groups.

## 3.3.2. Benefit-risk balance

IFN-beta and GA are both considered to confer moderate efficacy based upon the reduction in ARRs observed in randomized clinical studies. Although IFN beta therapy has been the standard of care for the early treatment of MS since the mid-nineties, two recent randomized studies have confirmed that GA has comparable efficacy to IFN-beta (REGARD and BEYOND studies) with ARR reductions to approximately 0.3. As such, these therapies are used as first line therapy in many patients and patients are only changed from an IFN-beta to GA or vice versa if they are unable to tolerate treatment or if they fail treatment. The various subgroup analyses in TOP indicate that Tysabri confers a substantial treatment benefit to patients after failure with either an IFN beta or GA, irrespective of whether one of these DMTs has been used alone or sequentially.

Data on safety did not indicate new concerns in patients switching from GA to Tysabri. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is considered to be equal in patients being switched from either of the two first line therapies, INF-beta or GA, with the same risk stratification algorithm applying to both patient groups.
