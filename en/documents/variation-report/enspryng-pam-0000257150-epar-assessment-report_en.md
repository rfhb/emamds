## 1. Introduction

On 28 February 2025, the MAH submitted a completed study for Enspryng including a few paediatric subjects in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  stated  that  WN42636  was  part  of  a  clinical  development program for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) but the program was halted by the MAH (see below).

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Satralizumab was supplied by the Sponsor as a prefilled syringe (PFS) assembled with a plunger rod, needle  safety  device  (NSD),  and  extended  finger  flange  (EFF)  filled  with  1.0 mL  of  solution  for subcutaneous (SC) injection corresponding to 120 mg. For the 180-mg dose of satralizumab, participants (&gt; 100  kg  of  weight)  were  administered  the  PFS  filled  with  1.0 mL  of  solution  for  SC  injection corresponding to 120 mg and a 0.5 ml syringe (60 mg) prepared on site. Satralizumab placebo PFS is identical in composition to satralizumab PFS but does not contain the satralizumab active ingredient.  It is identical in appearance and packaging to satralizumab.

A PFS (assembled with an NSD/EFF) filled with 0.5 mL of solution, corresponding to 60 mg satralizumab was used in the open-label extension (OLE) period of the study (after the second OLE dose).

No specific paediatric formulation was used.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted final report for:

· Study WN42636 (LUMINESCE): A PHASE III, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND (DB), PLACEBOCONTROLLED,  MULTICENTER  STUDY  TO  EVALUATE  EFFICACY,  SAFETY,  PHARMACOKINETICS,  AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF SATRALIZUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH GENERALIZED MYASTHENIA GRAVIS.

In addition, the study assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of satralizumab during the OLE period.

The study included a 28-day screening period, a 24-week DB treatment period, and approximately 2year OLE period after the last participant initiated open-label treatment.

## Description

The study WN42636 was planned to be the pivotal study for gMG as a new indication for satralizumab. However,  upon  review  of  the  primary  analysis  results  (DB  period),  the  sponsor  decided  to  halt development of satralizumab in gMG and discontinued further dosing with the study drug (while the OLE period was ongoing).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results from the study is being submitted to the European Medicines Agency to fulfil the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

## Methods

## Study participants

A  total  of  186  participants  (185  adults  and  1  adolescent  participant  [Patient  A;  see  Table 1])  were enrolled in the study. Additional 2 adolescent participants (Patient B and Patient C; see Table 1) were randomized after the last adult participant was enrolled in the study and were therefore not part of the intent to treat (ITT) and modified ITT (mITT) population for the primary analysis. The safety evaluable population comprised all participants randomly assigned to study treatment who received at least one dose  of  study  treatment,  including  the  2  adolescents  enrolled  after  the  last  adult  participant  was randomized.

Key Inclusion Criteria

Participants had to meet the following key criteria for study entry:

- Age ≥12 years at time of signing informed consent form;
- Confirmed diagnosis of gMG meeting the following criteria:
- Documented history of myasthenic weakness;
- MG severity of Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Class II, III, or IV at screening;
- The confirmation of the diagnosis had to be documented and supported by positive serologic test for one of the three antibody types: anti-AChR (antibodies against acetylcholine receptor), antiMuSK (antibodies against muscle-specific kinase), or anti-LRP4 (antibodies against low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4) at screening.

## Treatments

Participants received SC satralizumab or the matching volume of placebo at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (loading doses), and Q4W thereafter, throughout the DB period in addition to background treatments at a stable dose.

In the OLE period, all participants received a SC injection of satralizumab at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, and Q4W thereafter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objective

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of satralizumab versus placebo on function in daily life in the AChR+ population.

## Outcomes/endpoints

PRO data were collected through use of the following instruments: MG Activities of Daily Living (MGADL); Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 Scale revised (MG-QOL 15r); Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) Fatigue Subscale; EQ-5D-5L (EuroQoL 5-dimension questionnaire).

ClinRO  data  was  collected  through  use  of  the  following  instruments:  quantitative  myasthenia  gravis (QMG); myasthenia gravis composite (MGC).

## Sample size

The sample size of approximately 185 participants (160 AChR + participants and up to 25 AChR - (MuSK + or LRP4 +) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups. This was predicted to provide approximately 85% power to detect a difference in the mean change from baseline in MG-ADL at Week 24 in AChR + participants between satralizumab and placebo.

The mean change from baseline to Week 24 in placebo group was assumed to be 2.3 points and in the satralizumab group 4.3 points. The standard deviation of the change from baseline was assumed to be 3.97. Approximately 10% of participants were assumed to withdraw during conduct of the study.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

During  the  24-week  double  blind  period,  eligible  participants  were  randomized  to  one  of  the  two treatment groups in a 1:1 allocation and received either 120 mg or 180 mg (in a body weight-tiered dosing regimen) of satralizumab or matching placebo SC treatment at Weeks 0, 2 and 4, and Q4W thereafter until the end of the DB period in addition to background treatments at a stable dose.

## Statistical Methods

Serum concentrations of satralizumab (and pharmacodynamic variables (IL-6, sIL-6R)) were determined by validated quantitative sandwich immunoassay.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed on all participants in the safety analysis set with at least one valid post-dose concentration result with a dosing record and sampling time. 1 paediatric patient (16-year old, 58 kg) was included in the PK-dataset. Serum samples were collected pre-dose at weeks 0, 2, 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter during the DB and OLE period. Satralizumab concentrations were summarized using descriptive statistics (including geometric mean and coefficient of variance (CV)%, arithmetic mean and SD, median, observed maximums and minimums, and sample size). Non-linear mixed effects modelling was used to estimate population and individual PK parameters and to investigate the influence of covariates such as presence of antidrug antibody (ADA), age, race, gender, and body weight.

## Results

## Participant flow

The patient disposition is shown in Figure 1.

## Recruitment

Due to recruitment difficulties  for  adolescents  related  to  placebo  use  in  the  DB  period,  the  sponsor decided to enroll adolescents directly into the OLE period. The ITT and mITT exclude adolescents joining the study after the last adult participant was randomized. No subgroup analyses were performed in adolescent participants.

Adolescent Population: 2 treated with placebo, 1 with satralizumab

## Number analysed

The ITT population included 96 participants in the satralizumab group and 90 participants in the placebo group. The OP (as randomized) included 96 participants in the satralizumab group and 92 participants in the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety-evaluable population comprised 96 participants in the satralizumab group and 92 participants in the placebo group, all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. 1 of the 96 participants in the satralizumab group and 2 of the 92 participants in the placebo group were adolescents.

The mITT comprised a total of 96 participants in the satralizumab group and 89 participants in the placebo  group  who  were  either  AChR+  or  AChR  -  (86  AChR+  and  10  AChR-  participants  in  the satralizumab group; 80 AChR+ and 9 AChR- participants in the placebo group).

## Pharmacokinetic results

Observed  serum  satralizumab  concentrations  over  time  during  the  DB  period  in  the  PK  evaluable population is shown in Figure 2. Trough concentrations were at approximate steady state during the entire DB period Table 2. The reported observed pre-dose concentrations for the ID 1011 adolescent patient (ID 10119) were 10900 - 16700 ng/mL between week 4 - 24 (n=6).

A previous model developed for NMO, NMOSD and healthy volunteers (Roche Report #1094498) was updated with new data from patients with gMG from Study WN42636 (cut-off date 2023) and used to describe the PK of satralizumab in the population. The final model was a two-compartment model with linear and Michel-Menten elimination. Updates on the model were made on the effect of ADA, PE- and IVIg treatment. Model evaluation diagnostics indicates good description of the population.

The  summaries  of  predicted  exposures  stratified  by  covariate  group  are  presents  in  Table  3.  The predicted exposures (Ctrough, Cmax and AUC) for the 16-years old paediatric patient falls within the 90% prediction intervals for the rest of the population.

## Efficacy results

The primary endpoint of difference between the placebo and satralizumab groups in combination with stable background therapy in change from baseline to Week 24 in the total MG -ADL score in the AChR+ population met statistical significance in favor of satralizumab; however, the effect size observed was considered small.

In the satralizumab group, the mean change from baseline to Week 24 in the total MG-ADL score was -3.59 (95% CI: -4.15, -3.02) and in the placebo group was -2.57 (95% CI: -3.25, -1.88). The difference in adjusted mean was -1.02 (95% CI: -1.88, -0.16), p = 0.0196.

## Safety results

The mean duration of observation was comparable between the satralizumab group (138.6 days) and the placebo group (139.4 days). During the DB period, the proportion of participants who experienced at  least  one  adverse  event  (AE)  was  higher  in  the  satralizumab  group  (89.6%,  86/96  participants) compared to the placebo group (72.8%; 67/92 participants). The most common AEs in both groups were COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, hypertension, and pharyngitis. None of the AEs had a higher frequency (&gt;5% difference) in the satralizumab group compared to the placebo group. The majority of AEs were non-serious and grade 1-2 in severity.

Additional analyses were conducted by comparing results obtained in participants treated with different doses of satralizumab (120 mg vs. 180 mg) determined on the basis of body weight. The safety profile of satralizumab was comparable between the 2 doses.

The safety profile (AEs per 100 patient/year) in the overall satralizumab treatment (OST) period was consistent with the safety profile during the DB period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

None of the AEs reported during the safety follow-up period were considered related to the study drug, and no safety concern was identified.

The  safety  data  collected  in  Study  WN42636  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of satralizumab. No new safety signals were observed.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The study WN42636 was planned to be the pivotal study for gMG as a new indication for satralizumab. However,  upon  review  of  the  primary  analysis  results  (DB  period),  the  Sponsor  decided  to  halt development of satralizumab in gMG and discontinued further dosing with the study drug (while the OLE period was ongoing).

Results from the study is being submitted to the European Medicines Agency to fulfil the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. No subgroup analysis could be performed on adolescents due to the limited number.

Pk data from one adolescent (16 years, 58 kg) patient with gMG were available. The exposure for this patient was within the exposure range for the adult population. This is in line with previous observations for adolescents ≥ 40 kg.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The  results  from  study  WN42636  were  submitted  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  to  fulfil  the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. No subgroup analysis could be performed on adolescents due to the limited number. No assessment of the data could be performed due to limited data  related  to  the  low  number  (N=3)  of  adolescents.  The  Rapporteur  considers  the  requirements fulfilled.

Fulfilled: No regulatory action required.
