## 1. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a common term used to describe a complex of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The symptoms include urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually  accompanied  by  frequency  and  nocturia  when  appearing  in  the  absence  of  pathologic  or metabolic  factors  which  would  account  for  these  symptoms 1,  2 Patients  with  an  overactive  bladder include those with and without a possible neurological cause for their symptoms.

Incontinence  is  not  necessary  for  diagnosis;  however  is  a  chronic  condition  present  in  over  half  of female patients with OAB. Urinary incontinence is defined by the International Continence Society 1, 2 as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine.

The key symptom of OAB is urgency, the sudden compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer. Frequency  is  defined  as  the  patient  complaint  of  voiding  too  often  by  day,  and  nocturia  is  the complaint that the individual wakes at night to void. Urge incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency. 1, 2

Other  types  of  urinary  incontinence  include  stress  incontinence  and  mixed  incontinence.  Stress incontinence is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion or on sneezing or coughing. Mixed incontinence is the complaint of involuntary leakage associated with urgency and with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing . 1, 2

Observations made during urodynamic testing do not represent a definite diagnose 1, 2 . The overactive bladder is a chronic condition defined urodynamically as detrussor overactivity, and characterised by involuntary bladder contractions during the filling phase of the micturition cycle.

The precise aetiology of overactive bladder is unknown. Neurologic illness or injury, bladder outlet obstruction,  urethral  weakness,  detrussor  hyperactivity,  emergence  of  new  voiding  reflexes  and idiopathic bladder overactivity are considered within the causes of OAB.

The prevalence of OAB has probably been underestimated because nearly all epidemiologic studies have  been  previously  focused  on  urinary  incontinence  and  because  many  patients  are  reluctant  to discuss the subject with their doctors. Nevertheless, the recent standardisation of terminology by the International  Continence  Society  (ICS) 1,  2 has  facilitated  obtaining  reliable  epidemiologic  data  on OAB.  The  overall  prevalence  in  Europe  has  been  estimated  to  be  16.6%  on  the  basis  of  a population-based survey (15.6% for men and 17.4% for women) 3 . Although the overall prevalence is similar in men and women, there is a female-to-male preponderance in the prevalence of OAB with urge urinary incontinence, while OAB without urge urinary incontinence is more prevalent in men. Moreover, the prevalence  of  OAB symptomatology increased with advancing age in both men and women (41.9% of men and 31.3% of women over the age of 75 years) 3 . Finally, obesity is associated with symptoms of OAB, and the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and OAB with urge

urinary  incontinence  appears  stronger  than  that  between  BMI  and  OAB  without  urge  urinary incontinence 3 .

The functional integrity of the lower urinary tract, the kidneys, and the nervous system (predominantly under the control of the parasympathetic nervous system) are the key factors to maintain continence and bladder function. Bladder function involves a bladder filling and urine storage phase, which leads to a bladder emptying phase. A stable bladder wall muscle (detrusor) and a functional sphincter allow bladder filling during the storage phase 4 .

Undesired bladder muscle contraction may occur as the result of a break in the neurological pathway from the brain to the bladder. It can also occur if the bladder is irritated and the normal neurological impulses to inhibit urination are insufficient to keep the bladder relaxed as it fills.

The  course  of  OAB  is  not  life  threatening,  however  symptoms  may  diminish  the  psychosocial, occupational,  and  sexual  function  of  patients  affecting  quality  of  life.  Patients  consider  urinary leakage, frequency and urgency to be bothersome 5 .  Complications and comorbidities include urinary tract  infection  (UTI),  skin  ulceration  in  OAB  with  urge  incontinence,  and  a  greater  risk  of  bone fracture from a fall, although some research has found little association. Sleep disturbances, restricted motility, isolation and depression are described as the psychological and lifestyle related consequences of OAB.

Treatment may be managed using nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies.

## Nonpharmacologic treatment:

Include  lifestyle  changes  (controlled  fluid  intake),  behavioural  therapies,  pelvic  floor  electrical stimulation, and surgical procedures.

Standard behavioural therapies include bladder training which focuses on voiding habits.

Pelvic muscle training exercises called Kegel exercises are primarily used to treat patients with stress incontinence.

## Pharmacological treatment:

Medicinal products are aimed at diminish or suppress the intensity of involuntary detrusor contractions and  include  anticholinergic  agents,  antispasmodic  medications,  tricyclic  antidepressants,  and  beta agonist.

With  geographic  differences,  currently  approved  medical  treatments  are  propiverine,  propantheline, solifenacin,  oxybutynin,  tolterodine,  flavoxate,  darifenacine,  imipramine,  doxepin,  terbutaline  and trospium.

Oxybutynin and tolterodine are antispasmodic medications and are the most commonly used.

## About the product

The claimed indication of fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg prolonged-release tablets was the treatment of overactive  bladder  with  symptoms  of  urgency  urinary  incontinence  and/or  urgency  and/or  urinary frequency.

Fesoterodine  (INN)  is  a  new  chemical  entity  developed  as  a  hydrogen  fumarate  salt.  Fesoterodine fumarate  is  the  modified  INN  (INNM).  It  is  the  dextrorotary  enantiomer  of  a  derivative  of 3,3-diphenylpropylamine with the chemical name 'Isobutyric acid 2-((R)-3-diisopropylammonium-1phenylpropyl)-4- (hydroxymethyl)phenyl ester hydrogen fumarate'.

No formal scientific advice was given by the CHMP.

## 2. Quality Aspects

## Introduction

TOVIAZ is presented as prolonged-release tablets containing 4 mg and 8 mg of fesoterodine fumarate as  active  substance  (corresponding  to  3.1  mg  and  6.2  mg  fesoterodine  respectively).  The  other ingredients  are  xylitol,  lactose  monohydrate,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  hypromellose,  glycerol dibehenate and talc. The film-coat consists polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol 3350, talc, soya lecithin and indigo camine aluminium lake.

The prolonged-release tablets are packaged in aluminium-aluminium blisters.

## Drug Substance

The drug substance is presented as the fumarate salt. Fesoterodine fumarate is Isobutyric acid 2-((R)3-diisopropylammonium-1-phenylpropyl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl ester hydrogen fumarate according to the IUPAC nomenclature.

Fesoterodine fumarate is a white to off-white powder. It is freely soluble in aqueous solvents, soluble in  some  polar  protic  organic  solvents  (such  as  ethanol,  methanol,  glacial  acetic  acid,  2-propanol, propylene glycol) and polar non protic solvents (such as acetone, DMF, DMSO, acetonitrile ), slightly soluble in toluene and it is practically insoluble in heptane.

## · Manufacture

Fesoterodine fumarate is synthesised in eight reactions steps with two solid isolations.

The manufacturing process has been adequately described. Critical parameters have been identified and adequate in-process controls included.

Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of intermediates has been presented.

Structure elucidation has been performed by ultraviolet spectroscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, optical rotation and chiral capillary electrophoresis. The results of the elemental analysis are consistent with the proposed molecular formula. Unambiguous proof of structure was provided by X-ray crystallography.

## · Specification

The active substance specifications include tests for appearance, particle size, identification (IR and HPLC), melting point, water content (Karl Fischer), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur. the specification only refers to the current Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), impurities (HPLC), chiral purity (Capillary electrophoresis), specific optical rotation (Polarimetry) and assay (HPLC).

The  specifications  attributes  reflect  all  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  active  substance.  The analytical methods which were used in the routine controls were described and their validations are in accordance with the ICH Guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Impurities  have  been  extensively  described,  classified  as  process  related  impurities  and  possible degradation  products,  and  qualified.  Impurity  limits  in  the  specification  are  justified  by  toxicology studies.

The residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance. All batch analysis results comply with the specification and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

## · Stability

The stability results from long-term, accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines and demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. It was confirmed that the active substance is very stable when exposed to a variety of stressed conditions such as, thermal, humidity, acid or alkaline conditions, oxidizing conditions and light exposure. The results of the long-term and accelerated studies support the retest period.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The drug substance fesoterodine fumarate was developed with the objective of having a crystalline and stable substance, but the free base of the drug substance was not suitable for processing since it is an  oily  liquid  and  does  not  have  crystalline  properties.  Therefore,  the  hydrogen  fumarate  salt  was chosen  as  a  drug  substance  which  is  a  crystalline  non-hygroscopic  substance  with  relatively  high melting point.

Fesoterodine tablets are formulated as a prolonged release formulation in order to provide a once daily dosage  form.  The  formulation  is  a  hydrogel  matrix  tablet  based  on  hypromellose.  Results  of formulation  and  process  development  studies  demonstrate  that  the  tablet  formulation  and  the manufacturing process are robust.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing processes such as wet granulation, drying, dry blending, compression and coating unit operations. Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. The major steps to prepare fesoterodine tablets are the wet granulation and drying processes for the manufacture  of  the  granules,  dry  blending  of  granulate  with  remaining  excipients,  and  the  tablet compression process. The wet granulation process was optimized with regard to sieve size, amount of water and mixing time.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specification.

## · Product Specification

The  drug  product  specifications  were  established  according  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the following tests: appearance, odour (sensory examination), size, identification (HPLC, UV), impurities (HPLC),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer),  dissolution,  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  unit  and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).

## · Stability of the Product

The stability studies were conducted according to the current ICH guideline. Three production scale batches of each strength have been stored at long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions in the proposed market packaging.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One production batch per strength was stored under elevated temperature light exposure and humidity conditions for 3 months and at ICH conditions.

Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture,  control of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant guidelines. The results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  finished  product. Therefore, this medicinal product is expected to have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  two  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  which  have  no impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. The applicant gave a letter of undertaking and committed to resolve these as follow up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

All  pivotal  safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  including  the  determination  of  plasma concentrations  of  fesoterodine  and/or  SPM  7605  were  carried  out  in  conformance  with  Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards with the exceptions of an in vitro follow-up electrophysiological study  (sodium  channel,)  and  the  determination  of  the  secondary  metabolites  in  selected  plasma samples.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

Binding  of  fesoterodine  and  several  of  its  in  vivo  metabolites  to  human  recombinant  muscarinic acetylcholine  receptors  (M1-M5)  stably  expressed  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  was investigated  in  competition  binding  experiments.  For  comparison,  tolterodine  was  used  as  the reference compound. SPM 7605, the primary in vivo metabolite, bound with high affinity to all the muscarinic receptors subtypes, see table below. There was no selectivity of SPM 7605 in binding to these receptors. Fesoterodine was also non-selective and had at least a 100-fold lower binding affinity than the active metabolite.

| M 3                   | nd             | 6.3            | 489            | nd             | 338            | 12             |
| M 4                   | 177            | 1.0            | 94             | nd             | 35             | 1.9            |

Taking into account these results, the main active pharmacological principle of fesoterodine in vivo is SPM 7605.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  a  separate  study  the  binding  affinity  of  tolterodine,  fesoterodine  and  SPM  7605  to  all  human muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5) was determined as shown in the table below.

## Binding to muscarinic receptor subtypes by fesoterodine, SPM 7605 and tolterodine

| Muscarinic receptor   | Ki (nmol/L)   | Ki (nmol/L)   | Ki (nmol/L)   |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Muscarinic receptor   | Fesoterodine  | SPM 7605      | Tolterodine   |
| M 1                   | 52            | 0.9           | 5.0           |
| M 2                   | nd            | 2.9           | 14            |
| M 3                   | 209           | 1.7           | 4.6           |
| M 4                   | 23            | 1.1           | 4.6           |
| M 5                   | 285           | 2.7           | 7.2           |

Each determination was performed in duplicate nd= not determined (50% binding at 1 micromol/L)

The data obtained in this study are qualitatively comparable to those presented previously. All three compounds showed no selectivity towards the 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes. SPM 7605 exhibited the highest affinity, while fesoterodine was much less potent. The difference in the absolute numbers measured in these studies in comparison to the study reported above may be explained by different cell  clones  and  expression  systems  used  by  the  two  different  laboratories,  which  performed  the studies.

The specificity of fesoterodine and of its metabolite SPM 7605 was investigated in a broad screen of 41 receptors and ion channels. In particular, fesoterodine and its metabolite SPM 7605 do not interact with α -adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and excitatory amino acid receptors.

Functional  antimuscarinic  activity in  vitro was  demonstrated  in  organ  bath  studies  with  isolated bladder  strips,  where  maximum  inhibition  of  electrical  field  stimulation-induced  contractions  were observed at fesoterodine and SPM 7605 concentrations of 0.1 µM, tolterodine 0.3 µM, oxybutynin 0.1 µM and atropine 0.1 µM.

Both fesoterodine and the active metabolite SPM 7605 showed pronounced spasmolytic properties in the guinea-pig ileum model in vitro as can be expected from the anticholinergic mechanism of action.

## In vivo studies

Intravenous administration of fesoterodine and SPM 7605 reduced micturition pressure and increased bladder  capacity  and  intercontraction  intervals  at  0.01  mg/kg  in  the  rat  model  (Breidenbach  et  al, 2002).

The effects of SPM 7605 on urinary bladder contractions and salivation were also investigated in cats (Nilvebrant et al, 1997). SPM 7605 dose-dependently inhibited acetylcholine-induced contractions of the  bladder  (ID50  5.1  µg/kg).  There  was  also  a  dose-dependent  inhibition of electrically  stimulated salivation  observed with an ID50 of 13.7 µg/kg. This indicates that SPM 7605 is three times more potent at the urinary bladder compared to the salivary gland.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics and Safety pharmacology

## Cardiovascular system

The cardiovascular system has been extensively investigated both in vitro and in vivo .

In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells expressing hERG, fesoterodine and SPM 7605 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current with IC50 values of 3.6 and 0.5 µM, respectively. The metabolite SPM 5509 showed a similar concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current (IC50 = 3.3 µM) while the metabolite SPM 6923 had a weaker effect (inhibition of 22% at 300 µM, the highest  concentration  tested).  In  single  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells  expressing  the  human  SCN5A gene, SPM 7605 concentration dependently reduced the fast sodium current.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Blockade of the hERG-mediated potassium current has also been observed for other antimuscarinic agents such as solifenacin (IC500.27 µmol/L), tolterodine (IC500.009 µmol/L) and darifenacin (IC500.077 µmol/L).

The effects of fesoterodine, SPM 7605 and tolterodine on cardiac ion channels are summarized in the following table.

## Effects of fesoterodine, SPM 7605 and tolterodine on cardiac ion channels

| Cardiac ion channel   | IC50 (µmol/L) or %inhibition at 15 µmol/L   | IC50 (µmol/L) or %inhibition at 15 µmol/L   | IC50 (µmol/L) or %inhibition at 15 µmol/L   |

| Ca, L-Type            | 44%                                         | 18%                                         | 17%                                         |

The  cardiac  electrophysiological  studies  were  performed  with  fesoterodine  and  its  metabolite SPM7605.

In  vitro, a  concentration-dependent  increase  in  action  potential  duration  was  observed  in  isolated canine Purkinje fibres at 70% (APD70) and 90% (APD90) from 1.5x10 -7 to 1.5x10 -6 M. The increase was  statistically  significant  at  1.5x10 -6 M.  At  1.5x10 -5 M,  APD50  and  APD70  were  decreased, associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  amplitude  of  action  potential  and  in  the  depolarisation  rate, suggesting an interaction with the sodium channel.

In vivo ,  a dose-dependent tachycardia with no change in mean arterial pressure was observed in rats dosed  with  fesoterodine  3-30  mg/kg  as  expected  from  the  antimuscarinic  effect  of  fesoterodine. Moreover, a dose-dependent decrease in baroreflex sensitivity was observed which might indicate that fesoterodine can induce orthostatic hypotension in man, however, this has not translated in to a clinical signal.

In vivo , in anaesthetised dogs, slight decreases (3 to 9%) in systolic blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure and renal artery blood flow were found at 8 µg/kg of intravenous fesoterodine.

At a dose of 800 µg/kg i.v., decreases in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and coronary artery blood flow and prolongation of the QT interval and QTc interval were noted. However, in a 13-week toxicity study with continuous intravenous infusion of SPM7605 in dogs, no effect on the QT or QTc interval was  observed  at  free  plasma  concentrations  21-33  fold  higher  than  measured  following  8  mg  in humans . The clinical relevance of these findings for humans  is not clear . (See clinical section)

## Central nervous system

The main CNS-related effect of fesoterodine is a slight CNS stimulatory effect observed in mice (1030  mg/kg  p.o.)  in  behavioural  tests.  In  accordance  with  the  proposed  mechanism  of  action,  the increases in restlessness and spontaneous locomotor activity are expected. Fesoterodine (3-30 mg/kg) had  a  slight  analgesic  effect  at  30  mg/kg  but  no  pro-convulsive  or  anticonvulsive  properties.  A statistically significant decrease in body temperature was observed at 3 mg/kg at one time point only but not at 10 or 30 mg/kg and is considered of low clinical relevance.

## Other organ systems

No relevant effects have been observed on respiratory, autonomic nervous, renal and gastro-intestinal systems.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

The ability of fesoterodine to interact pharmacodynamically with other drugs has not been investigated. However, the mechanism of action of muscarinic receptor antagonist is well documented and potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions are published.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed but rapidly metabolized to SPM 7605, mainly in mice and rats. Tmax was approximately 0.5 h for mouse, rat and rabbit and 1 h in dogs.

Bioavailability was determined to be 50, 14 and 98% in mice, rats, and dogs, respectively. Due to a rapid hydrolysis of fesoterodine only SPM 7605, the major metabolite, was determined in mouse, rat, rabbit and human plasma. Fesoterodine is more slowly hydrolysed in dogs, where both fesoterodine and SPM 7605 can be detected in plasma. The extent of systemic exposure was characterized by nonlinear (dose-dependent) kinetics with a more than dose-proportionate increase of fesoterodine in dogs and of SPM 7605 in mice and dogs.

The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC of fesoterodine and its metabolites, in the plasma of human subjects, and in mice and dogs at the NOAEL are compared below.

## Distribution

The  distribution  of  [ 14 C]  fesoterodine  and/or  its  metabolites  was  studied  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs following oral administration. Fesoterodine was widely distributed in mice and rats. Highest levels of radioactivity were found in organs involved in drug elimination; however no specific affinity/uptake to organs/tissues was detected. No notable accumulation was observed. In dogs, the radioactivity is less widely distributed with highest concentrations of radioactivity detected in the intestinal tract. A slight accumulation  was  observed  in  skin  and  eyes.  [ 14 C]  Fesoterodine  and/or  its  metabolites  crossed  the blood-brain barrier to a low extent and did cross the placenta and distribute into fetal tissues in mice. The serum protein binding was low (21-30%) in mouse, rat and dog comparable to that in man (53%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  vitro ,  fesoterodine  is  extensively  metabolized  by  non-cytochrome  P450  activity  to  the  major metabolite  SPM  7605  (human,  rabbit  &gt;  mouse  &gt;  dog  &gt;&gt;  rat).  Further  metabolism  takes  place  via CYP2D6  to  the  carboxy  metabolite  SPM  5509  (major)  or  via  CYP3A4  to  the  N-desisopropyl metabolite SPM 7789 (minor). Both SPM 5509 and SPM 7789 are then further metabolized to SPM 7790.

In  vivo ,  in  all  animal  species  (and  humans),  the  major  biotransformation  pathways  involved  rapid hydrolysis  that  leads  to  the  formation  of  SPM  7605  followed  by  oxidation  and  N-dealkylation (mediated both by CYP activity). In these species, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma and SPM 7605  can  be  regarded  both  as  major  metabolite  and  active  principle  of  fesoterodine.  No  gender differences have been observed except in the rat. The dog does not hydrolyze fesoterodine to the same extent as observed in the other species, thus fesoterodine can be detected in plasma of the dog together with the other metabolites.

No  or  low  inhibitory  interactions  with  CYP1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6  and  3A4  were  detectable  for fesoterodine.

## Excretion

Fesoterodine and/or its metabolites are rapidly excreted with the majority of the dose recovered within 48 hours. In the dog, the majority of radioactivity (60-67%) was excreted in urine. Both urinary and fecal  elimination  are  relevant  in  the  mouse.  In  the  rat,  the  largest  portion  of  radioactivity  was recovered in feces. In humans, about 70% of an oral dose of fesoterodine is recovered in urine.

## Toxicology

The  toxicity  of  single  doses  of  fesoterodine  has  been  investigated via  the  oral  and  i.v.  routes  of administration in the mouse and rat.

Repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  in  mouse,  rat  and  Beagle  dog.  Based  on pharmacokinetic/metabolism data, the mouse and dog are considered the most relevant animal species for the human situation, the rat being less relevant due to different metabolism.

- Single dose toxicity

Dose-related clinical signs were mainly CNS related such as reduced motility, ataxia, dyspnoea and reduced muscle tone starting at 215 mg/kg (oral) or 21.5 mg/kg (iv).  Approximate LD50 in the mouse was 316/31.6 mg/kg and in the rat 681 (males) 454 (females)/31.6 mg/kg

Toxicokinetic  data  are  available  from  the  acute  toxicity  studies  using  p.o.  administration.  The exposure in mice and rats at the non-lethal dose 215 mg/kg was respectively 80-300 times and 12-30 times the human exposure.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Fesoterodine was administered orally to mouse for 6 months, rats for 3 months and Beagle dogs for 9 months.  Furthermore,  mice  were  dosed  via  4-hour/day  intravenous  infusion  with  fesoterodine  18 mg/kg for 14 days. Dogs were treated similarly with fesoterodine 6 mg/kg for 14 days (4-hour/day), and with SPM 7605 4.5 mg/kg for 13 weeks (24-hour/day). The main target organ of toxicity was the liver in rat. No target organ of toxicity was identified in the mouse or the dog.

Mice were dosed at 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg, the latter increased in week 16 at 125 mg/kg (females) and 100  mg/kg  (males)  of  fesoterodine  by  oral  gavage  for  6  months.  Some  high  dose  animals  died probably  in  relation  to  urinary  tract  infection  secondary  to  bladder  distension,  an  exaggerated pharmacodynamic (antimuscarinic) effect of fesoterodine/SPM 7605. High dose animals showed also piloerection  and  a  slightly  reduced  body  weight  gain  (5%  in  males  and  8%  in  females),  a  slight reduction (20-24%) in platelets in both male and female and  a slight increase in glucose (26%) in female  only.  Triglycerides  were  significantly  reduced  and  plasma  urea  was  increased  in  high  dose male mice in week 13 and 26. These moderate changes, without corresponding findings in clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

trials, are considered of low clinical relevance.

The NOAEL was 25 mg/kg at which Cmax was 144 ng/ml in males and 258 in females and AUC 379 h ng/ml in males and 575 h ng/ml in females. Thus based on Cmax the exposure margin to human exposure is 16-30 and 4-6 based on AUC values.

No additional toxicological effects were observed in studies of shorter duration or in a 14-days study with intravenous infusion where exposure did not exceed the exposure obtained in the high dose group dosed by oral gavage.

Rats were dosed with 5, 25 and 75 mg/kg fesoterodine by oral gavage (13 week MTD study). Body weight was reduced (3-11%) in high dose males while only a marginal effect was noted in females. The food consumption was decreased by approximately 10% in both males and females. A dose of 75 mg/kg  resulted  in  increased  bilirubin,  cholesterol,  ALAT,  ASAT,  ALP  activity  and  triglycerides. Absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased in females at 25 mg/kg and in both sexes of the high dose group. Histopathology showed a minimal to moderate pericholangitis with mild bile duct proliferation in high dose females. Thus, the target organ of toxicity is the liver in rats most pronounced in females.

In a supplementary study including toxicokinetics, at dosage of 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg, the NOAEL was determined to be 15 mg/kg.

At  a  dose  of  15  mg/kg  Cmax  levels  of  13.9-93.1  ng/ml  has  been  observed  in  male  rats  and corresponding  values  for  females  is  6.8-36.8  ng/ml.  AUC  value  for  males  is  125-182  h  ng/ml  and 47.2-73.4 h ng/ml in females. Exposure margins of 1-10 were obtained based on Cmax values and based on AUC values an exposure around clinical exposure was obtained in rats.

In  the  pivotal  9-month  study Beagle  dogs received  fesoterodine  0.5,  2.5  and  12.5  mg/kg  by  oral capsule. The most pronounced clinical finding was related to the eyes: mydriasis conjunctivitis and adhered  eyelids.  The  animals  had  to  be  treated  with  artificial  lachrymal  fluid  from  test  day  29 onwards.  These  effects  are  related  to  the  anticholinergic  mechanism  of  action  of  fesoterodine/SPM 7605. Clinical biochemistry showed an increase in bilirubin and plasma urea levels. However, this was not associated with any drug-related macroscopic or histopathological changes of the liver.

The electrocardiographic evaluation demonstrated a dose-dependent (animals dosed with 2.5 and 12.5 mg/kg) increase in heart rate in male and female dogs estimated 4 hours after dosing. The effect had nearly subsided 24 hours after dosing and no effect on QRS, QT, QTc, PQ-intervals and P segment were observed. In addition no effect on blood pressure was noted.

The  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  2.5  mg/kg,  all  effects  being considered as  exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects of fesoterodine/SPM 7605.

- Genotoxicity

In  vitro ,  fesoterodine  has  been  tested  in  Ames  test  and  in  chromosomal  aberration  tests  using metabolic activation both from rat and mouse liver. No induced mutation frequency or chromosomal aberrations  were  observed  up  to  cytotoxic  concentrations  of  fesoterodine  either  with  or  without metabolic activation.

In vivo ,  fesoterodine has been tested in the micronucleus test (bone marrow) in mice at a maximum oral dose of 250 mg/kg. No genotoxic effects were induced. Toxicokinetic data were not estimated in this  study,  however  based  on  data  from  other  toxicity  studies  an  adequate  exposure  level  of  the animals has been reached.

- Carcinogenicity

Two 104  weeks  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  mice  and  rats.  In  the mice study,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups of 50 males and 50 females received 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg by oral gavage. The 45 mg/kg dose did not result in sufficient degree of toxicity and the dose was increased to 60 mg/kg but was later reduced to 45 and 30 mg/kg in males due to high mortality rates. The survival rate was 32% in high dosed males and 38% in females. A tightly filled intestine and rectum was noted in all dosage groups related  to  the  anticholinerigic  mechanism  of  action  of  fesoterodine/SPM  7605.  No  difference  in neoplastic lesions was observed between animals on active treatment compared to placebo.

In rats groups  of  50  males  and  50  females/group  were  treated  with  5,  15,  and  45  mg/kg  by  oral gavage. The 45 mg/kg dose did not result in sufficient degree of toxicity thus the dose was increased to 60 mg/kg. No difference in neoplastic lesions was observed between animals on active treatment compared  to  placebo.  At  histopathology,  tightly  filled  urinary  bladder  and  minimal  to  moderately reduced secretory activity in salivary glands and lacrimal glands were noted. These effects are related to the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action.

The exposure to SPM 7605 at the high dose level was Cmax 340.68 ng/ml and AUC 1406.3 h ng/ml in males and Cmax 286.40 ng/ml and AUC 740.7 h ng/ml in females. Thus, exposure margins of 7-14 based on AUC and 33-39 based on Cmax are obtained.

In conclusion, fesoterodine was not carcinogenic in mice and rats.

- Reproduction Toxicity

## Fertility and early embryonic development

In  male  mice,  no  effects  on  clinical  signs,  body  weight  gain  or  male  fertility  parameters  (sperm number, motility and viability, weight of testis and epididymis) were observed up to maximum dose of fesoterodine 45 mg/kg.

Female mice dosed with 45 mg/kg showed a marginal reduction in body weight probably caused by the reduced number of fetuses. The number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was slightly  but  significantly  reduced.  The  uterine  weight  was  slightly  but  significantly  decreased correlated  with  the  reduced  number  of  fetuses.  Fesoterodine  had  no  effect  on  resorption  rate, preimplantation and post-implantation loss.  The NOEL for fertility was 15 mg/kg which corresponds to a Cmax value of 43.4-77.3 ng/ml resulting in exposure margins of 5-9 times the human exposure.

## Embryo-fetal development

In mice , dams at the high dose level (75 mg/kg) showed a decrease in body weight which was caused by the increased resorption rate. No maternal toxicity was seen. Embryotoxicity was observed evident as  a slight but statistically significant reduction in body weight for male fetuses at 45 mg/kg; at 75 mg/kg for both male and female fetuses. Furthermore, at 75 mg/kg an increase in the number of total resorptions was observed. The mean post-implantation loss was 16.6%; and complete in one female. Accordingly, the number of live fetuses was decreased. Four malformed fetuses were noted, three with cleft palate in each of the dosage groups (15, 45 and 75 mg/mg). One 45 mg/kg fetus had exencephaly. The NOEL was 15 mg/kg which corresponds to a Cmax value of 79.7 ng/ml resulting in an exposure margin of 9 times the human exposure.

In rabbits ,  no  maternal  toxicity  (net  body  weight  gain  or  decreased  food  consumption)  was  seen following oral gavage administration of fesoterodine. In the high dose group (27 mg/kg p.o.) the postimplantation  loss  was  slightly  (+17.1%)  increased  and  the  number  of  resorptions  was  threefold increased.  One  high  dose  dam  had  complete  post-implantation  loss  early  during  gestation.  Seven malformed fetuses, uni- or bilateral hyperflexion of the fore and/or hind paws and/or crossed legs were noted in three controls, two 3 mg/kg and two 27 mg/kg fetuses. These changes were considered to be within  the  normal  range.  At  27  mg/kg,  a  statistically  significant  increased  incidence  of  retarded ossification  of  the  sternebra(e)  and  total  retardations  was  noted.  The  NOEL  was  9  mg/kg  which corresponds to  a  Cmax  value  of  57.3  ng/ml  resulting  in  an  exposure  margin  of  6  times  the  human exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A study in rabbits using subcutaneous bolus injection of fesoterodine 0.5, 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg which enabled a high exposure did not demonstrate any embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. Severe maternal toxicity  was  observed  at  the  high  dose  level  while  only  slight  maternal  toxicity  was  observed  with administration via oral gavage up to a dose of 27 mg/kg.

## Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function

The peri- and postnatal toxicity was investigated in the mouse at dose levels of 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg. Evidence of maternal toxicity of the F0-dams was noted at the high dose level as slightly decreased body weight from gestation day 10 onwards which did correlate with the reduced number of fetuses. A decreased body weight gain was noted at the end of lactation weeks 1 and 2 (-11% and -10%). Similar effects were observed on food consumption. Slight effects on reproduction, not statistically significant were noted at the 30 and 60 mg/kg dose levels; slightly reduced number of implantations and slightly reduced  number  of  pups  alive  at  60  mg/kg.  A  dose-dependent  decrease  in  lactation  and  overall survival indices were observed from 30 mg/kg, in addition also decrease in viability at 60 mg/kg. The mean body weights of the pups were marginally decreased. No treatment related changes were noted at necropsy of the animals.

In the F1-generation, ear-opening was marginally delayed at 30 and 60 mg/kg and consequently also a decreased response to auditory startle reflex by  31.5%  and 46.3%, respectively. No adverse  effects were noted on F1-dams and male F1-partners or on the F2-generation until weaning. The NOEL for F0 and F1 is 10 mg/kg and the NOAEL for F2 is higher than 60 mg/kg resulting in an exposure margin of approximately 6.

In  conclusion,  reproduction  studies  have  shown  minor  embryo-toxicity  (increased  number  of resorption, pre-implantation and post-implementation losses). This is mentioned in the SPC.

## Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated

The  absence  of  studies  on  juvenile  animals  is  accepted  considering  the  proposed  indication  for fesoterodine.

## · Toxicokinetic data

The  applicant  has  conducted  a  number  of  toxicokinetic  studies,  where  the  plasma  exposure  to fesoterodine  at  the  maximum  therapeutic  dose  (8  mg,  0.11  mg/kg)  has  been  compared  to  reference doses in animal studies.

For exposure comparisons animal versus human, the following human data were used, AUC of 98.3 h ng/ml  and  Cmax  of  8.62  ng/ml  (observed  in  healthy  male  volunteers  receiving  the  maximum recommended dose of fesoterodine 8 mg, fed status, poor CYP2D6 metabolizers).

The  safety  margins  established  comparing  SPM  7605  AUC  values  show  that  in  chronic  toxicity studies  the  average  systemic  exposure  was  at  least  1.5  (dog,  iv)  or  3.9-fold  (mouse)  higher  as compared to man. In carcinogenicity studies was at least 7.7- (mouse) or 7.5-fold (rat) higher in terms of AUC at the highest dose as compared to man.

In embryo-foetal development studies, the systemic exposure to SPM 7605 at NOEL (mouse)/NOAEL (rabbit) was at least 0.9- (mouse) or 1.3-fold (rabbit, sc) in terms of AUC at the highest dose. In these toxicity studies, doses of fesoterodine which caused no toxicological consequences (NOAEL), were similar to the highest therapeutic dose of fesoterodine. Therefore, the occurrence of the above animal findings in humans cannot be ruled out. This is appropriately reflected in the SPC.

- Local tolerance

The potential of fesoterodine and its metabolite SPM 7605, to produce skin irritation was studied in rabbits

.

In the patch test a very slight erythema and edema were noted. Fesoterodine is classified as irritating to eyes.

- Other toxicity studies

## Antigenicity

Fesoterodine did not provoke skin sensitization reactions in guinea pigs.

## Biocompatibility

Fesoterodine  and  SPM  7605  were  studied  for  their  biocompatibility  and  haemolytic  properties  on human blood. Neither fesoterodine nor SPM 7605 showed any influence on the parameters observed.

## Immunotoxicity

The  Plaque  Forming  Colony  test  has  shown  that  fesoterodine  5-75  mg/kg  p.o.  for  28  days  has  no immuno-toxicological properties in mice with respect to an antibody response to IgM and IgG.

## Phototoxicity

According  to  guideline,  photosafety  testing  of  fesoterodine  is  justified..  SPM  7605  revealed  no phototoxic potential under the present test conditions.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

As per the guideline, a Phase I estimation of exposure based on the fesoterodine fumarate maximum daily  dose  of  8  mg  and  the  default  Fpen  value  of  0.01,  results  in  a    PECsurfacewater  =0.04  µg/L, which is &gt; the Action limit of 0.01 µg/L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore,  a  Phase  II  assessment  is  currently  underway    and  will  be  submitted  as  a  post-approval commitment, 2Q07.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Fesoterodine is a competitive, specific and non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist. It is rapidly and  extensively  hydrolysed  by  non-specific  plasma  esterases  to  the  5-hydroxymethyl  derivative (SPM 7605) its primary active metabolite, which is much more active than fesoterodine in vitro and in vivo (x100  times  more  affinity  for  muscarinic  receptors in  vitro than  fesoterodine).  SPM  7605  is therefore  the  main  active  pharmacological  principle  of  fesoterodine.  SPM  7605  is  also  the  main metabolite of the marketed medicine tolterodine.

The cardiovascular system has been extensively investigated both in vitro and in vivo .  Fesoterodine and SPM 7605 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current with IC50 values of 3.6 and 0.5 µM, respectively. Blockade of the hERG-mediated potassium current has also been observed for some other antimuscarinic agents.

A  dose-dependent  tachycardia  with  no  change  in  mean  arterial  pressure  was  observed  in  rats  as expected from a muscarinic antagonist. In vivo , at a dose of 800 µg/kg i.v., decreases in diastolic blood pressure,  heart  rate  and  coronary  artery  blood  flow  and  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  and  QTc interval were noted in dogs.

Pharmacokinetics :  fesoterodine is rapidly hydrolysed by non-specific plasma esterases to SPM 7605 in all animal species investigated including man except for the dog in which the rate of hydrolysis is slower. The in vitro metabolism of fesoterodine is most different in the rat, which is considered a less relevant species.

In  repeat-dose  toxicity,  the  main  target  organ  of  toxicity  was  the  liver  in  rats  .  No  target  organ  of toxicity was identified in the mouse or the dog. Overall, in toxicity studies, animals were exposed at the NOAEL to total amounts of fesoterodine and its metabolites that little exceeded or almost were equal than that encountered at the highest clinical dose of fesoterodine. Fesoterodine was not genotoxic or carcinogenic.

Reproduction  studies  have  shown  minor  embryo-toxicity  (increased  number  of  resorption,  preimplantation and post-implementation losses). This is mentioned in the SPC.

Phase  II  environmental  studies  will  be  completed  after  the  marketing  authorisation,  as  follow-up measures.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical development program for fesoterodine sustained-release (SR) included:

- Two double-blind Phase 3 trials (SP583, SP584) plus 2 long-term, open-label extension trials (SP738 and SP739),
- Two double-blind Phase 2 dose-defining trials (SP582 and SP668) plus a long term extension trial, SP669, which is still ongoing, and
- Seventeen Phase 1 trials to investigate the clinical pharmacology of fesoterodine SR (in one out of these seventeen studies an intravenous formulation was also tested).
- An immediate-release (IR) formulation of fesoterodine was used in two Phase 1 trials and a Phase 2a pilot trial (SP577).

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  fesoterodine  have  been  characterised  in  healthy  men  and  women  over  a single and multiple-dose range of 4 mg to 28 mg/day.

Nineteen Phase 1 trials, which included 753 subjects, have been completed to investigate the clinical pharmacology of fesoterodine.  An immediate-release (IR) formulation of fesoterodine was used in 2 initial  Phase  1  trials  (Studies  SP560  and  SP561),  including 75  subjects.  In  order  to  enhance  patient compliance, a sustained release (SR) tablet was developed for a once daily administration.  A total of 489  subjects  received  the  SR  formulation  intended  for  approval;  and  28  subjects  received  an intravenous formulation in addition to an SR formulation.

Fesoterodine metabolites were analysed using LC-MS/MS in plasma, urine and faeces. Fesoterodine was analysed in plasma using LC-MS/MS. The analytical method validations were found appropriate.

- Absorption

In vitro , the transport of fesoterodine, tolterodine and SPM 7605 across Caco-2 cell monolayers was investigated. The permeability coefficient of fesoterodine could not be determined due hydrolysis of fesoterodine to SPM 7605 in this study. The permeability constant for tolterodine and SPM 7605 were determined to be 1.0 10 -5 cm/s and 2.5 x 10 -6 cm/s respectively. For propranolol, which was used as one of the reference compounds and considered a highly permeable compound according to BCS, the permeability coefficient was determined to be 1.1 x 10 -5 cm/s.

In vitro studies have been also conducted with both fesoterodine and its major metabolite SPM 7605 to characterize whether they are substrates and / or inhibitors of P-gp. These in vitro studies indicate that both fesoterodine and SPM 7605 are substrates for P-gp (ATPase Km values = 56 and 105 µM) and that both compounds are weak inhibitors of the P-gp mediated transport of digoxin in Caco-2 cells (IC50 values of 131 and &gt;300 µM) respectively. Consequently, the likelihood of clinically relevant Pgp inhibition on fesoterodine and SPM 7605 is considered to be low in clinical practice given the wide margin between IC50 and maximal systemic concentrations.

After administration of the IR formulation, tmax is reached after approximately 0.5-1 hour. The rate of absorption  across  all  Phase  1  trials  is  comparable  with  tmax  being  approximately  5  hours  for  the prolonged release formulation.

The rate of absorption is constant over the dose range of 4 to 28 mg fesoterodine and is comparable after single or multiple-dose administration. The Cmax levels after a single dose of 4 and 8 mg of the prolonged  release  tablets  were  in  mean  values  approximately  1.90-2.20  ng/ml  and  3-6  ng/ml respectively (data from all phase I studies, no food interaction). See table 1 for a comparison between the immediate release and the prolonged release formulation.

*Mean±SD **AUC0-12 ***AUC0-∞

Maximum plasma levels  of  SPM  7605  are  achieved  approximately  5  hours  after  administration  of fesoterodine SR. The rate of absorption is constant over the dose range of 4 to 28mg fesoterodine and is comparable after single or multiple-dose administration.

The absolute bioavailability of fesoterodine could not be determined, due to the rapid hydrolysis of fesoterodine to SPM  7605.  Fesoterodine  was  only  measurable  after i.v. administration.  The bioavailability of SPM 7605 after oral administration of 8 mg fesoterodine could be determined to be 52 % compared to fesoterodine i.v. and 42 % compared to SPM 7605 i.v.

Exposure to SPM 7605 was 22% increased in the fed state as compared to the fasted state. Although bioequivalence between the 2 treatments could not be demonstrated the difference is considered not to be clinically relevant. Therefore, dose adjustment with regard to food is not necessary.

## · Distribution

The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  SPM  7605  was  169L  (CV  17.1%)  following  intravenous administration of SPM 7605 (study SP567),.

Plasma protein binding of SPM 7605 is approximately 50%, with a similar affinity to human serum albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein.

## · Metabolism and Excretion

Fesoterodine  functionally  acts  as  a  pro-drug.  After  oral  administration,  fesoterodine  is  rapidly  and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite SPM 7605.

Hepatic  metabolism  and  renal  excretion  contribute  significantly  to  the  elimination  of  SPM  7605 Clearance of SPM 7605 was approximately 42 L/h after i.v. administration. The mean terminal halflife was approximately 4-4.5 hours after i.v. administration and 6-9 hours after administration of the prolonged release formulation. This suggests an absorption-rate limited elimination for the prolonged release  formulation.  SPM  7605  is  metabolized  to  its  carboxy  (SPM  5509),  carboxy-N-desisopropyl (SPM 7790) and N-desisopropyl metabolite (SPM 7789).

The data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism, but are probably not the only enzymes involved, possibly CYP2A6 can be involved in the formation of SPM 7789. SPM 5509 is also formed in poor metabolisers,  indicating that there must be another enzyme other than CYP2D6 that is able to catalyse this metabolic pathway. In vivo metabolite profiling was performed up to 96 hours.  When  the  excretion  pattern  of  fesoterodine,  SPM  7605  and  subsequent  metabolites  was evaluated,  approximately  77  %  of  the  dose  after  oral  administration  and  85  and  86  %  after fesoterodine i.v. and SPM 7605 i.v. was recovered in urine and faeces. No biliary elimination seems to occur  because  almost  no  SPM  7605  is  found  in  faeces  after  i.v.  administration.  There  was  a  more extensive formation of SPM 5509, SPM 7789 and SPM 7790 after oral administration, indicating firstpass  metabolism.  It  seems  that  an  almost  complete  absorption  occurs  (based  on  similar  urinary excretion  of  metabolites  SPM  5509,  7789  and  7790  after  oral  and  i.v.  administration),  however  it

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cannot be excluded that some metabolites are formed presystemically and then subsequently absorbed. The fraction of SPM 7605 excreted unchanged in urine after oral, fesoterodine i.v. and SPM 7605 i.v. was approximately 16 %, 27 % and 34% respectively. The presence of SPM 7605 in the faeces after oral administration but not after i.v. administration indicates intestinal hydrolysis.

## · Target population

Pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  the  target  population  were  measured  in  two  Phase  2  (SP582  and SP668) and one Phase 3 (SP584) clinical trials.

## · Special populations

Exposure to SPM 7605 is approximately doubled in poor CYP2D6 metabolisers as compared to extensive metabolisers, while the terminal half-life of SPM 7605 is not changed in poor metabolisers. Exposure to the carboxy metabolite and to the carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite is decreased by approximately 50% as compared to extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers.

Gender,  age  or  race  do  not  influence  the  PK  behaviour  of  fesoterodine.  In  subjects  with  moderate hepatic impairment the exposure to SPM 7605 was increased 2-fold after a single dose of fesoterodine. CYP2D6 function was the most affected with a subsequent decrease of the related metabolites.  The dose  of  fesoterodine  has  been  limited  to  4  mg  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  In subjects with severe hepatic impairment, fesoterodine is contraindicated.

In subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment unbound exposure was 1.3, 1.5 and 1.8 fold higher compared to healthy extensive metabolisers. A larger effect is expected in patients with CYP2D6  poor  metaboliser  status.  In  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  the  dose should therefore be increased from 4 to 8 mg with caution. In patients with severe renal impairment, the dose is restricted to 4 mg.

Considering  the  risk  of  higher  exposure  associated  with  dose-dependent  side  effects  in  certain subpopulations such as CYP2D6 poor metabolisers and the absence of genotyping a starting on a dose of  4  mg  is  recommended.  The  dose  can  then  be  titrated  based  on  dose-dependent  side-effects  and needs of the patient. These dosing recommendations are reflected in the SPC (sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). The concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic or renal impairment is contra-indicated and mentioned in the SPC.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Based on in vitro data, it is likely that fesoterodine can inhibit CYP3A4 in the intestine, although the risk of a clinical significant interaction with midazolam and other substances with substantial intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism seems low. Some inhibition of CYP2B6 was found, however this is not expected to give rise to a clinically relevant interaction given the large margin between inhibitory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations  found  in  vitro  and  plasma  levels  obtained.  No  relevant  inhibition  of  CYP2C8  or CYP2E1 was found. The weak inhibition P-gp by SPM 7605 and fesoterodine is not likely to have any clinical relevance.

Concomitant  treatment  with  a  CYP3A4  inhibitor  resulted  in  a  2-fold  increase  of  exposure  to  SPM 7605. Both extensive and poor CYP2D6 metabolisers experienced similar increase. Potentially, up to a 4-fold increase of exposure compared the standard recommended treatment might be expected.

No interactions have been observed between fesoterodine and oral contraceptives.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Fesoterodine  displays  dose-proportional  pharmacokinetics  in  the  dose-range  from  4  to  12mg/day (SP565).

There are no indications of time dependent pharmacokinetics . No accumulation of SPM 7605 was observed.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

Binding  of  fesoterodine  and  several  of  its in  vivo metabolites  to  human  recombinant  muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1-M5) was investigated in competition binding experiments. There was no selectivity of SPM 7605 in binding to these receptors. Fesoterodine was at least 100-fold less potent. The carboxy metabolite (SPM 5509) and the N-desisopropyl metabolite (SPM 7833) showed uniform binding affinity to all muscarinic receptor subtypes as well, albeit with more than 50-fold and about 20-  to  70-fold  lower  affinity  respectively  as  compared  to  SPM  7605.  The  carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite  (SPM  6923)  did  not  bind  to  any  of  the  muscarinic  receptors  up  to  a  concentration  of  1 µmol/L.

Neither  the  S-enantiomers  of  fesoterodine  and  SPM  7605  nor  the  corresponding  racemates  have  a more than intermediate level of binding at any of the human muscarinic receptors. Fesoterodine or SPM  7605  do  not  show  specificity  to  other  receptors  (such  as    dopamine,  serotonin,  adrenaline, neuropeptide, sigma) or ion-channels tested (eg, sodium, calcium, chloride). The lack of selectivity was also seen in ex vivo tissue studies.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamics

## Two urodynamic studies were conducted: SP577 and SP668.

SP577 was a preliminary Phase  2  study  in  which  12  subjects  with  urodynamic  confirmed  detrusor instability were treated with the immediate release fesoterodine formulation (2 and 4 mg) for 4 weeks. The  volume  at  first  unstable  contraction  was  measured  as  the  primary  variable.  After  treatment  an increase  of  43.8  ml  and  81.5  ml  respectively  in  urinary  volume  were  measured.  Some  other urodynamic  parameters  showed  a  trend  of  improvement  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  small number of subjects available, the IR formulation used, the high variability observed, and the doses studied  (placed  in  the  lower  limit  of  the  dosage  range  finally  recommended)  provide  little  helpful information.

SP668 study, also discussed below (dose response studies) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose trial, where 3 doses of fesoterodine (4, 8 and 12 mg) were tested. The study enrolled male and female patients (18 to 78 years of age inclusive) with symptoms or signs of overactive bladder with increased urinary frequency and urinary incontinence. Subjects were stratified into 2 balanced strata by the presence or absence of involuntary detrusor contraction as measured during the filling phase of baseline  cystometry.  A  second  urodynamic  assessment  was  made  only  in  patients  with  involuntary detrusor  contractions.  Changes  in  volume  at  first  involuntary  contraction,  in  volume  at  first  and  at strong desire to void, in maximum cystometric capacity and in compliance were measured.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After 8 weeks of treatment an increase of bladder volumes was observed for fesoterodine groups with respect to placebo. Dose-dependent improvement was also noted for most of the volumes measured. The small size of the groups and the lack of a measurement in the group without urodynamic findings in cystometry limit the value of these results.

## Secondary pharmacodynamics

Fesoterodine  induced  a  decrease  in  saliva  volume,  mainly  when  doses  equal  or  higher  than  12  mg were  administered.  This  was  supported  by  the  patients'  view.  A  greater  decrease  was  reported  in elderly compared to young males after a single dose of 8 mg.

Fesoterodine  showed  a  clear  trend  to  increase  the  residual  urinary  volume  in  a  dose-dependent manner. Maximum tolerated dose was considered 28 mg with a maximum of &gt; 400 ml in one healthy volunteer. After a single dose of 8 mg elderly volunteers experienced a greater increase than young subjects did.

Heart rates increased with a clear dose-dependent relationship. Pupillary reaction was also affected; this  effect  was  more  remarkable  for  increasing  doses.  A  QT  study  was  conducted  in  healthy volunteers. The safety implications of these findings are discussed under Safety.

In summary, fesoterodine (in fact SPM 7605) exerted the expected urodynamic action. According its PD profile, negative effects in urinary retention, dryness of mouth and blurred vision were revealed. These findings were more evident for the highest doses and the elderly population.

Coadministration  of  fesoterodine  with  other  antimuscarinic  agents  may  increase  the  anticholinergic pharmacological  actions  and  result  in,  increasing  frequency  or  severity  of  dry  mouth,  constipation, urinary retention and other anticholinergic pharmacological side effects, and coadministration should therefore be avoided. This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.5).

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response studies

The Phase 2 program started with study SP577, a Phase IIa pilot trial that investigated the effects of fesoterodine Immediate release (IR) formulation 2mg and 4mg twice daily on urodynamic parameters in 12 female subjects with OAB. The urodynamic effect on the volume at first involuntary contraction and bladder capacity were assessed.

Study subjects had a mean ages of 60 years and had symptoms of bladder overactivity and confirmed detrusor instability (&gt;10 cmH2O) at urodynamic visit 1.

Study  result  showed  that  administration  of  fesoterodine  immediate  release  2  or  4mg  increased  the volume at first involuntary contraction and bladder capacity in a dose dependent manner. The improvement was comparable to results shown with other antimuscarinic compounds.

The Phase 2a pilot trial was followed by two double-blind, dose-defining trials using a slow release formulation (SR), study SP582 and study SP668.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

These studies enrolled male or female subjects (18 to 78 years of age inclusive) with symptoms or signs  of  overactive  bladder  with  increased  urinary  frequency  and  urinary  incontinence.  Most  of  the subjects  randomised  to  double-blind  treatment  in  these  Phase  2  trials  were  female:  85%  in  SP582 (FAS) and 87% in SP668 (FAS). The trial populations were primarily Caucasian (81% to 99%). Ages ranged  from  a  minimum  of  18  years  to  a  maximum  of  79  years  and  were  similar  between  trials; median  ages  overall  ranged  from  55  to  57  years.  Demographic  and  Baseline  characteristics  were generally  similar  among  treatment  groups  within  each  of  these  trials.  Patients  included  in  SP668 seemed  more  affected.  Higher  percentage  of  subjects  reported  both  prior  and  concomitant  diseases although only 16% of patients enrolled in SP668 vs 64% of subjects in SP582 had at least 1 prior medication.

In  both  trials,  there  was  a  considerable  time  since  first  diagnosis  of  OAB  (4  years  in  SP582  and  6 years in SP668 ). About one third of patients included in both trials (31% in SP582 and 28% in SP668) had received prior treatment for the condition, mainly with oxybutynin and tolterodine.

The  selection  criteria  for  SP582  and  SP668  were  common  in  most  aspects,  but  in  SP668  patients underwent a new urodynamic examination at Baseline. It results in a rather heterogeneous Phase 2 population  composed  of  patients  with  'at  least  1  involuntary  detrusor  contraction  in  a  urodynamic examination  in  the  prior  year  (SP582  subjects),  patients  with  documented  detrusor  contractions  at baseline  in  a  standardised  cystometry  (SP668  Stratum  A  subjects)  and  patients  with  documented normal urodynamic findings (SP668 Stratum B subjects).

No pre-specified degree of severity was required. Subjects included had baseline mean of 11 to 12 micturitions  per  24  hours.  The  baseline  mean  number  of  incontinence  episodes  was  more  variable, ranging  from  17  to  24  episodes  per  week.  Regarding  incontinence,  the  population  included  can  be considered in general as of moderate severity.

In SP 582 improvements were also shown for the second most important primary efficacy endpoint (change  in  average  number  of  urge  incontinence  episodes  per  week)  with  statistical  significance achieved in the fesoterodine 12mg group.

A dose related increase of most of bladder volumes was observed after 8 week treatment. Fesoterodine appears to exert a more defining effect in the urodynamic setting than in symptomatic one.

In conclusion, phase 2 studies are consistent in finding a statistically significant greater response for fesoterodine  groups  than  for  placebo  in  terms  of  reduction  of  frequency  of  micturitions  and incontinence episodes. The dose-response relationship is apparent in the range 4-8 mg, getting almost flat beyond that. This holds especially true regarding incontinence episodes. Due to the limited sample size of study SP668, no firm conclusions can be drawn on a differential clinical effect of fesoterodine depending on the baseline urodynamic findings.

## · Main studies

The efficacy and safety of fesoterodine in the treatment of OAB has been studied in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed dose Phase 3 trials (Studies SP583 and SP584).

The doses studied in the Phase 3 program included fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg once daily (od). The active comparator used was tolterodine 4mg od.

## The following table presents an overview of the Phase 3 trials conducted using an SR formulation of fesoterodine in subjects with OAB.

## METHODS

SP583 and SP584 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group  and 12  weeks treatment  duration  studies.  SP583  was  carried  out  in  Europe,  South  Africa,  Australia,  and  New Zealand and SP584 was carried out in the US.

The duration of the trial per subject was approximately 16 weeks: a 2-week placebo run-in period, a 12-week double-blind treatment period, and a 2-week safety follow-up period.

## Study Participants

Subjects were to be males and females ≥ 18 years of age with

- -symptoms or signs of OAB syndrome (known from medical history) and are expected to exhibit them at the specified level during the run-in period:
- o urinary urgency: at least 6 (later amended to 3) urinary urgency episodes documented during the 3-day diary period.
- o increased  micturition  frequency  (with/without  incontinence,  for  at  least  6  months  before enrollment):  at  least  8  micturitions  per  24  hours  confirmed  on  each  day  of  the  3-day  diary period.
- o urinary  urge  incontinence  (for  at  least  1  month  before  enrolment):  at  least  3  urinary  urge incontinence episodes documented during the 3-day diary period.
- -subject has documented the voided volume for 1 complete day during the 3-day diary period
- -subject  has  documented  (based  on  Likert  scale),  that  his/her  condition  causes  him/her  at  least moderate problems.

Patients with prior treatments with drug or non-drug treatment for OAB, amantadine, class Ia and III antiarrhythmic drugs and those who had any known neurological disease influencing bladder function, lower urinary tract pathology, a residual urine volume &gt; 100 mL or clinically relevant bladder outlet obstruction  or  had  predominantly  symptoms  of  stress  incontinence  were  not  eligible  for  pivotal studies.

A relevant Protocol Amendment (dated 26 Apr 2004) included revisions to 2 inclusion criteria to add subjects  with  urinary  urge  incontinence  at  Baseline  known  from  medical  history  and  to  include subjects with at least 3 urinary urge incontinence episodes documented during the 3-day diary period. The option to have 'at least 6 urinary urgency episodes' instead of the documented urge incontinence episodes was eliminated.

## Treatments

Patients were randomised to placebo, fesoterodine 4mg/day, and fesoterodine 8mg/day. In addition to a placebo control, SP583 also included an active control, tolterodine SR (4 mg once daily).

## Objectives

The objective of the trial was to investigate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of fesoterodine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as compared to placebo and active control in subjects with OAB.

SP584  also  included  genotyping  for  assessment  of  the  CYP2D6  metabolisation  status  (poor  vs extensive metabolizer) and a population pharmacokinetics analysis of SPM 7605, the active metabolite of fesoterodine.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Both Phase 3 studies assessed the same primary efficacy variable : 'Change in the average number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours after 12 weeks of treatment'. There were differences between the co-primary efficacy variables between the Europe and US

Co-primary variable for submission in Europe: 'Treatment response derived from a treatment benefit scale after 12 weeks of treatment'. Subjects were asked to compare their present condition with their situation before the start of the trial: My condition has been: 1=greatly improved, 2=improved, 3=not changed, 4=worsened, during treatment. The treatment response was set to 'YES' if the category on the Treatment Benefit Scale was '1' or '2' and to 'NO' if the category on the scale was '3' or '4'. Co-primary  variable  for  submission  in  the  US:  Change  in  average  number  of  urge  incontinence episodes per 24 hours (from baseline to value after 12 weeks of treatment).

Therefore three primary/co-primary endpoints were used in both pivotal trials.

Secondary endpoints in  both phase 3 trials included (but were not limited to) number of continent days per week, voided volume per micturition.

Health  outcome  variables included  the  change  in  the  subject's  evaluation  of  quality  of  life  using 2 validated questionnaires: the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF).

## Randomisation/Blinding (masking)

The randomization procedure anticipated a balancing of treatments (1:1:1:1 for placebo; fesoterodine 4mg/day, fesoterodine 8mg/day, tolterodine 4mg/day) across countries and sites.

Placebo  tablets  were  identical  in  appearance  (size  and  color)  to  fesoterodine  4mg  and  8mg  tablets. Placebo  capsules  (encapsulated)  were  identical  in  appearance  to  encapsulated  tolterodine  4mg capsules  (encapsulated)  given  orally  once  daily.  In  addition,  all  accompanying  packaging  was identical in appearance. Blinding was maintained by inclusion of matching placebos for the non-active dosage forms (double dummy design).

## Statistical methods/Sample size

Six analysis sets were defined:

- o Screened Set (SCS): The subjects who had signed an informed consent and completed a Visit 1 assessment.
- o Enrolled  Set  (ES):  The  ES  included  those  subjects  from  the  SCS  who  entered  the  Run-In Period (obtained at least 1 dose of placebo).
- o Randomized Set (RS): The RS included all subjects randomized in the trial.
- o Safety Set (SS): The SS defined all subjects who took at least 1 dose of trial medication after randomization.
- o Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS consists of all subjects in the SS, who had at least 1 valid post-Baseline efficacy measurement.
- o Per Protocol Set (PPS): An analysis was carried out excluding subjects from the FAS who had major  protocol  deviations  (determined  during  blind  data  review)  and/or  with  duration  of double-blind treatment shorter than 2 weeks.

The primary analysis set for efficacy in all statistical analyses was the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The measurements of the continuous primary and secondary variables prior to first administration of the trial medication were used as Baseline measurements. The measurements in the last completed valid diary of the Double-Blind Treatment Period were used as endpoint values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Statistical  analyses  for  the  primary  variables  of  micturition  and  urge  incontinence  were  performed using standard ANCOVA techniques including treatment and country/region as factors and baseline value  as  a  covariate.  Treatment  response  was  analyzed  using  asymptotic  normal  approximation methodology. A sequentially rejective closed-test procedure was applied.

The imputed endpoint values from the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method to account for the  missing  values  for  early  dropouts  were  used  in  the  primary  analysis.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was conducted based on observed cases (eg, missing values were not imputed). The ANCOVA results at the end of treatment (LOCF) among subjects who dropped out of the trial early are also presented for an  exploratory  comparison  with  trial  completers.  Further,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  by removing extreme outliers from the FAS. During the blinded data review meeting for SP583, it was decided  to  remove  extreme  outliers  from  the  FAS  and  to  perform  a  sensitivity  analysis.  The  same criteria  for  this  sensitivity  analysis  were  used  for  SP584  as  a  post-hoc  analysis.  Further,  a  nonparametric sensitivity analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

The following is a brief summary of the statistical analysis for the primary variables for the 2 regions. Both hierarchical testing procedures for the primary variables are considered closed-testing procedures that preserve the multiple alpha level without adjustment of the nominal significance level.

## Recruitment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SP 583: 264 (19%) of enrolled subjects were prematurely withdrawn from the trial as run-in failures. The most common reason for discontinuation from the Screening and Placebo Run-In Periods was ineligibility to continue trial (185/1463; 13%).

SP  584:  751  (40%)  of  screened  subjects  were  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  trial.  The  most common reason for discontinuation was ineligibility to continue in the trial (590/1886; 31%).

Most subjects ( ≥ 80% in any treatment group) completed the full 12 weeks of treatment in both studies

## Conduct of the studies

During  the  double  blind  treatment  period,  96%  to  100%  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were compliant with respect to trial medication.

A  slight  increased  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  with  higher  doses  of  fesoterodine  was observed.

## Baseline data

About  80%  of  the  subjects  were  female  and  20%  were  male  subjects.  The  trial  population  was primarily white. Ages ranged from 19 years to 91 years (mean 58 years). A total of 33% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age and 11% were ≥ 75 years of age.

The population was largely made up of subjects with long-term, established diagnosis of OAB. Baseline  micturition  frequency  and  incontinence  episodes  somewhat  representing  severity  of  OAB, were comparable between the different treatment groups.

Subjects in each treatment group had Baseline means of about 12 to 13 micturitions per 24 hours and 4 urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours. Notable is the wide range of micturition frequency. However the numbers are comparable between groups.

At  least  three  quarters  (75%  to  85%)  of  the  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were  incontinent  at baseline.

Demographic  characteristics  regarding  age,  gender,  concomitant  diseases  and  therapies  and  prior treatment  for  OAB  were  comparable  across  the  4  treatment  groups  and  the  trial  population  is representative for patients with OAB.

## Numbers analysed

SP 583: the Full Analysis Set (FAS) included a total of 1103 subjects. A total of 6% to 8% of subjects had LOCF imputations for the change in number of micturitions per 24 hours, 4% to 7% had LOCF imputations for the change in number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and 9% to 13% had LOCF imputations for response on the treatment benefit scale. A total of 87% to 91% of subjects in each treatment group completed double-blind treatment.

SP  584:  the  FAS  included  a  total  of  800  subjects;  a  total  of  11%  to  16%  of  subjects  had  LOCF imputations  for  the  change  in  number  of  micturitions  per  24  hours,  11%  to  15%  had  LOCF imputations for the change in number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and 15% to 18% had LOCF imputations for response on the treatment benefit scale.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoints

Both pivotal studies (SP 583 and SP 584) where fesoterodine was tested at fixed dose demonstrated a statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  3  principal  variables  (number  of  micturitions  in  24  hours, number of urge incontinence episodes in 24 hours, and treatment response).

- -Change in average number of micturitions per 24 hours

Treatment response findings were consistent in the FAS (primary analysis) and PPS populations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both fesoterodine doses (4 and 8mg/day) showed statistically significant improvement over placebo at the end of treatment for the micturition and urge incontinence variables (US FDA analysis) and for the micturition and treatment response variables (EU analysis).

## Secondary endpoints

Most symptoms related secondary variables also showed statistically significant difference from the baseline after 12 weeks treatment, with numerically better results for highest dose (8 mg/day).

Fesoterodine improved the signs and symptoms of OAB for all secondary endpoints in a comparable manner for both studies. A summary table for study SP 583 is given below:

## Health Outcomes Results

A small but consistent effect on quality of life as assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire in the fesoterodine was shown in pivotal trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Baseline scores in both pivotal studies were similar. Only one of the 9 domains, Impact of life scored over 50 points at baseline. No formal comparison was carried out. It has been suggested that a change of 5 or more points can be considered a clinical meaningful improvement, difference questioned by others.  Assessing  the  changes  from  baseline  with  respect  to  placebo  for  the  dosage  finally  chosen (4 mg) five out of 9 domains in Study SP583 and none in Study 584 reached the 5-minimal difference points.  Regarding  fesoterodine  8  mg  dose  7  and  6  domains  in  each  pivotal  study  scored  at  least  5 points more than placebo did.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

## Methods

Efficacy  data  from  the  double-blind  pivotal  trials  SP583  and  SP584  were  pooled  (Pool  E1)  to investigate  selected  subgroups.  Efficacy  in  subsets  of  the  population  was  evaluated  in  each  of  the primary  trials  (SP583  and  SP584).  Assignment  of  subjects  to  treatment  groups  followed  the trial-specific rules, ie, pooled analysis of efficacy data was performed as randomized on the basis of the Full Analysis Set (FAS).

## Results

Elderly  patients  ( ≥ 65  years)  experienced  a  lower  reduction  of  micturitions  and  patient  reported response  than  younger  subjects.  On  the  contrary,  a  greater  reduction  in  incontinence  episodes  was observed in that group, potentially related to a higher baseline rate in this subgroup.

Non-white  subjects  showed  a  lower  reduction  of  incontinence  episodes  as  well  as  some  greater response in incontinence episodes. However the under-representation of non-Caucasian subjects and the higher variability do not allow  conclusions to be drawn in this regard.

A higher placebo effect for the different endpoints is observed amongst naïve patients, which may be responsible of the observed differences in response. However, the differential effect from placebo is essentially similar.

- Clinical studies in special populations

No  specific  efficacy  studies  in  special  populations  have  been  performed.  However,  characteristics such as age, gender, race and prior drug treatment have been analysed in the pivotal trials.

- Supportive studies

## Long-Term Exposure Trials: Sp669, Sp738, Sp739

Subjects who completed the pivotal phase 3 studies SP583 or SP584 and the phase 2 study SP668 had the option to participate in long-term extension trials and receive fesoterodine up to 3 additional years to further evaluate its efficacy and safety. (ongoing studies)

Patients enrolled were treated with fesoterodine 8 mg/day (with the option to decrease to 4mg/day), regardless of the treatment received during the previous double-blind phase (placebo, fesoterodine 4 mg or fesoterodine 8 mg).

Conclusions on efficacy from supportive studies are difficult to draw due to the lack of control and to the high number of drop-outs. At the time of the data cut-off only 665 out of 1144 patients enrolled in OL treatment remained. A randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal study (as recommended on the CHMP guideline) would have been preferable in order to better check possible loss of efficacy.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Both pivotal studies (SP583 and SP584) where fesoterodine was tested at fixed dose, demonstrated a statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  principal  variables  (number  of  micturitions  in  24  hours, 'treatment  response').  For  the  variable  'treatment  response'  both  fesoterodine  4mg  (63;  74%)  and fesoterodine 8mg (74; 79%) doses showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo (4553%) at end of treatment, implying that a number of patients can expect benefit from the treatment. However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the patient perceived quality of treatment based on the scales used.

Globally considered, the effect of fesoterodine has consistently shown to be superior to placebo. The  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  is  modest  and  the  placebo  effect  is  large,  especially  the treatment difference for the fesoterodine 4 mg dose is rather small. Importantly however, the effect has been demonstrated to be about the same magnitude as for an acceptable comparator.

It  is  not  possible  to  assess  whether  there  is  a  clinically  relevant  treatment  effect  after  2  weeks treatment. The full treatment effect appears to be observed between 2 to 8 weeks post-treatment. This is reflected in the SPC (section 4.2).

The results in secondary endpoints support the result for primary endpoint and indicate that there is a clinically relevant treatment difference between active and placebo groups.

Most symptoms-related secondary variables also showed statistically significant difference from the baseline after 12 weeks treatment, with numerically better results for highest dose (8 mg/day).

As key secondary endpoints, HRQoL scales were used: KHQ (King's Health Questionnaire) and ICQSF (Incontinence Questionnaire- Short Form) both of them standard for these type of studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A small but consistent effect on quality of life as assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire in the fesoterodine was shown  in pivotal trials. This is a disease-specific health-related validated questionnaire generally used.

As with other drugs intended for the same condition the remaining question is how this results can be translates into a perceivable benefit for the patient.

## Clinical safety

Five safety pools have been provided to assess fesoterodine safety (Pool S1, Pool S2, Pool S3, Pool S4 and Pool S5).

<!-- image -->

In addition, an analysis pool (Pool P1) has been used to assess demographic and drug exposure for subjects participating in Phase I trials.

Since the results from the different safety pools can be regarded as fully consistent, the assessment has mainly focussed on pools S1 and S2, which are thought to provide a detailed description of the short and long term safety profiles of fesoterodine

- Patient exposure

Overall, 2859 patients were included in double blind controlled clinical trials, of whom, 780 received placebo,  290  tolterodine  and  1789  were  treated  with  fesoterodine  (782  with  4  mg/d;  785  with  8 mg/day  and  222  with  12  mg/day).  The  double  blind  phase  of  these  studies  was  in  most  cases  12 weeks.

One thousand and fifty five patients entered the open label extensions from controlled trials, all of them being initially treated with 8 mg/day of fesoterodine. Mean treatment duration was 13.5 months (including the 8-12 week double blind phase). During OL period 20% (206/1055) subjects reduced the dose from fesoterodine 8mg/day to 4mg/day. Among these 173/1055 (16%) remained on 4mg/day and 33/1055 (3%) were again up titrated to 8mg/day.

Regarding the subject disposition within the different safety pools,  the following should be considered

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In pool S1, overall, 2859 subjects were treated with trial medication. Of these, 442 (16%) discontinued trial  medication  prematurely.  The  primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were  AE (5%), withdrawal of consent (3%), and protocol violation (3%).

Of the 1055 subjects included in Pool S2 (OL only), 390 (37%) discontinued treatment prematurely. The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  OL  treatment  in  Pool  S2  were  adverse  event (117/1055: 11%), withdrawal of consent (99/1055: 9%), and lack of efficacy (97/1055: 9%).

- Adverse events

## Adverse events from primary safety trials

Overall, in Pool S1, AEs from any system organ class were reported by 50% of subjects in the placebo (390/780) and tolterodine 4mg/day (144/290) groups, and by 60% (465/782), 64% (500/785) and 73% (163/222) of subjects in the fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively.

## Common adverse events:

The  following  table  provided  the  treatment-emergent  AEs  reported  by ≥ 2%  of  subjects  in  any fesoterodine  group  in  Pool  S1  (sorted  in  descending  frequency  by  fesoterodine  8mg/day,  then fesoterodine 4mg/day, then placebo).

Feso=fesoterodine, Tolt=tolterodine

Data source: SCS Table 19.1

For the majority of adverse events the occurrence rate was equal to or less than placebo at 4 mg and 8 mg fesoterodine, the doses approved for clinical use, and more common than placebo at the higher 12 mg fesoterodine dose not intended for clinical use. A dose-dependent increase in dry mouth and dry throat were observed in the fesoterodine treatment groups.

Except for urinary tract infection (UTI), back pain, and upper respiratory tract infection, AEs were reported  more  often  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  than  in  the  fesoterodine  4  or  8mg/day  treatment groups.

Subjects  with  urinary  retention  were  considered  in  6  (&lt;1%),  8  (&lt;1%),  and  3  (1%)  subjects  in  the fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively. There were no cases of urinary retention in the tolterodine  4mg/day  group,  and  a  single  case  in  the  placebo  group.  Residual  urine  volume  and micturition disorder were reported each in 1 (&lt;1%) and 2 (&lt;1%) subjects in the fesoterodine 4, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12mg/day  groups  and  three  subjects  reported  residual  urine  volume  in  the  fesoterodine  8mg/day group. No subjects reported residual urine volume and micturition for placebo and tolterodine groups. In  addition, no subjects reported micturition disorder fesoterodine 8mg/day. (see residual urine and safety in special population sections).

Of the subjects reporting AEs during double-blind treatment in Pool S1 , 121/381 (32%) subjects in the placebo group, 161/458 (35%) subjects in the fesoterodine 4mg/day group, 193/489 (39%) subjects in the  fesoterodine  8mg/day  group,  66/163  (40%)  subjects  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  group,  and 49/139 (35%) subjects in the tolterodine 4mg/day group had ongoing AEs at the end of treatment.

## Adverse events from long-term safety data - Pool S2

Overall, in Pool S2 (DB+OL), AEs from any system organ class were reported by 80% (843/1055) of subjects in total. For OL only, AEs were reported by 70% (734/1055) of subjects.

DB=double-blind,OL=open-label

Note: Note: This table is sorted in descending order by DB+OL first, then by OL only.

Data source: SCS Table 19.2

Adverse events reported by ≥ 2% of subjects in Pool S2 were similar to those seen in Pool S1, with the exception of abdominal pain upper, asthenia, chest pain, dysgeusia, vision blurred, and nasal dryness which did not meet the ≥ 2% criteria,  and  the  addition  of  urinary  retention,  gastroesophageal  reflux disease, sinusitis, hypertension, and bronchitis, which did meet the ≥ 2% criteria for inclusion. Typical antimuscarinic AEs such as dry mouth occur early during treatment and are therefore included in the double-blind part of Pool S2. In addition, the DB+OL data in Pool S2 also contains data from SP668, which included the fesoterodine 12mg/day dose.

## Onset of drug-associated adverse events

The majority of drug-associated AE had an onset occurring during the first month of treatment, with the frequency of new onset declining over time. However this was not true for urinary retention and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) increase which did not show a clear pattern, with onset occurred after month 1. This reflected in the SPC (section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Drug related adverse events

Adverse events were considered to be drug related  if  causality  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as highly probable, probable, possible or not assessable.

In Pool S1 23%, 33%, 47% and 65% of subjects in placebo, fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups respectively  had  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug-related.  In  the  tolterodine  4mg/day group, 30% of subjects had an AE considered by the investigator to be drug related.

The  most  common  AEs  considered  to  be  drug  related  correspond  well  to  the  pattern  for  the  most common reported AEs known for anticholinergic drug

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In pool S1 (all subjects who participated in phase 2 and 3 trials SP582, SP668, SP583, SP584) serious adverse events were reported by 2% placebo treated subjects, 4%, 3% and 6% of subjects treated with fesoterodine 4, 8 and 12mg/day, respectively and by 2% of subjects treated with tolterodine 4mg/day. In all treatment groups, SAEs occurred across multiple body system with no obvious trends.

In  Pool  S3  (fesoterodine  treated  subjects  only  who  participated  in  phase  2,  phase  3  and  open-label trials) serious adverse events were reported in 7%. Myocardial infarction were reported by 7 subjects, angina pectoris and chest pain by 5 subjects each, bronchitis and pneumonia by 4 subjects each and abdominal pain, ECG QT prolongation, QTc interval prolonged were reported by 3 subjects each.

## Hepatobiliary disorders

Less than 1% of subjects in any treatment group had hepatobiliary system disorder during treatment, aside  from  isolated  cases  of  transaminase  elevations.  Three  subjects  in  Pool  S1  had  hepatobiliary disorders that were SAE and led to treatment discontinuation. One case of hepato-cellular damage was considered highly related to fesoterodine treatment (8 mg) by the investigator.

## Death

Five subjects died during the clinical program for fesoterodine and all were considered to be unrelated to fesoterodine treatment.

- Laboratory findings

In  the  results  for  laboratory  testing  there  were  individual  cases  that  exceeded  the  normal  range  for individual laboratory parameters but overall, there were no clinically relevant trends or change from Baseline to end of treatment in mean values for any haematology, chemistry or urinalysis parameter in any of the treatment groups.

Gamma-GT  increase  was  the  only  hepatic  lab  value  that  met  the  criteria  to  be  considered  drug associated e.g. had an incidence rate of at least 1% and occurring at least twice as often in any of the fesoterodine groups in comparison with the placebo group.

Examination  of  individual  clinically-relevant  laboratory  abnormalities  showed  that  there  was  no clinically relevant pattern of laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal or SAE.

- Urinary retention

Mean residual urine volume was influenced somewhat by gender, with small dose-dependent increases in both sexes, but this increase was more pronounced in men.

Increase in mean residual urine were also larger in subjects &gt;65 and &gt;75 years of age, than younger subjects.

Discontinuation due to Urinary retention: most cases of urinary retention were mild to moderate in intensity.  A  post-baseline  residual  urine  volume  &gt;200  ml  was  a  protocol  defined  criterion  for discontinuation  and  discontinued  subjects  were  usually  reported  as  adverse  event  which  coded  to urinary retention.Urinary retention led to treatment discontinuation in 3 (&lt;1%), 5 (&lt;1%), and 2 (&lt;1%) subjects  in  the  fesoterodine  4,  8  and  12  mg  group  respectively.  There  were  no  cases  of  urinary retention in the tolterodine 4mg/day group.

For the overall study population mean change from baseline in residual urine volume was rather small. However there  were  a  number  of  cases  reported  with  residual  urine  greater  than  200  mL  which  is considered highly clinically relevant. The results in the safety database indicate that urinary retention is slightly more pronounced in male subjects. This is mentioned in the SPC section 4.8.

- Vital signs and neurological observations

Individual  clinically  relevant  vital  sign  abnormalities  show  slight  dose-dependent  trends  in  the fesoterodine  treatment  groups  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  increases  in  pulse  rate,  while  the proportions of subjects with changes in blood pressure were similar across treatment groups. This finding is compatible with the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine.

The  cognitive  function  was  not  specifically  tested.  With  the  exception  of  dizziness,  the  overall incidence of neurological adverse events was very low; amnesia, confusional state, and disorientation occurred in very few subjects. The incidence of adverse events related to cognitive function in phase 2/3 trials are similar between fesoterodine and placebo treatment. In pool S1 the reported incidence related  to  cognitive  function  in  the  tolterodine  group  is  lower  compared  to  both  fesoterodine  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo.  However,  psychiatric  disorders  (confusion,  hallucination)  and  nervous  system  disorders (dizziness and somnolence) are known antimuscarinic class effects.

To  further support the safety of fesoterodine with respect to cognitive function, a specific Pharmacovigilance plan action is included in the Risk management plan.

- Cardiac safety

## Study SP686 (QT/QTc trial)

## Methods

The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg/day on the QT interval was evaluated in a phase 1, doubleblind,  randomized,  placebo-  and  positive-controlled  (moxifloxacin  400mg/day)  parallel  group  trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 healthy male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years.

Fesoterodine 28 mg/day was chosen because this dose results in an exposure to the active metabolite of fesoterodine that is higher than the exposure in poor CYP2D6 metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg/day together with a maximum CYP3A4 blockade.

The primary objective was to define the electrocardiographic effects of fesoterodine at steady-state after administration of 4 or 28mg/day for 3 days.

## As secondary objectives the correlation between fesoterodine plasma concentration and QTcF were examined.

Eletrocardiographic  parameters  were  measured  over  a  24-hour  period  at  pre-dose,  after  the  first administration, and after the third administration of study medication.

## The primary endpoint was the following :

Change from baseline in QTc based on Fridericia ( QTcF ) correction method.

## Secondary endpoints were the following :

Electrocardiograms:  change  from  Baseline  in  QTc  based  on  individual  ( QTcI )  and  Bazett  ( QTcB ) correction methods. Further secondary endpoint was change from Baseline in heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, ECG morphological pattern and uncorrected QT interval

Pharmacodynamics:  Correction  between  the  QTcF,  change  in  QTcF,  and  plasma  concentration  of SPM 7605 (the active metabolite of fesoterodine)

## Results

ECG parameters were similar across treatment groups. The exception was for heart rate in which the number of subjects with an increase of &gt;25% and&gt;100bpm was higher in the fesoterodine treatment groups  (16.9%,  39.1%  and  76.5%  in  the  placebo,  4mg/day  and  28mg/day  fesoterodine  groups respectively) due to the pharmacological effect of anticholinergics to increase heart rate.

At the end of treatment in Pool S1, marginal mean increases (3-6bpm) in heart rate, consistent with the observed slight increase in pulse rate, were observed in subjects receiving fesoterodine and tolterodine compared  with  a  mean  increase  of  &lt;1bpm  in  the  placebo  group.  Increased  heart  rate  is  a  known pharmacological effect of antimuscarinic drugs.

Individual  changes  in  QTc  were  classified  as  observed  values  &lt;450ms,  450  to  &lt;480ms,  480  to &lt;500ms, and ≥ 500ms. Changes from Baseline were classified as &lt;30ms, 30 to &lt;60ms, and ≥ 60ms.

EOT=end of treatment;Feso=fesoterodine,Tolt=tolterodine

NOTE: QTcF and QTcB were missing for 1 subject in the fesoterodine 8mg/day group in Pool S1 and Pool S5.

Data source: SCS Table 80.1, SCS Table 82.1, SCS Table 83.1, SCS Table 85.1

Change from Baseline ≥ 30ms in QTcF and QTcB at the end of treatment was generally similar across the treatment groups in both Pool S1 and Pool S5. At end of treatment in Pool S1, 1 subject in the fesoterodine  8mg/day  group  had  a ≥ 60ms  change  from  Baseline  in  QTcF  and  2  subjects  in  each fesoterodine treatment group had a ≥ 60ms change from Baseline in QTcB. Similar results were seen in Pool S5 except that there were no QTcB changes ≥ 60ms in the fesoterodine 4mg/day group. There was  no  indication  of  an  increased  incidence  of  QTc  prolongation  with  increased  exposure  to fesoterodine over a 3-month period calculated by either formula.

Overall, change from Baseline in QTc based on the Fridericia correction method did not show any differences between the active treatment and placebo group. Since, QT prolongation was also seen in &gt;5 subjects in the safety file for fesoterodine, the possibility of an increased risk for QT prolongation, associated with fesoterodine treatment, cannot be excluded. Therefore, as with other antimuscarinics, caution is given in the SPC  (section 4.4) for patients with risk for QT-prolongation  (e.g. hypokalaemia,  bradycardia  and  concomitant  administration  of    medicines  known  to  prolong  QT interval) and relevant pre-existing cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure).

## · Safety in special populations

## Safety by gender and age

In the treated study population 32% were older than 65 years and 9% were older than 75 years. Approximately  19  %  of  the  treated  study  population  was  men.  Mean  treatment  duration  was comparable in each treatment group regardless of gender.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were some difference in AE pattern based on age, with constipation, urinary tract infection and dizziness  occurring  more  often  in  older  (&gt;65  years  and  &gt;75  years)  subjects.  Dry  mouth  was  more frequent in the fesoterodine 8mg/day group among subjects &gt;75 years old than in those &lt;75 (45% vs. 34%, respectively). Headache was more common in younger subjects.

Gender appeared to play a role in the frequency of some AEs including dry mouth which occurred more often in females.

## Safety in poor metabolizers for CYP2D6

Poor metabolizers for CYP2D6 were more likely than extensive metabolizers to experience AEs such as those known to be associated with antimuscarinic treatment. This effect was more pronounced in the  fesoterodine  8mg/day  group,  eg,  constipation,  dry  mouth,  dry  eye,  residual  urine  retention  and dyspepsia occurred more often in poor metabolizers.

Regarding residual urine, results showed that there was a greater mean increase in poor metabolizers than extensive metabolizers. The most pronounced difference was in the fesoterodine 8mg/day group where  mean  increase  in  residual  urine  was  24mL  in  poor  metabilizers  and  14mL  in  extensive metabolizers.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors  did  appear  to  influence  the  occurrence  of  some  AEs, particularly dry mouth, constipation, and dry throat which were reported more frequently by subjects who used CYP3A4 inhibitors than those who did not use them, and more often in each fesoterodine group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  During  open-label  treatment  dry  mouth  occurred  with  similar incidence in subjects who did not use CYP3A4 inhibitors, and those who did.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total  of  142  subjects  in Pool  S1 discontinued  due  to  AEs  during  treatment:  26/780  (3%)  in  the placebo group, 35/782 (5%), 45/785 (6%), and 27/222 (12%) subjects in the fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively, and in 9/290 (3%) subjects in the tolterodine 4mg/day group.

Other than dry mouth, there was no clear dose-dependent relationship between fesoterodine dose and frequency of discontinuations due to any particular AE.

Adverse events led to discontinuation of fesoterodine in 11% of subjects during long-term treatment (Pool S2) ,  and were typical of those seen during treatment with antimuscarinics. These included (in more than 2 subjects during open-label treatment) dry mouth in 16 (2%) subjects, urinary retention in 10  (&lt;1%)  subjects,  constipation  in  8  (&lt;1%)  subjects,  residual  urine  volume  in  6  (&lt;1%)  subjects, lacrimal disorder (dry eye) in 5 (&lt;1%) subjects, and urinary tract infection, cough, dry throat, and dry skin in 3 (&lt;1%) subjects each. This AE dropout profile is similar to that in Pool S1 with the addition of cough, dry skin, and residual urine volume (6 subjects, &lt;1%) in Pool S2.

Overall  12%  of  subjects  in Pool  S2 had  their dose  reduced from  8mg  to  4mg  during  open-label treatment due to a treatment-emergent adverse event. Dry mouth in 91/1055 (9%) subjects was the AE most  often  leading  to  dose  reduction  during  OL  treatment.  This  was  followed  by  dysuria  and constipation,  leading  to  dose  reduction  in  8  (&lt;1%)  subjects  each,  lacrimal  disorder  (dry  eye)  in 7 (&lt;1%) subjects, headache in 6 (&lt;1%) subjects, dry skin in 4 (&lt;1%) subjects, and urinary hesitation and dry throat  in  3  (&lt;1%)  subjects  each.  The  majority  of  dose  reductions  occurred  during  the  first 6 weeks of treatment.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Common  AEs  (Treatment  Emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  with  incidence  rate  of  at  least  2%  in  any fesoterodine group) that occurred more often in subjects treated with fesoterodine 4 and 8mg/day than placebo included (in descending order based on the 4mg/day dose of fesoterodine) dry mouth 22% (173/782),  headache  8%  (64/782);  constipation  4%  (28/782),  nasopharyngitis  4%  (28/782),  urinary tract infection 3% (26/782), dyspepsia 2% (12/782), nausea 2% (17/782), dysuria 2% (12/782), and back pain 2% (19/782).

The AEs profile for the 8 mg/d dose was similar to the above described with a numerically higher incidence of dry mouth (35%). Except for urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and back pain, these AEs were reported more often in the fesoterodine 12mg/day than in the fesoterodine 4 or 8mg/day treatment  groups.  The  AEs  profile  for  tolterodine  was  similar  to  the  observed  for  the  4  mg/day  of fesoterodine, with a numerically lower incidence of dry mouth and headache.

During the open label (OL) extensions (Pool S2) the profile of common AEs was generally similar to that listed above for Pool S1 (double blind treatment).

Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity in Pool S1, and Pool S2 for both analyses. In Pool S1, severe AEs were reported for 4% (29/780), 5% (41/782), 8% (61/785), 14% (30/222), and 3% (8/290) of subjects in the placebo; fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups; and tolterodine 4mg/day group, respectively. Dry mouth was the AE most often rated as severe in intensity (&lt;1%, &lt;1%, 3%, 9%, and 0  in  placebo;  fesoterodine  4,  8,  and  12mg/day;  and  tolterodine  4mg/day  group,  respectively).  Dry throat,  lacrimal  disorders  and  headache  were  also  reported  as  severe  AEs  in ≥ 1%  subjects  in  the fesoterodine 12mg group.

Drug-associated AEs were reported for any system organ class (SOC) by 23% (176/780) of subjects in the placebo group, 35% (271/782), 46% (359/785), and 64% (141/222) of subjects in the fesoterodine 4,  8,  and  12mg/day  groups,  and  29%  (84/290)  of  subjects  in  the  tolterodine  4mg/day  group, respectively. Drug associated adverse events reported in ≥ 2% (in descending order based on incidence of adverse events in fesoterodine 8mg/day, followed by fesoterodine 4mg/day, followed by placebo) were dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, lachrymal disorder (dry eye), dry throat, dysuria, abdominal pain upper and back pain.

First onset of drug associated adverse events occurred mostly during Month 1 of treatment, decreasing the incidence afterward. Urinary retention and GGT increased did not show the same pattern of onset.

In  Pool  S1,  a  total  of  142/2859  (5%)  subjects  discontinued  clinical  trials  due  to  AEs  (3%  in  the placebo group, 5%, 6%, and 12% in the fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day groups, respectively, and 3% subjects  in  the  tolterodine  4mg/day  group).  During  long-term  treatment,  adverse  events  led  to discontinuation  of  fesoterodine  in  11%  of  subjects.  Reasons  for  discontinuations  (each  of  them accounting for less than 1%) were dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, ECG corrected interval prolonged,  GGT  increased,  mucosal  dryness,  headache,  dyspepsia,  dry  throat,  nausea,  vertigo, dizziness, chest pain, lacrimal disorder, vomiting and vision blurred. There was a clear dose-dependent relationship between fesoterodine dose and frequency of discontinuations due to dry mouth rising to 5%  in  the  fesoterodine  12mg/day  group.  No  other  AE  showed  such  a  clear  dose  dependence relationship.

Twelve  percent  (12%)  of  subjects  had  their  dose  reduced  from  8mg  to  4mg  during  open-label treatment due to TEAE. Dry mouth in 91/1055 (9%) subjects was the AE most often leading to dose reduction during OL treatment. The majority of dose reductions occurred during the first 6 weeks of treatment.

Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE)  were  reported  in  Pool  S1  by  2%  placebo  (15/780)  and  tolterodine (7/290) treated subjects, 27/782  (4%),  23/785  (3%),  and  13/222  (6%)  subjects  treated with fesoterodine 4, 8, and 12mg/day, respectively. During open-label treatment, SAEs were reported by 92/1055 (9%) subjects treated with fesoterodine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAEs reported by more than 2 fesoterodine treated subjects included myocardial infarction reported by 7 subjects, angina pectoris and chest pain by 5 subjects each, bronchitis and pneumonia, each reported by 4 subjects, and abdominal pain, ECG QT corrected interval prolonged, invertebral disc protrusion, breast cancer, appendicitis, and cholecystectomy reported by 3 subjects each (all &lt;1%).

Seventeen 17/1055 (2%) subjects discontinued treatment due to SAE during OL. None of the SAEs reported in Pool S2 OL only, led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject.

A thorough QT study in healthy volunteers was conducted. Fesoterodine up to 28 mg/d for 3 days was assessed.  A  placebo  and  positive  control  (moxifloxacine)  arms  were  included.  The  results  did  not show  fesoterodine  to  have  an  effect  on  the  QT  surpassing  the  established  threshold  of  regulatory concern (10 msec). These findings have been properly reflected in the SPC

.

These  results  are  apparently  confirmed  by  the  ECG  analysis  from  therapeutic  trials,  although  3 subjects assigned to fesoterodine 4mg/day and 6 to fesoterodine 8 mg discontinued the study drug due to QT prolongations. Importantly, 3 patients on the 8 mg dose were reported to have a SAE related to QT prolongation. Further analysis revealed that the incidence rates of QTc &gt;=500 ms post-baseline or QTc increase of &gt;=60 ms (some of which were classified as SAEs), were similar in active and placebo groups: 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.5% for fesoterodine 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and placebo, respectively.

Mean changes from Baseline in residual urine volume were usually greater in males than in females and greater in older subjects ( ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years) compared with younger subjects (&lt;65 years and &lt;75 years). A dose dependent increase in residual urine volume was observed in the fesoterodine treatment  groups.  Although  urinary  retention  is  compatible  with  the  antimuscarinic  activity,  results showed  a  numerically  higher  incidence  amongst  the  fesoterodine  treated  patients  than  tolterodine treated patients.

Cognitive  function  is  known  to  be  possibly  affected  by  antimuscarinic  agents.  With  increasing incidence of urge incontinence with age, elderly patients are a relevant target population. Although the incidence of adverse events related to cognitive function was low and not different from placebo, a specific pharmacovigilance plan action is included in the risk management plan.

During the extension clinical trials, patients were down-titrated and up-titrated accordingly, apparently,  with  their  tolerability  to  treatment.  Moreover,  there  were  a  3%  of  subjects  who  were up-titrated again to the 8mg/day dosage.

No relevant laboratory abnormalities has been reported for fesoterodine apart from isolated cases of raised liver enzymes determinations, in some cases leading to treatment discontinuation.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. The specific areas of monitoring for safety concerns are those mentioned in the above table.

In summary, routine and enhanced pharmacovigilance will be employed. The applicant will provide reviews  of  AEs  associated  with  the  use  of  fesoterodine,  as  well  as  specific  reviews  of  QT prolongation/Torsades de Pointes, hepatic disorders, urinary retention, cognitive function impairment, and systematic analysis by age and gender of AEs.

A paediatric development program is being designed and will be submitted and the Agency will be informed of the relative studies.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

There are no unresolved quality issues which may affect the Benefit/Risk balance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Pharmacotoxicological  studies  have  shown  effects  in  relation  to  the  antimuscarinic  activity  of fesoterodine and its main metabolite (SPM 7605).

Fesoterodine and SPM 7605 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG current with IC50 values of 3.6 and 0.5 µM, respectively. However in conscious dogs, the active metabolite had no effect on the QT interval and QTc interval at plasma exposures more than 20-fold higher than the mean peak free plasma concentration in humans.

The main target organ of toxicity was the liver in rats. No target organ of toxicity was identified in the mouse or the dog.

## Fesoterodine is non-genotoxic and non-carcinogenic

.

Reproduction  studies  have  shown  minor  embryotoxicity  at  doses  close  to  maternally  toxic  ones (increased number of resorptions, pre-implantation and post-implantation losses).

Environmental  studies  including  chronic  ecotoxicity  tests  of  the  active  metabolite  SPM  7605  in aquatic  organisms  of  at  least  three  trophic  levels,  are  ongoing  and  will  be  completed  in  the post-authorisation phase. (Follow-up measure)

## Efficacy

The demonstration of the clinical  efficacy  of  fesoterodine  is  based  on  2  pivotal  trials  in  which  the doses of 4 and 8 mg/d have been compared to placebo and tolterodine. The clinical efficacy results are statistically significantly superior to placebo in all primary endpoints i.e. reduction in the number of micturitions  per  24 hours,  of  urge  incontinence  episodes  per  24 hours  and  improvement  of  the treatment response rate using a treatment benefit scale.

The  efficacy  results  for  fesoterodine  4mg/day  and  the  active  comparator  tolterodine  are  judged comparable whereas the efficacy for fesoterodine 8mg/day was more pronounced.

For the overall patient group, the clinical relevance for the efficacy differences between the different doses of fesoterodine is difficult to assess, but the slightly better treatment effect of the higher dose of 8mg/day, may imply some benefit for the individual patient.

Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of  fesoterodine  in  overactive  bladder  syndrome, though  modest,  has  been  reasonably  and  consistently  established  both  against  placebo  and  an acceptable active comparator with a similar mechanism of action.

## Safety

The safety  profile  of  fesoterodine  is  the  one  expected  for  an  antimuscarinic  drug.  No  major  safety concerns  have  been  identified,  although  a  numerically  higher  incidence  and  severity  of  some anticholinergic AEs as compared with tolterodine were observed.

No evidence from a QT prolonging effect is apparent from either a specific QT study or in depth ECG analysis from phase II and III data. However, some QT-related AEs have been reported, especially for the 8 mg dose. This is reflected in the SPC.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities adequately addressed these.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- User consultation

The readability of the package leaflet for fesoterodine was tested based on the method for user testing described in the Readability Guideline. The outcome was satisfactory in accordance with predefined success criteria.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The demonstration of the clinical  efficacy  of  fesoterodine  is  based  on  2  pivotal  trials  in  which  the doses of 4 and 8 mg/d have been compared to placebo and tolterodine. Globally considered, the effect of fesoterodine has been consistently shown to be superior to placebo. Importantly, the magnitude of such effect has been demonstrated to be about the same magnitude of an acceptable comparator. For the overall patient group, the clinical relevance for the efficacy differences between the different doses of  fesoterodine  is  difficult  to  assess,  but  the  slightly  better  treatment  effect  of  the  higher  dose  of 8mg/day,  may  imply  some  benefit  for  the  individual  patient.  Therefore,  and  fully  recognising  the above mentioned limitations, the efficacy of fesoterodine in the intended indication can be considered as reasonably established.

Fesoterodine presents a clinical safety profile fully compatible with its antimuscarinic activity. There was an evident dose relationship for the incidence of some clinical AEs, with a slightly numerically higher  incidence  amongst  fesoterodine  4  and  8  mg  treated  patients  than  with  tolterodine.  No outstanding safety concerns are apparent from the assessment of submitted data .

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. Safety issues have been properly taken into consideration in the revised risk management plan: cardiovascular safety, liver toxicity, urinary retention and cognitive function impairment.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  TOVIAZ  (fesoterodine)  in  'Treatment  of  the  symptoms (increased urinary frequency and/or urgency and/or urgency incontinence) that may occur in patients with  overactive  bladder  syndrome'  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation.
