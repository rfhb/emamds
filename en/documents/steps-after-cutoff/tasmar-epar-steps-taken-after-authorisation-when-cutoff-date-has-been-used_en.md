## Steps taken after granting the Marketing Authorisation

## For procedures finalised after 1 September 2004 please refer to module 8B.

- The MAH submitted on 17 September 1997 two type I variations in accordance with Article 5 of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95  [(extension  of  shelf  life  from  2  to  3  years EMEA/H/C/132/I/02) and minor changes in the manufacturing process (EMEA/H/C/132/I/01)]. The MAH received a positive notification from the EMEA on 28 October 1997 (type I, no 20, extension  of  shelf-life)  and  on  25  November  1997  (type  I,  no  12,  minor  change  of  the manufacturing process of the active substance).
- On 16 February 1998, The MAH  submitted an application for a Type I variation (EMEA/H/C/132/I/03) for a change in the content of the manufacturing authorisation (additional  Primary  Packaging  and  Batch  Release  site).  The  MAH  received  a  positive notification from the EMEA on 24 April 1998 for the Type I Variation application.
- On 20 October 1998 the MAH applied for a Type II variation for Tasmar (EMEA/H/C/132/II/04 ) to  update  sections  4.2  (Posology  and  method  of  administration),  4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use), 4.8 (Undesirable effects) and 4.9 (Overdose) of  the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), and as a consequence the Package Leaflet following  new  data  provisionally  introduced  through  two  Urgent  Safety  Restrictions  (USRs). The CPMP, during its October 1998 plenary meeting, considered the changes acceptable and issued on 21 October 1998 a positive Opinion on this Type II variation.
- In the post-opinion phase of variation EMEA/H/C/132/II/04, prior to the variation receiving a Commission Decision, the European Commission requested the Opinion of the EMEA on cases of hepatotoxicity and neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. On 10 November 1998, the CPMP convened  an  extraordinary  meeting  to  review  the  cases.  Following  that  meeting,  the  CPMP adopted,  on  12  November  1998,  an  Opinion  recommending  the  suspension  of  the  marketing authorisation for Tasmar due to increasing concerns over reports of severe hepatotoxicity, three with a fatal outcome. The European Commission issued a Decision suspending the Marketing Authorisation of Tasmar on 11 December 1998, for the period of one year renewable.
- Subsequently, decisions renewing the suspension of the Tasmar Marketing Authorisation for the period  of  one  year  have  been  issued  by  the  European  Commission  on  20  January  2000,  29 January 2001, 17 December 2001, 7 January 2003 and 14 January 2004, following the CPMP opinions dated 21 October 1999, 19 October 2000, 19 September 2001, 19 September 2002 and 22 October 2003, respectively.
- Although on 22 October 2003, the CPMP adopted an Opinion recommending the renewal of the suspension of the marketing authorisation for Tasmar, for a further year, the CPMP agreed on a list of outstanding issues to be addressed by the MAH focussing on the submission of revised product information and proposals for safety measures relating to the possible re-introduction of Tasmar into the EU market.
- Therefore, on 16 February 2004, the MAH submitted documentation to support their request for the lifting of the suspension of the Marketing Authorisation for Tasmar addressing the issues raised by CPMP during its October 2003 plenary meeting, including a proposal to ensure safe use  of  Tasmar,  a  communication  plan  to  prescribers  including  a  Dear  Doctor  Letter  and  a revised Product Information. During its April 2004 plenary meeting, the CPMP adopted on 22 April 2004  an  Opinion  recommending  the  lifting  of  the  suspension of  the  Marketing Authorisation for Tasmar. The MAH provided the letter of undertaking on the measures to be fulfilled further to the lifting of the suspension on 22 April 2004.
