## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Datroway 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One vial of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains 100 mg of datopotamab deruxtecan. After reconstitution, one vial of 5 mL solution contains 20 mg/mL of datopotamab deruxtecan (see section 6.6).

Datopotamab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that contains a humanised anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) produced by mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, covalently linked to DXd, an exatecan derivative and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Approximately 4 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule.

## Excipient with known effect

Each 100 mg vial contains 1.50 mg of polysorbate 80 (E 433).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion.

White to yellowish white lyophilised powder, which has a cake-like appearance.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Breast cancer

Datroway as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have received endocrine therapy and at least one line of chemotherapy in the advanced setting (see section 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Datroway should be prescribed by a physician and administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.

## Patient selection

Patients for treatment of unresectable or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer should be selected on the basis of a documented HER2-negative result assessed by a CE marked IVD if available, or an alternative validated test.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

The recommended dose of Datroway is 6 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 540 mg for patients ≥90 kg) of body weight given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Premedication and prophylactic medicinal products

Prior to each infusion of Datroway, a premedication regimen for the prevention of infusion-related reactions that consists of an antihistamine and paracetamol (with or without glucocorticoids) should be considered (see section 4.8).

It is also recommended that patients receive prophylactic antiemetic agents (dexamethasone with 5-HT3 antagonists as well as other medicinal products, such as NK1 receptor antagonists) prior to infusion of Datroway and on subsequent days as needed.

For prophylactic treatment for keratitis and stomatitis, see section 4.4.

## Dose modifications

## Dose modifications for infusion-related reactions

The infusion rate of Datroway should be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion-related reaction. Datroway should be permanently discontinued in case of life-threatening infusion-related reactions.

## Dose modifications for adverse reactions

Management of adverse reactions may require dose delay, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation per guidelines provided in Tables 1 and 2.

Datroway dose should not be re-escalated after a dose reduction is made.

* Per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0.

# Grade 0 refers to full resolution of ILD/pneumonitis, including the disappearance of radiological findings associated with active ILD/pneumonitis. Residual scarring or fibrosis following recovery of ILD/pneumonitis is not considered to be active disease.

## Delayed or missed dose

If a planned dose is delayed or missed, it should be administered as soon as possible without waiting until the next planned cycle. The schedule of administration should be adjusted to maintain a 3-week interval between doses.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment of Datroway is required in patients aged 65 years or older. Data from datopotamab deruxtecan in patients aged 85 years or older are limited.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 30 and &lt; 90 mL/min) renal impairment (see section 5.2). The recommended dosage of Datroway has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored carefully. In patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline who received datopotamab deruxtecan 6 mg/kg, a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions was observed compared to those with normal renal function.

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and any aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. There are limited data to make a recommendation on dose adjustment in patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Insufficient data are available in patients with severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Therefore, patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment should be monitored carefully (see section 4.4 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Datroway is for intravenous use. It must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional and administered as an intravenous infusion. Datroway must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.

The first infusion is to be administered over 90 minutes. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes following the initial dose for signs or symptoms of infusion-related reactions.

Subsequent infusions are to be administered over 30 minutes if prior infusions were tolerated. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after infusion.

## Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

This medicinal product contains a cytotoxic component, which is covalently attached to the monoclonal antibody (see special handling and disposal procedures in section 6.6).

For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis

Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, have been reported in patients treated with Datroway (see section 4.8). Fatal outcomes have been observed.

Patients should be advised to immediately report cough, dyspnoea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis. Evidence of ILD/pneumonitis should be promptly investigated. Patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis should be evaluated by radiographic imaging. Consultation with a pulmonologist should be considered. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g. ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). Datroway should be delayed until recovery to Grade 0 and may be resumed according to instructions in Table 2 (see section 4.2). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g. ≥ 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. Datroway should be permanently discontinued in patients who are diagnosed with symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) ILD/pneumonitis (see section 4.2). Patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis may be at increased risk of developing ILD/pneumonitis and should be monitored carefully.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Keratitis

Datroway can cause ocular surface undesirable effects including keratitis. Signs and symptoms of keratitis may include dry eye, increased lacrimation, photophobia, and detrimental changes to vision (see section 4.8).

Patients should be advised to use preservative-free lubricant eye drops several times daily for prophylaxis. Patients should be advised to avoid use of contact lenses unless directed by an eye care professional. Patients should be promptly referred for appropriate ophthalmologic assessments for any new or worsening ocular signs and symptoms that could suggest keratitis. Keratitis should be monitored and if diagnosis is confirmed, Datroway should be dose delayed, dose reduced, or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

Patients with clinically significant corneal disease were excluded from the study (see section 5.1). Patients with pre-existing keratitis should be carefully monitored.

## Stomatitis

Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, have been reported in patients being treated with Datroway (see section 4.8).

In addition to practicing good oral hygiene, when starting Datroway and throughout treatment, daily use of a steroid-containing mouthwash (e.g. dexamethasone oral solution 0.1 mg/mL 4 times daily or a similar steroid-containing mouthwash regimen) is recommended for prophylaxis and treatment. Where clinically indicated, antifungal agents may be considered in accordance with local guidelines. In the absence of a prophylactic steroid-containing mouthwash, use of bland mouth rinses (e.g. a nonalcoholic and/or bicarbonate-containing mouthwash) per local guidelines is recommended. Ice chips or ice water held in the mouth throughout the infusion may also be considered. If stomatitis does occur, frequency of mouthwashes may be increased and/or other topical treatments may be used. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, dose delay, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue Datroway (see section 4.2).

## Embryo-foetal toxicity

Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase I inhibitor component of Datroway can cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

The pregnancy status of females of childbearing potential should be verified prior to the initiation of Datroway. The patient should be informed of the potential risks to the foetus. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of Datroway. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Datroway and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Datroway (see section 4.6).

## Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment

There are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and severe hepatic impairment. As metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes of elimination of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd, Datroway should be administered with caution in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Excipient with known effect

This medicine contains 1.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical drug interaction studies with datopotamab deruxtecan have been conducted. However, clinical drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which contains the same DXd payload as Datroway. The Cmax of DXd was not affected by ritonavir (inhibitor of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 and 1B3) or itraconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4). The AUC was increased 1.2-fold by both inhibitors which was not considered clinically relevant. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 will most likely not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of deruxtecan released from datopotamab deruxtecan.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males

The pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiation of Datroway.

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Datroway and for at least 7 months following the last dose.

Men with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Datroway and for at least 4 months following the last dose.

## Pregnancy

There are no available data on the use of Datroway in pregnant women. However, based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase I inhibitor component, DXd, can be expected to cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to pregnant women (see section 5.3).

Datroway is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Patients should be informed of the potential risks to the foetus before they become pregnant and to contact their doctor immediately if they become pregnant.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known if datopotamab deruxtecan is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed children, women should discontinue breast-feeding prior to initiating treatment with Datroway. Women may begin breast-feeding 1 month after concluding treatment.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of datopotamab deruxtecan on fertility are available. Based on results from animal toxicity studies, Datroway may impair male and female reproductive function and fertility (see section 5.3).

Both men and women should seek advice on fertility preservation before treatment. It is not known whether datopotamab deruxtecan or its metabolites are found in seminal fluid. Male patients must not freeze or donate sperm throughout the treatment period, and for at least 4 months after the final dose of Datroway. Females must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova throughout the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the final dose of Datroway.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Datroway may influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machines in case they experience fatigue or vision changes during treatment with Datroway (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The pooled safety profile has been assessed from two clinical studies involving 443 patients who received Datroway 6 mg/kg body weight for the treatment of breast cancer. The median exposure to Datroway in this data set was 6.2 months (range 0.7 to 28.5 months).

The most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were stomatitis (5.2%), COVID-19 (4.1%), fatigue (2.3%), ILD/pneumonitis (1.6%), pneumonia (1.6%), keratitis (1.4%) and infusion-related reaction (1.1%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 3 presents adverse reactions reported with Datroway. Adverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class and frequency category. The adverse reaction frequencies are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies, where a proportion of the events for an adverse reaction may have other causes than datopotamab deruxtecan, such as the disease, other medicinal products or unrelated causes. The severity of adverse drug reactions was assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), defining Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life threatening, and Grade 5 = death.

Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis

ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.7% of the pool of patients with breast cancer treated with Datroway 6 mg/kg, of which 3.6% were adjudicated as drug-related ILD/pneumonitis by independent review. Most ILD/pneumonitis cases were Grade 1 (2.9%). Grade 2 events occurred in 0.9% of patients. Grade 3 events occurred in 0.9% of patients. Adjudicated drug-related Grade 5 events occurred in 0.2% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.8 months (range: 1.1 to 10.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ocular surface undesirable effects

Ocular surface undesirable effects occurred in 49.0% of the pool of patients treated with Datroway, of which 35.0% were Grade 1, 12.2% were Grade 2 and 1.8% were Grade 3. Keratitis occurred in 17.8% of the pool of patients treated with Datroway, of which 13.3% were Grade 1, 3.6% were Grade 2 and 0.9% were Grade 3. The median time to onset was 4.1 months (range: 0 to 23.2). Discontinuation due to keratitis occurred in 0.5% of patients.

## Stomatitis

Stomatitis occurred in 64.8% of the pool of patients treated with Datroway, of which 29.3% were Grade 1, 27.5% were Grade 2 and 7.9% were Grade 3. Median time to first onset was 0.6 months (range: 0.03 to 12.2). Discontinuation due to stomatitis occurred in 0.5% of patients.

## Haematological events

In study TROPION-Breast01 neutropenia occurred in 11.7% of patients treated with Datroway (1.1% were Grade ≥3). Leukopenia occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Datroway (none were Grade ≥3). Colony stimulating factor was used by 2.7% of patients treated with Datroway.

## Elderly

Of the 443 patients with breast cancer treated with Datroway 6 mg/kg, 23.3% were 65 years or older and 4.7% were 75 years or older. Data are limited to establish the safety in patients 85 years or older.

There was a numerically lower proportion of Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (24.3% vs 25.0%) and a numerically higher proportion of serious adverse reactions (9.7% vs 6.8%) and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (3.9% vs 3.5%) observed in patients aged 65 years or older compared to patients younger than 65 years old.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose. Higher than the indicated dosing may increase risk of adverse reactions. Physicians should follow general supportive measures and institute appropriate treatment.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX35

## Mechanism of action

Datopotamab deruxtecan is a TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a humanised anti-TROP2 IgG1 attached to deruxtecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) bound by a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. The antibody-drug conjugate is stable in plasma. The antibody binds to TROP2 expressed on the surface of certain tumour cells. After binding, datopotamab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

deruxtecan undergoes internalisation into the tumour cells. Subsequently, the release of DXd results in DNA damage and apoptotic cell death via topoisomerase I inhibition. Datopotamab deruxtecan may also exhibit indirect cytotoxicity as shown in vitro through mechanisms of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and bystander cytotoxicity of DXd against TROP2 expressing tumour cells and neighbouring cells.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. During the median 5.5 month treatment period across clinical studies in NSCLC and breast cancer patients treated with Datroway at 6 mg/kg, the incidence of anti-datopotamab deruxtecan antibodies was 16% (146 out of 912) and the incidence of neutralising antibodies against datopotamab deruxtecan was 2.5% (23 out of 912). There was no apparent effect of anti-drug antibodies on the pharmacokinetics or effectiveness of datopotamab deruxtecan. No clinically meaningful impact on the safety of datopotamab deruxtecan was observed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## HR+/HER2- breast cancer

## TROPION-Breast01 (NCT05104866)

The efficacy of Datroway was evaluated in study TROPION-Breast01, a multicentre, open-label, randomised study of 732 patients with unresectable or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative (IHC 0, IHC1+ or IHC2+/ISH-) breast cancer. Patients must have progressed on and been unsuitable for endocrine therapy. Patients were required to have received 1 to 2 lines of prior chemotherapy in the unresectable or metastatic disease setting. Patients with clinically inactive brain metastases were included in the study. Patients were excluded for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids, ongoing ILD/pneumonitis, or clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary or corneal disease at screening. Patients were also excluded for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt; 1.

A total of 732 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either Datroway 6 mg/kg (N=365) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (N=367, eribulin 59.9%, capecitabine 20.7%, vinorelbine 10.4% or gemcitabine 9.0%) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by previous lines of chemotherapy (one or two), prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (yes or no) and geographical region (United States, Canada, Europe, or Rest of World). Tumour imaging was obtained every 6 weeks until disease progression.

The dual primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v.1.1 and overall survival (OS). Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were secondary endpoints.

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between treatment arms. The median age was 55 years (range 28 to 86); 22.3% were ≥ 65 years and 98.8% were female; 47.8% were White, 1.5% were Black or African American, 40.7% were Asian and 11.3% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity; 57% had ECOG PS 0 and 42.3% had ECOG PS of 1; 97.3% had visceral disease, 71.9% had liver metastases and 7.9% had stable brain metastases at baseline at the time of randomisation.

There were 60.2% of patients who received prior endocrine therapy in the (neo) adjuvant setting, 88.5% received prior endocrine therapy in the unresectable or metastatic setting and all patients received prior chemotherapy regimens in the unresectable or metastatic setting. Overall, 80.7% of patients had received prior taxanes and 63.8% had received prior anthracyclines. There were 62% of patients who had 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and 37.7% of patients who had 2 prior chemotherapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regimens for treatment of unresectable or metastatic disease. 82.5% of patients had prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Efficacy results are shown in Table 4 and Figure 1 and 2.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Datroway in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of datopotamab deruxtecan was evaluated in 729 patients.

At the recommended dosage of Datroway, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV]%) Cmax of datopotamab deruxtecan and DXd were 154 µg/mL (20.3%) and 2.82 ng/mL (58.1%), respectively, and the AUC (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve) of datopotamab deruxtecan and DXd were 671 µg*day/mL (31.4%) and 18.5 ng*day/mL (42.6%) after the first dose in cycle 1, respectively.

## Distribution

Steady state volume of distribution of datopotamab deruxtecan is 3.52 L. In vitro, across the concentration range of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL, the mean human plasma protein binding of DXd was 96.8 to 98.0%, and the blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of DXd was 0.59-0.62.

## Biotransformation

Datopotamab deruxtecan undergoes intracellular cleavage by lysosomal enzymes to release DXd. The humanised TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes indicate that DXd is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 via oxidative pathways and does not undergo significant metabolism by UGT or other CYP enzymes.

## Elimination

Following intravenous administration of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients, the clearance of datopotamab deruxtecan was estimated to be 0.57 L/day. The median elimination half-life (t1/2) of datopotamab deruxtecan was 4.82 days and apparent median t1/2 of released DXd was approximately

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5.50 days. In vitro , DXd was a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, MRP1 and BCRP. DXd excretion was not studied in humans.

## In vitro interactions

## Effects of Datroway on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

In vitro studies indicate DXd does not inhibit or induce major CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A. In vitro studies indicate that DXd does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP or BSEP transporters.

## Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of Datroway

In vitro , DXd was a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, MRP1 and BCRP. No clinically meaningful interaction is expected with medicinal products that are inhibitors of MATE2-K, MRP1, P-gp, OATP1B1 or BCRP transporters (see section 4.5).

## Linearity/non-linearity

The exposure of datopotamab deruxtecan and released DXd when administered intravenously increased in proportion to dose in the 4 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg dose range (approximately 0.7 to 1.7 times the recommended dose). No accumulation of datopotamab deruxtecan was observed at the 6 mg/kg dose between cycle 1 and cycle 3.

## Special populations

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (26 to 86 years), race, region, and sex did not have a clinically meaningful effect on exposure of datopotamab deruxtecan or DXd. The mean volume of distribution and clearance of datopotamab deruxtecan and DXd increase with increasing body weight (35.6 kg to 156 kg). This is considered clinically relevant. See section 4.2 for dose recommendations.

## Renal impairment

No dedicated renal impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis including patients with mild to moderate (CLcr ≥ 30 and &lt;90 mL/min) renal impairment (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), the pharmacokinetics of datopotamab deruxtecan or DXd was not affected by mild to moderate renal impairment as compared to normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min) (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dedicated hepatic impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis including patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and any AST &gt; ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), the pharmacokinetics of datopotamab deruxtecan or DXd was not affected by mild hepatic impairment as compared to normal hepatic function. There are limited data in patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment to draw conclusions. Insufficient data are available for patients with severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Therefore, patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment should be monitored carefully (see section 4.2 and 4.4).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Repeat-dose toxicity

In animals, toxicities were observed in lymphatic and haematopoietic organs, intestines, kidneys, male and female reproductive tracts, lung, skin, eye (cornea), liver and incisor teeth following the administration of datopotamab deruxtecan at exposure levels of the topoisomerase I inhibitor below

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinical plasma exposure. In these animals, ADC exposure levels were similar or above clinical plasma exposure.

## Genotoxicity

DXd was clastogenic in both an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay and an in vitro Chinese hamster lung chromosome aberration assay.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with datopotamab deruxtecan.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Dedicated fertility studies have not been conducted with datopotamab deruxtecan. Based on the results from an animal toxicity study in rats, datopotamab deruxtecan at 200 mg/kg (approximately 29 times the human recommended dose of 6 mg/kg based on AUC) may impair male and female reproductive function and fertility at exposure levels of the topoisomerase I inhibitor below clinical plasma exposure. Toxicity to male reproductive tract included testis (degeneration of germinal epithelium and atrophy of seminiferous tubule) and epididymis (single cell necrosis of ductal epithelium, cell debris in duct and decreased number of spermatozoa in duct), which did not reverse after 8 weeks of treatment cessation, except for single cell necrosis of ductal epithelium. The effects on female fertility, including an increase in the number of atretic follicles in the ovaries and single cell necrosis of mucosal epithelium in the vagina, may be reversible.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with datopotamab deruxtecan. Based on results from general animal toxicity studies, datopotamab deruxtecan and DXd were toxic to rapidly dividing cells (testes), and DXd was genotoxic, suggesting the potential for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity.

3. How you are given Datroway
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Datroway
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Datroway is and what it is used for

Datroway is a medicine that contains the active substance datopotamab deruxtecan.

Datroway is used to treat adults who have been diagnosed with a type of cancer known as hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. It is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery in patients who have received hormone therapy and at least one additional cancer treatment for unresectable or metastatic disease.

One part of the medicine is a monoclonal antibody (datopotamab) that attaches specifically to cells that have the protein TROP2, which is present in larger numbers on the surface of TROP2-expressing breast cancer cells. The other active part of Datroway is DXd, a substance that can kill cancer cells. Once the medicine has attached to TROP2-expressing cancer cells, the DXd enters the cells and kills them.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Datroway

## You must not be given Datroway

- if you are allergic to datopotamab deruxtecan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Datroway.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Datroway, or during treatment if you have:

- cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other new or worsening breathing problems. These may be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal lung disease called interstitial lung disease. A

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

history of lung disease may increase the risk of developing interstitial lung disease. Your doctor may have to monitor your lungs while you are taking this medicine.

Datroway may also cause:

- eye problems. You should use preservative-free lubricating eye drops several times daily to prevent dry eye and other eye problems. You should avoid the use of contact lenses during treatment. If you have or develop eye problems, which may include dry eyes, increased tears, sensitivity to light or vision changes during treatment, contact your doctor or nurse. Your doctor may refer you to an eye care provider if needed.
- mouth ulcers and sores. In addition to good oral hygiene and dietary recommendations, your doctor or nurse will also recommend a non-alcoholic mouthwash to use 4 times a day. This mouthwash may contain steroids. If you develop pain, discomfort, or open sores in your mouth, tell your doctor or nurse. Follow your doctor or nurse's instructions on how to use mouthwash to prevent or treat mouth ulcers and sores.

If you have liver problems; your doctor may have to monitor you more closely while you are taking this medicine.

## Children and adolescents

Datroway is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years: there is no information on how well it works in this age group.

## Other medicines and Datroway

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Contraception

You should use effective contraception (birth control) to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Datroway and for a period of time after your last dose.

- Women taking Datroway should continue contraception for at least 7 months after the last dose of Datroway.
- Men taking Datroway whose partner may become pregnant should continue using effective contraception for at least 4 months after the last dose of Datroway.

Talk to your doctor about the best contraception for you. Also talk to your doctor before you stop your contraception.

## Pregnancy

Datroway is not recommended during pregnancy because this medicine may harm the unborn baby. Speak with your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant before or during treatment.

## Breast-feeding

You should not breast-feed during treatment with Datroway and for at least 1 month after your last dose. This is because it is not known whether Datroway passes into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about this.

## Fertility

If you are being treated with Datroway, you should take advice on conserving sperm or eggs (ova) before treatment because the medicine may reduce your fertility. Therefore, discuss this with your

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

doctor before starting treatment.

## Driving and using machines

Datroway could impact your ability to drive or use machines. Be careful if you feel tired or have trouble seeing.

## Datroway contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 1.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How you are given Datroway

Datroway will be given to you in a hospital or clinic by a doctor or nurse experienced in the use of cancer medicines.

The recommended dose is 6 mg for every kilogram of your body weight, every 3 weeks. Your doctor or nurse will calculate the dose you need based on your body weight and will decide how many treatments you need.

Your doctor or nurse will give you Datroway as an infusion (drip) into your vein.

Your first infusion will be given over 90 minutes. If this goes well, the infusion on your next visits may be given over 30 minutes.

After each infusion, you will be monitored for side effects for 30 minutes. Your doctor or nurse may lower your dose, or temporarily or permanently stop your treatment depending on your side effects.

Before each Datroway infusion, your doctor or nurse may give you medicines to help prevent nausea, vomiting, and infusion-related reactions.

Before each Datroway infusion and during the treatment period, your doctor or nurse may recommend using a mouthwash to help prevent mouth ulcers and sores. If you get infusion-related symptoms, your doctor or nurse may slow down your infusion or interrupt or stop your treatment.

During the treatment period, you should use preservative-free lubricating eye drops several times daily and avoid the use of contact lenses.

## If you miss an appointment to get Datroway

Contact your doctor or treatment centre right away to reschedule your appointment. It is very important that you do not miss a dose of this medicine.

## If you stop receiving Datroway

Do not stop treatment with Datroway without checking with your doctor or nurse. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.
