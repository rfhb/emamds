## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Ipsen Pharma submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 10 April 2021 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected     |

| C.I.11.b              | C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the obligations and conditions of a marketing authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of change(s) which require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH where significant assessment is required | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |

Update of the annex IIE and SmPC section 5.1 to remove the specific obligation (SOB 001) and the reference to the conditional approval based on the final results from the study XL184-401 (EXAMINER), a randomised, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib (XL184) at 60 mg/day compared to a 140 mg/day in progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer patients. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. The updated RMP version 5.4 has also been submitted. With this submission, the MAH is proposing to revert from conditional marketing authorisation to full marketing authorisation. Additionally, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the Product Information in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2 Rev 1, to add the sodium content in the Summary of product Characteristics and Package Information Leaflet in line with the guideline on 'Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use' and update details of local representatives.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The conditional approval for Cometriq was granted on 21/03/2014. At the time of the initial approval the CHMP identified uncertainties in relation to the impact of RET mutation status on the efficacy of cabozantinib and the possibility of giving effective lower dosages with less toxicity.

In the pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study presented in patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (XL184-301), a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS was shown for cabozantinib compared with placebo (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19-0.49, p&lt;0.0001), with a gain in median PFS of 31.2 weeks (7.2 months) in favour of cabozantinib (median PFS 48.6 weeks vs 17.4 weeks, respectively).

From a quantitative point of view, the specific benefit in patients with RET negative tumours or tumours with unknown RET mutation status was less as compared with what was observed in patients with RET+ tumours. The possible lower beneficial effects of cabozantinib in patients in whom RET mutation are not known or is negative has been included in the indication and further information is warranted to clarify this further.

The toxicity profile was considered acceptable. However, in view of the frequent dose reductions due to toxicity, the CHMP agreed that the benefit-risk balance might be further improved by studying the efficacy and safety of a lower starting dose. Consequently, a dose-comparison study (XL-184-401) (140 mg vs 60 mg) in patients with hereditary or sporadic medullary thyroid cancer was recommended

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as a SOB (SOB 001).

This study evaluated a lower cabozantinib dose of 60 mg qd (tablets) to determine whether it would yield similar efficacy to the approved 140 mg qd dose (capsules) with improved tolerability. As part of this study, the impact of RET mutation status on the efficacy of cabozantinib was further ascertained. Additionally, PK data were collected in all subjects to assess the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 mg and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the population PK modeling and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib in this population.

The study used a non-inferiority trial design. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study XL184-401 was a treatment comparison of PFS per RECIST 1.1 per BIRC.

The primary endpoint analysis demonstrated that PFS per BIRC did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion for the cabozantinib 60 mg arm compared with the cabozantinib 140 mg arm in Study XL184-401. The concern of a possible lower benefit of cabozantinib in subjects with a negative or an unknown mutation status was not confirmed, however the subgroup analyses was not powered to detect differences. The recommended posology for Cometriq remains unchanged.

Changes proposed to the product information and RMP are acceptable.

The submission of the final clinical study report for study XL184-401 satisfactorily fulfils the specific obligation SOB 001:

'A dose-comparison study (XL-184-401) (140 mg vs 60 mg) in 112 patients with hereditary or sporadic medullary thyroid cancer.

Patients with both sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC will be eligible for the study. Fresh tumour samples for tumour genetic analysis from the most recent metastatic site in patients enrolled in the dose-comparison study should be collected.

Samples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. Tumour tissue samples initially will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumour enrichment, and DNA isolation. The resulting DNA samples will be evaluated for quality by a PCR-based amplification test, and by Sanger sequencing for RET M918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original sample fails during the PCR quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation sequencing of RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 will be performed, which covers the vast majority of known RET mutations. In addition, samples will be evaluated for mutations in RAS gene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes).

PK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results will be used to evaluate the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the population PK models and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib and possible metabolites in this population.'

imposed as part of the conditional marketing authorisation granted in 2016 and the MAH's request that the marketing authorisation for Cometriq is no longer subject to Specific Obligations is endorsed by the CHMP. In alignment, it is also endorsed that Cometriq is removed from the European list of additionally monitored medicines No new safety signals have been identified.

The benefit-risk balance of Cometriq in the approved indications, remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

## 5. Introduction

Cabozantinib potently inhibits three RTKs implicated in MTC pathogenesis and progression: MET, VEGFR2 and RET (Yakes et al 2011; Sennino et al 2012). Cabozantinib capsules at a dose of 140 mg qd are conditionally approved in the EU since March 2014 for the treatment of subjects with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC (Cometriq SmPC) on the basis of the randomized, double-blind phase 3 Study XL184-301. The dose of cabozantinib in the Phase 3 study (XL184-301), on which the approval of cabozantinib for the treatment of advanced MTC was based, was 140 mg qd. This was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the Phase 1 Study XL184-001. A conditional approval for Cometriq was granted because additional clinical data was needed to address the possibility of giving effective lower dosages with less toxicity since in Study XL184-301 dose reductions occurred in 79% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm.

A total of 330 subjects with metastatic or locally advanced MTC were randomized 2:1 to receive an orally administered regimen of either cabozantinib 140 mg qd or matching placebo in the Phase 3 study (XL184-301). Subjects were required to have radiographically documented progressive disease (PD) within 14 months prior to study entry. The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS per mRECIST 1.0 (Therasse et al 2000) by BIRC. Overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) were secondary outcome measures. In the cabozantinib arm, the estimated median PFS was 11.2 months compared with 4.0 months in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19, 0.40; p value &lt;0.0001). In the final analysis of the OS secondary endpoint, the estimated median OS for the cabozantinib arm was 26.6 months versus 21.1 months for the placebo arm (HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.65, 1.12, p-value = 0.2409; XL184-301 CSR Addendum 2, Table 8 and Table 14; Schlumberger et al 2017).

A subgroup analysis of subjects with the RET M918T mutation revealed an approximate doubling in OS for the cabozantinib arm; the median OS was 44.3 months for the cabozantinib arm versus 18.9 months for the placebo arm. There was no improvement in OS for the RET M918T negative (median 20.2 months for the cabozantinib arm vs 21.5 months for the placebo arm) and unknown subgroups; of note, the RET M918T negative group includes subjects with RAS mutations that are mutually exclusive from RET M918T. The other secondary endpoint, ORR was 27.9% in the cabozantinib arm versus 0% in the placebo arm (p value &lt; 0.0001). Dose reductions occurred in 79% of subjects in the cabozantinib arm.

Subsequently, cabozantinib tablets (Cabometyx) were approved in the US, EU, and other regions at a lower dose of 60 mg qd for RCC and HCC indications. The capsule and tablet formulations are not bioequivalent or interchangeable.

As a specific obligation current Study XL184-401 in subjects with progressive, metastatic MTC was initiated. This study evaluated a lower cabozantinib dose of 60 mg qd (tablets) to determine whether it would yield similar efficacy to the approved 140 mg qd dose (capsules) with improved tolerability. As part of this study, the impact of RET mutation status on the efficacy of cabozantinib was further ascertained. Additionally, PK data were collected in all subjects to assess the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 mg and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the population PK modeling and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib in this population.

The study used a non-inferiority trial design. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study XL184-401 was a treatment comparison of PFS per RECIST 1.1 per BIRC.

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology Aspects

## 6.1. Introduction

Results from the clinical pharmacology studies were included in the original cabozantinib (XL-184) marketing application (EMEA/H/C/002640/0000) and are not further discussed.

This procedure concerns a variation that addresses the specific obligation and complete the postauthorisation measures for the conditional marketing approval:

- SOB001: A dose-comparison study (XL-184-401) (140 mg vs 60 mg) in 112 patients with hereditary or sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. Patients with both sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC will be eligible for the study. Fresh tumour samples for tumour genetic analysis from the most recent metastatic site in patients enrolled in the dose-comparison study should be collected. Samples will undergo thorough evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. Tumour tissue samples initially will undergo histological evaluation, manual tumour enrichment, and DNA isolation. The resulting DNA samples will be evaluated for quality by a PCR-based amplification test, and by Sanger sequencing for RET M918T. A replacement sample will be requested if an original sample fails during the PCR quality or the Sanger sequencing tests. Next generation sequencing of RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 will be performed, which covers the vast majority of known RET mutations. In addition, samples will be evaluated for mutations in RAS gene hotspots (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes).

PK assessments will be required for all subjects (both dose groups). Results will be used to evaluate the exposure to cabozantinib at the 60 and 140 mg dose levels and to further characterize the population PK models and exposure response relationships of cabozantinib and possible metabolites in this population.

Within this application, a population pharmacokinetics (popPK) model and an exposure-response analysis in patients with medullary thyroid cancer with data from Study XL184-401 have been submitted.

## 6.2. Bioanalytical Methods

In MTC Study XL-184-401, pharmacokinetic samples were collected 8 hours after drug intake on Week 3 Day 1 (W3D1), W5D1, W9D1, W13D1, and W25D1 in human plasma (anticoagulant: K2EDTA). For each visit, the PK sample was to be collected approximately 8 or more hours after the previous dose of cabozantinib, and if cabozantinib was administered on that day, samples were to be collected prior to cabozantinib administration.

Plasma concentration analyses for cabozantinib were performed by a previously validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method was validated for a range of 0.500  to 1000 ng/mL based on the analysis of 50.0 µL of plasma by LC-MS-MS.

## Assessor's comment:

The same bioanalytical method as previously approved in EMEA/H/C/4163 has been used to determine the concentration of cabozantinib (XL-184) in human plasma. The bioanalytical method is considered adequate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.3. Study XL184-401

## Data

Study XL184-401 was a Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind non-inferiority trial of cabozantinib at 60 mg tablet versus 140 mg capsule once daily, with progression free survival as the primary efficacy endpoint in metastatic medullary thyroid cancer patients. A total of 247 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive study treatment. The study used a noninferiority trial design. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study XL184-401 was a treatment comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The study used a noninferiority trial design. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study XL184-401 was a treatment comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). A pharmacokinetic analysis was also conducted. Dose reductions were allowed in both treatment groups (i.e. 140 mg could reduce to 100 mg and 60 mg QD, whereas the 60 mg group could reduce to 40 mg and 20 mg QD).

A total of 243 subjects (121 in the 60-mg/tablet arm and 122 in the 140-mg/capsule arm) had eligible records in the pharmacokinetic analysis dataset. Summary pharmacokinetics data are provided in Table 1. In general, mean cabozantinib plasma concentrations in the 60-mg/tablet arm were lower than those in the 140-mg/capsule arm. In addition, there was a trend for cabozantinib concentrations to decrease over time for subjects in both the 60-mg/tablet and 140-mg/capsule arms, likely due to cabozantinib dose interruptions or reductions. The decrease in concentration was more markedly seen in the 140-mg/capsule arm compared with the 60-mg/tablet arm. At the W3D1 visit, mean concentrations were approximately 73% higher in the 140-mg/capsule arm compared with the 60mg/tablet arm; however, at later time points ≤ 38% difference was observed due to a higher number of dose modifications in the 140-mg arm compared with the 60-mg arm.

## Assessor's comment:

Summary statistics per dose level and study visit have been provided on request. No pre-dose samples have been collected. Due to AEs in both the 60 mg and 140 mg dose group, a majority of the patients needed a dose reduction. A decrease in plasma concentrations can be observed over time for both the 60 mg and 140 mg dose groups, due to the dose reductions.

## 6.4. Population pharmacokinetic model

## Objective

The objective of the population pharmacokinetic analysis were: 1. to characterise the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in patients with medullary thyroid cancer. 2. Compare cabozantinib the pharmacokinetics between medullary thyroid cancer patients enrolled in Phase 3 (XL184-301) and Phase 4 (XL184-401) clinical trials.

## Methodology

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling using NONMEM (Version 7.3).  Stochastic estimation methods including stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) and importance sampling (IMP) were used for parameter estimation and objective function value, respectively. Pre- and post-processing of data from each modeling step was performed using SAS (Version 9.4), S-plus9 (Version 8.2) and/or R10 (Version 3.6.1 or higher). Graphical analysis of the data or output from the models was performed using R. Standard goodnessof-fit plots and numerical diagnostics were used to evaluate model performance. A prediction-corrected visual predictive check was constructed to evaluate the predictive performance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analysis included data from four clinical studies (Table 1): two phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (XL184-010 and XL184-020) and a phase 3 and phase 4 study, respectively, in subjects with MTC (XL184-301 [210 subjects] and XL184-401 [220 subjects]) for a total of 6144 cabozantinib concentration records from 570 subjects. A small percentage (&lt;1%) of post-dose samples had concentrations below the lower limit of quantification. Descriptive statistics of the included population are displayed in Table 2.

N = number; SD = standard deviation; MTC = metastatic medullary thyroid cancer

## Model

A 2-compartment model with first-order elimination and a dual absorption (first-order + zero-order) process adequately described the observed cabozantinib PK data (Figure 1). The capsule formulation was included as a structural covariate on the first-order absorption rate and overall relative bioavailability. Interindividual variability was included assuming a log-normal distribution. Residual variability was modelled assuming an additive error in the log domain. Parameter estimates are displayed in Table 4 and a prediction corrected visual predictive check in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Prediction-Corrected Visual Predictive Check of the Final Population PK

<!-- image -->

Typical PK parameters estimated from the final population PK model for a White male, healthy subject were as follows: CL/F of 2.75 L/h, Vc/F of 199 L, Q/F of 33.0 L/h, and Vp/F of 183 L. The inter-subject variability was 42% for CL/F and 73% for Vc/F. Female, Asian race and MTC subjects (Study XL184301) were identified as statistically significant covariates on CL/F. Female and Asian subjects had lower CL/F when compared to male and White subjects. Females had 28% lower CL/F than males which resulted in 38% higher area under the plasma concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC(024,ss)). Asian subjects had 23% lower CL/F than White subjects which resulted in a 30% higher AUC(0-24,ss).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MTC population in Study XL184-401 had similar CL/F to healthy subjects. As expected, the predicted exposure (AUC(0-24,ss)) for 60-mg tablet was lower than 140 mg-capsule in MTC subjects in Study XL184-401 (Figure 3). The difference in CL/F between studies should be interpreted with caution, however, due to study differences in PK data available to inform the model. Whereas Study XL184-301 provided only absorption phase data (due to data exclusions), Study XL184-401 had PK data that were obtained during the elimination phase (&gt;8 hours post-dose) at steady state. Some trough PK samples collected at steady state in Study XL184-301 were excluded due to missing dose date/time information prior to the PK sample.

## Assessor's comment:

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics in patients with medullary thyroid cancer and more specifically, to compare the pharmacokinetics between study XL184301 and XL184-401. The population pharmacokinetic model however does not appear to adequately describe the pharmacokinetic data of study XL184-301 and XL184-401 as clear deviations from the observed median and 5 th  and 95 th  percentile and the model predictions for studies XL184-301 and XL184401 can be observed. This is further supported by the inclusion of a study effect for study XL184-301 on CL/F. The applicant argues that this is due to study differences to inform the model, however this also indicates that the model is unable to adequately predict the structural trend of the data. The stochastic part of the population pharmacokinetic model indicates very large variability in the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib, in particular in the absorption phase (variance for Ka was estimated to be 1.61, which after conversion to CV = 199% [sqrt( exp ( omega ^2) 1) )], and variance for F was estimated to be 2.5 [CV = 334%]). Specially regarding the bioavailability, this indicates that there are large differences in plasma exposure between individuals, which could warrant different starting dosages. The large variability in the pharmacokinetics is observed even after correction of several covariates, indicating that the plasma exposure cannot be predicted by the model without any observations. The population pharmacokinetic model is therefore not suitable to determine an individual's starting dose.

## 6.5. Exposure-Response analysis

The exposure-response analysis included clinical data for patients with medullary thyroid cancer from study XL184-401 up to the data cut-off point of 15 July 2020. Endpoints that were evaluated are: progression free survival, dose modification, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (Grade 1 or higher,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[PPE]), diarrhea, hypertension, oral mucositis/stomatitis, fatigue/asthenia and ALT/AST elevation. Individual predicted cabozantinib exposures were merged with endpoint specific time-to-event data. An overview of the number of events and number of subjects at risk by endpoint is displayed below.

Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis by cabozantinib exposure tertile was used to investigate the exposureresponse (ER) relationship between cabozantinib exposure and clinical efficacy and safety endpoints in MTC subjects from Study XL184-401. The analysis comprised cabozantinib-treated subjects who received at least one dose of cabozantinib and contributed at least one measurable cabozantinib concentration. Of those 247 cabozantinib-treated subjects, 243 subjects had at least one measurable PK concentration. Cabozantinib exposure was defined as the overall average concentration calculated from time 0 to the time of event or censoring (CAVG0T), which is a time-invariant exposure measure. For the cabozantinib dose modification endpoint, the average concentration over the first week of treatment (CAVG1W) was used to represent cabozantinib exposure to avoid possible correlation between CAVG0T and time of cabozantinib dose modification.

No clear relationship was observed between the fraction of subjects with progressive disease or death and the different tertiles of cabozantinib exposure (Figure 4).

The frequency of cabozantinib dose modification was 119/122 (98%) and 105/121 (87%) in the 140 mg capsule and 60 mg tablet groups, respectively. The observed median time to first cabozantinib dose modification was 29 days for the 140 mg capsule treatment group, and 56 days for the 60 mg tablet treatment group. For the evaluation of dose modification with cabozantinib exposure over the first week of treatment (CAVG1W), only 4 out of the total 243 subjects had a dose modification event before Day 7 and were excluded from the KM analysis. KM plots evaluated separately for 140 mg capsule and 60 mg tablet showed no apparent relationship of cabozantinib dose modification with average cabozantinib exposure due to a narrow range of exposure for each group. When 140 mg capsule and 60 mg tablet treatment groups are combined, the data comprise a broader range of exposure, and a higher cabozantinib exposure (CAVG1W) was associated with earlier and more frequent dose modification.

Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier Plot for dose modifications by Average Exposure Tertile

A total of 133 subjects had an event of PPE (Grade ≥ 1), 49 subjects had an event of diarrhea (Grade ≥ 3) and 51 subjects [22 subjects] had an event of hypertension (Grade ≥ 3, based on BP source data [MedDRA terms]), out of 243 subjects with at least one quantifiable cabozantinib concentration. KM plots showed significant relationships of PPE (Grade ≥ 1), diarrhea (Grade ≥3) and hypertension (Grade ≥ 3) with cabozantinib exposure tertiles. The frequency of these events increased with increasing cabozantinib average concentration. Event rates were lower for oral mucositis/stomatitis (Grade ≥ 3) (13/243 subjects) and fatigue/asthenia (Grade ≥ 3) (34/243 subjects). The rate of oral mucositis/stomatitis (Grade ≥ 3) and fatigue/asthenia (Grade ≥ 3) tended to be highest in the largest cabozantinib exposure tertile; however, no significant relationship with cabozantinib exposure was observed based on overlapping confidence intervals across concentration tertiles in the KM analysis. Similarly, the event of ALT/AST elevation (Grade ≥ 3, defined by either CTCAEv4.03 or CTCAEv5 criteria), did not demonstrate a significant relationship with cabozantinib exposure, although the KM plot of ALT/AST elevation (Grade ≥ 3) defined by MedDRA terms suggested a possible increase in frequency with increasing cabozantinib concentration. With low overall event rates for ALT/AST elevation (Grade ≥ 3) based o n CTCAEv4.03 criteria (19/242), CTCAEv5 criteria (15/242) and MedDRA terms (14/243), these results should be interpreted with caution.

## Assessor's comment:

The exposure-response analysis consisted of a Kaplan Meier analysis, in which the average concentration (calculated from time 0 to the time of event/censoring) was divided in tertiles and plotted versus several clinical endpoints. No significant relationships could be identified by the applicant for both efficacy as well as safety endpoints. Additional submitted data on Kaplan-Meier plot separated by arms (140 mg, solid lines vs. 60 mg, dashed lines) and cabozantinib exposure tertiles for each dose group showed that the Q2 and Q3 PFS of the 60 mg dose group were below the exposure tertiles of the 140 mg dose group. However, the Q1 of the 60 mg dose group was above the Q3 of the 140 mg dose group, indicating no clear relationship between the fraction of subjects with progressive disease and the different tertiles of cabozantinib exposures of the 60 and 140 mg dose group. These results do not support therapeutic drug monitoring. Moreover, more rapid dose reductions in the 140 mg dose group compared to the 60 mg group cause the drug levels in both dose groups to converge over time. The convergence of the exposure levels likely confounds the ability to detect an exposure-response relationship by exposure quantile. In the current study XL184-401, the exposure-response analysis is not inconsistent with the clinical results. And it should be noted that the study was designed as a non-inferiority study. Whether the PFS is worser or better cannot be scientifically confirmed or supported by such a study.

The safety endpoints demonstrate clear trends for better tolerability with a lower dose.

## 6.6. Overall conclusion on clinical pharmacology

A large variability in the pharmacokinetics, and in particular the absorption (CV = 199%) and bioavailability (CV = 334%), can be observed for cabozantinib in patients with medullary thyroid cancer. This indicates very large differences between patients in overall plasma exposure, which could imply that one (starting) dose for all patients might not be optimal. The population pharmacokinetic model is however not predictive for which patient would require a higher or lower starting dose as the included covariates were not able to explain the variability in cabozantinib pharmacokinetics to a clinical relevant degree. Plasma exposure, and thus dose, cannot be predicted up front.

The exposure-response analysis indicates that no relationship between plasma exposure and progression-free survival exists. This questions the need for a 140 mg starting dose and is contradicting the finding that the 60 mg dose would result in a lower, or at least non-similar, efficacy than the currently conditionally approved 140 mg dose. With respect to safety, clear trends between plasma exposure and several endpoints can be observed, which is in favour of the 60 mg dose. After inclusion of plasma exposure as continuous covariate, the exposure-response analysis for safety endpoints will most likely result in significant results.

In conclusion, from a clinical pharmacology point of view, uncertainties remain regarding the appropriate starting dose. The large range in plasma exposures observed in study XL184-401, as a result of a large variability in bioavailability, indicates that different patients would require different dosages to achieve a similar level of overall plasma exposure and the possible expected effect. However, no clear relationship between the fraction of subjects with progressive disease and the different tertiles of cabozantinib exposures of the 60 and 140 mg dose group were observed and these results do not support therapeutic drug monitoring. More rapid dose reductions in the 140 mg dose group compared to the 60 mg group cause the drug levels in both dose groups to converge over time. The convergence of the exposure levels likely confounds the ability to detect an exposure-response relationship by exposure quantile. In the current study XL184-401, the exposure-response analysis is not inconsistent with the clinical results. And it should be noted that the study was designed as a noninferiority study. Whether the PFS is worser or better cannot be scientifically confirmed or supported by such a study.

The safety endpoints demonstrate clear trends for better tolerability with a lower dose.

## Treatments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects received blinded oral study drug once daily. Study drug consisted of both tablets and capsules for all subjects. Subjects randomized to the 140 mg treatment arm received active capsules and placebo tablets. Subjects randomized to the 60 mg treatment arm received active tablets and placebo capsules. At the starting dose level, subjects received as their daily study treatment dose one 80 mg capsule, three 20 mg capsules, and one 60 mg tablet. At the first-level dose reduction level (Figure 7),subjects received one 80 mg capsule, one 20 mg capsule, and two 20 mg tablets. At the secondlevel dose reduction, subjects received three 20 mg capsules and one 20 mg tablet. All study treatment had to be discontinued if a once-daily dose at the second reduction-dose level was not tolerated Table 6.

All subjects received both tablet and capsule doses (one active, one placebo); as the treatment was double-blinded, both formulation dose-levels were changed when the Investigator determined that a dose reduction was necessary. All study treatment had to be discontinued if a once-daily dose at the second reduction-dose level was not tolerated. Source: Protocol Amendment 4.0 (Appendix 16.1.1.1, Section 6.5.1)

## Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral cabozantinib at a daily dose of 60 mg (in a tablet formulation) compared with 140 mg (in a capsule formulation) in subjects with progressive, metastatic MTC.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoint:

Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al 2009) per independent radiology review

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary efficacy endpoint:

- Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 per independent radiology review

## Additional Endpoints:

· Safety and tolerability of cabozantinib as assessed by AEs including haemorrhage, gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal fistulas, gastrointestinal perforations, hypertension, diarrhoea, oral mucositis/stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthaesia syndrome (PPE), changes in laboratory parameters, and frequency of dose modifications

- Pharmacokinetics (PK) of cabozantinib
- Biochemical response to cabozantinib as assessed by the plasma tumour markers including calcitonin (CTN) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
- Pharmacodynamic effects of cabozantinib on plasma biomarkers of cabozantinib target pathway inhibition and bone turnover (not reported in this CSR)
- Correlation of germline and somatic genetic alterations to tumour response or resistance, cabozantinib exposure, and/or toxicity (not reported in this CSR)

Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study. Placebo was packaged and colour-, size-, and shape-matched such that it was indistinguishable (including imprint on capsules) from cabozantinib. Study treatment assignment was unknown to the subjects, Investigators, study centers, Sponsor, and any contract research organization affiliated with the study (other than those authorized to access treatment assignment for regulatory safety reporting and submission processes, IxRS administration, and drug supply management).

In the event of a medical emergency, the treating physician may have decided that knowledge of dose of study treatment was critical to the subject's management. In such situations, the treating physician could access the treatment information for this subject through the IxRS. If possible, the Investigator was to contact the responsible medical monitor prior to unblinding any subject. The blind was only to be broken for the specific subject in question, and before breaking the blind of an individual subject's study treatment the Investigator was to have determined that the information would alter the subject's immediate management. In the vast majority of cases, AEs were expected to be properly managed without the need for unblinding, especially since it was known that all subjects were receiving cabozantinib. An unblinded notification, including the subject ID, treatment group, and date of unblinding was to be provided to the Investigator and to the chair of the IDMC. A blinded notification that included only the subject ID and the date of unblinding was to be provided to the responsible medical monitor and the Sponsor's Vice President of Drug Safety (or designee).

## Statistical methods

All analyses were conducted using SAS software Version [9.3] or higher ([SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina]). 9.7.1.1.

Analysis Populations and Study Date Definitions

## Intent-to-Treat Population

The ITT population, defined as all randomized subjects, was used for efficacy analyses, with analyses according to the randomized treatment assignment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety Population The Safety population, defined as all subjects who received any amount of study treatment, was used for safety analyses, with analyses according to the actual treatment received.

Per-Protocol Population A Per-Protocol population was not defined or planned for this study.

PK Analysis Population A PK population flag was used to identify records for subjects that had at least one reported plasma PK concentration. A PK analysis eligibility flag was also used to identify records that met basic eligibility requirements for formal analysis (eg, sample met stability requirements, the PK concentration result was not missing, and the PK sample was associated with a planned visit [ie, was not unscheduled or taken during screening]).

Baseline and Study Dates Unless otherwise specified, for efficacy endpoints the last observed measurement prior to or on the date of randomization was considered as the baseline measurement. Exceptions to this rule were efficacy markers such as pharmacogenetics blood samples, biomarker samples, and bone marker samples; for safety endpoints the last observation on or before the date of first dose of study treatment was considered as the baseline measurement. Study Day 1 was defined as the date of randomization to study treatment. The safety observation period was defined as the date of first dose of study treatment to the earliest of the decision to discontinue study treatment + 30 days, consent withdrawn, death, or data cut-off date. 9.7.1.2.

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses

The analyses of the primary endpoint of PFS (PFS-A1 per BIRC and PFS-B1 per Investigator) were prespecified in the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9.1) and are outlined in Table 7. Two additional supportive analyses of PFS (PFS-A2 and PFS-A3) were performed to explore the effect of potentially informative censoring on BIRC assessments.

Progression-Free Survival Per BIRC: Primary Analysis

The primary analysis of duration of PFS (designated PFS-A1 in the SAP) was defined as time from randomization to the earlier of either PD per BIRC per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause.

The primary analysis of PFS was performed using the ITT population and evaluated whether PFS in subjects in the 60 mg cabozantinib arm was noninferior to PFS in subjects in the 140 mg cabozantinib arm. It included radiographic progression events per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the BIRC and deaths. Clinical deterioration was not considered as an event for the analysis of PFS. The primary efficacy analysis was event based and was to be conducted when at least 150 PFS events had been observed.

The recorded date of radiographic progression was the date of the tumour assessment visit at which progression was declared per BIRC per RECIST 1.1. If multiple scan dates were associated with a tumour assessment visit, the earliest assessment date within the set was chosen as the progression date.

Only adequate tumour assessments (ATAs) were considered in the determination of radiographic progression and censoring dates. An ATA was defined as one that resulted in a time point assignment of response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]), stable disease [SD]/non-CR/non-PD, or progression. For PFS, an ATA was based on soft tissue evaluation by CT/MRI.

Single missing or inadequate scheduled tumour assessments were ignored. No values were imputed.

General censoring rules for the primary analysis of PFS were as follows:

· Subjects who received systemic non-protocol anticancer therapy (other than palliative bone radiation) before radiographic PD per BIRC were censored at the date of their most recent postrandomization ATA prior to receipt of such therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subjects missing two or more scheduled ATAs before radiographic PD or death were censored at the date of their most recent post-randomization ATA prior to the missed assessments
- Subjects who had not progressed or expired as of the date of the analysis data cut-off were censored at the date of their most recent post-randomization ATA prior to the data cut-off date
- Subjects without an appropriate post-randomization ATA were censored at the date of randomization

The median duration of PFS and its associated confidence interval (CI) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The stratified and unstratified HR and the associated 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional- hazards model with treatment group as the independent variable. Stratification factors were those that were used for randomization (Section 9.4.3). Noninferiority was to be concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the HR(cabozantinib 60 mg/140 mg) was less than the noninferiority (NI) margin of 1.58.

Progression-Free Survival per the Investigator: Primary Analysis

To demonstrate robustness of the primary analysis of PFS per BIRC, an additional primary analysis of PFS (designated PFS-B1) based on the Investigator assessment of radiographic progression was also performed.

## Progression-Free Survival: Supportive Analyses

To explore the effect of potentially informative censoring on BIRC assessments, two supportive (sensitivity) analyses of PFS (PFS-A2 and PFS-A3) were performed as pre-specified in the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9.1) and are outlined in Table 7. The PFS-A2 and PFS-A3 supportive analyses defined additional clinical outcomes as events.

For PFS-A2 analysis, the following were considered as events:

- Receipt of systemic non-protocol anticancer therapy (NPACT)
- Radiation (other than to bone)
- Surgery impacting soft tissue lesions

For PFS-A3 analysis, the following was considered as an event:

· ≥ two consecutive missing scheduled ATA immediately prior to radiographic progression disease or death A summary of the concordance between the BIRC and Investigator determinations of radiographic PD was also provided.

ATA, adequate tumour assessment; BIRC, blinded independent radiology committee; ITT, intent to treat; NA, not applicable; NPACT, non-protocol anticancer therapy; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression-free survival; rPD, radiographic PD; RT, Radiotherapy; sNPACT, subsequent NPACT. Two or more missed scheduled ATAs are operationally defined as &gt;178 days without an evaluation.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint

Objective Response Rate: Primary Analysis

For each subject, best overall response (BOR) by BIRC per RECIST 1.1 was defined as the best tumour response that occurred prior to any of the censoring events defined for the primary analysis of PFS. Tumour responses were ranked as follows: confirmed CR, confirmed PR, SD, PD, and not evaluable (NE). To be classified as CR or PR, confirmation must have occurred on a subsequent visit ≥ 28 days after the response was first observed. The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects who experienced a BOR of confirmed CR or confirmed PR per RECIST 1.1. The analysis of ORR included all subjects in the ITT population and was based upon evaluations by the BIRC.

## Multiplicity Adjustment

The multiplicity issue resulting from analysis of one primary endpoint of PFS and one secondary endpoint of ORR was addressed by hierarchical testing procedures. The primary analysis of PFS was event-driven and was to be conducted after at least 150 events were observed. The hypothesis for PFS was tested at the twosided 0.05 level of significance (α). If this hypothesis was rejected, then the hypothesis for the secondary endpoint was to be tested at α=0.05.

## Safety Analyses

All safety analyses were performed using the Safety population. Any statistical comparisons between the two treatment arms were to be considered exploratory.

## Determination of Sample Size

For this study the noninferiority (NI) margin was chosen using the fraction-retention method to preserve 50% of the benefit of cabozantinib 140 mg demonstrated versus placebo in prior Phase 3 study XL184-301. In this study the estimated HR for PFS was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.40). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

noninferiority NI margin was based on the upper bound of 95% CI and was calculated as: NI margin = exp[ln(1/0.40)/2] = 1.58 Assuming a randomization ratio of 1:1, a onesided α of 0.025, and an NI margin of 1.58, a sample size of 188 subjects (94 subjects in each arm) was required to provide 80% power to demonstrate that PFS in the 60 mg treatment arm was noninferior to that in the 140 mg treatment arm. The protocol allowed an increase in the sample size up to 250 subjects if a review of the accumulating PFS events suggested that the number required for the event-driven primary analysis was not to be reached (due to censoring) in a reasonable time frame among the approximately 188 subjects originally enrolled.

## Substantive Protocol Amendments

The original protocol dated 24 May 2013, was amended as follows.

## Amendment 1.0

Amendment 1.0 dated 21 March 2014, had the following substantive changes:

· The NI margin was changed to 1.58 based on retaining at least 50% of the treatment effect of cabozantinib compared to placebo based on the upper 95% CI bound (0.40) of the HR in Study XL184301. The NI margin of 1.89 in the original protocol was based on retaining at least 50% of the treatment effect based on the point estimate of the HR in Study XL184-301. As a result, the recalculated sample size was changed to 188 subjects (previously 112), and the number of events required for the primary efficacy analyses of PFS was increased to 150 (previously 77).

· A new inclusion criterion was added (Inclusion Criterion 2), requiring a fresh tumour sample preferably obtained from the most recently progressed metastatic site within 2 years for subjects without documentation of a RET mutation in their tumour.

- Several eligibility criteria clarifications

· In concordance with new Inclusion Criterion 2, instructions were clarified regarding the collection of tumour tissue samples, specifically for the determination of RET and RAS mutational status.

· A Maintenance Phase was introduced, which subjects were to enter when sufficient data had been collected to adequately evaluate all study endpoints and upon site notification by the Sponsor. In the Maintenance Phase, subjects were to continue to receive study treatment until they met the protocolrequired criteria for treatment discontinuation. Subjects were to undergo periodic safety assessments (including local laboratory tests) and tumour assessments. The nature and frequency of these assessments were to be performed per standard of care. It was to be the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that subject visits occurred frequently enough and adequate assessments were performed to ensure that subject safety was adequately monitored. The Sponsor was to only collect SAEs and drug accountability data. SAE reporting (including pregnancy and overdose with sequelae) was to continue per protocol. The data collected from the Maintenance Phase are not included in this CSR.

## Amendment 2.0

Amendment 2.0 dated 08 August 2014, had the following substantive changes:

· Stratification of randomization by M918T RET mutational status (positive, negative, unknown) replaced stratification by age and sex; M918T RET mutational status was deemed a more important prognostic factor. Furthermore, the M918T RET unknown stratum would be limited to at most 10% subjects and include only subjects who underwent a tumour biopsy for the purpose of enrolling in the study but analysis of the tumour sample for RET mutation status failed, a replacement sample was not available, and repeat biopsy was not feasible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Eligibility criteria modifications: o Inclusion Criterion 2a: For subjects lacking prior documented evidence of a RET mutation, a tumour sample taken within 6 months (2 years in Protocol Amendment 1.0) was required. If none was available, a fresh biopsy during screening was required. o Inclusion Criterion 2b: For subjects with Sponsor-approved prior documentation of a RET mutation, no tumour sample was required for eligibility.

· The text allowing Sponsor discretion in changing the frequency or discontinuing collection of PK and biomarker samples during the study was removed for the purpose of clarifying the time points for collection of PK and biomarker samples; The text was clarified that cabozantinib plasma concentration would (previously 'might' in Protocol Amendment 1) also be used to explore the relationship of exposure and clinical safety parameters (eg, selected AEs) or clinical response.

## Amendment 3.0

Amendment 3.0 dated 01 September 2015, had the following substantive changes:

· To ensure that all PFS events (PD or death) were captured, a requirement to follow subjects for survival and subsequent anticancer therapy every 12 weeks after the 30-day Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit was added.

· Eligibility criteria modifications: o Inclusion Criteria 2a and 2b: The criteria were modified to account for the identification of RAS mutations in tumour samples. As RAS and RET mutations are considered mutually exclusive, documented evidence of a RAS mutation was considered sufficient to assign a subject to the M918T RET negative stratum without acquiring or analysing additional tumour samples.

· The restrictions for taking various stomach acid modifying agents were removed to align with the latest PK and safety information on cabozantinib.

## Amendment 4.0

Amendment 4.0 (Appendix 16.1.1.1) dated 14 June 2018, had the following substantive changes:

· Study treatment discontinuation criteria were modified to allow subjects to continue on study treatment upon Investigator-determined PD per RECIST 1.1 if the Investigator believed that the subject was still receiving clinical benefit with cabozantinib treatment that outweighed the risk. Subjects were required to discontinue study treatment upon Investigator-determined PD per RECIST 1.1 in prior versions of the protocol.

· The radiographic tumour assessment period was updated accordingly to accommodate subjects who continued to receive study treatment beyond Investigator-determined PD per RECIST 1.1. The radiographic tumour assessment period was extended (and scans submitted to the BIRC) to the later (previously the earlier) of 12 weeks after the initial PD per RECIST 1.1 per Investigator or the date of the decision to permanently discontinue study treatment. However, radiographic tumour assessments were to be discontinued if subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, radiation therapy or surgery affecting tumour lesion(s) was initiated prior to meeting these criteria.

· The sample size of the study was permitted to be increased to up to 250 subjects, from the originally planned approximately 188 subjects, to ensure that the number of the accumulating PFS events (≥ 150) required for the primary efficacy analysis was satisfied. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis was not modified.

· For subjects who discontinued study treatment in the Maintenance Phase a Post Treatment Follow-up Visit was required (previously it was at the discretion of the Investigator).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· The description of study treatment in the Maintenance Phase was updated to clarify that subjects were to continue to receive their study treatment in an unblinded fashion according to their assigned treatment arm (dose and formulation), and no placebo was to be provided.

## Changes to the Planned Analyses

Changes from the original SAP are shown below. All revisions to the SAP occurred before database lock. Version 2.0 contained the following key changes: All efficacy analyses were to be presented with regard to stratification factors based on IxRS and CRF Per protocol population was deleted as analyses by ITT population were deemed more robust. Baseline biomarkers were defined with regard to first dose date as samples were collected prior to first dose date and not prior to randomization. Definition of safety observation period was added. Summaries for demographic and baseline characteristics were refined to remove baseline laboratory characteristics. Summaries for cancer history and disease status were refined to include cancer staging, CTN, and CEA. Summaries for treatments, medications, surgeries/procedures were refined to include systemic therapy by special categories, prior radiation therapy, and prior surgeries/procedures. Exposure summary were to be presented in months instead of weeks PFS per BIRC analysis time computation in months was added. Censoring rules for analysis of PFS were updated to include censoring due to radiation (other than to bone) and surgery to soft tissue. In addition, additional PFS censoring rules per EMA were added. Clarification was added to the definition of ORR. Subgroup categories were refined to include receipt and number of prior systemic non-radiation anticancer therapy due to MTC and to remove receipt of prior vandetanib. AE summaries were refined. Sponsor-defined grades for LDH were added. Summaries for liver function abnormalities and renal failure screening criteria, and updated eGFR calculated were added. Clarification was added to include all QTcF measurements at a time point if more than 3 measurements are done.

## 7.2. Results

The first subject was enrolled on 25 February 2015, the last was enrolled on 02 June 2020, and the data collection cut-off date was 15 July 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARSCoV-2 a pandemic on 11 March 2020, nearly four months prior to the clinical cut-off date for this study. In response to the evolving circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, study memoranda were released to clinical study sites to provide ongoing guidance to Investigators on study conduct to protect subject safety and maintain scientific integrity of the study. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trial conduct, data collection, and the study population was low. Pandemic consequences did not meaningfully influence study interpretation.

Figure 8: Study XL184-401: Flow Chart of Subject Disposition (ITT Population)

<!-- image -->

AE, adverse event; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; Cabo, cabozantinib; ITT, intent to treat; PD, progressive disease; SAE, serious adverse event.

Note :  Reasons for screen failure are provided in XL184-401 CSR, Table 9

- a   Includes 19 subjects who were screened multiple times, met the eligibility criteria, and were subsequently enrolled in the study
- b   This study was fully enrolled and closed to enrollment prior to the clinical database cut-off date of 15 July 2020
- c   Excluding events due to disease progression
- d   Two subjects (one in each arm) were summarized as having non-PD AEs (regardless of causality) leading to study treatment discontinuation: 1 Subject (decubitus ulcer, Grade 2, treatment not related) in the 60-mg arm and 1 Subject (AST increased, Grade 1, treatment related) in the 140-mg arm. They were not included on this flow chart as both subjects discontinued study treatment due to an AE after the CSR data cut-off date.
- e   Including Grade 5 AEs
- f   Clinical deterioration comprises AEs or SAEs related to disease progression
- g    Subject was treated with study drug beyond progressive disease, which was not permitted under Protocol Amendment 3. The subsequent protocol amendment allowed treatment beyond disease progression if subjects were eligible.

## Outcomes and estimation

The prespecified primary analysis of PFS per BIRC (PFS-A1) was triggered by the required number of at least 150 events occurring in the ITT population. The data cut-off date for this event-driven analysis was 15 July 2020, and a total of 155 events were reported by this date. The minimum time of followup (from the date of randomization of the last subject through 15 July 2020) was 1.4 months. The median time of follow-up (from the date of randomization of the first subject through 15 July 2020) was 30.2 months. Only PFS events determined by the BIRC per RECIST 1.1 were included. Subjects who had not experienced an event by this date were censored.

A higher proportion of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm experienced disease progression compared with that in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (55% vs 45%, respectively). A similar percentage of deaths occurred in each arm (12% vs 13%, respectively).

The primary endpoint analysis demonstrated that PFS per BIRC did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion for the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the cabozantinib 140-mg arm; the HR adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS) was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.70) with the stratified log-rank p-value of 0.1916. The upper bound of 95% CI of 1.70 was higher than the prespecified NI margin of 1.58.

The Kaplan-Meier estimate for median duration of PFS was 11.0 months in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm vs 13.9 months in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm, an estimated 2.9-month difference in the medians. The landmark estimate of the proportion of subjects event-free at 12 months was 42.7% in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 52.5% in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (Figure 9 and Table 10).

## Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per Investigator

Corresponding results for the PFS analysis per the Investigator (PFS-B1) were similar to the primary efficacy analyses per BIRC: the HR adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS) was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.59; stratified log-rank p-value 0.3814). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for median duration of PFS were 11.8 months in the 60 mg treatment arm versus 13.8 months in the 140 mg treatment arm, an estimated 2.0-month difference in the medians. The landmark estimate of the proportion of subjects event free at 12 months was 49.5% in the 60-mg arm compared with 54.9% in the 140-mg arm.

## Progression-Free Survival: Sensitivity Analyses

In addition, prespecified sensitivity analyses per BIRC in which additional clinical outcomes were considered to be events showed similar results compared with those of the primary PFS analysis (Table 11).

Progression-Free Survival: Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses were not powered to detect a treatment difference in this noninferiority study, and all summaries are descriptive.

Secondary Endpoint: Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, results for the prespecified secondary efficacy endpoint of ORR per BIRC are descriptive.

The analysis of BIRC-determined ORR per RECIST 1.1 was conducted in the ITT population at the time of the primary analysis of PFS and with the same data cut-off date of 15 July 2020. Tumour assessments that occurred after the individual subject PFS-censoring dates were excluded from this analysis.

The ORR per BIRC was similar in both treatment arms: 41 (33%) subjects in the 60-mg arm and 41 (33%) subjects in the 140-mg arm. One subject had a CR in the 60-mg arm and two subjects in the 140-mg arm, all other responses were PRs (Table 12). In addition, there was a high rate of stable disease as best overall response in each arm (60 mg 47%, 140 mg 52%). The incidence of PD as best overall response was approximately 11% and 9%, respectively.

The stratified odds ratio per IxRS in the 60-mg arm vs 140-mg arm was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.7). The unstratified odds ratio was similar to the stratified odds ratio per IxRS.

## Biomarkers Calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen

Calcitonin (CTN) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were the plasma tumour markers evaluated in this study. The median (range) CTN laboratory value at baseline in the 60-mg arm was higher than that in the 140-mg arm: 1826 (4, 57876) vs 807 pmol/L (4, 48895), respectively. The median CEA laboratory values were similar between treatment arms (approximately 140 μg/L; XL184 401 CSR, Table 14.3.4.5.1).

The rate of increase of CTN and CEA levels are strongly correlated with tumour burden (Laure Giraudet et al 2008). In the current study, plasma samples for bone marker analyses and blood serum samples for analysis of CTN and CEA levels by central laboratory were collected pre-dose on W1D1 and then every 4 weeks through W13D1. The blood samples for CTN and CEA analyses were further collected every 12 weeks thereafter corresponding with tumour assessments.

Among subjects with at least one baseline and post-baseline assessment, 97% of subjects in each arm had a ≥ 30% post-baseline decrease in plasma CTN. For CEA, 74% of subjects in the 60-mg arm and 80% in the 140mg arm had a ≥ 30% post -baseline decrease in plasma CEA (XL184 401 CSR, Section 11.4.3.3).

## Exploratory Analysis: Overall Survival

The analysis of OS in Study XL184-401 was a post hoc analysis and was not a prespecified study endpoint. Per protocol, information on survival status was collected until the subject's final PFS status was determined. Sites were required to contact or determine the survival status of all study subjects through the database cut-off date of 15 July 2020. Survival status for subjects was determined for 238 of the 247 subjects. Eight subjects (60 mg: 5; 140 mg: 3) withdrew consent including for survival follow-up and were censored at their date of withdrawal of consent in the OS analysis. One subject in the 140-mg arm was lost to follow-up and censored at the date the subject was last known alive. Of note, 19 subjects (60 mg: 13; 140 mg: 6) had death dates available from public record. All other subjects who were not deceased through 15 July 2020 were documented to be alive (and were censored) on this date.

The OS analysis demonstrated a trend for longer duration of OS for subjects in the 140-mg arm (Table 13) the HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS), was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.63). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Kaplan-Meier estimates for median duration of OS were 29.4 months in the 60-mg arm versus 33.0 months in the 140-mg arm, an estimated 3.6 month difference in the medians.

The landmark estimate of the proportion of subjects alive at 12 months was 74% in the 60-mg arm compared with 78% in the 140-mg arm.

Results for the unstratified analysis (XL184-401 CSR, Table 14.2.5.1) were similar to those for the stratified analysis per IxRS. Results for the stratified analysis per CRF were similar to those for the stratified analysis per IxRS.

## RET M918T Mutation Efficacy Subgroup Analyses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup analyses were not powered to detect a treatment difference in this noninferiority study, and all summaries are descriptive. The analyses of the additional endpoint of PFS, ORR plus DOR, and OS in RET M918T positive and negative subgroups are presented below. Due to the small number of subjects with RET M918T unknown status (n=15) enrolled on study, the results of efficacy analyses for this subgroup are difficult to interpret and will not be discussed in the following sections; data are provided in in-text tables. The analysis of efficacy for RAS mutation subgroups is not summarized in this report, neither for subgroups with other mutations in RET. The analysis of efficacy in other demographic and baseline characteristic subgroups is presented in Section 11.4.4.8.

## Progression-Free Survival in RET M918T Mutation Subgroups (BIRC-Determined, ITT Population)

The analysis of PFS by RET M918T mutation status per BIRC per IxRS was conducted to assess the potential for differing efficacy results among RET M918T positive and negative subgroups and is summarised in Table 16 and depicted in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of PFS for the RET M918T positive subgroup was 8.6 months in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with 10.7 months in the 140-mg arm, with an HR of 1.38 (95% CI: 0.90, 2.12). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of PFS for the RET M918T negative subgroup was 11.1 months in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with 16.6 months in the 140-mg arm, with an HR of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.03).

Objective Response Rate and Duration of Response in RET M918T Mutation Subgroups (BIRCDetermined, ITT Population)

The analysis of ORR by RET M918T mutation status per IxRS was conducted to assess the potential for differing efficacy results among RET M918T positive and negative subgroups and is summarized in Table 14. The ORR per BIRC for the RET M918T positive subgroup in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 140-mg arm was 30% and 25%, respectively, with an odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI: 0.62, 2.88). The ORR per BIRC for the RET M918T negative subgroup in the respective arms was 34% and 45%, with an odds ratio of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.40).

The RET M918T mutation status was determined by central laboratory or by local laboratory (with Sponsor approval of report) and was available before randomization. The analysis was based on subject's RET M918T mutation status per IxRS at randomization. A total of 15 subjects (7 in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 8 in the 140-mg arm) had unknown RET M918T mutation status.

## 7.3. Discussion

The blinded dose composition for 140 mg (Active Capsules and Placebo Tablets) and 60 mg (Active Tablets and Placebo Capsules) intents to objectively compare the 140 mg dose with the 60 mg dose level . For Cabometyx 60 mg dose reductions were needed for 59.8% of the patients (EMA/664123/2016). As the majority of the patients need dose reductions the actually compared dose levels differ from the intended dose level at the start of study. Dose levels are also discussed in the safety section below. The lowest dose level of cabozantinib received in the 60-mg arm (excluding dose interruptions) was generally evenly distributed between the three protocol-defined dose levels: 31% of subjects received cabozantinib 60 mg as their lowest dose, 32% received 40 mg, and 37% received 20 mg. However, in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm, 19% of subjects received cabozantinib 140 mg as the lowest dose level (excluding dose interruptions), 29% received 100 mg, and 52% received 60 mg. This means that as only two dose reductions were allowed for each starting dose level a skewed distribution occurred, likely to maintain patients on study.

In the original version of the protocol the non-inferiority (NI) margin was based on the point estimate 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.40) of the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS from the study XL184-301. Per FDA review the NI margin was changed based on the upper 95% confidence limit (0.40), of the point estimate for the HR for PFS. This resulted in an increase of the sample size from 112 to 188 and an increase in the events from 77 to 150 for the analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint.

The prespecified primary analysis of PFS per BIRC (PFS-A1) was triggered by the required number of at least 150 events occurring in the ITT population. The data cut-off date for this event-driven analysis was 15 July 2020, and a total of 155 events were reported by this date. For the study the NI margin was chosen using the fraction-retention method to preserve 50% of the benefit of cabozantinib 140 mg demonstrated versus placebo in prior Phase 3 study XL184-301. In this study the estimated HR for PFS was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.40). The noninferiority NI margin was based on the upper bound of 95% CI and was calculated as: NI margin = exp[ln(1/0.40)/2] = 1.58. The primary endpoint analysis demonstrated that PFS per BIRC did not meet the prespecified non-inferiority criterion for the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the cabozantinib 140-mg arm; the HR adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS) was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.70) with the stratified log-rank p-value of 0.1916. The upper bound of 95% CI of 1.70 was higher than the prespecified NI margin of 1.58.

The baseline and demographic characteristics were similar in each treatment arm.

As the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, all summaries for the prespecified secondary efficacy endpoint of ORR per BIRC were descriptive. Subgroup analyses were not powered to detect a treatment difference in this noninferiority study, and all summaries are descriptive. However, part of the SOB discussed in this assessment report concerns evaluation for RET and RAS mutations. As the MAH proposed to fulfil the obligation, the results on the RET and RAS mutation are discussed.

Overall survival was not a prespecified endpoint in this study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for median duration of OS was 29.4 months in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm vs 33.0 months in the 140-mg arm, an estimated 3.6-month difference in the medians. The HR, adjusted for stratification factors (per IxRS), was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.63). The landmark estimate of the proportion of subjects alive at 12 months was 73.9% in the 60-mg arm compared with 78.1% in the 140-mg arm. Of note, the OS analysis performed in this study was not powered to detect a treatment difference.

The RET M918T mutation status was determined for 90% of subjects in Study XL184-401. The analyses of PFS per BIRC in the RET M918T positive and negative subgroups per IxRS were conducted to assess the potential for differing efficacy results in these subgroups. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median duration of PFS were 8.6 months in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 10.7 months in the 140-mg arm for the RET M918T positive group, and 11.1 months and 16.6 months, respectively, for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the RET M918T negative group. In conclusion, efficacy of cabozantinib at the starting dose of 140 mg is observed in both RET M918T positive and RET M918T negative mutation status subjects as demonstrated by PFS, ORR, duration of response and OS. The concern of a possible lower benefit of cabozantinib in subjects with a negative or an unknown mutation status was not confirmed.

Subgroup analyses for PFS per BIRC per IxRS for demographic and other baseline characteristics generally showed lower or similar median duration of PFS in the 60-mg arm relative to the 140-mg arm with the exception of a limited number of subgroups with few subjects (n ≤ 31). In summary, the efficacy for the primary endpoint PFS analyses of a cabozantinib 60-mg regimen (as tablets) did not meet the pre-specified noninferiority threshold relative to the approved cabozantinib 140-mg regimen (as capsules).

For the additional tumour marker endpoint, a simila r proportion of subjects (97%) in each arm had a ≥ 30% post-baseline reduction in plasma CTN, and 74% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 80% in the 140mg arm had a ≥ 30% post -baseline decrease in plasma CEA.

The median duration of exposure (including dose interruptions) was 11.1 months in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 10.1 months in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (Table 19). The median daily dose was 38.7 mg in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 73.4 mg in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm; the corresponding median dose intensities were 64.5% and 52.4%, respectively. A total of 29% of subjects in the 60-mg arm remained on treatment as of the data cut-off date compared with 33% of subjects in the 140-mg arm.

## Study Drug Dose Reductions Due to Adverse Events

A total of 69% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm had a dose reduction due to an AE compared with 81% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (Table 20). Approximately 67% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 73% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm had a first dose level reduction due to an AE, and 37% and 52%, respectively, had a second dose level reduction due to an AE. As allowed per the protocol, four subjects in the 60-mg arm re-escalated study treatment from 20 mg to 40 mg, and one subject in the 140-mg arm re-escalated from 60 mg to 100 mg.

The median time to first dose level reduction due to an AE was 59 days in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 49 days in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm; the median time to a second dose level reduction due to an AE was 131.5 and 99.0 days, respectively.

As a consequence of dose reductions, the lowest dose level of cabozantinib received in the 60-mg arm (excluding dose interruptions) was generally evenly distributed between the three protocol-defined dose levels: 31% of subjects received cabozantinib 60 mg as their lowest dose, 32% received 40 mg, and 37% received 20 mg. The median time on treatment (excluding dose interruptions) for the three respective dose levels was 63.0, 100.0, and 134.5 days.

In the cabozantinib 140-mg arm, 19% of subjects received cabozantinib 140 mg as the lowest dose level (excluding dose interruptions), 29% received 100 mg, and 52% received 60 mg. The median time on treatment (excluding dose interruptions) for the three respective dose levels was 30.0, 56.5, and 182.0 days. These data reflect the use of dose modifications to manage AEs and adjust the dose to the level of individual subject tolerance.

AE, adverse event.

The terms 'interruption' and 'hold' are used interchangeably, and no difference in meaning is implied.

Any subject who had multiple dose interruptions due to different reasons was counted once.

a  Only subjects who had a first dose interruption due to an AE were included.

b  Included dosing records for which the prior interval ended due to AE. Excluded dosing records for which the prior interval ended due to subject noncompliance other than AE or site error or other.

c A total of 13 subjects on study had cabozantinib dose reduced directly to the second dose reduction level (ie, without receiving first dose reduction level) per Investigator: 3 subjects in the 60-mg arm and 10 subjects in the 140-mg arm.

d  At the time of this data cut-off for the CSR, there was an error in the clinical database. One subject in the 140mg arm was recorded as not having received the randomized dose; however, per the IRT and site confirmation, the subject actually received cabozantinib 140 mg as the initial dose.

e  Only subjects who had a first dose reduction due to an AE were considered.

f  Only subjects who had a second dose reduction due to an AE were considered.

g  Only subjects who had a dose modification (reduction or interruption) due to an AE were considered

h  One subject in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm received a nonprotocol-defined dose of cabozantinib 20 mg (tablets) (instead of a dose reduction level of 60 mg [capsules]) for 34 days due to incorrect dispensing at the site (Section 10.2). No SAE was reported due to this deviation.

AE, adverse event (only treatment-emergent events are summarized); MedDRA, Medical Dictionary for

Regulatory Activities; PD, progressive disease; SAE, serious adverse event.

Subjects are counted only once in each category but may be counted in multiple categories.

Events are recorded with onset date through the end of the safety observation period (earliest of decision to discontinue study treatment + 30 days, consent withdrawn, death, or data cut-off date) unless otherwise stated (ie, 'at any time').

a  Grade 5 AEs judged not to be causally related to PD.

- b  A total of five additional subjects (one cabozantinib 60 mg, four cabozantinib 140 mg) had Grade 5 AEs that were reported outside of the safety observation period. The preferred terms for these events in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm were metastases to liver (1 Subject). The preferred terms for these events in the cabozantinib 140mg arm were MTC (3 Subjects) and general physical health deterioration (1 Subject).
- c  Subjects could be assessed as having more than one AE that led to treatment discontinuation with differing causalities. As a result, the total proportion of subjects with an AE leading to treatment discontinuation may not necessarily equal the sum of the related and not related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation for a given treatment arm.

In XL184-401 CSR Table 45, two subjects (one cabozantinib 60 mg and one cabozantinib 140 mg) were summarized as discontinuing study treatment due to AE who were not summarized as having AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (not related to PD) in this table: 1 Subject (decubitus ulcer, Grade 2, treatment not related) in the 60-mg arm and 1 Subject (AST increased, Grade 1, treatment related) in the 140 mg arm.

Table 22. The overall incidence of AEs was 99% in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 100% in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm.

The most frequent AEs (≥ 20% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE), decreased appetite, fatigue, weight decreased, ALT increased, AST increased, asthenia, hypocalcemia, dysgeusia, hypertension, nausea, mucosal inflammation, and abdominal pain.

The most frequent AEs (≥ 20% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib 140 -mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, PPE, weight decreased, fatigue, decreased appetite, hypertension, nausea, AST increased, mucosal inflammation, hypocalcemia, ALT increased, asthenia, vomiting, stomatitis, hypomagnesemia, and abdominal pain.

AE, adverse event; PPES, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome.

Denominators for percentages are N, the total number of subjects in each treatment arm.

Preferred terms were ordered by descending frequency of all grades in the cabozantinib 140 mg arm.

At each level of subject summarization, a subject was counted once for the most severe event if the subject reported one or more events.

Adverse events (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% lower incidence in the cabozantinib 60 -mg arm compared with the 140-mg arm by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were weight decreased, vomiting, alopecia, hypertension, nausea, mucosal inflammation, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, stomatitis, leukopenia, hypoalbuminemia, general physical health deterioration, anemia, and diarrhea. Conversely, AEs (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% higher incidence in the cabozantinib 60 -mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm compared with the 140-mg arm by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were chest pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, myalgia, and arthralgia.

## Treatment-Related Adverse Events

The overall incidence of related AEs was similar in both arms (60-mg arm 96%; 140-mg arm 97%). The most frequent treatmentrelated AEs (≥ 20% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm in descending order of incidence were diarrhea, PPE, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight decreased, ALT increased, AST increased, asthenia, dysgeusia, mucosal inflammation, and hypocalcemia. The most frequent treatmentrelated AEs (≥ 20% incidence) reported for subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm in descending order of incidence were diarrhea, PPE, weight decreased, fatigue, decreased appetite, hypertension, mucosal inflammation, AST increased, ALT increased, nausea, asthenia, stomatitis, hypocalcemia, and vomiting. Related AEs (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% lower incidence in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with cabozantinib 140-mg by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were weight decreased, hypertension, alopecia, mucosal inflammation, rash, vomiting, hypomagnesemia, nausea, hypokalemia, stomatitis, diarrhea, and blood LDH increased. Conversely, related AEs (all grades) that had a ≥ 5% higher incidence in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with cabozantinib 140-mg by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were myalgia and dry mouth. Treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported for 58% and 69% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg and 140-mg arms, respectively. No treatment-related Grade 5 AEs were reported in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm, and one treatment-related Grade 5 event was reported in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm.

## 8.5. Serious adverse events and deaths

Frequent Grade 3 or 4 AEs are summarized in Table 23. The overall incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs was 63% in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 72% in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs (≥ 5% incidence) in the cabozantinib 60 -mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, fatigue, hypocalcemia, PPE, hypertension, asthenia, weight decreased, γ -glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased, and lipase increased. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs (≥ 5% incidence) in the cabozantinib 140 -mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, weight decreased, PPE, hypertension, hypocalcemia, ALT increased, fatigue, AST increased, asthenia, hypokale mia, and stomatitis. Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had a ≥ 2% lower incidence in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the 140-mg arm by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were diarrhea, weight decreased, ALT increased, AST increased, stomatitis, PPE, vomiting, hypokalemia, hypertension, blood LDH increased, and pain in extremity. Conversely, Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the 140-mg by decreasing frequency of between-arm difference were fatigue, amylase increased, anemia, lipase increased, and tooth infection. The overall incidence of Grade 4 AEs was 12% in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 10% in the cabozantinib 140mg arm. Grade 4 AEs reported for ≥ 1% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60 -mg arm by decreasing frequency were lipase increased (3.3%), hypocalcemia, sepsis, and amylase increased (1.6% each). Grade 4 AEs reported for ≥ 1% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140 -mg arm were hypocalcemia, large intestine perforation, and medullary thyroid cancer (1.6% each).

## Deaths

A total of 110 deaths were reported as of the cut-off date of 15 July 2020: 59 (48%) in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 51 (41%) in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (Table 26). A similar proportion of subjects died through 30 days after last dose of study treatment in each arm: 13 subjects (11%) in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 12 subjects (9.7%) in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. Deaths were attributed to PD for 6 subjects (4.9%) and 3 subjects (2.4%) in the 60-mg arm and the 140-mg arm, respectively, and to other reasons for 7 subjects (5.7%) and 9 subjects (7.3%), respectively. A total of 85 deaths occurred more than 30 days after last dose of study treatment: 46 subjects (37%) in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 39 subjects (31%) in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. The majority of deaths were due to PD (73 out of 85) with numerically more PD occurring in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the 140-mg arm (32% vs 27%, respectively).

## 8.7. Laboratory findings

## Serum Chemistry - Changes Over Time

The post-baseline mean values for the serum chemistry parameters were generally similar between treatment arms with the exception of LDH. The mean LDH value at peak was approximately 190 U/L at Week 5 in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 290 U/L at Week 3 in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. The mean values in both treatment arms then decreased to similar values by Week 9 and remained similar through the course of study. In the cabozantinib 60mg arm, parameters that most frequently (≥ 5% of subjects) showed a ≥ 2 grade shift from &lt; Grade 3 at baseline to ≥ Grade 3 post -baseline were lipase increased (9.8%), LDH increased (8.9%), phosphate decreased (7.3%), potassium decreased (7.3%), GGT increased (7.3%), calcium corrected decreased (6.5%), and amylase increased (5.7%) In the cabozantinib 140-mg arm, parameters that most frequently ( ≥ 5% of subjects) showed a ≥ 2 grade shift from &lt; Grade 3 at baseline to ≥ Grade 3 post -baseline were LDH increased (12.9%), ALT increased (9.7%), potassium decreased (8.1%), AST increased (7.3%), GGT increased (7.3%), lipase increased (7.3%), magnesium decreased (6.5%), and calcium corrected decreased (5.6%).

## Weight

Clinically meaningful losses in body weight (≥ 10% from baseline) at any post -baseline visit occurred in 39% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 60% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm Table 30.

## Studies in Special Populations

Evaluations of PK in renal and hepatic impaired subjects have been presented previously. No further information for studies in special populations is available.

## 8.8. Discussion

The median duration of exposure (including dose interruptions) was numerically higher in the 60-mg arm than in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (11.1 vs 10.1 months). A total of 29% of subjects in the 60mg arm remained on study treatment as of the 15 July 2020 data cut-off compared with 33% of subjects in the 140-mg arm. The median daily dose was 38.7 mg in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 73.4 mg in the 140-mg arm; the corresponding median dose intensities were 64.5% and 52.4%, respectively. The lowest dose level of cabozantinib received in the 60-mg arm (excluding dose interruptions) was generally evenly distributed between the three protocol-defined dose levels: 31% of subjects received cabozantinib 60 mg as their lowest dose, 32% received 40 mg, and 37% received 20 mg. In the cabozantinib 140-mg arm, 19% of subjects received cabozantinib 140 mg as the lowest dose level (excluding dose interruptions), 29% received 100 mg, and 52% received 60 mg. Regardless of the starting dose level reductions were necessary.

Dose reductions due to an AE occurred in 69% of subjects in the 60-mg treatment arm and 81% of subjects in the 140-mg treatment arm. Median time to first dose level reduction due to an AE was 59 days in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 49 days in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. The median time to a second dose level reduction due to an AE was 131.5 and 99.0 days, respectively. Dose interruptions due to an AE occurred in 75% and 91% of subjects in the 60-mg and 140-mg treatment arms, respectively.

The median time to the first dose interruption was longer in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared to the 140-mg arm (54 vs 29 days). The median time to the second dose interruption was similar (103.5 and 99.5 days). Dose modifications (dose reductions or interruptions) due to an AE occurred in 86% and 96% of subjects, respectively.

Almost all patients experienced an AE regardless of causality. AE reported for ≥ 20% of subjects in the 60-mg treatment arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, PPE, decreased appetite, fatigue, weight decreased, ALT increased, AST increased, asthenia, hypocalcemia, dysgeusia, hypertension, nausea, mucosal inflammation, and abdominal pain. Adverse events reported for ≥ 20% of subjects in the 140 -mg treatment arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, PPE, weight decreased, fatigue, decreased appetite, hypertension, nausea, AST increased, mucosal inflammation, hypocalcemia, ALT increased, asthenia, vomiting, stomatitis, hypomagnesemia, and abdominal pain.

Grade 3 or 4 events regardless of causality were reported for 63% of subjects in the 60-mg arm and 72% in the 140mg treatment arm. Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported for ≥ 5% of subjects in the 60 -mg treatment arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, fatigue, hypocalcemia, PPE, hypertension,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

asthenia, weight decreased, GGT increased, and lipase increased. Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported for ≥ 5% of subjects in the 140-mg treatment arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, weight decreased, PPE, hypertension, hypocalcemia, ALT increased, fatigue, AST increased, asthenia, hypokalemia, and stomatitis.

The number of deaths observed through the 15 July 2020 data cut-off was 59 (48%) in the cabozantinib 60-mg treatment arm and 51 (41%) in the 140-mg arm. Deaths through 30 days after the last dose occurred in 13 subjects (11%) in the 60-mg arm and 12 subjects (9.7%) in the 140-mg arm.

The subject incidence of SAEs regardless of causality was similar (45% in the 60-mg treatment arm and 50% in the 140-mg treatment arm).

The most frequent AEs leading to dose reductions (≥ 10% inciden ce) in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea and PPE. The most frequent AEs leading to dose reductions (≥ 10% incidence) in the 140-mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, PPE, and weight decreased. The most frequent AEs le ading to dose interruptions (≥ 10% incidence) in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, PPE, and fatigue.

Adverse events (all grades) leading to treatment discontinuation regardless of causality (excluding AEs of disease progression) was reported for 23% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 36% of subjects in the 140-mg arm. Treatment-related AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment were lower in the 60-mg arm compared to the 140-mg arm (14% vs 28%).

The most frequent treatmentrelated AE that led to discontinuation of study treatment (≥ 2% incidence) was diarrhea in the 60-mg arm. The most frequent treatment-related AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment (≥ 2% incidence) by decreasing frequency were diarrhea, fatigue, and PPE in the 140-mg arm.

An additional endpoint in this study was the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib as assessed by AEs including hemorrhage, GI and non-GI fistulas, GI perforations, hypertension, diarrhea, oral mucositis/stomatitis, PPE, changes in laboratory parameters, and frequency of dose modifications. In general, lower incidences were observed in the 60-mg arm relative to the 140-mg arm for the majority of the parameters of the additional safety endpoint.

Most of the treatment-emergent serum chemistry abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 2 severity in both treatment arms. In total 45 subjects (37%) in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 46 subjects (37%) in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm had normal TSH and FT4 levels at baseline. Of these subjects, 2 in the 60-mg arm and 5 in the 140-mg arm had post-baseline increased TSH with normal FT4. Hypothyroidism as an AE was reported in 15% of subjects in the 60-mg arm and 12% of subjects in the 140mg arm. No ≥ Grad e 3 events of hypothyroidism were reported in either arm.

Most of the treatment-emergent hematology abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 2 severity in both treatment arms. The most frequent (≥ 40% incidence) treatment -emergent hematology abnormalities (all grades) reported in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm by decreasing frequency were WBC decreased and platelets decreased. The most frequent (≥ 40% incidence) treatment emergent hematology abnormalities (all grades) reported in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm by decreasing frequency were WBC decreased, ANC decreased, and platelets decreased.

The incidence of treatment-emergent Joint National Committee Stage 2 increases in blood pressure was 12% in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 10% in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. The PT of hypertension was reported for 20% of subjects in the 60-mg arm and 34% of subjects in the 140-mg arm; Grade 3 hypertension was reported for 7.3% and 10% of subjects, respectively. No ≥ Grade 4 PT of hypertension was reported in either treatment arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Weight loss of ≥ 10% from baseline at any post -baseline visit was recorded for 39% of subjects in the 60-mg arm and 60% in the 140-mg treatment arm. The incidence of the corresponding AE of weight decreased for any grade in the 60-mg and 140-mg arms was 31% and 52%, respectively (Grade 3 events: 5.7% and 13%, respectively). No ≥ Grade 4 events of weight decreased were reported in either treatment arm.

Over the course of the study, a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment arm (58%) had an increase in ECOG PS of ≥ 1 from baseline. Approximately 15% and 17% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg and 140mg arms, respectively, had an increase in ECOG PS of ≥ 2. Of note, subjects in the 60-mg treatment arm had a relatively longer duration of exposure to study treatment (approximately one-month difference).

## 9. Overall conclusion

The primary endpoint analysis demonstrated that PFS per BIRC did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion for the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the cabozantinib 140-mg arm in Study XL184-401. The concern of a possible lower benefit of cabozantinib in subjects with a negative or an unknown mutation status was not confirmed, however the subgroup analyses was not powered to detect differences. The recommended posology for Cometriq remains unchanged. The specific obligation has been fulfilled. A conversion of the conditional marketing authorisation to a full marketing authorisation can be granted. No new safety signals have been identified.

The benefit-risk balance of Cometriq, remains positive.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 13. Request for supplementary information

## 13.1. Major objections

## Indication

1. No warning has been found in SmPC section 4.4 for patients in whom rearranged during transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is negative. Therefore., please remove the cross reference to section 4.4 from section 4.1.

## 13.2. Other concerns

## Clinical pharmacokinetics

2. The applicant is requested to provide summary statistics per dose level and study visit. Also, samples were collected pre-dose and 8 hours after dosing. It is unclear whether the pre-dose samples have been included in the current table. Therefore, the applicant is requested to provide the summary statistics stratified for the pre-dose and 8 hour post-dose observations.
3. The applicant should perform a statistical evaluation of plasma exposure (on a continuous scale and assuming a log-normal distribution for plasma exposure) versus the different endpoints. An approach as described by Holford et al. 2013, CPT PSP would be the preferred approach. Depending on the results of this analysis, the applicant should discuss whether therapeutic drug monitoring could be more appropriate for this population.
4. No trends can be observed for PFS in the exposure-response analysis, which is inconsistent with the lower efficacy observed in the 60 mg QD arm as compared to the 140 mg QD arm in trial XL184-401. If a difference between the 60 mg QD and 140 mg QD exists, then this should also be reflected in the exposure-response analysis for PFS. This should be clarified by the applicant.

## Clinical aspects

5. The MAH is asked to provide further justification for the change in the NI margin, this should include the FDA review which lead to the modification of the NI margin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6. The Applicant is asked to perform the analysis at 77 events from the first 112 patients as initially proposed and provide the results which would have been obtained with the initial NI margin.
7. The Applicant is asked to provide an overview Table per treatment arm with the specific reasons for censoring. The applicant is asked to provide the number of participants who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event and had no further assessments.
8. A sensitivity analysis and discussion of the MAH to assess the impact of participants who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event and had no further assessments is requested. Information on survival outcomes for these patients are also requested where available.
9. Part of the SOB is the assessment of the M918T mutation status. The Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in the SmPC are not considered to be complete. The number of patients remaining on study over time are missing. The applicant is asked to update Figure 2 KaplanMeier curve of overall survival and Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS among subjects with a RET M918T mutation by including the number of patients remaining on study over time.

## RMP aspects

## Question 2

The applicant is requested to provide summary statistics per dose level and study visit. Also, samples were collected pre-dose and 8 hours after dosing. It is unclear whether the pre-dose samples have been included in the current table. Therefore, the applicant is requested to provide the summary statistics stratified for the pre-dose and 8 hour post-dose observations.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The Applicant wants to clarify that there were no pre-dose PK samples. Patients were instructed to take their cabozantinib dose every day at the same time 2 hours after the evening meal before going to bed (section 9.4.5, CSR study XL184-401). PK samples were collected the next morning at least 8 hours after the previous dose of cabozantinib at Week 3 Day 1 (W3D1 or Study Day 15), Week 5 Day 1 (W5D1 or Study Day 29), Week 9 Day 1 (W9D1 or Study Day 57) Week 13 Day 1 (W13D1 or Study Day 85) and Week 25 Day 1 (W25D1 or Study Day 169).

As requested, Table 1 provides the summary statistics for cabozantinib plasma concentrations per dose level and study visit by treatment arm (Tablet 60 mg versus Capsule 140 mg) for the PK population. In both arms groups, patients received a starting dose of either 140 mg or 60 mg. Investigators were instructed to manage adverse drug reactions using dose holds and dose reductions at any time depending on the occurrence and severity of the adverse drug reactions (and thus independently of the planned date of blood samples for PK measurements). In the Tablet 60 mg group, the first level of dose reduction was 40 mg and the second was 20 mg. In the Capsule 140 mg group, the dose reduction levels were 100 mg and 60 mg. The dose modifications were very frequent and occurred in both groups, which makes the interpretation of the data in Table 1 difficult.

A total of 69% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm had a dose reduction due to AEs compared with 81% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm (Table 42, CSR study XL184- 401). Approximately 67% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 73% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm had a first dose level reduction due to an AE, and 37% and 52%, respectively, had a second dose level reduction due to an AE. As allowed per the protocol, 4 subjects in the 60-mg arm re-escalated study treatment from 20 mg to 40 mg, and 1 subject in the 140-mg arm re-escalated from 60 mg to 100 mg. In addition, 75% of subjects in the cabozantinib 60-mg arm and 91% of subjects in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm had at least one dose interruption due to an AE and the median number of dose holds for a given subject was 3. These data reflect the use of dose modifications to manage AEs and adjust the dose to the level of individual subject tolerance. Table 1 presents data by dose group with the actual dose taken by the patients on the day before the plasma sample. The long half-life of cabozantinib (120 hours) has an impact on the cabozantinib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations following dose reductions or dose holds, which causes a slow decline in circulating concentrations. For example, patients in the 0 mg dose level may still have quantifiable cabozantinib concentrations reflecting cabozantinib intake before a dose hold, due to the long half-life of cabozantinib. Therefore, given the number of doses holds and dose reductions, it is difficult to draw any conclusion from Table 1.

To eliminate the effect of dose modifications on the cabozantinib concentrations, the Applicant provides cabozantinib concentrations with PK visits prior to any cabozantinib dose interruptions or reductions. Summary statistics for the 60-mg/day tablet and 140-mg/day capsule arm concentrations by visit are presented in Table 2.

For subjects who received the 60 mg tablet dose plasma cabozantinib concentrations were generally in the same range up to W13D1. At W25D1, at a time point with only 19 patients, the arithmetic mean concentration value is lower than that observed for previous study visits, however the difference was within their respective CV% across PK timepoints (range, 41.3% to 53.0%). For subjects who received the 140-mg/capsule dose, the plasma cabozantinib concentrations were in the same range up to W5D1. At later time points the numbers of subjects is small (as more patients had dose modifications) with only 28, 19 and 5 subjects at W9D1, W13D1 and W25D1 respectively, limiting the interpretation of the values (Table 2). At the 140-mg/capsule dose, mean plasma concentrations showed greater fluctuations between PK timepoints compared with the 60-mg/tablet dose level.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The requested summary statistics per dose level and study visit have been provided. No pre-dose sample have been collected. Due to AEs in both the 60 mg and 140 mg dose group, a majority of the patients needed a dose reduction. A decrease in plasma concentrations can be observed over time for both the 60 mg and 140 mg dose groups, due to dose reductions.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 3

The applicant should perform a statistical evaluation of plasma exposure (on a continuous scale and assuming a log-normal distribution for plasma exposure) versus the different endpoints. An approach as described by Holford et al. 2013, CPT PSP would be the preferred approach. Depending on the results of this analysis, the applicant should discuss whether therapeutic drug monitoring could be more appropriate for this population.

## Summary of the MAH's response

An overlay plot of the KM curves for the Pop PK model predicted exposure tertiles by dose level are presented in Figure 1. As seen in Figure 1, no trend of PFS with increasing CAVG0T was observed. The PFS for the lowest exposure tertile of the 60 mg dose (dashed gray line) was similar to the PFS for the highest exposure tertile of the 140 mg dose (solid red line). The PFS for the mid and high 60 mg exposure tertiles, however, underperformed all exposure tertiles for 140 mg, which is consistent with the overall higher PFS observed for 140 mg.

The Applicant does not believe that longitudinal modelling of the PFS data using cabozantinib concentration as a time-varying covariate will reveal an exposure-response relationship that does not exist as a monotonic trend across the wide range of exposure quantiles. Changes in cabozantinib levels over time caused by accumulation or dose modifications are already captured by the Pop PK model and CAVG0T (i.e., average concentration calculated from time 0 to the time of event or censoring) exposure metric. This finding of no exposure-response relationship is not unexpected (see response to QUESTION 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 KM plot separated by arms (l40 mg, solid lines vs. 60 mg, dashed lines) and cabozantinib exposure tertiles for each dose group

<!-- image -->

Time Since Randomization (month)

Cabozantinib exposure was defined as the overall average concentration calculated from time 0 to the time of event or censoring (CAVG0T), which is a time-invariant exposure measure.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

Kaplan-Meier plot separated by arms (140 mg, solid lines vs. 60 mg, dashed lines) and cabozantinib exposure tertiles for each dose group showed that the Q2 and Q3 PFS of the 60 mg dose group were below the exposure tertiles of the 140 mg dose group. However the Q1 of the 60 mg dose group was above the Q3 of the 140 mg dose group, indicating no clear relationship between the fraction of subjects with progressive disease and the different tertiles of cabozantinib exposures of the 60 and 140 mg dose group. These results do not support therapeutic drug monitoring.

## Conclusion

Considering that no clear relationship is observed between PFS and different tertiles of cabozantinib exposures of the 60 and 140 mg dose group, a clear support for therapeutic drug monitoring is lacking. Issue resolved.

## Question 4

No trends can be observed for PFS in the exposure-response analysis, which is inconsistent with the lower efficacy observed in the 60 mg QD arm as compared to the 140 mg QD arm in trial XL184-401. If a difference between the 60 mg QD and 140 mg QD exists, then this should also be reflected in the exposure-response analysis for PFS. This should be clarified by the applicant.

## Summary of the MAH's response

From the study XL184-401, the primary endpoint analysis demonstrated that PFS did not meet the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prespecified noninferiority criterion for the cabozantinib 60-mg arm compared with the cabozantinib 140-mg arm. It has shown that 60mg starting dose was not able to retain at least 50% of the treatment effect observed versus placebo in XL184-301 study (EXAM).

It is important to highlight that in the previous study XL184-301 (EXAM study) comparing 140mg capsules to placebo in MTC patients, no exposure-response relationship could be detected when analyzing PFS with AUCss. In the current study XL184-401, similarly, no exposure-response relationship was found when analyzing PFS with CAVG0T (i.e., average concentration calculated from time 0 to the time of event or censoring).

It appears that for MTC, a flat exposure-response relationship was observed with the primary efficacy end-point PFS.

In the current study XL184-401 (EXAMINER study), more rapid dose reductions in the 140 mg dose group compared to the 60 mg group cause the drug levels in both dose groups to converge over time. The convergence of the exposure levels likely confounds the ability to detect an exposure-response relationship by exposure quantile. In the current study XL184-401, the exposure-response analysis is not inconsistent with the clinical results.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The study was designed as a non-inferiority study. Whether the PFS is worser or better cannot be scientifically confirmed or supported by such a study.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Clinical aspects

## Question 5

The MAH is asked to provide further justification for the change in the NI margin, this should include the FDA review which lead to the modification of the NI margin.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Minutes of the meeting with FDA and the US MAH partner Exelixis held on 5 February 2014 including discussion on the choice of the NI margin are provided in this response. The modification of the NI margin in the study protocol amendment n°1 was supported by the draft FDA guidance for Industry: Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness (November 2016), which recommended the statistical method used to establish the NI margin for EXAMINER. The Applicant acknowledges that the original study design including initial statistical assumptions with NI margin of 1.89 was provided as part of the responses to questions in frame of Cometriq Marketing Authorisation Application review. However, the study protocol version that was submitted to EMA as the SOB in April 2014 included the amendment n°1 to the study protocol with the modification of the NI margin.

## Summary of meeting minutes

Exelixis submitted Protocol XLl34-401, intended to fulfil PMR 1970-5 on May 29, 2013. The noninferiority (NI) margin for this study was chosen using the fraction retention method to preserve 50% of the benefit of cabozantinib 140 mg versus placebo demonstrated in the major efficacy trial, XL184301, where the estimated HR for PFS was 0.28 (95% CI:0.19, 0.40). Exelixis stated that to achieve a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reasonable sample size, the point estimate used in the calculation of the NI margin would rely on the point estimate for the HR, according the following calculation: NI margin: exp[ln(1/0.28)/2=1.89.

The proposed primary efficacy analysis was event based, to be conducted when at least 77 PFS events were observed. Exelixis proposed that non-inferiority would be concluded (ie, the null hypothesis of PFS inferiority would be rejected) if the upper 95% CI for the PFS HR is less than the NI margin of 1.89.

On July 30, 2013, FDA informed Exelixis that the NI margin should be obtained by using the upper bound of 95% confidence interval, rather than the point estimate. Further, FDA noted that applying the 50% fraction-retention criterion to the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval bound for Study XLl84-301 (0.40) results in a NI margin M2 of 1.58. A trial designed with a NI margin of 1.58 requires 150 PFS events, which is similar to the 138 PFS events that were required for to detect efficacy in Study XL184-301.

On August 2,2013, Exelixis proposed another analytic approach in which 30% fraction-retention criterion was applied to the confidence interval bound, resulting in a NI margin M2 of 1.90, and requiring 76 PFS events observed in approximately 110 patients. FDA reviewed the August 2,2013, submission and responded on November 4, 2013, stating that the proposed modifications to Protocol XL184-401would yield data demonstrating that the two doses are similarly efficacious and that the primary objective of the PMR would not be fulfilled.

On December 20, 2013, Exelixis submitted a Type C meeting request to discuss the analysis plan for Study XL 184-401. The request was granted on December 30, 2013, and a teleconference was scheduled for January 22,2014. On January 6' 2014, Exelixis submitted their meeting package acknowledging FDA's November 4,2013, comments and proposed a third analysis plan and revisions to the study design incorporating FDA's November 4, 2013 recommendations in order to fulfill the PMR. The current proposal applies the 50% fraction-retention criterion to 0.40, based on the upper 95% confidence interval bound for the PFS HR observed in Study XLl84-301. Using this approach, the NI margin is determined to be: exp(ln(1/0.40)/2) = 1.58.

Additionally, an interim analysis is proposed to allow stopping the study early if the NI criterion is met before the study is fully enrolled (this may be achieved if the 60 mg dose level is truly superior to the 140 mg dose level). The interim analysis is planned for the 50% information fraction (77 events) and Type I error will be controlled with a LanDeMets O'Brien Fleming alpha spending function. With this design, 200 total patients are planned to be enrolled to observe 155 PFS events to provide 80% power with a I - sided Type I error rate of 0.025.

Draft FDA responses were sent to Exelixis on January 21,2014, in advance of the January 22,2014, teleconference. Exelixis then responded to FDA's draft responses by electronic mail (e-mail communication).

## Sponsor submitted questions and FDA responses.

The Sponsor proposes to design the study as recommended by the Agency. Applying the 50% fractionretention criterion to 0.40, the upper 95% confidence interval bound for the PFS HR in Study XL184301, the Sponsor determines the NI margin to be: exp(ln(l/0.40) /2): 1.58.

The Sponsor proposes to design the study as recommended by the Agency. Applying the 50 fractionretention criterion to 0.40, the upper 95% confidence interval bound for the PFS HR in Study XL184301, the Sponsor determines the NI margin to be: exp(ln(l/0.40) /2): 1.58.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With this design, approximately 200 patients are planned to be enrolled to observe 155 PFS events to provide 80% power with a 1-sided Type I error of 0.025. Does the Agency agree with the revised study design?

FDA Response Sent on Januarv 21.2014: The design is acceptable only if no interim analysis will be planned for the NI claim.

Exelixis' January 21, 2014, e-mail response: Sponsor would like clarification about why an interim analysis at 50% information to reject the null hypothesis of inferiority (to infer NI) is not acceptable if Type 1 error is appropriately controlled.

FDA's January 21, 2014 additional E-mail response: FDA does not accept an interim analysis in an NI design because an interim analysis using limited data will usually provide biased estimates of both treatment and control, thus, a conclusion based on an interim analysis will be most likely invalid since the estimates based on the interim will not be similar to the estimates from historical trial(s) and consequently the margin selection will be invalid.

Exelixis' January 21, 2014, e-mail response to the FDA Above : Would an interim analysis at the 75% information fraction for the purpose of declaring NI be more acceptable than the proposal for this analysis at 50% information?

FDA's January 21, 2014 additional E-mail response: No, see Response to la.

Exelixis' January 21, 2014, e-mail response to the FDA comment Above: To protect subjects from prolonged exposure to a potentially ineffective dose, the Sponsor proposes to include evaluations of futility at the time of interim analysis. Details about the criteria for futility will be provided in the SAP. Does the agency agree with the inclusion of interim analysis for futility?

FDA's January 21, 2014 additional E-mail response: No, see Response to la.

Discussion during the January 22, 2014. Teleconference : Exelixis agreed to FDA's recommendation to apply 50% fraction-retention criterion to 0.40, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the PFS HR in Study XLl84-301 and agreed to remove the planned interim analysis from Study XLl84-401 for the NI claim. Exelixis is committed io running the study tut expressed concern about the proposed study in a reasonable time frame as the environment has changed and the study will be challenging.

FDA recognizes the challenge, but stated that a dose that is not tolerable should not be the recommended dose in the product label.

Exelixis will provide a protocol, per agreed upon specifications, in March 2014 and will send new proposed timelines for PMR 1970-5 and provide justification regarding the missed milestones. Exelixis further stated that a copy of the material containing the changes discussed will be sent to EU; however, there may be changes to the protocol to suit the needs of EU. The proposed dose will be tablet formulation for commercial use.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The justification for the change in the NI margin, including the FDA review which lead to the modification of the NI margin has been provided.

## Question 6

The Applicant is asked to perform the analysis at 77 events from the first 112 patients as initially proposed and provide the results which would have been obtained with the initial NI margin.

## Summary of the MAH's response

During the review process of the EU Marketing Authorization Application for COMETRIQ, the Applicant committed to provide the final protocol of the study XL184-401 to the EMA for approval as post authorisation measure (refer to response to QUESTION 5). Accordingly, the initial study protocol that has been submitted to the EMA on the 9th of April 2014 included the amendment n°1 to the study protocol with the modified NI margin. The EMA approved the study protocol amendment n°1 on 20 November 2014. Additionally, at the time of approval of the study protocol amendment n°1 by the EMA, no patient was randomized in the study as the first patient was randomized on 25 February 2015. Finally, no interim analysis was planned and the results with modified NI margin clearly demonstrated that 60 mg of cabozantinib is not non inferior to 140 mg for the treatment of MTC. Based on the foregoing, the MAH considers that the initial statistical hypothesis are those approved by the EMA on 20 November 2014 and the MAH proposes not to conduct the analysis at 77 events from the first 112 patients included.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The Applicant was asked to perform the analysis at 77 events from the first 112 patients as initially proposed and provide the results which would have been obtained with the initial NI margin. The MAH proposes not to conduct the analysis at 77 events from the first 112 patients included. The arguments of the MAH are not considered to reflect the underlying request. However, the final conclusions are not expected to be affected by the requested analysis and the protocol has been approved.

## Conclusion

Issues not further pursued.

## Question 7

The Applicant is asked to provide an overview Table per treatment arm with the specific reasons for censoring. The applicant is asked to provide the number of participants who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event and had no further assessments.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Table 1 presents the number of subjects with events (death or progression) and the numbers of patients censored by reasons of censoring (extract from table 14.2.1.1 of the CSR study XL184- 401). Ninety-two subjects (40 in the 60 mg group and 52 in the 140 mg group) were censored. Overall, 7 patients (4 in the 60 mg group and 3 in the 140 mg group) were censored in the study for no post baseline adequate tumour assessment. Among the 7 patients, only one in the 60 mg group had discontinued treatment for AE. All 6 other patients were randomized late in the study (between April and June 2020) and had no assessment before the cut-off date (15 July 2020).

Patients who discontinued treatment for adverse events: A total of 71 patients discontinued treatment for adverse events. Among them, 25 had no tumour assessment after treatment was stopped. Among these 25 patients, 7 patients only were censored in the analysis of the PFS:

- Two (1 in each treatment group) because of no event by last tumour assessment
- Three (2 in the 140mg group and 1 in the 60mg group) because they received systemic anticancer therapy.
- One in the 60mg group because he had no post baseline ATA (as indicated above)
- And 1 in the 60 mg group because he missed 2 or more ATA prior to the event. In conclusion, only one patient who discontinued treatment for AE was censored for no post baseline adequate tumour assessment, and only a small number of patients who discontinued treatment for AE were censored for any reason, and they are equally distributed between the 2 groups of treatment.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant provided the number of participants who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event and had no further assessments.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 8

A sensitivity analysis and discussion of the MAH to assess the impact of participants who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event and had no further assessments is requested. Information on survival outcomes for these patients are also requested where available.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Given the small number of patients discontinued for adverse events without further assessment who were censored in the analysis of the PFS and their equal distribution between groups it is not relevant to perform a sensitivity analysis. The listing in Appendix 8 provides survival outcomes for these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the MAH's response

It is agreed with the MAH that given the small number of patients who discontinued for adverse events without further assessment who were censored in the analysis of the PFS and their equal distribution between groups it is not needed to perform a sensitivity analysis .

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## Question 9

Part of the SOB is the assessment of the M918T mutation status. The Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in the SmPC are not considered to be complete. The number of patients remaining on study over time are missing. The applicant is asked to update Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival and Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS among subjects with a RET M918T mutation by including the number of patients remaining on study over time.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Figures 14.2.12 and 14.2.96. are available in appendix 14 ad 2 of the CSR. As suggested by EMA, figures 2 and 3 have been updated in the section 5.1 of the COMETRIQ SmPC.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH updated the SmPC as suggested.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

## RMP aspects

## Question 10

The MAH should submit an updated RMP in which the proposed summary of completed study XL184401 is removed in part IV 'Plans for postauthorisation efficacy studies' (i.e. the proposed text above subsection 4.1).

## Summary of the MAH's response

As per EMA request, the MAH has updated the COMETRIQ RMP that was submitted. The proposed summary of completed study XL184-401 was deleted from the Part IV as well as all proposed text above subsection 4.1. The updated RMP version 5.5 is provided.

## Assessment of the MAH's response by the PRAC Rapporteur

The updated RMP version 5.5, signed off 28 June 2021, has been amended in line with the Rapporteur's request.

## Conclusion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Issue solved. Other remarks for the MAH

At the next opportunity the MAH is requested to reevaluate the safety concerns in the RMP and amend the updated RMP as appropriate

## Question 11

Frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs necessitating dose modifications in the cabozantinib 140-mg arm ( ≥ 5% incidence) included ALT increased, and AST increased. No warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC of Cometriq. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC of Cabometyx. The Applicant is asked to include and align the warning on hepatoxicity in the SmPC of Cometriq.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The MAH agrees to the inclusion of a hepatotoxicity warning regarding transaminases increase, in line with the existing Cabometyx SmPC warning. Inclusion of the following text is proposed in Cometriq SmPC section 4.4: 'Abnormalities of liver function tests (increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin) have been frequently observed in patients treated with cabozantinib. It is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of cabozantinib treatment and to monitor closely during treatment. For patients with worsening of liver function tests considered related to cabozantinib treatment (i.e where no alternative cause is evident), the dose should be reduced or treatment interrupted following the recommendations provided in section 4.2.'

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH included the hepatotoxicity warning regarding transaminases increase as suggested in the SmPC.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved.

- [x] Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

- [ ] No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## 14.3. Overall conclusion on the RMP

The changes to the RMP and the changes to the conditions and obligations of MA are acceptable.
