## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Hypertension  has  been  identified  as  a  major  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular  diseases  such  as  stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure: it's widely recognised that an adequate control of hypertension is  important to significantly decrease  cardiovascular mortality and  morbidity. All international guidelines  for  the  management  of  hypertension  recommend  a  general  target  blood  pressure  (BP)  &lt; 140/90 mm Hg for most hypertensive patients. A lower BP target (&lt;130/80 mm Hg) is recommended in high-risk patient populations such as those with organ damage, diabetes, or renal disease.

The main objective of the clinical programme provided in this Marketing Authorisation Application was to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  fixed  combination  of  aliskiren  with  amlodipine  in  the treatment of hypertension. Combination of aliskiren/amlodipine at doses of 150mg/5mg, 150mg/10mg, 300mg/5mg and 300mg/10mg was selected.

Several  therapeutic  choices  are  currently  available  to  lower  blood  pressure,  including  diuretics, β -blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and calcium channel antagonists. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an effective way to intervene in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disorders. Renin is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Then the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) transforms angiotensin I into the active octapeptide angiotensin II, which acts via type-1 angiotensin II receptors  (AT1)  to  increase  arterial  tone,  adrenal  aldosterone  secretion,  renal  sodium  reabsorption, sympathetic  neurotransmission,  and  cellular  growth.  Some  of  currently  used  antihypertensive  drugs intervene at different points of renin-angiotensin system: -β -blockers  reduce  the  release  of  renin  from  the  juxtaglomerular  apparatus  and  lower  blood pressure. -ACE-inhibitors reduce the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They also inhibit the inactivation of bradykinin and substance P, causing some typical side-effects of ACE inhibitors, such as cough and angioedema. -Angiotensin-receptor  antagonists  (ARB)  block  the  interaction  of  angiotensin  II  with  the  AT1 receptor. -Renin-inhibitors directly inhibit renin, blocking the RAS at its very origin. Despite the availability of several therapeutic choices, in the majority of hypertensive patients blood pressure  cannot  be  adequately  controlled  by  one  antihypertensive  drug  alone.  In  most  patients,  a combination  of  two  or  more  antihypertensive  medications  will  be  required  to  reach  adequate  blood pressure control. In this scenario, development  of new  fixed-dose combinations of different antihypertensive  drugs  helps  to  improve  patient  compliance  over  the  free  combination  of  single monotherapies  as  well  as  the  safety  profile  related  to  the  current  available  treatments.  Therefore, aliskiren, a DRI (direct renin inhibitor), and amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), were selected as the active substances to be combined in a fixed combination product for the treatment of hypertension based on their complementary mechanisms of action, pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics, and their clinical profiles. Aliskiren acts by inhibiting the RAS at the initial rate limiting step, the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Treatments which block the RAS are widely favoured methods of treating hypertension. Aliskiren was authorised in EU via the centralized procedure in August 2007. Amlodipine inhibits the calcium-dependent contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells and, through this effect, lowers total peripheral resistances to blood flow and blood pressure. Previous studies show additive antihypertensive  effects  of  CCB  with  drugs  which  block  the  RAS.  Amlodipine  was  approved  for  the treatment of hypertension, angina, and in some countries for angiographically documented coronary artery disease several years ago.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Rasilamlo film-coated tablets are a fixed combination product consisting of two active substances: Aliskiren hemifumarate and Amlodipine besylate.

Aliskiren  hemifumarate  (SPP100)  is  an  anti-hypertensive  agent  that  inhibits  the  renin-angiotensin system  and  Amlodipine  besylate  is  a dihydropyridine calcium channel  blocker. Both  Aliskiren hemifumarate and amlodipine besylate are already present in mono and combination products already approved.

<!-- image -->

## Manufacture

To cover the therapeutic needs, the tablets are formulated in four strengths 150/5 mg, 150/10 mg, 300/5 mg and 300/10 mg with a combination of Aliskiren hemifumarate equivalent to 150 mg or 300 mg of Aliskiren free base  and with Amlodipine besylate equivalent to 5 mg or 10 mg of Amlodipine free base. The  primary  packaging  of  tablets  consists  of  Polyamide/Aluminium/Polyvinylchloride  (PA/Alu/PVC) blister  packs  (Alu  blisters)  and  Polytetrafluoroethylene  PCTFE/PVC  blister  packs  backed  with  a  heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil 2.2.2. Active Substance Active Substance Aliskiren hemifumarate Aliskiren hemifumarate of Novartis has already been authorized via the centralised procedure both in monotherapy and in a combination product, with hydrochlorothiazide, owned by the Applicant. Aliskiren hemifumarate exists as a white to slightly yellowish powder. It has four chiral centres, but is obtained as a single diastereoisomer, all S-configured. Sufficient scientific information has been presented for the physicochemical properties such as appearance,  solubility  in  standard  aqueous  buffers  and  non-aqueous  solvents,  pKa,  specific rotation, log P, melting point and thermal behaviour. This molecule shows polymorphs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Aliskiren hemifumarate (SPP100) drug substance is manufactured according to two synthetic pathways: B and C.

The drug substance is manufactured with total synthesis including ten and six main stages using routes [synB] and [synC], respectively. Addition of synthesis C in alternative to synthesis B has been the object of a type II variation. The alternate synthesis C has been developed to reduce the complexity of the process, while improving the overall quality and safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adequate  in-process  controls  including  the  control  of  the  stereochemistry  and  control  of  the  critical steps have been applied as well as controls of the reagents, solvents, catalysts, starting materials, and intermediates used in the manufacture of aliskiren hemifumarate. Materials used in the manufacture of aliskiren  hemifumarate  active  substance  are  all  of  synthetic  origin;  therefore  do  not  pose  a  risk  of TSE/BSE contamination.

Adequate specifications have been included for the starting materials, solvents, and intermediates.

Validation data are available and the robustness of the process has been demonstrated.

The structure of aliskiren hemifumarate drug substance (SPP100) is supported by the synthetic routes.

The  structure  of  aliskiren  hemifumarate  has  been  fully  elucidated  with  usual  techniques  such  as elementary analysis, Infra-Red (IR) spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( 1 H-NMR and  13 C-NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy (by ESI, Electron Spray Ionisation) and X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), optical rotation (single diasteroisomer), particle size analysis.

Stability  data  on  three  pilot  batches  have  been  carried  out  under  ICH  long  term  (24  months, 25°C/60%RH)  and  accelerated  conditions  (6  months,  40°C/75%RH)  as  well  as  photostability  and stress testing under different conditions. Very tight packaging has to be used.

Specification The  drug  substance  specifications  using  the  different  syntheses  differ  only  in  the  requirements  for residual solvents and impurities Appropriate specification has been set up for the active substance obtained by route B and route C and includes  appearance,  particle  size,  appearance  of  the  solution,  identification  (IR,  XR  and  optical rotation),  residual  solvents  (Gas  Chromatography  GC),  water  content,  sulfated  ash,  heavy  metals, related substances, assay (titration and HPLC), assay of the salt (fumaric acid), microbiological quality. The skip-testing approach for the microbiological quality is considered acceptable. Specification  of  the  active  substance  including  residual  solvents  (in  line  with  ICH  requirements)  and impurities  (justified  by  toxicological  data)  are  appropriately  justified.  An  overview  on  the  related substances of aliskiren hemifumarate  has been presented covering potential process impurities and degradation products (from synthesis B and C). Levels observed and the origin of related substances has been extensively discussed and found satisfactory. The limits are in line with ICH Q3A. Analytical methods  have  been  adequately  detailed and  non-compendial  methods  validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The bulk of the active substance is packed and stored in very tight packaging. The bags are stored in drums with a tamper resistant seal. Batch analysis from batches obtained by the route B (12 batches) and the route C (6 batches) has demonstrated the uniformity and the consistency of the syntheses. Data presented show the release testing of batches manufactured by syntheses B and A which were used in clinical  trials,  toxicological  studies  and  /  or  primary  stability  studies.  Comparative  analytical data of three more recent batches of aliskiren hemifumarate manufactured by the synthetic route B and three batches of drug substance manufactured by the synthetic route C. All the results were found compliant with the specifications. Stability Stability summary and conclusions for synthesis B Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  addition  six  production  batches  have  been  placed  under  stability.  The  stability  reports  submitted contain data covering 36 months of long term and 6 months of accelerated stability studies.

The  parameters  tested  were  including:  appearance,  identity  (IR,  X-ray  diffraction,  optical  rotation), impurities (HPLC), water content (Karl-Fischer), clarity and colour of the solution and assay (HPLC). All parameters  were  found  in  accordance  with  the  specification  and  no  major  degradation  could  be observed under long-term and accelerated conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability summary and conclusions for synthesis C

Stability data on four development batches and three production-scale batches have been carried out under ICH long term and accelerated conditions (24 months, 25°C/60%RH, 30°C/ 65% RH and 40°C/ 75% RH and 18 months respectively).  The  results  obtained  show  that  they  are  similar  to  the  data obtained for aliskiren hemifumarate manufactured by synthesis B and confirm the storage precautions (store below 25°C, protect from light in very tight packaging).

Based on the discussion above, the data for synthesis B support a retest period of 30 months stored not  above  25°C  in  a  very  tight  packaging.  Stability  data  on  pilot  and  commercial  batches  from synthesis C are available for up to 24 and 18 months, respectively, and a re-a test period of 24 months stored not above 25°C in a very tight packaging can be granted.

Adequate specification  from  the  active  substance  suppliers  include  the  following  tests:  description, particle size (laser diffraction), appearance of solution, identity (IR, XR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl-Fisher), sulfated ash (Ph.Eur.), optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (ICP-OES), microbial contamination.

Active Substance Amlodipine Besilate Amlodipine besilate (INN) is an active substance described in the Ph.Eur and is manufactured by two active substance manufacturers. Both manufacturers have presented Certificates of Suitability (CEP). The three CEPs, current version, are provided in the regional section of the dossier Amlodipine is a White or almost white powder. Physico-chemical properties such as solubility in various solvents, melting point, polymorphism and chirality have been described. The substance is used as a racemic mixture (R and S isomers). There is no polymorphism of Amlodipine besylate described in the literature. All  the  information  relating  to  the  manufacturing  process,  control  of  materials,  critical  steps  and intermediates, manufacturing development, elucidation of the structure and impurities is covered by the CEP therefore no information was included in the dossier. Specification Medicinal product no longer authorised

Upon receipt from the commercial manufacturers, the active substance is tested in accordance with internal Novartis testing monographs specific for each supplier.

The  monographs  are  based  on  the  requirements  for  amlodipine  besilate  as  found  in  the  Ph.  Eur. monograph, and include additional tests needed to conform to Novartis internal standards.

The applicant has put in place additional tests needed by comparison to the Ph.Eur. monograph to ensure  the  consistency  of  quality  for  the  active  substance  between  and  within  each  supplier  The specification has been adequately justified and especially limits for impurities, heavy metals, residual solvents have been toxicologically justified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, amlodipine besilate is controlled for the content in besylate esters that are known to be genotoxic.  Moreover,  according  to  the  Q&amp;A  document  on  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Limits  of Genotoxic  Impurities  (EMA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007)  the  tolerated  amounts  of  besylate  esters should not be cumulated since the benzenesulfonate impurities are structurally related. The limits for besylate esters in amlodipine besylate have been restricted to NMT 75 ppm each and NMT 150 ppm for the sum. This was found acceptable.

In  summary,  the  active  substance  is  controlled  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  Ph.  Eur. monograph with the addition of the following tests, which are not source specific: identification by XRPD  and  HPLC,  Heavy  metals,  clarity  of  solution, colour of solution and  microbial limits. Requirements for additional impurities and residual solvents are included in the specifications and are active substance source specific.

All  analytical  procedures  used  for  testing  the  active  substance  have  been  properly  described. Compendial methods are used for clarity and colour of the solution, identification by IR, water content by Karl Fischer, sulphated ash, optical rotation, related substances by HPLC and assay by HPLC. In-house  analytical  methods  are  used  for  particle  size  determination  (laser  light  diffraction), identification by X-ray diffraction, Identification by HPLC, impurities by HPLC, residual solvents by GC, heavy  metals  by  ICP/OES  and  microbial  enumeration  test.  Non-compendial  methods  have  been validated in line with ICH guidelines. Nine  batches  from  both  active  substance  manufacturers  were  tested  for  compliance  with  the specifications of the test monographs. Certificates of analysis showed that all the batches meet the Ph.Eur.  test  requirements  and  all  additional  testing  requirements  from  the  applicant.  Results  of analysis  demonstrate  that  the  quality  of  the  active  pharmaceutical  ingredient  batches  of  both suppliers is comparable. For  one  manufacturer,  the  drug  substance  is  filled  in  clear  polyethylene  bag,  tied  in  a  black polyethylene  bag,  tied  and  in  HDPE  container.  For  the  other  manufacturer,  it  consists  of  a polyethylene inner bag in a black polyethylene outer bag in or without (Process II) a cardboard box or polypropylene pail with lid. The  certificates  of  compliance  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  the  foodstuff  legislation  for  the  packaging materials have been provided Stability For one manufacturer, a retest period of 5 years and 1 year (depending on the synthetic route) have been  granted  on  the  CEPs.  For  the  other  manufacturer,  since  the  CEP  provides  no  re-test  period, long-term and accelerated stability data are provided but the Applicant commits to test each batch of amlodipine besilate before producing the drug product. In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product The  Rasilamlo  film-coated  tablets  are  immediate  release  solid  dosage  forms  for  oral  administration containing fixed combinations of the active substances aliskiren hemifumarate and amlodipine besilate. The four different tablet strengths  have the same shape (ovaloid convex shaped) but different colour and sizes: Medicinal product no longer authorised

300  mg  aliskiren/5  mg  amlodipine  film-coated  tablets  are  dark  yellow,  ovaloid  convex  shaped, bevelled-edged film-coated tablet with debossing 'T11' on one side and 'NVR' on the reverse side of the tablet.

300  mg  aliskiren/10  mg  amlodipine  film-coated  tablets  are  brown  yellow,  ovaloid  convex  shaped, bevelled-edged film-coated tablet with debossing 'T12' on one side and 'NVR' on the reverse side of the tablet.

The excipients used for the core tablets are common  standard Pharmaceutical excipients: microcrystalline  cellulose,  crospovidone,  povidone,  magnesium  stearate,  silica  colloidal  anhydrous, ethanol with 5% isopropanol.

The  tablet  cores  are  coated  with  a  non-functional  coating  to  provide  a  distinctive  tablet  colour  to identify the different dosage strengths.  The basic coating premixes are a combination of ingredients established  for  use  in  medicinal  products.    The  premixes  themselves  do  not  appear  in  any pharmacopoeia; but the ingredients meet compendial requirements and/or international standards.

The  Coating  premixes  (white,  yellow  and  red)  are  commercially  available  materials  containing  iron oxides and/or titanium oxides, macrogol, talc and hypromellose. There  are  differences  in  the  ratios  of  the  film-coating  pre-mixes  that  make  the  various  strengths distinguishable. The components of the premixes are given and comply with the standard of the Ph.Eur. or with the Directive 2008/128/EC. The difference in the premixes is the colourant (iron oxide and titanium dioxide. The primary packaging consists of tablets are PA/Alu/PVC blister packs (Alu blisters) and PCTFE/PVC blister packs backed with a heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil Pharmaceutical development Aliskiren  is  a  single  diastereoisomer  with  4  S-configured  chiral  centers.  Its  hemifumarate  salt  was selected  for  the  drug  product,  because  it  was  the  only  one  which  showed  crystallinity.  Aliskiren hemifumarate is a white to slightly yellowish hygroscopic crystalline powder with high solubility and low permeability according to the BCS (class 3). Aliskiren does not possess adequate compactability properties therefore needs granulation. Aliskiren has shown very good chemical compatibility with all the  excipients  used  in  the  formulation,  proved  by  previously  approved  formulations.  Given  the  high solubility,  particle  size  is  not  a  concern  however  the  particle  size  is  checked  to  be  under  1000  µm (90%). The crystalline form is checked in the specifications. Amlodipine besylate is described in the US Pharmacopoeia and Ph.Eur.  From the literature it is known to  be  well  absorbed  (90% in humans) and with a good solubility. No classification according BCS is given, however given the low dose it may be considered as a high solubility drug.  Particle size may be an issue and therefore is controlled by laser diffraction. Amlodipine besylate is sourced from two drug substance suppliers with CEPs. Compatibility  studies  with  mixtures  of  the  actives  with  a  variety  of  excipients  were  carried  out  and analyzed using the validated chromatography currently utilized in the Aliskiren / Hydrochlorothiazide project. The major identified impurity in samples showing significant degradation was formed by the reaction of the major components. No other major impurities were observed and therefore, the tested excipients were deemed to be compatible. The  excipients  selected  are  standard  ingredients  in  tablet  formulations,  and  are  in  compliance  with internationally  accepted  pharmacopoeial  standards.   The  concentrations  of  each  excipient  are  within the usual range of application. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The formulation development focused on obtaining a tablet formulation using the existing commercial granulates  of  Aliskiren  hemifumarate  and  Amlodipine  besylate.    Aliskiren  hemifumarate  granules (without extra-granular material or lubricant) are manufactured using the validated process developed for  the  approved  Rasilez  product.  Amlodipine  granules  were  manufactured  using  the  commercial validated process for the amlodipine granulation portion. Four strengths of the fixed combination were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

developed.  A suitable extragranular phase was found and compression conditions were chosen then scaled up to industrial scale.

The 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg film-coated tablet formulation were tested in bioequivalence studies. Both  formulations  successfully  demonstrated  bioequivalence  to  the  free  forms  of  aliskiren  and amlodipine. As a result of the positive bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, this disintegrant level was maintained for all strengths.

The  composition  of  drug  substance  and  excipients  in  the  150/5  mg  tablet  is  weight  and  dose proportional  to  the  300/10  mg  tablet  which  proved  bioequivalent  to  the  free  combination.  The qualitative composition of the 150/5 and 150/10 mg formulations as well as of the 300/5 and 300/10 mg  formulations  are  qualitatively identical and  quantitatively similar  (the  amount  of  drug  is compensated  by  a  corresponding  amount  of  the  excipient  cellulose  microcrystalline  and  the  total percentage  difference  in  excipient  concentration  is  0.7  %).  Therefore  the  formulations  can  be considered as dose proportional all together and a biowaiver for the two formulations that have not been subjected to bioequivalence studies can be considered. The  biowaiver  request  for  the  150/5  mg  and  300/5  mg  film-coated  tablets  based  on  compositional proportionality (300/10mg - 150/5 mg), compositional similarity (300/10 mg - 300/5 mg), identical manufacturing process and similar dissolution profiles of the waived strengths to the profile of 300/10 mg BE batch in four dissolution media is acceptable. A 20 % overage is included in the film coating suspension to compensate for any losses that may occur during the film-coating process Based on the available stability data, the following packaging materials are claimed to be sufficiently protective  and  compatible  with  the  film-coated  tablets:  PA/Alu/PVC  blister  packs  (Alu  blisters)  and PCTFE/PVC blister packs. Adventitious agents There are no excipients of human or animal origin used in the manufacture of the finished product .A declaration that the magnesium stearate used is of vegetable origin is provided. Manufacture of the product Details of the manufacturing process and appropriate in-process controls including parameters such as mean mass, individual mass, thickness, hardness, friability, disintegration time have been provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The manufacture of the tablets can be summarized in three main steps: granulation, Final compression and  film  coating.  In  summary,  the  manufacturing  process  uses  standard  processes,  granulation, blending,  compression  and  coating.    The  tablet  cores  are  coated  and  packaged.  All  strengths  are manufactured with the same process.

The manufacturing process development was briefly addressed. The manufacture of the tablets can be summarized in three main steps: granulation, Final compression and film coating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All strengths are manufactured by combining and blending the granulates of the active substance with extragranular components and compression of the tables.  The manufacturing process presents critical points, concerning the homogeneity of granulates blends and the content uniformity of tablet cores. These  have  been  addressed  in  the  process  validation.  Even  though  the  homogenous  distribution  of active ingredients in the final powder mixture is supported by the homogeneity results presented in the validation  report  and  is  ensured  by  the  preset  mixing  parameters,  the  applicant,  upon  request,  has specified in section 3.2P.3.3. the exact value of the  mixing parameters (time and speed).

The  primary  packaging  for  SPA100  150/5  mg,  150/10  mg,  300/5  mg  and  300/100  mg  film-coated tablets  are  PA/Alu/PVC  blister  packs  (Alu  blisters)  and  PCTFE/PVC  blister  packs  backed  with  a  heat sealable lacquered aluminum foil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The components of the blisters are tested for cleanliness, total thickness and identity (IR). In addition the  packaging  components  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements  (where  applicable)  and/or  foodstuff legislation.

## Stability of the product

Stability  results  have  been  presented  on  3  pilot  batches  for  each  strength  150/5  mg,  150/10  mg, 300/5 mg and 300/10 mg film-coated tablets in two different packaging configurations (PA/Alu/PVC (Alu) blister packs and in PCTFE/PVC blisters).

The  batches  have  been  stored  under  ICH  long  term  testing  at  25°C/60%RH  and  30°C/65%RH  (12 months), accelerated testing at 40°C/75%RH (6 months), as well as other temperatures (e.g. - 20°C, 5°C  and  50°C).  Special  tests  (e.g.  photostability  and  microbial  enumeration)  have  also  been performed. The characteristics  tested  during  the  stability  study  were  appearance,  water  content,  accompanying substances,  dissolution,  assay  and  degradation  products  as  well  as  microbiology.  The  tests  covered parameters susceptible to change during storage and likely to influence quality and/or efficacy of the product. Parameters  remained  within  the  specification  when  the  product  was  kept  at  25C  and  no  significant change  could  be  observed,  slight  increase  was  observed  under  intermediate  conditions  but  out  of specification  results  were  found  under  accelerated  conditions.  Photostability  data  showed  that  the product is stable in the proposed packages. Stability data support the proposed shelf life under the precautions of storage described in the Product Information. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The active substance aliskiren hemifumarate is optically active with four chiral carbons but exists as a single  diastereoisomer.  It  is  manufactured  via  2  stereochemically  controlled  syntheses  (route  B  and route  C).  Controls  of  stereochemistry,  polymorphism  and  impurities  have  been  fully  discussed. Appropriate  specification  has  been  presented.  Stability  studies  conducted  according  to  the  ICH guidelines  showed  that  aliskiren  hemifumarate  is  stable.  Based  on  the  discussion  above,  the  data support  synthesis  B  support  a  retest  period  of  30  months  stored  not  above  25°C  in  a  very  tight packaging. Stability data on pilot and commercial batches from synthesis C are available for up to 24 and 18 months, respectively, and a re-a test period of 24 months stored not above 25°C in a very tight packaging can be granted. The active substance amlodipine besilate is covered by Certificates of Suitability CEP from 2 suppliers. Adequate specification has been presented. For one manufacturer, a retest period of 5 years and 1 year (depending on the synthetic route) have been granted on the CEPs. For the other manufacturer, since the CEP provides no re-test period. Long-term and accelerated stability data are provided but the Applicant commits to test each batch of amlodipine besilate before to produce the drug product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this medicinal product is considered satisfactory when used with the conditions defined in  the  SPC.  The  documentation  provided  for  the  active  substance  aliskiren  hemifumarate  and amlodipine  besilate  is  comprehensive  and  adequately  detailed.  The  pharmaceutical  development  is adequate and took into consideration the properties and the stability of the 2 active substances. The excipients used are common excipients for immediate release dosage forms. Similarly, the packaging material is well documented  and  no  incompatibility  has  been  noticed.  The  validation  of the manufacturing  process  ensures  consistency  and  reproducibility  of  the  finished  product.  The  finished product has been satisfactorily controlled and stability studies conducted under ICH conditions showed that the product is stable throughout the proposed shelf-life.

Studies on pharmacodynamics for the fixed combination of aliskiren and amlodipine (SPA100) were not conducted primarily due to the lack of appropriate animal models. Aliskiren is highly specific for human renin and has limited activity in standard rat models of hypertension. The highly artificial human renin transgenic models used to demonstrate the efficacy of aliskiren cannot be used to model the activity of the combination drug in man.  The  individual efficacy of aliskiren and  amlodipine  has  been demonstrated extensively and there are no expectations of a lowered effectiveness when combined. This approach is considered acceptable.

2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction No  preclinical  pharmacodynamic  or  special  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  with  Rasilamlo. Rationale for not performing these studies is discussed in detail in each section. The 2-week and 13week  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  rats  evaluated  the  nonclinical  safety  profile  of  aliskiren  and amlodipine when used in combinations. Toxicokinetic analyses of the two components, aliskiren and amlodipine, were included in the toxicity studies. The preclinical safety programme is consistent with the  CHMP  guidance  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005)  on  the  non-clinical  safety  evaluation  of  fixed combinations. Based on the proposed highest therapeutic dose strength of 300/10 mg (aliskiren/amlodipine), a ratio of approximately 30:1 was used in the toxicity studies. The principal 13week  study  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  GLP.  In  addition,  two  genotoxicity  assays  including Ames and the chromosome aberration assays were performed on Rasilamlo. No further studies were performed for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity since the assessment of potential in  these  areas  was  adequately  performed  with  aliskiren  or  amlodipine  and  there  were  no  safety concerns from the assessment. The nonclinical programme took into consideration the approved SmPC for aliskiren and amlodipine and allowed for the characterisation of the nonclinical safety profile of the combination while avoiding unnecessary repetition  of  animal  studies.  In  support  of  the  programme, literature data were also provided. 2.3.2. Pharmacology 2.3.2.1. Primary pharmacodynamic studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.2.2. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

No special studies were conducted with aliskiren/amlodipine, due to the lack of appropriate animal models as described in the above sections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2.3. Safety pharmacology programme

No special studies were conducted with aliskiren/amlodipine, due to the fact that the safety of aliskiren and amlodipine on the central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems has been demonstrated in previous studies with the individuals components and the combination was tested in repeated dose toxicity studies.

## 2.3.2.4. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Due to the distinct mechanisms of amlodipine and aliskiren, specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction investigations were not conducted for the aliskiren/amlodipine fixed combination.

The volume of distribution of aliskiren at steady-state was high in the rat, moderate in humans and mice, and low in the marmoset. After single intravenous dosing of 10 mg/kg radio-labelled aliskiren to pigmented rats, radioactivity was extensively distributed throughout the body, with the highest levels at 5min post-dose in the liver and kidney. However, after oral dosing, there was no evidence of drugrelated material being bound. Aliskiren-related radioactivity was eliminated within 24 hours from most organs and tissues. Aliskiren and/or its metabolites were not taken up into the central nervous system. The binding of aliskiren to plasma proteins was moderate with free fractions (fu) of 29% (mouse), 38% (rat) and 50% (human). In marmosets, a distinctly higher plasma protein binding was observed (fu = 8%). The distribution between blood cells and plasma was independent of the concentration for rat, and human. Amlodipine was highly distributed into tissues with a large volume of distribution around 21-32 L/kg across species. The myocardial concentration increased after a bolus injection and reached

2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the aliskiren and amlodipine are well characterised and have been extensively studied preclinically as well as clinically. Based on the Guideline on the Non-clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products (CHMP/EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), if the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  the  single  components  are  adequately  characterised  in  animals, additional non-clinical  documentation  on  pharmacokinetic  interactions  is  generally  not  needed. Accordingly,  no  new  pharmacokinetic  study  with  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  combination  has  been submitted and the preclinical pharmacokinetic documentation is a compilation of results from previous studies and literature data. Absorption and bioavailability The  rate  of  absorption  of  aliskiren  was  rapid  in  mice,  rats,  and  moderate  in  dogs,  marmosets  and humans. The oral bioavailability in  mouse, rat,  marmoset and human was low and ranged between 1.5% and 3%. Systemic exposure was roughly dose proportional with no gender differences observed in  the  toxicology  species.  There  was  no  accumulation  in  blood  or  plasma  of  the  rat  after  daily  oral administration of the drug for 10 days. After oral dosing, the concentration-time profiles of aliskiren and  aliskiren-related  components  in  plasma  were  highly  variable  and  peaked  between  0.25  and  3 hours in all species investigated, including humans. The plasma clearance (CL) was low in marmosets (0.036 L/h/kg) and humans (0.13 L/h/kg), and moderate to high in rats (1.2 L/h/kg) and mice (2.01 L/h/kg). Oral doses of amlodipine were well absorbed in mice, rats and dogs, and nearly completely absorbed  in  humans.  Unlike  other  calcium  antagonists,  amlodipine  did  not  undergo  relevant  presystemic metabolism. Absolute oral bioavailability is 67-90% in humans, and 88-100% in dogs, mice and rats. There is no food-effect in humans. Rats showed higher plasma clearance and shorter half-life than human, dog and mouse and a plasma clearance which exceeds liver blood flow 2.2 fold. This may indicate dose-dependent kinetics in the rat with first-pass metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of R-(+)and  S-(-)-amlodipine  after  single  enantiomer  administration  were  comparable  to  that  of  each enantiomer after administration of the racemate. No racemization occurred in vivo in human plasma. The absorption and bioavailability of aliskiren/amlodipine combination is not expected to act differently from  the  individual  components  aliskiren  and  amlodipine.  There  was  no  significant  effect  on  the exposure  of  either  drug  components  after  single  and  multiple  dosing  of  the  combination.  The pharmacokinetics of individual components aliskiren and amlodipine and its combination in a 2- and 13-week oral (gavage) toxicity study in male and female rats indicate no potential clinically significant interactions (see section Toxicology). Distribution and protein binding Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a maximum in 2min and then remained on a plateau. Myocardial uptake was threefold higher than lung uptake. Both enantiomers of amlodipine displayed similar myocardial kinetics. Amlodipine was highly bound  to  human  plasma  proteins  (98%  at  a  drug  concentration  of  50ng/mL).  Protein  binding  was similar in dogs and rats.

The blood distribution and plasma protein binding of aliskiren and amlodipine have been investigated as  described  above  and  it  is  not  expected  to  act  differently  when  administered  in  combination. Therefore, additional blood distribution and plasma protein binding studies with the combination were not conducted.

## Metabolism

Examination  of 14 C-labeled  aliskiren  metabolism  in  mice,  rats,  marmosets,  humans  and  pregnant rabbits showed that the drug was metabolised to a low to moderate extent in humans, marmosets, rats and mice. The primary metabolic pathways involved oxidative reactions on the phenol moiety of aliskiren, like O-dealkylation and further oxidation to the carboxylic acid metabolites. These oxidation processes  had  been  found  to  be  catalysed  largely  by  cytochrome  P450  3A4/5  enzymes.  Minor metabolic pathways were the formation of glucuronide metabolites and hydrolytic cleavage of aliskiren at the amide bond level. All metabolites observed in plasma were also found in the excreta either in free or conjugated form. In animals and humans, amlodipine was eliminated mainly through extensive, though  slow  metabolism,  with  a  low  first  pass  extraction  in  mouse,  dog  and  humans.  In  rats,  a substantial first-pass extraction is indicated. Metabolism was catalysed mainly by hepatic CYP3A4 and was  similar  in  rats,  dogs,  mice  and  humans.  Only  a  small  fraction  of  the  dose  (up  to  5%)  was recovered  in  urine  as  unchanged  drug.  In  human,  rat  and  dog,  the  first  step  of  metabolism  was oxidation  of  the  dihydropyridine  ring  of  the  racemic  compound  to  the  pyridine  analogue.  Further metabolism involved oxidation/hydrolysis of the side-chain ester(s) and oxidation/degradation of the aminoethoxymethyl side chain. The  metabolism  of  the  individual  components,  aliskiren  and  amlodipine,  was  extensively  studied  as described  above.  Additional  metabolism  studies  with  the  combination  aliskiren/amlodipine  were therefore not necessary. Excretion In  mice,  rats,  marmosets  and  humans,  aliskiren  and  its  metabolites  were  predominantly  eliminated with faeces ( ≥ 88% of the absorbed oral dose) indicating high biliary excretion of the absorbed fraction of the administered dose. In bile duct-cannulated rats, about 13% and 70% of orally and intravenously administered radio-labelled aliskiren were excreted in bile, respectively. Renal excretion was generally low in all investigated species, including humans. Excretion was complete within 7 days, with the main fraction  of  a  radioactive  dose  excreted  within  24-48  hours.  About  50%  of  amlodipine  oral  dose  was recovered in urine and faeces of rats and dogs. Following the administration of single 5mg intravenous and 15mg oral doses of  14 C-radiolabeled amlodipine to healthy volunteers, 59% (p.o.) and 62% (i.v.) of the dose were recovered in faeces, and 23% (i.v., p.o.) in urine. Excretion after 12 days accounted for 84% of the administered dose. The elimination and excretion of the individual components, aliskiren and amlodipine, was extensively studied as described in the above sections. Elimination and excretion of the individual components is not  expected  to  act  differently  when  administered  in  combination.  Therefore,  additional  studies investigating the elimination and excretion of the fixed dose combination were not necessary. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Aliskiren is not expected to inhibit CYP450-catalysed metabolism of co-administered drugs. The clinical relevance of drug transporter interactions between aliskiren and various co-medications was assessed in numerous clinical studies. The AUC of the MDR1 (P-gp) substrate digoxin was only weakly affected by  aliskiren  co-administration.  Similarly,  aliskiren  did  not  alter  pharmacokinetics  of  the  MDR1  and CYP3A4 substrate cyclosporine A. In vitro studies showed that aliskiren had a minimal effect on the MRP2 efflux pump as demonstrated with the MRP2 substrate valsartan. Interactions of aliskiren with substrates  of  several  uptake  transporters  were  only  weak  or  not  present  in  clinical  drug-drug interaction  studies  with  digoxin,  metformin,  atenolol  or  cimetidine.  Further,  multiple  once  oral  daily dosing  of  aliskiren  (300  mg)  showed  no  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  when administered in combination with valsartan (320 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) or ramipril (10 mg). Ketoconazole, a very potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and also moderate MDR1 inhibitor, showed a moderate (1.8 fold) increase in aliskiren exposure. A single oral dose of Cyclosporine A (200 or  600  mg),  a  potent  MDR1  and  weak  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  co-administered  with  a  single  oral  dose  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aliskiren (75 mg) resulted in a 4- to 5-fold and 2.5 fold increase in aliskiren AUC and C max , respectively. Accordingly, aliskiren should not be used in combination with potent MDR1 (P-gp) inhibitors.

In  studies in  vitro ,  amlodipine  showed  a  strong  competitive  inhibition  of  CYP1A1,  and  a  moderate inhibition  of  CYP2B6.  The  observations  suggest  a  moderate  to  low  potential  of  amlodipine  to  inhibit CYP1A1- and/or CYP2B6-mediated metabolic clearance. In studies in vitro , amlodipine was found to be an inhibitor of MDR1. Amlodipine moderately inhibited the transport of daunorubicin, however, in vitro amlodipine  did  not  inhibit  the  MDR1-mediated  transport  of  digoxin.  Therapeutic  amlodipine  steadystate concentrations are comparatively low; therefore the systemic in  vivo interaction  potential  with MDR1 appears to be very low. Amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the cardiovascular drugs digoxin, telmisartan, or benazepril. Amlodipine increased AUC and Cmax of simvastatin by 28% and  43%,  respectively,  though  without  an  effect  on  cholesterol.  It  caused  a  minor  increase  of cyclosporine A plasma levels. Grapefruit juice, which inhibits CYP3A4 and MDR1, or sildenafil, a CYP3A substrate in the gut did not change the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. Cimetidine, telmisartan and benazepril did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine. The potent CYP3A inhibitor diltiazem caused an increase in plasma Cmax and AUC of amlodipine by up to 57%.

Two repeated dose toxicity studies in rats were conducted with aliskiren/amlodipine. All animals were dosed orally by gavage. The high doses (300/10 mg/kg/day) selected for both 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were based on the results of the previous toxicity data with aliskiren and amlodipine and considered to be at, or above, the maximum tolerated dose for repeated administration in rat. Oral administration  of  aliskiren/amlodipine  to  rats  for  2-  or  13-weeks  resulted  in  changes  in  clinical observations,  clinical  pathology  parameters  and  histopathological  changes  in  large  intestine  and adrenals.  All  the  changes  noted  in  the  studies  were  attributed  to  either  aliskiren  or  amlodipine, respectively,  based  on  previous  findings  with  each  component.  In  the  2-week  rat  study,  the  main adverse effects of aliskiren/amlodipine were noted in the large intestine at doses of 100/3 and 300/10 mg/kg/day, including inflammation  and  hypertrophy/hyperplasia.  These  changes  are  consistent  with those  previously  observed  for  aliskiren  in  repeated-dose  toxicity  study  in  rats.  In  the  13-week  rat study, the adverse effects were mainly noted in the high dose groups. The findings included premature

Aliskiren-amlodipine: The absorbed part of aliskiren is metabolised by CYP3A4 to a very limited extent (~  1%  of  the  dose)  in  humans.  Animal  data  indicated  that  absorbed  aliskiren  is  eliminated  via hepatobiliary  route  and  mainly  as  unchanged  drug.  In  humans,  amlodipine  was  eliminated  mainly through  extensive  metabolism.  Direct  biliary  excretion  of  unchanged  amlodipine  is  much  less significant. Thus, the clearance mechanisms of aliskiren and amlodipine are not anticipated to interfere with each other. The effect of co-administration of aliskiren (300 mg) and amlodipine (10 mg) on the steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of  each  drug  was  determined  in  an  open-label  study  conducted  in healthy volunteers. Amlodipine steady-state pharmacokinetics is comparable when given alone or in combination with aliskiren.  Co-administration  of  amlodipine  with  aliskiren  resulted  in  an  18%  and  a 29% increase in aliskiren steady-state Cmax and AUC, respectively. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Administration of aliskiren with amlodipine to healthy volunteers was safe and well tolerated. In summary, due to the double action of amlodipine, it might be expected that there are some changes in aliskiren exposure but a strong effect is not expected since none of these effects are strong and they are in fact counteracting. As it was stated, there is some increase in the exposure of aliskiren (18% and  a  29%  increase  in  aliskiren  steady-state  C max and  AUC,)  which  is  in  line  with  the  reasoning presented  above.  The  pharmacokinetic  interactions  were  sufficiently  described  for  the  individual compounds.  The  significant  interactions  identified  in  preclinical  and  clinical  studies  are  adequately described in the SmPC of Rasilamlo. 2.3.4. Toxicology 2.3.4.1. Single dose toxicity No  nonclinical studies investigating single dose toxicity  were  conducted  with the fixed dose combination of aliskiren/amlodipine. Previous studies conducted with the single components aliskiren and amlodipine did not suggest that the individual components of the fixed association would behave differently when given in combination. 2.3.4.2.

deaths and clinical signs of shallow/deep/laboured breathing. The findings were consistent with those observed  in  the  previously  conducted  13-week  rat  study  with  aliskiren  and  associated  with  local irritation  of  aliskiren  as  a  result  of  aspiration  of  the  dosing  solution  into  the  respiratory  tract  rather than  systemic  toxic  effects.  The  findings  in  the  adrenals  were  clearly  related  to  the  amlodipine treatment  since  there  were  no  similar  findings  noted  in  aliskiren  alone  group.  Also  the  number  of animals  with  the  findings  in  the  adrenals  was  higher  in  the  amlodipine  treated  group  than  in  the combination  groups.  Most  of  the  findings  were  reversible  following  the  4-week  recovery  period.  In summary, there was no new toxicity or increased severity of the known toxicity associated with each component noted in the 13-week oral toxicity study in rats with aliskiren/amlodipine. The NOAEL was considered to be 90/3 mg/kg/day for aliskiren/amlodipine in this study. In summary, there were no toxicities identified in the 2-week and 13-week oral toxicity study in rats that would be prohibitive for use of the FDC in humans.

## Repeated dose toxicity studies with aliskiren/amlodipine

<!-- image -->

NOAEL = No adverse effect level

The 2-week study is considered to be the dose finding study. There was no new toxicity or increased severity of the known toxicity associated with each component noted in the 13-week oral toxicity study in rats with aliskiren/amlodipine. The NOAEL was considered to be 90/3 mg/kg/day for the FDC. The exposure  multiples  at  dose  of  NOAEL  in  the  13-week  rat  toxicity  study  when  comparing  with  the exposure  levels  at  the  projected  highest  human  dose  (300/10  mg/day  for  aliskiren/amlodipine)  are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relatively low. Overall, these studies raised no major concerns on the potential toxicity of aliskiren/amlodipine FDC.

## 2.3.4.3. Genotoxicity

Genotoxic  potential  of  aliskiren  and  amlodipine  was  fully  evaluated  as  part  of  the  monotherapy development programmes and no genotoxic potential was identified for either aliskiren or amlodipine. It  is,  therefore,  acceptable that no specific genotoxicity tests with Rasilamlo were needed. However, two  genotoxicity  tests  were  performed  to  qualify  the  impurities  detected  in  the  drug  substance  of Rasilamlo,  including  the  mutagenicity  test  using  Salmonella  typhimurium  and  the  chromosome aberration test with cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The results from these assays were negative on genotoxicity potential of impurities of Rasilamlo.

2.3.4.4. Carcinogenicity No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  with  Rasilamlo  since  this  area  has  been  adequately investigated for the monocomponents. The safety profile of Rasilamlo is expected to be same as those for the two components. 2.3.4.5. Reproduction Toxicity No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted with Rasilamlo, since these have been conducted with the monotherapies. This approach is acceptable. 2.3.4.6. Toxicokinetic data Toxicokinetic analyses of the two components, aliskiren and amlodipine, were included in the toxicity studies and no new safety signals have been identified. 2.3.4.7. Local Tolerance No specific local tolerance studies were conducted with Rasilamlo and this is considered acceptable. 2.3.4.8. Other toxicity studies No specific studies have been conducted with Rasilamlo. 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment The  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  aliskiren/amlodipine  fixed  dose  combination  tablets (150/5  mg,  150/10  mg,  300/5  mg  and  300/10  mg)  was  provided  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP guideline  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  The  active  molecules  were  assessed  separately.  Predicted environmental concentrations for aliskiren and amlodipine exceed the threshold value of 0.01 μ L and trigger a Phase II - Tier A for both substances. Aliskiren shows low acute and chronic toxicity towards aquatic organisms. Based on the low adsorption coefficient determined for sludge, partitioning to soil is not  expected  for  aliskiren.  Bioaccumulation  is  not  expected.  The  value  of  log  Koc  &lt;  4  in  the adsorption/desorption study suggests a low to moderate sorption to soil and sludge and aliskiren has no  significant  potential  to  inhibit  the  microbial  activity  of  activated  sludge,  and  is  not  readily biodegradable. Photodegradation is expected to be minimal. Although a highly conservative approach in  predicted  environmental  concentrations  (PEC)  calculation  has  been  adopted,  the  determined  PEC values are well below the recommended threshold values indicated in the CHMP guidelines. Results of Tier B risk assessment on sediment dwelling organisms, in particular on the midge larvae Chironomus riparius , suggests that no risk for the sediment compartment due to exposure to aliskiren is expected.

However, amlodipine shows significant chronic toxicity to aquatic species with the green algae species Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata being the most sensitive species tested. Moreover, amlodipine has the potential to inhibit the microbial activity of activated sludge at concentrations higher than 10 mg/L and toxicity to fish early-life stage seems to appear at concentration of 1mg/L. Nevertheless, amlodipine is neither considered to be stable in the surface water, based on its photolability, nor is it persistent in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sediment compartments. The PEC values are below the recommended threshold values indicated in the CHMP guidelines. Amlodipine is not expected to bioaccumulate.

According  to  the  results  of  the  test  entitled  'Transformation  in  Aquatic  Sediment  Systems  test' conducted with amlodipine, DT90 sediment equals 35-53 days. It means that more than 10% of the test substance is present in the sediment after 14 days thus, triggering a Tier B risk assessment on sediment  dwelling  organisms.  Moreover,  Metabolite  Met5  is  present  in  the  sediment  up  to  99  days accounting  for  37.1%  of  the  applied  test  substance  radioactivity.  As  regards  Met5,  a  Tier  B  risk assessment on toxicity to sediment dwelling organisms should be provided as this was agreed as part of the post-authorisation follow-up measure. According to the OECD  308, metabolites with concentration  &gt;10%  in  total  system  water/sediment  should  be  identified,  as  it's  the  case  for  Met1, Met2, Met6, Met8, and Met10. Thus, the CHMP has requested the relevant documentation as follow-up measure. The results from these additional studies  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee before the adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with  Article  6  of  Regulation  726/2004  having  regard  to  the  requirements  of  Article  8(3)  (ca)  of Directive 2001/83.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects No specific  studies  with  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  fixed  combination  have  been  conducted  concerning primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamics,  safety  pharmacology,  animal  pharmacokinetics,  singledose toxicity, genotoxic potential, carcinogenic potential, reproductive and developmental toxicity and special toxicity studies. For all of the above aspects, reference is made to previous studies conducted with the single components aliskiren and amlodipine, conducted either in animals or in humans, and assuming  that  the  individual  components  of  the  fixed  association  were  not  expected  to  behave differently when given in combination. As far as pharmacodynamics was concerned, the lack of special studies was also justified by the unavailability of appropriate animal models. Animal toxicokinetic -but not pharmacokinetic- data have been obtained from sub-groups of animals within the pivotal 2-week and 13-week repeated dose toxicity studies. Further support for limiting the number of specific studies in the pre-clinical development plan derived from the indications of the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005 guideline in order to reduce the use of experimental animals. Overall, the pre-clinical developmental plan  was  limited  to  a  minimum  essential  number  of  studies.  The  CHMP  considered  this  approach acceptable. Two  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  performed  using  free  or  fixed  combination  of  aliskiren  and amlodipine to support the present application. The 2-week aliskiren oral dose range finding study in rats in combination with amlodipine was conducted in-house according to GLP-like standards. The 13week GLP study was a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in the rat followed by a 4-week recovery, conducted and reported in compliance with the current requirements of the GLP regulations. Overall, these  studies  raised  no  major  concerns  on  the  potential  toxicity  of  Rasilamlo  FDC.  While  the assessment of environmental risk for aliskiren was considered acceptable, there is a post-authorisation follow-up measure to be conducted in order to better clarify the environmental toxicity of amlodipine. 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects Overall,  the  pre-clinical  developmental  plan  was  limited  to  a  minimum  essential  number  of  studies. This is acceptable. The available nonclinical safety data including the results obtained from the 2-week and  13-week  oral  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  genotoxicity  studies  with  Rasilamlo  impurities  and  the environmental risk assessment did not identify any new safety issues. The nonclinical safety profile of aliskiren/amlodipine appears to be consistent with those established for aliskiren and amlodipine when used as monotherapy. Based on the available clinical safety data with the two monotherapy, aliskiren and  amlodipine,  it  is  concluded  that  the  FDC  should  be  well  tolerated  when  used  in  human  at  the proposed dosage. The environmental toxicity profile of amlodipine will be better characterised in frame of an agreed follow-up measure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.4.3. Pharmacokinetics

Rasilamlo  is  a  fixed  combination  of  two  drug  substances  already  approved  in  EU,  aliskiren  and amlodipine. In support of the submission, the new fixed dose combination was compared with the free combination  in  two  pivotal  bioequivalence  studies.  Biowaivers  were  requested  for  the  remaining strengths.  The main goals of these studies were to justify the substitution (third-line) indication and to allow bridging to existing efficacy and safety data generated for the first and second line indications. Overall, four pharmacokinetic studies were submitted as listed in the table below.

| authorised   |
|--------------|

In  the  pivotal  efficacy  phase  III  trials,  the  Final  Market  Image  (FMI)  aliskiren/amlodipine  fixed combination  tablets  were  used,  while  the  free  combination  was  used  in  the  long  term  safety  trial. Therefore,  bioequivalence  (BE)  had  to  be  demonstrated  between  the  FMI  formulation  and  the  free combination formulations. In addition, demonstration of BE between FMI combination tablets and the free combination formulations also fulfils the requirement of the Guideline on clinical development of fixed  combination  medicinal  products,  requiring  a  BE  study  to  be  performed  between  the  free combination of the recognised reference formulations of the individual monocomponents and the final marketed formulation. Two definitive BE studies were conducted with the dose strengths of 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg of aliskiren/amlodipine. The studies employed an open-label, randomised, single dose, two period, two sequence, crossover design. Washout between treatments was 14 days. The subjects enrolled were male healthy subjects. The studies were correctly designed and carried out. The results of the studies show that under fasting conditions, the fixed combination FMI tablets are bioequivalent to the free combination forms. Bioequivalence was evaluated under fasting conditions, while the SmPC recommends taking Rasilamlo after light meal. But based on recommendations in the CHMP Guidance, EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006,  the  study  results  are  acceptable  because  the  SmPC  recommends  to take  Rasilamlo  with  food  to  avoid  large  concentration  fluctuations  and  consequently  to  improve  its tolerability. The results of these two pivotal bioequivalence studies are acceptable. Biowaivers are considered appropriate for the 150/5 mg and 300/5 mg dose strengths based on the compositional proportionality/similarity, linear pharmacokinetics within the registered dose range, and similarity in vitro dissolution properties.

The influence of a high-fat meal on the bioavailability of the 300/10 mg fixed combination FMI tablet was investigated in an open-label, randomised, single dose, two period, two sequence, crossover study CSPA100A2104.  Based  on  the  geometric  mean  ratios,  aliskiren  AUC  and  C max under  fed  conditions were reduced by 80% and 90%, respectively, when compared to fasted conditions. Bioavailability of amlodipine was not significantly affected by food. The study confirms a marked decrease in aliskiren bioavailability was elicited by food. The decrease found in the present study was higher than that found in  previous  studies  with  aliskiren  alone  or  aliskiren/HCTZ  (AUC  reduction  60  to  70%)  and  similar  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that  found  with  aliskiren/valsartan  (AUC:  -76%;  C max :  -88%).  Overall,  these  data  suggest  that  the effect of food may also be dependent on formulation.

## 2.4.3.1. Absorption, distribution and elimination

Pharmacokinetics of aliskiren and amlodipine have been reviewed and assessed in previous studies and below is a summary of their profiles based on data available from these investigations.

Aliskiren shows a very low bioavailability (2.6%). Absorption is probably also mediated by unidentified active transporters. Food markedly decreased aliskiren bioavailability by about 70%. Aliskiren is only moderately  bound  to  plasma  protein  (47-51%),  is  poorly  metabolised  and  is  excreted  mainly  as unchanged drug into the bile, its urinary excretion being minimal. Hepatic uptake and biliary excretion are predominantly mediated by transporters. Plasma clearance was found to be 0.13 L/h/kg. Terminal half-life is about 40 h (ranging from 30 to 60 hours) and was found to be slightly longer in the elderly (&gt;65 years). In the elderly (&gt;65 years), exposure is increased by about 50%, with respect to subjects aged 18-45 years. In subjects with renal impairment, Cmax and Cmin are both about 2-fold higher than in subjects with normal renal function. The increase appears to be not related to the decrease of renal function. In subjects with hepatic impairment, exposure is not increased. Time needed to reach steadystate is 7-12 days. The accumulation factor is 1.5-2. Apparent clearance did not change with repeated administration.  Pharmacokinetics  slightly  deviated  from  linearity  in  the  whole  range  of  investigated doses. Pharmacokinetics of aliskiren was found to be highly variable. The inter-subject variability for Cmax and AUC was 40-70% and 30-50%, respectively. The intra-subject variability for aliskiren Cmax and AUC was 40% and 20%, respectively. Aliskiren does not inhibit any of the CYP450 enzymes at therapeutic  concentrations. In  vivo data  suggest  that  aliskiren  is  not  an  enzyme  inducer.  When administered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. An interaction study with ciclosporin has shown that ciclosporin increased aliskiren AUC by 4.5 to 5.5-fold, and Cmax by 2.5-fold, independently of ciclosporin dose. Ciclosporin markedly increased aliskiren t 1/2 . This result confirms that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren clearance. Amlodipine is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, absolute bioavailability being between  52%  and  88%.  Absorption  is  not  influenced  by  food.  Amlodipine  has  a  high  volume  of distribution (Vd) of 21 L/Kg, which could be due to high membrane affinity of the drug. Approximately 93%  of  circulating  amlodipine  is  bound  to  plasma  proteins  in  hypertensive  patients.  Amlodipine  is extensively  (about  90%)  converted  to  inactive  metabolites via hepatic  metabolism  with  10%  of  the parent  compound  and  60%  of  the  metabolites  excreted  in  the  urine.  The  elimination  half-life  of amlodipine is approximately 40 hrs. Amlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between 5 mg and 10 mg.  Elderly  patients  have  decreased  clearance  of  amlodipine  with  a  resulting  increase  in  AUC  of approximately  40-60%.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  amlodipine  is  not  significantly  influenced  by  renal impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have a decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase  in  AUC  of  approximately  40-60%;  therefore,  a  lower  initial  dose  of  amlodipine  may  be required. 2.4.3.2. Dose proportionality and time dependencies No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. 2.4.3.3. Special populations No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. 2.4.3.4. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Interaction  between  aliskiren  (300  mg/day)  and  amlodipine  (10  mg/day)  was  investigated  at  a steady-state in young healthy subjects. In the SPP100A2218 study, drug products were administered under  fasting  conditions.  Amlodipine  co-administration  significantly  increased  aliskiren  AUC ss ,  C max and  Cmin.  Inspection  of  aliskiren  time-courses  indicated  that  amlodipine  co-administration  likely altered the absorption features of aliskiren. The mechanism of the effect of amlodipine is unknown but may be related to inhibition or modulation of P-glycoprotein activity by amlodipine, aliskiren PK being very sensitive to P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Hence, the effect of amlodipine might depend on the dose ratio of the two drugs and thus, might be greater with the 150/10 mg combination, which was not investigated. In addition, food decreases aliskiren absorption, but the overall effect of amlodipine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and food is unknown even though the proposed SmPC recommends that the drug product should be taken with food. Finally, interaction data in the elderly are missing. The CHMP considered that these data may be important because of the likely differences in the absorption of aliskiren in different age groups. The published pharmacodynamic studies indicate that an interaction at the absorption site between  amlodipine  and  aliskiren  is  theoretically  possible  and  that  the  extent  of  their  interaction depends on the dose (plasma concentration) ratio. However, the data from the pivotal clinical trial provide sufficient evidence that an eventual interaction has no clinically significant effects.

## 2.4.3.5. Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No specific studies were conducted. 2.4.4. Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies with the aliskiren/amlodipine combination have been performed.  The  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  aliskiren  and  amlodipine  are  well  characterised  and relevant information is reflected in their SmPCs. 2.4.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology The  main  issue  under  discussion  in  the  initial  phase  of  the  evaluation  was  that  the  bioequivalence studies were performed under fasting conditions, whereas the  proposed  SmPC  recommends administration of the medicinal product with a light meal. Since available data show that food has a marked  effect  on  aliskiren  bioavailability  and  that  the  effect  of  food  may  also  be  dependent  on formulation, it was considered that a BE study under fed conditions was therefore needed to support the substitution indication. Nevertheless, the indication substitution therapy has finally been withdrawn during the procedure. Interaction between aliskiren (300 mg/day) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) was investigated at steadystate  in  healthy  subjects  and  products  were  administered  under  fasting  conditions.  Amlodipine  coadministration increased aliskiren AUCss, Cmax and Cmin and appears to alter the absorption features of aliskiren.  The  mechanism  of  this  effect  may  be  related  to  inhibition  or  modulation  of  P-glycoprotein activity by amlodipine. The effect of amlodipine was considered to be dependant on the dose ratio of the two drugs and food. However, clinical data from clinical trial CSPA100A2305 were presented and showed that the association of aliskiren 150 mg and amlodipine 10 mg does not lead to unpredictable clinical effects. Patients on the FDC 150/10 mg dose showed good efficacy and safety when the drug was administered without regards to food intake. The standard error for the DBP reduction observed with 150/10 mg was the same as for other doses, indicating that there was no greater variability with this  dose.  Moreover,  no  new  safety  issues  were  identified  with  any  of  the  aliskiren/amlodipine combination  doses  studied,  including  150/10  mg.  Therefore,  the  data  from  clinical  trials  provide sufficient  evidence  that  an  eventual  interaction  has  no  clinically  significant  effects.  The  recently published  data  on  rifampicin  decreasing  the  bioavailability  of  aliskiren  by  about  50%  have  been included in the SmPC of Rasilamlo, as required by the CHMP. 2.4.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Rasilamlo  is  a  fixed  combination  of  two  drug  substances  already  approved  in  EU,  aliskiren  and amlodipine. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles have been adequately characterised during  the  drug  development  of  each  substance.  The  core  clinical  pharmacology  studies  were  the bioequivalence studies performed to bridge the data between the Final Market Image aliskiren/amlodipine fixed combination tablets used in the pivotal efficacy phase III trials and the free combination used in the long term safety trial. Two definitive BE studies were conducted with the dose strengths of 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg of aliskiren/amlodipine. The studies were correctly designed and carried out. The results of the studies show that under fasting conditions, the fixed combination FMI tablets are bioequivalent to the free combination forms. Demonstration of BE under fed conditions is  not  deemed necessary as the substitution and first line therapy indications have been withdrawn. The biowaiver request for the 150/5 mg and 300/5 mg strengths is acceptable, being supported by all the data and information required by the valid CHMP guidelines on bioequivalence. Interaction between aliskiren  (300  mg/day)  and  amlodipine  (10  mg/day)  was  investigated  at  steady-state  in  healthy subjects  under  fasting  conditions.  In  the  study,  drug  products  were  administered  under  fasting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

conditions.  Amlodipine  co-administration  increased  aliskiren  disposition.  Although  theoretically  the extent of interaction may depend on the dose ratio, and also be different under fed conditions, data from clinical trials show that the clinical consequence of this presumed interaction is not significant.

## 2.4.7.1. Dose response study(ies)

The  clinical  program  does  not  include  true  dose-response  studies  but  the  proposal  of  four  different dosages of the FDC is acceptable because they include all the dosages available in the market for the two monocomponents, aliskiren and amlodipine.

Focus on long-term use of the aliskiren/amlodipine combination

Study  SPA2305  was  a  multifactorial  comparison  of  4  doses  of  aliskiren/amlodipine  to  each  of  the monotherapy components.  It served to support the use of the combination as first-line therapy, since patients  whose  BP  was  unlikely  to  be  controlled  by  a  single  agent,  such  as  those  with  stage  2 hypertension  and  co-morbidities  (diabetes  and  renal  impairment)  were  included,  and  since  all randomised patients received aliskiren/amlodipine fixed combination treatment without titration from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monotherapy.  Mean  24-hour  ABPM  was  evaluated  in  a  subset  of  the  study  patient  population  in support of the once-daily dosing. However, this study failed to provide convincing evidence in support of  the  first  line  indication  of  Rasilamlo.  In  light  of  the  above  and  considering  that  the  first  line indication was not approvable, the results of this study will not be the main focus of the report, and will be mentioned as supportive data in the appropriate sections.

Studies  SPA2303,  SPA2304  and  SPP2305  were  double-blind,  randomised,  active-controlled  and performed  in  patients  not  adequately  controlled  by  one  or  the  other  monotherapy.  These  studies provide the data to support the use of the combination as add-on therapy in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2004. Study SPA2303  was  conducted  in  patients  who  were  inadequately  controlled  by  aliskiren  300  mg,  study SPA2304  and  study  SPP2305  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  amlodipine  (10  mg  and  5  mg, respectively).  These  studies  are  considered  the  be  the  main  clinical  trials  in  support  of  the  add-on indication for Rasilamlo.

Studies SPA2303, SPA2304, SPP2305: All trials had 3 phases and began with a 1- to 4-week washout phase to allow patients to taper off previous antihypertensive treatments, followed by a 4-week singleblind active run-in period. Non-responding patients were then randomised to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment  in  Study  SPA2303  and  Study  SPA2304,  and  6  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment  in  Study SPP2305. Summary of treatments is provided in the table below.

Supportive study SPA2301 was an uncontrolled, open-label study to investigate on long-term use of the maximum dose of aliskiren/amlodipine (1 year). This study is in line with the requirements of the ICH Guideline on Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety E1, 1995, which addresses the extent of population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term treatment of  non-life  threatening  disease.  Study  SPP2323  and  its  extension  Study  SPP2323E1  evaluated  longterm (52 weeks) use of aliskiren based regimen vs HCT-based regimen. Since these studies allowed the  optional  addition  of  amlodipine  they  provide  additional  data  about  the  long-term  use  of aliskiren/amlodipine combination. Methods Study Participants Studies SPA2303, SPA2304, SPP2305: The populations evaluated in the short-term, active controlled, non-responder studies were those who required combination therapy due to inadequate BP control with monotherapy. Study SPA2303 in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren 300  mg monotherapy, study SPA2304 and study SPP2305 in patients not adequately controlled with amlodipine (10 mg and 5 mg, respectively) monotherapy. Patients enrolled in the active-controlled non-responder studies were required to have an msDBP of ≥ 90 mmHg and &lt;110 mmHg after the 4-week run-in with aliskiren  or  amlodipine.  Differences  between  short-term,  active-controlled,  non-responder  studies included  a  larger  percentage  of  Black  patients  in  study  SPP2305  ( ≥ 16.3%  within  each  treatment group) compared with study SPA2303 (0% to 0.4% within each treatment group) and none in study SPA2304. There was a larger  percentage  of  Asian  patients  in  study  SPA2303  (&gt;26.5%  within  each treatment group) vs study SPP2305 (10.0% to 12.4%) and study SPA2304 (0% to 0.4%). Exclusion criteria were generally similar across all trials. Patients with severe hypertension, secondary hypertension, evidence of significant hepatic or renal impairment, unstable diabetes, significant cardiac disease, and history of hypertensive encephalopathy or cerebrovascular accident were not included in most trials. Concomitant medications that could significantly affect BP or were known to interact with the study drug were also excluded. However, the CHMP noted that drug taking was not standardised in terms of food intake. Treatments Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study SPP2305: The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline (Visit 4, Day 1) to endpoint (Visit 7, Day 42) in msDBP at trough, as measured by the Omron HEM-705CP automatic blood pressure monitor and appropriate size cuff. The secondary efficacy variables included the change from baseline (Visit 4, Day 1) to endpoint (Visit 7, Day 42) in msSBP at trough, the proportion of responders (msDBP &lt;90 mm Hg or a reduction or ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline, and the proportion of patients achieving blood pressure control (msSBP&lt; 140 mm Hg and msDBP &lt; 90 mm Hg) in each treatment group.

Objectives The primary objective was change from baseline in msDBP for all short-term and long-term controlled studies, which is consistent with ICH Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Hypertensive Drugs E12, 2000. Secondary efficacy variables in all studies included change from baseline to Endpoint in msSBP, BP control rates (msSBP &lt;140 mmHg and msDBP &lt;90 mmHg), as well as aggressive BP control rates for msSBP &lt;130 mmHg and msDBP &lt;80 mmHg), DBP response defined as an msDBP &lt;90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg decrease compared to baseline, SBP response defined as msSBP &lt;140 mmHg or a ≥ 20 mmHg decrease  compared  to  baseline,  mean  ABPM  (in  Study  SPA2305),  and  the  biomarkers  (PRA and/or PRC) as exploratory objective. The CHMP considered the objectives of the studies as adequately defined. Outcomes/endpoints Study SPA2303: Efficacy variables included changes from baseline (Visit 4) to Endpoint in msDBP and msSBP,  the  proportions  of  patients  achieving  a  BP  control  target  of  &lt;140/90  mmHg,  and  the proportions  of  patients  achieving  a  response  (msDBP:  &lt;90  mmHg  or  a ≥ 10  mmHg  reduction  from baseline and msSBP: &lt;140mmHg or ≥ 20 mmHg reduction from baseline). Study SPA2304: Efficacy variables included changes from baseline (Visit 5) to endpoint in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) and mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP), the proportions of patients  achieving  a  blood  pressure  control  target  of  msSBP/msDBP&lt;  140  /  90  mmHg,  and  the proportions of patients achieving a diastolic blood pressure response (msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg reduction from baseline).

## Sample size

A total of 5570 patients were treated in studies: SPA2305, SPA2303, SPA2304, SPP2305, SPA2301, SPP2323 and SPP2323E1, including 2835 patients who received at least 1 dose of any aliskiren/amlodipine  combination,  and  86  patients  who  received  hydrochlorothiazide  add-on  to aliskiren/amlodipine combination. Among these 5570 treated patients, 21 patients in Study SPP2323 were excluded from the safety analyses because they were only treated with placebo for a short period of time and never re-randomized to receive aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide treatment in this long-term study. Sample size of the studies matches the zero hypotheses.

## Randomisation

All  eligible  patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  treatment  arms  using  the  IVRS  system  if appropriate,  which  assigned  a  randomization  number  to  the  patient  following  the  confirmation  of inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  The  randomisation  number  was  not  communicated  to  the  investigator. Randomisation  was  stratified  by  centre.  The  randomisation  scheme  for  patients  was  reviewed  and approved by a member of the Biostatistics Quality Assurance Group. Blinding (masking) Once  patients  fulfilled  the  entry  criteria  to  enter  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  patients, investigator  staff,  persons  performing  the  assessments,  and  data  analysts  remained  blind  to  the identity  of  the  treatment  from  the  time  of  randomization  until  database  lock,  using  the  following methods: a/ randomization data were kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and were not accessible by anyone else involved in the study; b/ the identity of the treatments was concealed by the  use  of  study  drugs  that  were  all  identical  in  packaging,  labelling,  schedule  of  administration, appearance  and  odour.  A  double-dummy  design  was  used  because  the  identity  of  the  medications could  not  be  disguised  due  to  their  different  forms.  Unblinding  only  occurred  in  the  case  of  patient emergencies  (see  below)  and  at  the  conclusion  of  the  study.  Emergency  unblinding  was  only undertaken when it was essential for effective treatment of the patient. Statistical methods For  studies  SPA2305,  SPA2303,  SPA2304,  SPP2305,  SPP2323  and  SPP2323E1,  the  primary  efficacy variable  (change  from  baseline  in  msDBP)  was  analysed  by  a  pre-specified,  2-way  analysis  of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and region as factors, and baseline as a covariate. The region was  pre-specified  prior  to  unblinding  treatment  codes  for  analyses.  The  same  model  was  used  to analyze the change from baseline in msSBP. The response rates and the overall BP control rate were analysed by means of a logistic regression model with treatment and region as factors, and baseline BP measurement as a covariate. The statistical methods, as proposed, were considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study SPP2305 Recruitment Medicinal product no longer authorised

For studies SPA2305, SPA2303 and SPA2304 the study period was between September 2008 and June 2009. Study SPP2305 was conducted between February and October 2005.

## Conduct of the study

Studies SPA2303 and SPA2304

The protocols of studies SPA2303 and SPA2304 were not amended. All analyses were carried out as specified in the protocol. No changes in the studies' conduct occurred.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study SPP2305

The protocol of the study SPP2305 was amended twice. Amendment 1, issued before any patients were enrolled in the study concerned the collection of blood samples for the analysis of PRA in a subset of patients  at  Visit  4  and  Visit  7.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  an  automatic  blood  pressure  monitor  rather than a standard mercury sphygmomanometer for the assessment of blood pressure at each visit in the study was required. Amendment 2, issued after the inclusion of 27.6% of patients, allowed an optional two week extension of the washout period prior to the start of single-blind amlodipine in this study. This option was needed as the initial two week washout did not allow sufficient time for blood pressure to rise above normal ranges for a large number of the subjects initially screened. This amendment did not have impact on patient safety as patients with msDBP ≥ 110 mmHg or msSBP ≥ 180 mmHg at any time during the study were to be discontinued from the trial.

Outcomes and estimation Studies SPA2303, SPA2304 and SPP2305 Changes  from  baseline  in  msDBP  and  msSBP: The  below  tables  present  the  statistical  analyses  of changes from baseline in msDBP and msSBP at Endpoint in the active-controlled non-responder trials. For  all  3  active-controlled  non-responder  trials,  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  combination  treatment  was clinically and statistically superior to the respective monotherapies in reduction of msDBP and msSBP. In  study  SPA2304, when aliskiren was added to amlodipine 10 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and aliskiren/amlodipine 150/10 mg were both clinically and statistically superior to amlodipine 10 mg at Endpoint in reduction of msDBP (-3.76 and -1.72 mmHg over amlodipine 10 mg, respectively) and msSBP (-6.22 and -2.81 mmHg over amlodipine 10 mg, respectively). Similarly, in study SPA2303, when amlodipine was added to aliskiren 300 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and aliskiren/amlodipine  300/5  mg  were  both  clinically  and  statistically  superior  to  aliskiren  300  mg  at Endpoint  in  reduction  of  msDBP  (-7.23  and  -4.71  mmHg  over  aliskiren  300  mg,  respectively)  and msSBP  (-11.62  and  -  8.01  mmHg  over  aliskiren  300  mg,  respectively).  In  Study  SPP2305,  the combined aliskiren/amlodipine 150/5 mg treatment group showed a significantly greater reduction (p &lt;0.0001) in msDBP compared to the amlodipine 5 mg treatment group at Endpoint, with an additional mean reduction in msDBP of 3.62 mmHg and in msSBP of 6.02 mmHg. Aliskiren/amlodipine 150/5 mg had a numerically greater (but not statistically significant) SBP/DBP reduction than amlodipine 10 mg, with an incremental change of 1.35/0.42 mmHg.

Study SPP2305 BP response rate: DBP response rates (percentages of patients with msDBP &lt;90 mmHg and/or a ≥ 10 mmHg reduction from baseline in msDBP) were summarised in the active controlled trials. With the exception  of  one  comparison,  statistical  superiority  in  the  DBP  response  rate  was  observed  in  all studied  doses  of  aliskiren/amlodipine  combinations  compared  to  component  monotherapies.  The exception  was  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  150/10  mg  vs.  amlodipine  10  mg  comparison  in  study SPA2304, where the aliskiren/amlodipine 150/10 mg combination showed a numerically greater DBP response rate in comparison to amlodipine 10 mg that did not reach statistical significance. Results for SBP response rates (percentages of patients with msSBP &lt;140 mmHg or a reduction from baseline ≥ 20  mmHg)  showed  statistical  superiority  to  component  monotherapies  in  all  studied  doses  of aliskiren/amlodipine combinations in study SPA2303 and study SPA2304. SBP response rate was not performed for study SPP2305. Ancillary analyses Overall BP control rate, DBP control rate and SBP control rate: For patients whose BP was uncontrolled (&gt;140/90  mmHg)  at  baseline,  each  of  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  combination  dose  groups  had  a statistically or at least numerically greater proportion of patients with overall BP control (msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg) than component monotherapy or placebo groups at Endpoint. The greatest BP control rate was seen with the aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg group (68.1%) and with 10mg amlodipine group it was 50.3%. The DBP control rate (msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg) and SBP control rate (msSBP &lt; 140 mmHg) were similar to the overall BP control rates. Blood pressure control rate in patients uncontrolled at baseline by renal function and diabetic status: In general, the aliskiren/amlodipine combination therapies resulted in a higher percentage of controlled patients  (msSBP/msDBP  &lt;  140/90  mmHg)  at  Endpoint  than  component  monotherapies  or  placebo regardless of renal impairment or diabetic status, as stated by the applicant. However, patients with 30 ≤ eGFR were excluded from all of the studies and the proportion of patients with moderate renal failure and of patients with diabetes were small and limit the interpretation data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Time to BP control in patients uncontrolled at baseline: The greater BP control rate and aggressive BP control rates with aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg combination over monotherapies and placebo were seen as early as week 1 and maintained throughout the study, with a similar trend observed for other doses.  These  results  indicate  that  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  aliskiren/amlodipine combination  will  achieve  BP  control  earlier  than  with  either  component  monotherapy.  The  detailed statistical analysis broken down to weeks after starting the treatment is not presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stage  2  hypertension: Study  SPA2305  included  1074  stage  2  hypertension  patients,  of  which  463 received  combination  therapy.  Patients  with  stage  2  hypertension  treated  with  aliskiren/amlodipine combination  demonstrated  clinically  meaningful  and  numerically  greater  reductions  in  msDBP  and msSBP compared with placebo and the component monotherapies. Although the sample size for the subgroup  of  stage  2  patients  may  not  have  sufficient  power  to  detect  treatment  differences,  the greater  reductions  in  msDBP  and  msSBP  with  aliskiren/amlodipine  combinations  showed  statistical superiority  in  most  comparisons,  with  the  exception  of  comparisons  to  amlodipine  10  mg  for aliskiren/amlodipine  150/10  mg  (msDBP and msSBP) and aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg (msSBP). Even  in  this  hypertensive  population,  over  60%  of  patients  achieved  BP  control  with  the  high-dose combination  (aliskiren/amlodipine  300/10  mg).  Stage  2  patients  receiving  the  fixed  combination therapies  had  statistically  greater  BP  control  rates  than  placebo  or  component  monotherapies  at Endpoint, with the exception of aliskiren/amlodipine 150/10 mg vs. amlodipine 10 mg which showed a clinical meaningful incremental BP control rate of 13.4%, though the difference did not reach statistical significance.  In  conclusion,  the  results  of  the  ancillary  analyses  gave  support  for  the  enhanced antihypertensive effect of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine over placebo and in the majority of the cases also over the monotherapies.

A hierarchical multiple testing strategy was used for the analyses of primary endpoint, change from baseline in msDBP. First, aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg) was compared to aliskiren 300 mg. If aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg) was statistically superior to aliskiren 300 mg, then further assessment for efficacy of aliskiren/amlodipine (300/5 mg) compared to aliskiren 300 mg was made.

Additional analysis of the efficacy of the fixed dose combination were performed in patients with stage 2  hypertension  combining  data  from  different  studies  (SPA2305,  SPA2306,  SPAUS01  and  SPA2307) Specifically, the BP lowering effect of the high dose combination versus monotherapy was investigated. The analysis across the above mentioned studies confirmed the efficacy of the high dose combination in patients with stage 2 hypertension.

## Short-term studies

## Supportive study SPP2305

This  is  a  6-week  double-blind  multicenter,  randomised  parallel-group  study  for  comparison  of  FDC (aliskire/amlodipine (Ali/Aml) 150/5 mg) to amlodipine alone (5 and 10 mg) in patients with untreated essential hypertension stage 1-2 (msDBP ≥ 95 mm Hg and &lt;110 mm Hg) not controlled by 5 mg Aml alone.    The  effects  of  the  combination  aliskiren  150  +  amlodipine  5  mg  were  compared  to  data  of Placebo + Aml 5 mg in patients with hypertension stage 1-2 not controlled after 4-week treatment with Aml alone 5 mg. Thus, this study integrates the main information of the preceding study (main study SPA2304) which investigated only the comparison between aliskiren/amlodipine 150 mg/10 mg and Aml 10 mg alone. The design of the study included a 2-4 weeks washout period, a 4-week single-blind run in period in which patients received Aml 5 mg monotherapy, and a 6-week double-blind treatment period (3 periods and 7 visits). The study, inclusive of all phases lasted 12-14 wk/patient.

Effects on blood pressure: Treatment with the combination at the Ali/Aml 150/5 mg dosage induced a blood pressure reduction greater than Aml 5 mg alone. In the comparison of Ali150/Aml5 mg vs Aml 5 mg, the LSM difference in change from baseline to study end was -5.9 mm Hg for average msSBP, and -  3.5  mm  Hg  for  average  msDBP.    These  differences  were  statistically  significant  (P&lt;0.001).  The percentage of patients with controlled hypertension at the end of the study was approximately 1.9time higher using the combination, than Aml alone (43% vs 23%, P&lt;0.001)).  Findings tend to be consistent  in  subgroup  analyses  but  there  were  a  low  number  of  patients  in  some  subgroups.    The treatment with 5 mg Aml alone was associated with higher incidence of drug-related AEs than Ali150 mg + Aml5 mg but the incidence of serious AEs was higher during the treatment with combination. It is impossible to assess the confounding on these data due to the fact that aliskiren administration was not standardized with a light meal as per CHMP recommendations.

## Summary of trials providing long-term data

Study SPA2301 and  Study SPP2323 with  its  extension Study  SPP2323E1 provide  supportive evidence of efficacy. Study SPA2301 Study SPA2301 was performed to assess long-term (1 year) safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy (secondary endpoint) of the maximum dose of Ali/Aml (300/10 mg) combination. This study included 556 patients, of which 470 were treated with Ali/Aml without requiring the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). Patients who received the optional HCTZ add-on treatment were considered more resistant  to  therapy  and  more  difficult  to  treat.  The  mean  duration  of  treatment  with  Ali/Aml 300/10  mg  (without  HCT)  for  the  546  pooled  patients  who  continued  into  the  52-week  high-dose treatment period was 282.5 days, indicating an adequate exposure to study medication. In the group of patients treated with the FDC alone, number of patients was 101 for age group ≥ 65 years and 24 for age group ≥ 75 years. Effects on blood pressure: Clinically meaningful mean reductions from baseline in msDBP and msSBP were seen as early as Week 2, and this effect was maintained over the entire 54 weeks of the study. Approximately 16% of the study population required the addition of HCT to the Ali/Aml regimen. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Blood pressure reduction: The Ali-based regimen was statistically superior to the HCT-based regimen in reduction of msDBP and msSBP at the Week 26 endpoint and for msDBP at the Week 52 endpoint. For  msSBP  at  Week  52,  the  Ali-based  regimen  was  non-inferior  to  the  HCT  regimen  and  was numerically, but not statistically superior to the HCT-based regimen. A further reduction in msDBP and msSBP, and an increased percentage of patients achieving BP control, was observed after Week  12 following the addition of Aml to the Ali-based or the HCT-based treatment group. A specific analysis carried out in patients treated with the combination Ali/Aml, showed a clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both msSBP and msDBP, indicating that in patients whose BP was not controlled with Ali monotherapy, adding Aml provides additional BP lowering effect.

Blood  pressure  control  rate  and  BP  response  rate: The  BP  control  rate  (msSBP  &lt;140  mmHg  and msDBP  &lt;90  mmHg)  was  31.1%  after  2  weeks  and  increased  to  74.3%  at  the  endpoint.  A  large majority  of  patients  (89.7%)  achieved  a  DBP  response  (percentages  of  patients  with  msDBP  &lt;90 mmHg and/or  a ≥ 10  mmHg  reduction  from  baseline  in  msDBP)  at  Endpoint.  Consistent  with  the results observed for BP reductions, a higher percentage of patients treated with Ali/Aml/HCT achieved BP  control  and  DBP  response  after  Week  10  following  the  addition  of  HCT. Data  on  efficacy  are  of limited relevance because this is an open-label uncontrolled study. These uncontrolled long-term data on efficacy substantially confirm the observations of 8-week, double-blind, controlled studies. Studies SPP2323 + SPP2323E1 Study  SPP2323  and  its  extension  SPP2323E1  provide  supportive  data  for  long-term  efficacy  of  the Ali/Aml combination. Although primarily designed to evaluate Ali and HCT, the optional addition of Aml provides  some  relevant  long-term  experience  with  the  combination  of  Ali  and  Aml  when  used  with another  antihypertensive  agent.  Based  on  the  design  of  this  study,  a  patient  whose  BP  was  not controlled with aliskiren 300 mg or HCTZ 25 mg had optional add-on of amlodipine. The first timepoint with optional amlodipine 5 mg add-on was Week 12 and the first time point with optional Aml 10 mg add-on was Week 18. The demographic distribution of patients was similar to that seen in the shortterm, controlled studies. The study was adequately carried out and completed by 978 (87%) of the 1124 randomised patients.  Overall, the number of patients with age ≥ 65 years was 256 ( ≤ 129 per arm).  Overall number of patients with age ≥ 75 years was 38 (19 per arm). Prevalence of diabetes was  around  11%  in  both  arms.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  to  double-blind  study  medication (329.8 days for aliskiren and 311.9 days for HCT) was similar for the 2 regimens. A slightly greater proportion  of  patients  in  the  HCT-based  regimen  received  Aml  when  compared  to  the  Ali-based regimen. Medicinal product no longer authorised

effect of the high dose combination versus monotherapy. Overall, data from these studies confirmed the efficacy of the high dose combination in patients with stage 2 hypertension. Limited efficacy data for  the  FDC in patients with stage 1 hypertension with additional cardiovascular (CV) risk have also been submitted. A sound conclusion on the efficacy of the FDC in patients with Stage 1 hypertension with additional cardiovascular (CV) risk is thus impossible at present.

## 2.4.9. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  clinical  data  submitted  in  support  of  the  first  line  indication  are  not sufficient. In fact, several issues prevent granting of the first line indication:

i)  Currently,  the  clinical  experience  with  aliskiren  is  considered  limited.  In  the  absence  of  data supporting the existence of a wide therapeutic experience, the benefit-risk of the combination in the first-line indication needs to be explored further with special attention paid to the doses, as used in the fixed combination tablet. An in depth evaluation of the benefit of the FDC in the indication first line therapy has not been performed at present.  In addition, the long term safety profile (&gt; 1 year) of aliskiren has not been adequately characterized. ii)  In  the  clinical  study  SPA2307,  approximately  1/3  of  patients  with  stage  2  hypertension  were adequately controlled after 16-week treatment with a mono-regimen (27.3% with aliskiren and 33.8% with  amlodipine,  respectively).  A  sizeable  percentage  of  patients  would  therefore  be  unnecessarily exposed  to  two  pharmacological  agents  and  to  an  increased  risk  of  adverse  events.  Approximately 58% of patients were controlled with the combination therapy at the Week 16 time point, i.e, 30% more patients with the combination than with the respective monotherapies. Data about benefits of early  blood  pressure  control  in  patients  with  uncomplicated  hypertension  were  not  provided,  not quoted nor reported by the clinical development program. In addition, some data show that incidence of AEs was higher while on treatment with the FDC (Study SPA2303). Although results from Study SPA 2307 do not seem to suggest the possibility of an increased risk of adverse effect with the combination therapy compared to monotherapy, Study SPA2307 was designed to show efficacy as primary objective, therefore  no  conclusive  evaluation  of  the  risk  profile  for  the  combination  versus  the  individual monotherapy regimes is possible. iii)  Study  SPA2305,  the  pivotal  study  submitted  in  support  the  first-line  indication,  failed  to  show superiority in BP control of the intermediate dose combination Ali/Aml 150/10 mg compared to 10 mg amlodipine  monotherapy;  in  addition,  no  difference  in  BP  lowering  effect  was  observed  between Ali/Aml 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg FDCs. Following the CHMP's recommendation for not granting the authorisation for the use of Rasilamlo in the first line indication, the claim for this indication was withdrawn by the applicant. Overall, data support the use of the FDC as a second line treatment, although the additional benefit of the FDC with 150 mg aliskiren versus monotherapy with 10 mg amlodipine seems to be limited. The efficacy of 150 mg aliskiren in the presence of food has been demonstrated in the elderly population (Study SPP2405). A significant BP lowering effect is achieved with the 75 mg dose, and a plateau in the BP lowering effect of aliskiren is apparent at 150 mg dose, with no difference between 150 mg and 300 mg. This does not occur in the adult population where a dose-effect curve is evident in the dose range 75-300 mg, and the 75 mg dose is largely ineffective. Food intake in the adult population may thus  decrease  the  absorption  of  150  mg  aliskiren  and  potentially  reduce  the  BP  lowering  effect  of aliskiren.

In addition, study SPP100A2110 supports the relevance of meal-induced reduction in plasma AUC of aliskiren at steady state. For example, this study shows that aliskiren-induced increase in plasma renin concentration was approximately 2-fold higher when the drug was given in fasting state compared to the fed state.

Study SPP100ADE03 was submitted during the evaluation of the application. It does not directly solve the specific issue of the superiority of the FDC (in particular the combination with 150 mg aliskiren) versus  the  respective  monotherapies  because  it  does  not  contain  a  direct  comparison  of  the combination versus the monotherapies. On the other hand, results of this study are reassuring about the extent of BP lowering effect of 150 mg aliskiren when taken after a light meal. It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  originally  requested  third  line  (substitution) indication  was not  approvable and  was  withdrawn  during  the  procedure.  The  CHMP  identified  two  main  issues  preventing  the approval  of  the  substitution  therapy  for  Rasilamo:  a/  the  demonstration  of  a  wide  therapeutic experience and b/ the demonstration of the bioequivalence between the monocomponents of the FDC and the FDC under fed conditions (light meal). A wide therapeutic experience for aliskiren/amlodipine combination is at present not available. In addition, overall pharmacokinetic data show not only that food induces a large decrease in aliskiren absorption, but also that the effect of food may be dependent on formulation. In the absence of both, the proof of a wide therapeutic experience and results from a bioequivalence  study  under  fed  conditions,  the  indication  substitution  therapy  cannot  be  granted  at present. GCP inspection-related issues In  the  context  of  the  assessment  of  a  related  application  for  the  triple  fixed  dose  combination Rasilamlo  HCT,  the  CHMP  requested  a  GCP  inspection  of  the  clinical  study  SAH100A2302  (pivotal efficacy study submitted within the application for the triple combination Rasilamlo HCT). As this study is also part of the application for Rasilamlo double combination, the outcome of this inspection and the responses to its findings were required to be submitted as part of the responses to the outstanding issues identified by the CHMP for the Rasilamlo application. The conclusion of the GCP Inspectors was that the data from study SAH100A2302 raised questions regarding GCP compliance at a global level and similar non-compliance issues could be found at other study sites. A major objection concerning the potential impact of the inspections findings on the Rasilamlo dossier was raised by the CHMP, and this issue was requested to be addressed in an oral explanation. The oral explanation focused on two points: i. The protocols and conduct of the studies supporting the Rasilamlo application, in relation to the critical issues raised for study SAH2302 with an adequate description of the procedures put in place for the control of the quality and validity of Rasilamlo efficacy data, and providing evidence supporting the adequacy of the Sponsor's Monitoring Plan Medicinal product no longer authorised

- ii. Impact  of  the  exclusion  of  the  minority  of  cases  with  aberrant  BP  readings  on  the  overall results of the SPA programme.

## In response, the following was claimed:

i. It was stated that the prevalence of aberrant BP readings in studies of the SPA programme, pivotal for the Rasilamlo application,was substantially lower than in studies of the SAH programme.

ii. It was stated that overall results from the studies of the SPA programme did not change after the exclusion of the minority of patients with aberrant BP readings.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following the oral explanation, the CHMP concluded that the presentation did not lift the doubts on the quality of efficacy data control and successful training of the investigators in the clinical studies of the SPA programme. This could represent a concern in view of the observation that the analysis of the pivotal add-on trials of the SPA program, studies 2303 and 2304, after removal of aberrant readings, showed  a  minimal,  although  significant  blood  pressure  lowering  effect  of  Rasilamlo  in  patients  not responding to amlodipine 5 and 10 mg.  As stated in the CHMP guidelines for the assessment of clinical trials, it is important to critically assess, apart from statistical significance, the clinical relevance of the observed  changes.  Given  the  limited  additional  efficacy  of  Rasilamlo  in  patients  not  responding  to amlodipine  and  the  significant  number  of  aberrant  readings  admitted  by  the  applicant,  it  was  the CHMP's opinion that the impact of variability in BP pressure readings on the clinical significance of the efficacy data should have been further investigated. The CHMP considered that a new GCP inspection was  not  needed,  but  nevertheless,  the  lack  of:  i.  information  on  baseline  characteristics  (pretreatment) of patients without aberrant BP measurements, and ii. detailed statistics and efficacy and safety  data  for  patients  without  aberrant  readings  precluded  an  adequate  evaluation  of  the  efficacy data.. Therefore, a new set of additional information was requested. The CHMP requested to submit, for the three Rasilamlo pivotal studies SPA2302, SPA2304, and SPA2305 data on:

- ii. Occurrence  of  an  aberrant  BP  reading  per  se  was  not  a  protocol  deviation  according  to  the study  protocols.  Aberrant  BP  measurements  could  have  qualified  as  protocol  deviations only when a second set of BP measurements was not performed. This occurred in 11.6% of patients  (at  baseline  or  endpoint)  in  study  SPA2303  and  16.3%  of  patients  in  study SPA2304.  When  considering  the  other  protocol  deviations  leading  to  exclusion  from  the PPS,  which  were  unrelated  to  aberrant  BP,  a  total  of  4.5%  of  major  protocol  deviations (PDs) were reported for study SPA2303 and 7.7% for study SPA2304 (as presented in the study reports and in the response to the list of outstanding issues). Therefore, even when applying the most conservative calculation by adding the aberrant BP PDs to major PDs and not adjusting for double-counting, the maximum total of protocol deviations that could have  occurred  is  16.1%  for  study  SPA2303  and  24.0%  for  study  SPA2304.  Therefore, based upon this definition, the PPS constitutes at worst &gt;80% for study SPA2303 and &gt; 76% for study SPA2304.

a)  Prevalence  of  aberrant  readings  (BP  measurements  differing  by  10  or  more  mm  Hg)  at  visit  2 (initiation of 4-week  run-in period and  treatment  with  monocomponent),  at  visit 4 (end of monotherapy) and at study end. b) Detailed descriptive statistics and efficacy and safety data (the latter limited to hypotension-related adverse events) for patients without aberrant readings. The additional set of results provided in response showed that, across each one of the three studies, the  baseline  characteristics  of  the  different  arms  did  not  substantially  differ  and,  therefore,  were unlikely  to  have  biased  the  main  results.  The  aliskiren/amlodipine  combination  was  superior  to  the respective  monotherapies  in  reducing  BP  in  patients  without  aberrant  readings,  and  the  statistical significance  was  preserved  for  both  add-on  studies.  However,  the  continuous  increase  in  the percentage  of  patients  with  aberrant  BP  readings  in  the  course  of  the  assessment  is  considered  a matter  of  concern.    Not  a  single  case  of  aberrant  BP  was  disclosed  at  the  time  of  the  original application  although  this  data  were  readily  available  in  the  final  data  file  used  for  analysis,  as confirmed  during  the  oral  explanation. After  the  inspection  on  studies  of  the  SAH  program,  the presence of cases with aberrant BP readings was estimated to be 30% and this was also reported in the  Oral  Explanation.  This  percentage  rose  up  to  above  40%  in  the  very  last  analysis  submitted  in response  to  the  CHMP  list  of  outstanding  issues.  In  response  to  the  issue  raised  by  the  CHMP concerning the overall reliability of BP data on the basis of the evidence that the percentage of patients with aberrant BP readings seems to increase constantly through the whole assessment procedure, the following clarification was provided: i. In  the  assessment  report,  the  derived  value  for  the  total  percentage  of  patients  in  the  per protocol  set  of  less  than  60%  is  based  on  exclusion  of  all  patients  with  aberrant  BP readings at visit 2 (pre-randomisation), baseline or endpoint. If the aberrant data from the pre-randomisation  visit  are  excluded,  the  total  percentage  of  patients  with  aberrant readings is 28.6% for study SPA2303 and 34.9% for study SPA2304.

There are total of 2, 4 and 3 randomized patients respectively in study SPA2303, SPA2304 and SPA2305 that were randomized in error and excluded from FAS and did not receive double-blind study medication The CHMP came to the conclusion that overall data, after the exclusion of patients with aberrant BP readings, consistently show an additional benefit of the FDC over monotherapy with the components of the FDC. This is considered sufficiently reassuring on the reliability of the results. The additional analyses performed by the Applicant have confirmed that limited information is available in  patients  with  age ≥ 65  years,  in  particular  limited  efficacy  data  for  the  add-on  indication  and  no information in patients aged 75 years and older. The limited efficacy data in patients aged 65 years and older is reflected in the Rasilamlo SmPC. 2.4.10. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy It is concluded that overall data do not support the use of Rasilamlo as first line therapy because the clinical experience is considered limited and a non-negligible percent of patients do not need the FDC to  achieve  blood  pressure  control,  even  in  the  presence  of  stage  2  hypertension.  The  Applicant  has withdrawn the first-line indication. With regard to the second-line indication, overall add-on studies show a greater BP reduction effect of the  FDC  in  comparison  with  therapy  in  patients  not  controlled  with  monotherapy,  all  studies  were conducted regardless of food intake. Data from the newly submitted observational Study SPP100ADE03 indirectly reassure on the efficacy in the adult population of both 150 mg and 300 mg aliskiren when taken after a light meal. Overall the issues raised by the GCP inspections are considered sufficiently  addressed  and  clarified  in  the  oral  explanation  and  in  written  response  to  the  list  of outstanding issues.

The lack of the demonstration of bioequivalence between the FDC and the free combination after a light  meal  prevents  the  approval  of  the  substitution  indication.  The  Applicant  has  withdrawn  the substitution indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The indication applied for:

Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.

Rasilamlo is indicated for the initial treatment of stage 2 hypertensive patients (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg) who are likely to need multiple medicinal products to achieve blood pressure control.

Rasilamlo  is  indicated  in  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  adequately  controlled  with aliskiren or amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) used alone.

Rasilamlo is indicated as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and amlodipine, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. Indication granted by the CHMP: Rasilamlo is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine used alone. 2.5. Clinical safety Patient exposure Overall, 5549 patients were included in the safety analysis of aliskiren/amlodipine clinical development programme  as  submitted  for  initial  evaluation.  This  included  studies  SPA2305,  SPA2303,  SPA2304, SPP2305, SPA2301, SPP2323, and SPP2323E1. In total, 2835 patients were exposed to aliskiren/amlodipine combination. The total number of patients exposed to aliskiren/amlodipine in longterm  6-month  and  1-year  studies  was  612  and  372,  respectively.  During  the  evaluation,  additional safety data from new studies SPA2307, SPA2306, SPAUS01, and SAH2302 were submitted. Pooled analysis from Studies SPA2306, SPAUS01 and SAH2302 included 2115 patients with stage 2 hypertension,  with  750  exposed  to  aliskiren/amlodipine  combination.  Data  is  provided  for  the monotherapy amlodipine and combination of aliskiren/amlodipine. The overall extent of drug exposure is shown in the below table. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Adverse events

In short-term and long-term studies, the two main non-serious adverse events observed with the use of  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  Ali/Aml  were:  peripheral  oedema  and  diarrhoea.  The  table  below summarises data about completion, discontinuation of treatment, serious AEs, and deaths during the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

short-term studies (8-week treatment, study SPA2305, study SPA2304, and study SPA2303).  There was no death.  Incidence of serious AEs was 0.4% lower during active treatment in comparison with placebo.    Discontinuation  of  treatment  due  to  side  effects  was  0.7%  more  frequent  during  active treatment in comparison with placebo.

Effective  antihypertensive  treatment  is  essential  in  the  control  of  proteinuria  and  microalbuminuria. Aliskiren appears to play a specific role in this regard, as was observed in several previous studies. Vice  versa,  the  effect  of  dihydropyridines  (and  amlodipine)  on  proteinuria  and  microalbuminuria  is controversial.  The clinical programme included information about standard urinalysis by dipstick but no reliable  assessment of proteinuria or microalbuminuria was reported. Dipstick is a low-sensitivity method.  Thus, it was considered impossible to assess whether the antiproteinuric effect of aliskiren is present when given in association with amlodipine. Additional data on this issue were presented in an observational study SPPDE03 conducted in Germany. Aliskiren and amlodipine were administered as a dual  combination  or  as  part  of  a  multidrug  combination.  These  data  show  that  amlodipine  did  not prevent  the  expected  reduction  in  albuminuria  from  aliskiren.  It  is  also  noted  that  there  are  other planned trials in which patients with CV diseases or risk including renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60) will be enrolled and the urine albumin/creatinine ratio will be measured.

The incidence of most common AEs in the same clinical studies (study SPA2305, study SPA2304, and study SPA2303) is given below. Peripheral oedema was the most common AE. It was a frequent cause of  treatment  discontinuation  and  was  much  more  common  during  treatment  with  amlodipine  than during the treatment with aliskiren. The possible protective effect of aliskiren against this side effect was one of the secondary objectives of the clinical programme. However, on the basis of safety data accumulated  for  all  aliskiren-containing  products,  including  those  that  were  authorised  earlier, peripheral oedema was identified as one of the AEs related to aliskiren treatment and thus, adequate information has been reflected in the SmPC.

In  study  SPA2307,  the  total  overall  adverse  events  were  similar  in  all  treatment  groups.  The  most frequent AE in all treatment groups was peripheral oedema. The incidence of peripheral oedema was highest in amlodipine based add-on regimen (24.1%) followed by aliskiren/amlodipine initial treatment

Pooled analysis from Studies SPA2306, SPAUS01 and SAH2302 Oedema, Headache, Dizziness were the most frequent AEs (&gt; 2% for either treatment group). The incidence  of  total  AEs,  and  of  peripheral  edema  and  headache  were  higher  in  the  amlodipine monotherapy group than in the aliskiren/amlodipine combination group. The incidence of dizziness was similar between the two groups. The availability of long-term safety data only for the high dose combination gives information about safety under the worst possible conditions, i.e. with the use of the highest dose.  Thus, the long-term safety  profile  appears  acceptable  and  it  is  likely  to  be  better  with  the  low  dose  FDC.

Overall, most AEs were rated by the investigator as mild or moderate in intensity and were most often reported in only one to two patients. No pattern was observed. Severe peripheral oedema was most often observed when the higher dose of amlodipine (10 mg) was given alone or in combination with aliskiren;  however,  in  the  short-term,  placebo-controlled  and  all  controlled  studies,  the  incidence  of severe peripheral oedema was lower in the aliskiren/amlodipine combination treated patients than in the  amlodipine  treated  patients.  In  the  long-term,  open-label  study,  severe  peripheral  oedema  was reported in 7 patients (1.3%) treated with aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg. In long-term, double-blind study, severe peripheral oedema was reported for 0.4% of all patients treated with aliskiren/amlodipine and 1.5% of all patients treated with HCT/Aml. Severe diarrhoea was reported in 2 patients (aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg) in the long-term, open-label study, and was not observed in the other analysis groups. There were no deaths reported in any of the pivotal clinical studies.

In  study  SPA2307,  the  severity  of  AEs  during  double-blind  treatment  was  mainly  mild  (30.2%  of patients) to moderate (30.5% of patients), and to a much lesser extent severe (6.1% of patients). For the  most  frequently  reported  AE  of  peripheral  oedema,  the  majority  of  cases  were  mild  (11.7%  of patients  in  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  initial  treatment  regimen,  6.0%  in  the  aliskiren  based  add-on regimen and 10.8% in the amlodipine based add-on regimen) or moderate (7.8% of patients in the aliskiren/amlodipine initial treatment regimen, 7.9% in the aliskiren based add-on regimen and 11.1% in the amlodipine based add-on regimen). The percentage of severe cases was low (&lt; 3%) and similar across treatment groups. No patient died during this study. Pooled analysis from Studies SPA2306, SPAUS01 and SAH2302 The incidence of SAE was low for both groups (4 patients, 0.9%, in amlodipine group and 4 patients, 0.5%, in aliskiren/amlodipine group). Angioedema was not reported in any patient in the 3 studies that formed  the  pooling  database.  Two  deaths  were  reported  in  Study  SAH2302.  Both  were  reported  in patients who had not been exposed to active study medication, and therefore were not suspected to be related to study medication. Laboratory findings Medicinal product no longer authorised

Decreases in haemoglobin and hematocrit have been reported with agents acting on the RAS, including aliskiren.  In  the  short-term  studies,  aliskiren/amlodipine  treated  patients  had  slight  mean  decreases from baseline in haemoglobin (-1.8 g/L and -2.0 g/L for placebo controlled and all controlled studies); however, the changes were small and not clinically meaningful. In the long-term studies, the slight decreases in haemoglobin for the aliskiren/amlodipine treated patients was consistent with the results of the short-term studies (-1.9 g/L and -0.1 g/L, for open-label and double-blind studies). In the shortterm and long-term studies, analyses by age, gender, race, and ethnicity, baseline renal function and BMI status showed a pattern of laboratory values not different from those in the overall population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Changes  from  baseline  in  most  biochemistry  parameters  were  generally  small  and  not  clinically meaningful when compared across treatment groups within the 4 analysis sets. There were no clinically meaningful  changes  in  potassium,  calcium,  creatinine,  BUN,  lipids  or  glucose  with  the  treatment  of aliskiren/amlodipine (short-term, placebo-controlled; short-term, all controlled; long-term, open-label study and long-term, double-blind).

The effect  of  aliskiren  on  ECG  parameters  was  thoroughly  investigated  during  its  development,  and aliskiren did not prolong the QT-interval as assessed by the QTcF or the QTcI compared to placebo. No correlation between QT interval and Cmax or AUC was observed.

Orthostatic BP change was defined as a decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg in SBP or a decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg in DBP  when  moving  from  a  sitting  position  to  a  standing  position.  The  incidence  of  orthostatic  BP changes  with  aliskiren/amlodipine  was  infrequent,  and  was  often  higher  at  baseline  than  at  any individual post-baseline visit for all treatment groups. When orthostatic BP changes at any visit postbaseline  were  considered,  the  incidence  with  aliskiren/amlodipine  (8.1%)  treatment  was  lower  than placebo (10.1%) in the short-term, placebo-controlled study. In the short-term, all controlled studies, the  incidence  with  aliskiren/amlodipine  (7.6%)  treatment  was  similar  to  amlodipine  monotherapy (6.9%),  and  aliskiren  monotherapy  (6.6%).  In  the  long-term  studies,  orthostatic  BP  change  was infrequent at each individual post-baseline visit. In  study  SPA2307,  the  laboratory  results  did  not  reveal  any  particular  safety  concerns  for  the combination. The number of patients meeting pre-specified high potassium level of &gt;5.5 mmol/L was similar in aliskiren/amlodipine initial treatment regimen and amlodipine based add-on regimen, while it was slightly higher in the aliskiren based add-on regimen (2.0%). Pooled analysis from studies SPA2306, SPAUS01 and SAH2302 showed that the proportion of patients meeting the criterion of serum potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/L was small in both aliskiren/amlodipine group (0.6%) and amlodipine group (0.2%). More patients in the amlodipine monotherapy group (4.7%) met the criterion of serum potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L than in aliskiren/amlodipine group (2.6%). The number of  patients  meeting  the  criterion  of  serum  BUN  &gt;14.28  mmol/L  or  creatinine  &gt;176.8  ìmol/L  at  any post-baseline visit was small in both groups (1 to 2 patients). Safety in special populations The initially submitted studies encompassed a total of 640 elderly ( ≥ 65 yr old) and 109 ( ≥ 75 yr old) very elderly patients treated with Rasilamlo in studies of duration up to one year. These safety data in elderly populations (&gt;65yr and especially &gt;75yr) obtained from the clinical trials were considered too limited.  Additional  data  became  available  from  the  newly  submitted  studies  for  the  evaluation  of aliskiren/amlodipine combination in elderly patients (overall n=434 for age ≥ 65 and n=90 for age ≥ 75). The number of elderly and very elderly patients is summarized in the below table. Medicinal product no longer authorised

| Medicinal   |
|-------------|

The paucity of data in patients &gt;75 years old, and in patients with co-morbidity does not allow a sound evaluation of efficacy and safety of the FDC in these patient populations. This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC of Rasilamlo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  already  known  data  on  aliskiren  as  well  as  the  new  data  derived  from  the  clinical  study CSPP100A2405  (efficacy  of  aliskiren  75  mg,  150  mg  and  300  mg  compared  to  placebo  in  elderly patients with essential hypertension after a light meal) indicate that there is no significant increase in the efficacy with increasing aliskiren dosage &gt;75 mg/day in the elderly population. Indeed, not only was there no significant difference in SBP and DBP between the doses of 150 and 300 mg aliskiren, but the absolute BP reduction was numerically greater with 150mg. It is considered necessary to include information  on  the  limited  information  from  elderly  in  the  SmPC  along  with  an  advice  to  exercise caution when these patients are being treated with Rasilamlo.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Study  SPP2218  was  an  open-label,  multiple  dose  study  specifically  designed  to  evaluate  the pharmacokinetic  drug-drug  interaction  between  amlodipine  and  aliskiren  when  given  alone  or  in combination  to  healthy  subjects.  Twenty-five  healthy  subjects  were  enrolled  and  18  completed  the study. Conclusions from this study, together with safety data from other clinical trials, show that coadministration of aliskiren and amlodipine during steady-state conditions had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug. Aliskiren: Previous studies have shown that aliskiren has no known clinically relevant interactions with medicinal  products  commonly  used  to  treat  hypertension  or  diabetes.  A  drug-drug  interaction  with furosemide  (decreased  furosemide  exposure  and  peak  concentration)  has  been  conducted  and  is described  in  the  aliskiren  prescribing  information.  Aliskiren  is  a  substrate  for  P-glycoprotein  and increased aliskiren exposure and peak concentration have been identified with concomitant use of P-gp Inhibitors. This effect is substantial with cyclosporin A and  itraconazole. Contraindication for concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine and itraconazole is present in the SmPC of Rasilamlo. Due  to  the  lack  of  data  a  potential  interaction  between  grapefruit  juice  and  aliskiren  cannot  be excluded. Grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasilamlo as stated in the SmPC. Amlodipine: Several studies have shown that, in monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered  with  other  hypertensive  drugs.  A  study  in  elderly  patients  has  shown  that  diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4, since the plasma concentration increases by  approximately  50%  and  the  effect  of  amlodipine  is  increased.  The  possibility  that  more  potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem cannot be excluded. Co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers  may  lead  to  reduced  plasma  concentrations  of  amlodipine.  The  information  on  potential interactions  between  amlodipine  and  other  drugs  has  been  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC  of Rasilamlo. Discontinuation due to adverse events Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was 0.7% more frequent during active treatment in comparison with placebo. Peripheral oedema was a frequent cause of treatment discontinuation. The incidence was lower in aliskiren/amlodipine treated patients than in amlodipine treated patients (shortterm, placebo controlled and short-term, all controlled trials). In the long-term studies, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events in aliskiren/amlodipine patients was lower when compared to the total population (long-term, open-label) and when compared to all hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine patients  (long-term,  double-blind).  No  other  particular  pattern  or  clustering  of  events  according  to preferred term was observed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study SPA2307, more patients discontinued due to AE in the amlodipine (18.4%) regimen compared to  aliskiren/amlodipine  (13.8%) or aliskiren  (14.3%) regimen. Most of the AE discontinuations were suspected to be drug-related with the incidence higher in the amlodipine (16.5%) regimen than in the aliskiren/amlodipine (12.5%) and aliskiren regimen (12.7%). SAEs-related discontinuations were low (&lt;1.5% in all treatment groups). No patients discontinued study due to abnormal laboratory findings. Presented  safety  data  indicated  that  the  combination  regimen  of  aliskiren/amlodipine  was  well tolerated.

Pooled  analysis  from  Studies  SPA2306,  SPAUS01  and  SAH2302  showed  that  more  patients  in amlodipine  monotherapy  group  discontinued  from  the  studies  due  to  any  reason  or  due  to  AEs compared to the aliskiren/amlodipine group.

The fixed combination of aliskiren/amlodipine was not marketed in any country at the time of the first MAA submission for Rasilamlo and until 26 August 2010, when the first marketing authorisation was granted in US. According to the Applicant's update, the number of total Standard Units (tablets) sold was 780 with a cut-off date of 09-Oct-2010.

Based on sales data, patient exposure to aliskiren was estimated to be approximately over 460,000 patient-treatment-years (PTY); while for amlodipine it was approximately 325 million PTY. Applicant's search  conducted  for  all  cases  with  concurrent  use  of  aliskiren  and  amlodipine  (as  single  active ingredients  or  in  combination  products)    produced  320  cases  reporting  1268  events.  The  review  of these cases did not result in any new safety findings, as the events were either known to be associated with  the  use  of  amlodipine  and/or  aliskiren  or  related  to  the  underlying  disease.  Based  on  the submitted data, approximately 779.000 patients have used aliskiren as monotherapy or in combination with  another  anti-hypertensive  drug  since  its  first  introduction  on  the  market  until  January  2010. Roughly 19% of the patients are taking aliskiren in combination with amlodipine, with an estimated total number of aliskiren-amlodipine treated patients of 149,643. On this regard a 30% discontinuation rate  (best  case  scenario  for  patients  treated  with  anti-hypertensive  drugs  at  6  months)  should  be applied to these figures. This reduces the number of long-term exposed patients to nearly 105,000.

2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety Based on the analysis of overall short-term safety data in the general hypertensive population there is no  evidence  that  Rasilamlo  may  induce,  in  the  short  term,  changes  in  the  nature,  incidence,  and seriousness of AEs or laboratory abnormalities, that could raise serious concerns in comparison with the  monocomponents.  To  date,  data  in  patients  with  severe  hypertension  and  patients  with  comorbidities are limited or lacking. Very limited safety data are available in patients with hypertension stage  1  with  additional  cardiovascular  risks.  The  paucity  of  data  in  patients  &gt;75  years  old,  and  in patients  with  co-morbidity  does  not  allow  a  sound  evaluation  of  Rasilamlo  safety  in  these  patient populations. Safety in stage 2 hypertensive patients: In study SPA2305, no increase in the incidence of AEs was observed  in  stage  2  hypertensive  patients  in  comparison  with  the  general  population.  Peripheral oedema was, as expected, the most common. The nature and frequency of AEs reported was similar to that  of  the  overall  population.  No  additional  safety  concerns  in  stage  2  hypertension  patients  were observed. Similar results were obtained from the pooled analysis from studies SPA2306, SPAUS01 and SAH2302,  analysing  data  from  750  patients,  567  of  which  were  exposed  for  &gt;  8  weeks  to  the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine. The most frequently reported AEs were: peripheral oedema and headache, the incidence of which was higher in the amlodipine than in the aliskiren/amlodipine group. The incidence of diarrhoea was 1.5 % for  aliskiren/amlodipine  combination  and  1.3  %  for  amlodipine.  One  patient  had  hypotension  in aliskiren/amlodipine  group.  Angioedema  was  not  reported  in  any  of  the  studies.  The  proportion  of patients who had serum potassium  5.5 mmol/L was 0.6 % in aliskiren/amlodipine group and 0.2 % in almodipine group. The number of patients who had BUN  14.8 mmol/L or creatinine  176.8  mol/L was small in both groups Long-term (1 year) safety data do not seem to indicate additional safety concerns elicited by Rasilamlo in comparison with those already known for the monocomponents.  Post-marketing data show the use of  the  free  combination  of  aliskiren  and  amlodipine  in  nearly  105,000  patients.  This  number  is somewhat  reassuring.  However,  these  data  should  be  supported  by  information  on  the  long-term safety profile of the combination therapy in the clinical practice. This information is lacking. The longterm safety profile (&gt; 1 year) of the aliskiren/amlodipine combination is at present not fully established. Medicinal product no longer authorised

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and the post-marketing use of aliskren and/or amlodipine have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Based  on  the  short-  and  long-term  (1  year)  observations,  there  is  no  evidence  that  in  stage  2 hypertensive  patients  or  in  the  general  hypertensive  population  -  with  the  exclusion  of  severe

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertensive patients and patients with co-morbidities, for whom data are lacking - Rasilamlo could induce  such  incidence  and  seriousness  of  AEs  or  laboratory  abnormalities,  which  may  raise  serious concerns  in  comparison  with  the  safety  profile  of  the  monocomponents.  However,  long  term  safety data (&gt; 1 year) for the FDC are still limited.

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation (Section 4.6): - Women of child-bearing potential/contraception in males and females: Healthcare professionals prescribing Rasilamlo should counsel women of childbearing potential about the potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasilamlo should not be used in women planning to become pregnant. - Pregnancy: Rasilamlo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasilamlo is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters. If pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasilamlo should be discontinued accordingly as soon as possible. - Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of lactating rats. Since there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of aliskiren and amlodipine in human or animal breast milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is therefore not advisable for women who are breast-feeding to use Rasilamlo. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Rasilamlo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast- feeding for the child and the benefit of no longer authorised |

## 2.7. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

The  current  indication  concerns  the  use  of  the  FDC  150mg/5mg,  150mg/10mg,  300mg/5mg, 300mg/10mg film-coated tablets in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren  or  amlodipine  used  alone  (second  line).  First-line  and  substitution  indications  have  been withdrawn.

##  Beneficial effects

The  majority  of  hypertensive  patients  need  two  or  more  medications  for  adequate  blood  pressure control. New fixed-dose combinations of antihypertensive drugs could improve the patients' compliance over the free combination of the single monotherapies. The  parallel  group  study  SPA2305  and  the  add-on  studies  indicate  that  Rasilamlo  induces  a  higher dose-dependent antihypertensive effect and a higher rate of controlled hypertension in comparison to mono-regimens.  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. The population of hypertensive patients that would benefit from initial therapy with the FDC has not been clearly identified. In addition, no demonstration of the clinical relevance of early BP control with the use of the FDC in first-line therapy in non-high risk patients with stage 2 hypertension has been provided. Consequently, the first-line indication was not granted, and was withdrawn. There is limited information available in patients with age ≥ 65 years, in particular limited efficacy data for  the  add-on  indication  and  no  information  in  patients  aged  75  years  and  older.  This  is  correctly reflected in the SmPC. However, the information on elderly will be further updated based on the assessment of results from study 2405 in elderly patients. Therefore, the Applicant is committed to submit the relevant type II variation for all aliskiren containing products according to the CHMP requests. Limited  information  on  BE  of  the  FDC  when  administered  under  fed  conditions.  The  lack  of bioequivalence data in the fed state is correctly reflected in the SmPC Risks A significant percentage (about 30%) of patients initially treated with the FDC combination could have their BP potentially controlled by the monotherapy, and thus, be unnecessarily exposed to two drugs and to  the  risk  of  higher  number  of  adverse  events.  Consequently,  the  first-line  indication  was  not granted. Food  decreases  aliskiren  absorption.  Available  data  suggest  that  the  effect  of  food  may  also  be dependent on formulation. No bioequivalence study of the FDC in the fed state has been performed. This has led to the withdrawal of the indication in substitution therapy. Theoretically,  the  use  of  the  FDC  could  imply  the  sum  or  the  potentiating  of  the  AEs  of  the  two monocomponents, the incidence of new AEs secondary to an unknown interaction between the two monocomponents, and AEs secondary to too rapid and/or excessive blood pressure reduction.

-  Unfavourable effects

In  short-term  studies,  incidence  of  AEs  was  slightly  higher  during  treatment  with  the  FDC  in comparison to monotherapies.  Discontinuation of treatment due to AEs was slightly more frequent during treatment with the FDC in comparison to monotherapies. Long-term safety data are limited and are available only for the high-dose combination, hence under the worst possible conditions because the long-term safety profile is expected to be better with the use of the low-dose FDC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In short-term and long-term studies, the FDC was characterised by two non-serious AEs: peripheral oedema and diarrhoea and both have been included in the SmPC. Peripheral oedema was the most common  AE  and  a  frequent  cause  of  treatment  discontinuation.  It  was  more  common  during  the treatment with amlodipine than during treatment with aliskiren.  Diarrhea occurred approximately in 3% of  patients  and  was  more  common  during  treatment  with  aliskiren  than  during  treatment  with amlodipine.  Diarrhea was severe only in approximately 0.5% of patients but was not related to the treatment.

##  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Limited information is available form patients with age ≥ 75 years. This is reflected in the SmPC with a warning on the use of aliskiren in patients older than 75 years old.

The  benefit-risk balance  for the substitution indication is  negative  because  of  the  lack  of  a bioequivalence study in the fed state. This has led to its withdrawal.

Benefit-risk balance  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects As regards the first-line indication: i) The  lack  of  a  wide  therapeutic  experience  for  the  combination  therapy  with aliskiren and amlodipine, ii) The unnecessary exposure to the FDC of a significant number of patients (30%) whose BP is adequately controlled by the monotherapy, iii) The lack of demonstration of the clinical relevance of early BP control with the use of  the FDC in first-line therapy in non-high risk patients with stage 2 hypertension are considered major issues that overweight the potential benefit represented by the faster control of BP levels obtained with the FDC as compared to the sequential add-on treatment strategy. For these reasons, the first-line indication was not granted and was withdrawn. In reference to the second-line indication, the FDC induced a higher dose-dependent antihypertensive effect  and  a  higher  rate  of  controlled  hypertension  in  comparison  to  mono-regimens.  Although  the effect of food on the additional benefit of the FDC combination versus amlodipine monotherapy can not be  clearly  estimated,  the  entity  of  the  BP  lowering  effect  of  the  components  of  the  FDC  when administered  after  a  light  meal  is  reassuring  on  the  beneficial  effects  of  the  FDC  in  patients  not controlled by monotherapy. No important safety concern for the FDC has emerged from short term safety studies. However, the long-term safety profile of the FDC is not completely elucidated yet.  Benefit-risk balance For the second line indication ,  the  beneficial  effect  of  the  FDC  combination  is  considered  sufficiently demonstrated,  although  there  was  a  considerable  fraction  of  aberrant  BP  readings.  Their  clinical relevance on the overall efficacy of Rasilamlo is however not considered significant. For  the  first  line  indication ,  the  observation  that  1/3  of  patients  with  stage  1-2  hypertension  were controlled after 16 weeks of treatment with the mono-regimen, and that a higher number of AEs are associated with the FDC in comparison with the monotherapy, together with the lack of demonstration of the clinical relevance of early BP control with the use of  the FDC in first-line therapy in non-high risk  patients  with  stage  2  hypertension  renders  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  this  indication  negative. The first-line indication was withdrawn. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.7.1. Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The overall  benefit/risk  of  Rasilamlo  is  considered  positive  for  the  indication: treatment of  essential hypertension  in  adult patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  adequately  controlled  with  aliskiren  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

amlodipine used alone . The benefit/risk of Rasilamlo is considered negative for the first line indication and for the substitution indication.

## 2.7.2. Risk management plan

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- Routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

- No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. 2.8. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Rasilamlo in the treatment of Rasilamlo is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine used alone was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
