## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Celvapan is a Vero cell derived, monovalent, whole virion, inactivated H1N1v vaccine. The application for  a  marketing  authorization  for  Celvapan  was  supported  by  a  core  dossier  for  pandemic  influenza vaccine and the scientific development was based on the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03) and the guideline  on  submission  of  marketing  authorisation  applications  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines through the centralised procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03). The European Commission issued a Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  under  exceptional  circumstances  for  Celvapan  (EU/1/08/506/001, containing a non-circulating A/H5N1 strain) on 4 March 2009. The  strain  change  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  from  H5N1  to  H1N1v  was  approved  on  06/10/2009 (EMEA/H/C/982/PU/02). Subsequently the MA was modified as regards the conditions of authorisation from exceptional to full marketing authorisation on 13/08/2010 (EMEA/H/C/982/SW/14).  As a result the  recommended  indication  was  modified  as  follows: Prophylaxis  of  influenza  caused  by  A(H1N1) 2009  virus  (see  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC).  Celvapan  should  be  used  in  accordance  with  Official Guidance . This group of two variations II-19/G aimed at: 1. updating  the  SmPC  sections  4.8  and  4.6  with  the  safety  data  obtained  from  the  pandemic observational study 820901 (parts B and C), which was submitted via SOB 30. Supportive data available  from  the  United  Kingdom  Teratology  Information  Service  (UKTIS)  (assessed  in PSU051)  and  from  the  pandemic  vaccination  campaign  in  Jersey  were  also  taken  into consideration by the CHMP and were considered consistent with study 820901; 2. the results of the paediatric study 820903 also became available and warranted an update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC with new data concerning antibody persistence at 6 and 12  months  post-primary  vaccination  and  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  post-booster  in children and adolescent (stratified by age in four groups and randomised to receive either a full or a half dose of the pandemic H1N1 vaccine). As a consequence some of the conditions identified in Annex II from the pandemic were fulfilled and this section of the PI was also updated accordingly. In addition the MAH took this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8.1. 1.2. Clinical Efficacy aspects 1.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted Study 820903 Part B and C (FU2 40.1, FU2 40.2) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study  820903  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  multicentre  study  in  healthy  infants,  children  and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years, which was conducted in Austria and Germany.

The study was designed to determine the preferred dose of the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in a paediatric  population,  aged  6  months  to  17  years,  based  upon  assessment  of  immunogenicity  and safety.  Results  of  safety/reactogenicity  and  immunogenicity  of  two  doses  of  3.75  µg  or  7.5  µg  HA H1N1 vaccine, obtained for the period up to Day 43 (21 days after the second vaccination/Visit 5),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  presented  in  the  CSR  Part  A,  which  was  previously  assessed  (SOB  28  and  consequent  SO2; variations II-07 and II-13). Part B and C of the study were submitted in the context of FU2 40.1 and FU2 40.2 and cover the following evaluations:

-  Antibody  persistence  measured  by  Haemagglutination  inhibition  assay  (HI),  Microneutralization assay (MN) and Single Radial Haemolysis assay (SRH) for the period up to Day 181 and for the period up to Day 360 following the first vaccination.

 Antibody response 21 days after the booster vaccination measured by HI, MN and SRH assays. Booster  vaccination  was  given  at  Day  361  using  a  licensed  trivalent  seasonal  influenza  vaccine (Inflexal-V, containing the A/H1N1/California/07/2009 strain, for the season 2010/2011).  1-year safety follow-up. A total of 400 healthy subjects, stratified into 4 age strata (9 to 17 years: Stratum A; 3 to 8 years: Stratum B; 12 to 35 months: Stratum C; 6 to 11 months: Stratum D, with each stratum consisting of approximately 100 subjects), were to be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive two vaccinations of either  3.75  µg  or  7.5  µg  of  H1N1  HA  at  a  21  day  interval.  The  booster  vaccination  was  to  be administered to at least 30 subjects in each of the 4 age strata and only to those who received the 7.5 μ g dose for the first and second vaccinations (N=110, as only 20 infants in Stratum D completed two vaccinations at the 7.5 μ g dose). Children in Strata A and B received 0.5 ml of the booster vaccine INFLEXAL V, whereas those in Strata C and D received 0.25 ml of INFLEXAL V. The Part A total vaccinated cohort included 339 subjects (101 in Stratum A, 100 in Stratum B, 100 in Stratum C, 38 in Stratum D) who completed the first and second vaccinations. During study Part B, 314 subjects with evaluable HI assay results were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset for Day181. During study Part C, 336 subjects were included for safety follow up until Day 361. A total of 114 subjects received a booster vaccination and were included in the safety and ITT datasets for the booster vaccination. Detailed disposition of subjects in each of the four age strata and in each dose level as well as the number of subjects receiving booster vaccination at Day 361/Visit 8 is depicted in Tables 10.1-1 and 10.1-2 below.

The  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  by  dose  remained  largely  unchanged  throughout  the study (when compared with Part A). At Day 361, the male/female distribution was 45.3% vs. 54.7% for the 3.75 µg dose group, and 56.7% vs. 43.3% for the 7.5 µg dose group. Most subjects were white (95.3% and 98.2% in 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg groups, respectively). There was no significant difference in demographic parameters (age/years, weight and height) between the 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg dose groups. Among subjects  who  received  booster  vaccination,  males  slightly  outnumbered  females  (57.9%  vs. 42.1%) and 98.2% of the total were white. 1.2.2. Results Antibody persistence data from study 820903 Antibody  persistence  was  assessed  using  blood  samples  at  Day  181  (Month  6)  and  Day  361  (prebooster,  Month  12)  using  HI  and  MN  assays.  In  most  age  groups  and  both  dose  groups,  the  seroprotection rate (SPR) and sero-conversion rate (SCR), geometric mean titres (GMTs) and geometric means (GMs) of fold increase in antibody titres were in general stable between Day 43 and Day 181. In both dose groups at Day 181, all CHMP criteria for immunogenicity, as defined in adults for seasonal influenza  vaccines  (Note  for  guidance  on  harmonisation  of  requirements  for  influenza  vaccines  CPMP/BWP/214/96), were still met and the differences between age and dose groups were minimal, with slightly lower levels in the youngest age group. As expected, the SPR and SCR, GMTs and GMs of fold  increase  decreased  in  all  age  strata  between  Day  181  and  Day  361  prior  to  booster  vaccine administration. The pre-booster immunogenicity measurements (day 361) were only taken from the group vaccinated with the 7.5 μ g HA dose. Tables 1, 2 and 3 display the antibody persistence data for the 7.5µg vaccine group, which corresponds to the formulation currently licensed for Celvapan H1N1. Table 1.

21-28 days post-booster (Day 382-389), SPR/SNR against the H1N1 strain was 100.0% and SCR was 100.0%  compared  to  baseline  whereas  slightly  lower  rates  were  observed  when  compared  to  prebooster on Day 361 in all age groups as measured by HI and MN. Antibody response measured by SRH assay (especially in GMTs and GM-FI parameters) was lower but generally consistent with the HI and MN results (as shown in table 4).

* Day 181 data were from subjects included in the ITT dataset ** Day 361 data were from subjects included in the ITT dataset for the booster vaccination A repeated mixed model ANCOVA demonstrated that HI titres were significantly affected by age, time, logarithmic titre at baseline and dose/time interaction. Notably, there was no significant difference in adjusted means of HI titres between the 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg dose groups on Day 181.

## 1.2.1. Discussion

The antibody persistence profile for Celvapan H1N1 was shown to be largely stable up to D181 after the first vaccination, as compared with the data at Day 43. The HI and MN results demonstrated the persistence of high titres against the vaccine strain A/H1N1/California/07/2009 up to 360 days after the first vaccination in all age strata and dose groups, with minimal differences between the 3.75 and 7.5 μ g HA formulations.

<!-- image -->

A total of 3,216 (100%) subjects enrolled in the study had been vaccinated with H1N1 vaccine at least once;  3,039  (94.5%)  subjects  had  received  two  vaccinations.  A  total  of  1,948  (60.6%)  subjects entered the study at the time of their second vaccination. Most subjects (3,023; 94.0%) had received the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine containing 7.5 μ g HA antigen for both vaccinations; 11 (0.3%) subjects had received two 3.75 μ g doses; 3 (0.1%) subjects had received 3.75 μ g followed by 7.5 μ g,

The booster response data presented in this variation have shown that priming with two doses of 7.5 µg HA antigen of H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine was robust and capable of inducing immunologic memory resulting in a high booster response to the A/H1N1/California/07/2009 strain of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine administered approximately one year after the first vaccination. 1.3. Clinical Safety aspects 1.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted Observational safety study 820901 In the framework of SOB030 the MAH provided the final report of the observational study 820901 to assess  the  safety  of  two  vaccinations  of  a  Vero  cell-derived,  whole  virus  H1N1  pandemic  influenza vaccine (Celvapan; ref. to SO2 30.6). This study was conducted as part of the risk management plan (RMP). The primary objective of this prospective, multicentre, non-interventional study was to estimate the incidence of any medically-attended adverse events in all vaccinated subjects. The secondary objectives of this study were:  To investigate the incidence of injection site and systemic reactions to vaccination in a subset of the cohort;  To estimate the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI) following an active surveillance of all vaccinated subjects;  To  survey  pregnancy  outcomes  in  vaccinated  pregnant  women  and  in  women  who  become pregnant after vaccination. The study was conducted in Austria. Subjects were to be enrolled and vaccinated according to national policy  and  standard.  Contacts  were  made  approximately  at  4  to  6  weeks  and  6  months  after  the second vaccination for follow-up on any medically-attended adverse events (AEs), SAEs, AESI, and/or pregnancies. If any clinically relevant event that was not previously recorded was reported during a contact, a follow-up consultation was to be made to collect the relevant medical data. Subjects and/or parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  of  subjects  in  the  subgroup  for  evaluation  of  injection  site  and  systemic reactions were given a diary card for documentation of specifically queried symptoms following each vaccination. The diary cards were to be returned after the 7-day post-vaccination observation period. Safety analysis set Medicinal product no longer authorised

and 2 (0.1%) subjects had received 7.5 μ g followed by 3.75 μ g. Subjects who had received 3.75 μ g HA antigen were aged between 2 months and 8 years. A total of 277 (8.6%) subjects were withdrawn prematurely from the study mainly due to being lost to follow-up (N=231; 7.2%); six subjects died during the study. Male and female subjects were enrolled to a similar extent (1599:1617) and subjects' median  age  in  the  safety  analysis  set  was  36.0  years  (range:  0.2  to  92.0  years),  with  the  largest percentage (35.4%) of subjects aged 18 to 44 years.

 Analysis set for assessment of commonly observed adverse reactions (injection site and systemic) after the first and second vaccination A  total  of  648  and  583  subjects  were  included  in  the  analysis  set  for  assessment  of  commonly observed  ADRs  after  the  first  and  second  vaccination,  with  a  median  age  of  27.0  and  28.0  years, respectively, and slightly more female than male subjects.  4- to 6-week contact analysis set A total of 3,028 subjects who received the first vaccination with a 7.5 μ g vaccine dose had a follow-up contact approximately 4 to 6 weeks thereafter.  6-month contact analysis set A total of 2,939 subjects received the first vaccination and had a follow-up contact approximately 6 months after the first or second vaccination had been performed. 1.3.2. Results Adverse Events (AEs) - Study 820901  Deaths Six  deaths  occurred  during  this  study,  of  which  four  (depression,  urothelial  cancer,  myocardial infarction, pneumonia and sepsis) were considered unrelated to the vaccination, one was considered 'unlikely related' (Miliar TB), and one (hepatitis C) was un-assessable according to the MAH and was judged unrelated by the CHMP, as Hepatitis C is not associated with influenza vaccination.  SAEs A total of 11 subjects experienced 14 SAEs after the first vaccination and 89 subjects experienced 104 SAEs  after  the  second  vaccination  (among  subjects  who  received  the  first  and  second  vaccination, respectively). Two vaccine-related SAEs were reported after the first vaccination (transverse myelitis and febrile convulsion) and four (rash; premature rupture of membranes and caesarean section; febrile convulsion) were reported after the second vaccination. In two subjects, the causality of SAEs after the second  vaccination  was  unknown  (details  on  the  nature  of  the  SAEs  were  not  disclosed  by  the subjects).  AESIs (adverse events of special interest) Medicinal product no longer authorised

The overall incidence of subjects with medically confirmed non-serious and serious AESIs after the first (n=1;  n=3)  and  second  (n=1;  n=2)  vaccinations,  respectively,  were  very  low.  Two  cases  of  H1N1 influenza  infection  were  reported  (considered  AESIs):  one  was  a  suspected  case  6  days  after vaccination in a 13-year old male who received only a single H1N1 vaccination, and the other was a confirmed vaccination failure which was reported &gt; 4 weeks after the second vaccination, administered 4  weeks  after  the  first  vaccination  in  a  35-year  old  female.  Other  AESIs  after  the  first  vaccination included: a case of epilepsy in a 48 year old male; a case of transverse myelitis, also reported as an SAE;  and  a  case  of  febrile  convulsion  in  a  9-year  old,  also  reported  as  an  SAE.  After  the  second

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccination, other AESIs included: febrile convulsions in a 3-year old (also included as a SAE) and in a 12 month-old.

Based on the narratives presented by the MAH, the case of transverse myelitis reflects most likely a para-infectious AE not related to vaccination and both described febrile convulsions (3 and 9 year old children) are most likely related to an infection. The febrile convulsion in the 12 months old child was considered unrelated by the investigator as well as the case of epilepsy 33 days post dose 1 in a 48year-old-male.

 AEs related to pregnancy See the paragraph 'Post-marketing data on pregnancy'.  AEs within 4 weeks after vaccination The incidence of medically-attended AEs reported within 4 weeks after first and second vaccination was low  (2.7%  and  3.8%,  respectively).  Children  in  the  2-  to  23-month  age  stratum  reported  highest incidence  (6.7%  and  13.0%)  of  medically-attended  AEs  after  the  first  and  second  vaccination.  The incidence of related medically-attended AEs across all age strata was low and similar (0.4% and 0.5%) after the first and second vaccinations. Within  4  weeks  after  the  first  and  second  vaccination,  23  and  22  subjects  respectively  experienced medically-attended fever (pyrexia) across all age strata. Of these, 6 and 4 subjects, respectively, had events  of  pyrexia  that  were  considered  related  to  vaccination.  The  incidence  of  fever  was  highest (2.6%) in subjects from the 2- to 8-year age stratum after the first vaccination and 3.0% in the 2- to 23-month age stratum after the second vaccination.  Non-serious systemic reactions from the analysis set The highest rates of fever among subjects included in the analysis set for commonly observed adverse reactions within 7 days after the first vaccination were in the 2-8 years old age group (9.2%; n/N= 13/141)  and  the  2-23  month  age  group  (6.8%;  4/59).  Very  few  cases  of  fever  were  observed  in adults, with those 61 years and older experiencing no fever (0/72). After the second vaccination, fever rates were similar, with 4.1% of 2-8 year olds affected, and 7.5% of 2-23 month olds. No cases of fever within 7 days after the second vaccination were observed in adults over age 18. After the first and second vaccinations, severe fever (39.0 °C - 40.0 °C) was reported in 10 and 2 (1.5% and 0.3%) subjects,  moderate  in  7  and  1  (1.1%  and  0.2%)  subjects  and  mild  in  5  and  6  (0.8%  and  1.0%) subjects, respectively. Fever &gt; 40.0 °C was reported by 2 and 1 (0.3% and 0.2%) subjects after the first and second vaccination. Headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain were the most common non-serious systemic reactions after  the  first  and  second  vaccinations  in  subjects  aged  5  years  and  older,  which  were  all  mild  or moderate. In children aged 2 months to 4 years, irritability drowsiness and loss of appetite were the most  common  non-serious  symptoms  occurring  within  7  days  after  the  first  vaccination  and drowsiness, loss of appetite and vomiting were most common after the second vaccination.  Non-serious injection reactions Overall 18.2% and 13.0% of subjects reported non-serious injection site reactions within 7 days after the first and second vaccination, respectively. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The highest incidence of injection site reactions after first vaccination was reported by subjects in the 9 to 17 years age stratum (26.9%) and the lowest (2.8%) incidence was reported in subjects 61 years and  older.  Concerning  the  other  age  strata,  the  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  was  16.9%,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

17.0%, 22.2% and 17.4% in the 2 to 23 months, 2 to 8 years, 18 to 44 years and 45 to 60 years age strata respectively.

The highest incidence of injection site reactions after second vaccination was reported by subjects in the 18 to 44 years age stratum (19.0%) and the lowest (3.1%) incidence was reported in subjects 61 years and older. Concerning the other age strata, the incidence of injection site reactions was 3.8%, 13.8%, 14.3% and 13.4% in 2 to 23 months, 2 to 8 years, 9 to 17 years, and 45 to 60 years age strata respectively.

Fever  with  onset  within  7  days  after  the  booster  vaccination  and  considered  related  to  the  booster occurred in two subjects each (5.9%) in Strata B and C, and three subjects (18.8%) in Stratum D (none in Stratum A). After the booster vaccination, the vast majority of subjects were determined to have  normal  body  temperatures.  Malaise,  shivering  and  irritability  were  reported  at  lower  rates: Shivering within  7  days  after  and  related  to  the  booster  vaccination  was  reported  in  one  subject  in Stratum  D.  No  subject  in  any  strata  experienced  related  malaise  within  7  days  after  booster

Injection  site  pain  was  the  most  common  specifically  queried  symptom  of  non-serious  injection  site reactions  after  first  and  second  vaccination  and  reported  by  17.9%  and  13.0%  of  subjects, respectively. Adverse events - Study 820903  Unsolicited AEs Between Day 43 and Day 361, unsolicited AEs were reported at a similar rate in the 3.75 μ g and 7.5 μ g dose group: 76.0% and 84.3% in Stratum A, 85.7% and 80.4% in Stratum B, 94.1% and 89.8% in Stratum C and 86.7% and 75.0% in Stratum D. No vaccine-related unsolicited AEs (excluding fever) occurred between Day 43 and Day 361. For  the  3.75  µg  dose  group,  the  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AEs  were  sinusitis  (24%)  in Stratum A; tracheitis (26.5%) and acute tonsillitis (24.5%) in Stratum B; otitis media (33.3%) and tracheitis  (27.5%)  in  Stratum  C,  influenza-like  illness  (20%),  bronchitis  (20%),  rhinitis  (20%)  and tracheitis (20%) in Stratum D. For the 7.5 µg dose group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were sinusitis (21.6%) and acute tonsillitis  (17.6%)  in  Stratum A,  acute  tonsillitis  (27.5%)  in  Stratum  B,  otitis  media  (34.7%), acute tonsillitis (24.5%), bronchitis (22.4%), gastroenteritis (20.4%) and cough (20.4%) in Stratum C, dermatitis diaper (25%), bronchitis (25%) and pharyngitis (20%) in Stratum D.  Deaths and SAEs No deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs occurred between Day 43 and Day 361 of this study. A total of 27 unrelated SAEs in 22 subjects were reported.  Systemic reactions Within 7 days after the booster vaccination, the majority of subjects experienced no systemic reactions (excluding fever). Rates of non-serious systemic reactions were 6.7% (N=2), 2.9% (N=1), 0.0% and 18.8% (N=3) in Strata A, B, C and D, respectively. No severe systemic reactions occurred. Headache was the most common specifically queried symptom of systemic reactions, occurring in two (6.7%) subjects in Stratum A, followed by fatigue and vomiting in one subject each (2.9%) in Stratum B. No subject in Stratum C experienced symptoms of systemic reactions. Inconsolable or excessive crying and disturbed sleep were the most frequently reported symptoms in Stratum D, each in two subjects (12.5%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

vaccination. Only one subject in Stratum D experienced irritability within 7 days after and related to the booster vaccination.

##  Injection site reactions

Within 7 days after the booster vaccination, non-serious injection site reaction rates were 13.3% in Stratum  A,  8.8%  in  Stratum  B,  11.8%  in  Stratum  C  and  6.3%  in  Stratum  D.  Most  injection  site reactions were mild and moderate; one severe case of injection site redness was reported in Stratum A. The most common specifically reported symptoms of local reactions were: injection site pain (5.913.3% in Strata A, B, C and D) and injection site induration (5.9-8.8% in Strata B and C). Injection site induration and swelling were not reported for subjects in Stratum A and Stratum D.

Post-marketing data on pregnancy Pregnancy reports from the pandemic observational study 820901, the pregnancy registry set up by the United Kingdom Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) and national vaccination campaigns were previously submitted and assessed in the PSURs covering the period from October 2009 to October 2011. Of 33 pregnancies in study 820901, 26 women delivered a child with normal foetal/neonatal status; one female had a child with an unspecified disorder, which was prematurely delivered (30 weeks) by caesarean section (reported as a related SAE). No specification of pregnancy outcome was available for the remaining 6 women. Serious AEs in pregnant women included premature labor (19 days after first vaccination), caesarean section, pulmonary embolism, pregnancy complications (induced labor in one subject 3 weeks prior to due date because foetal heartbeat was not clearly audible - healthy infant) and gastroenteritis, all of which were judged unrelated to vaccination. The  UKTIS  conducted  a  study  on  Influenza  A/H1N1  vaccination  during  pregnancy.  Out  of  2307 pregnant  women,  10  were  vaccinated  at  least  once  with  Celvapan.  Only  eight  pregnancy  outcomes were  provided  for  the  Celvapan-vaccinated  group,  all  of  which  were  live  births  with  no  congenital abnormalities. In  addition,  during  the  pandemic  vaccination  campaign  in  Jersey  over  40%  of  pregnant  and  postpartum  women  (total  population  pregnant  or  post-partum:  1973  individuals)  were  vaccinated  with Celvapan. No safety signals were reported. 1.3.3. Discussion Based  on  the  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  study  820903,  booster  vaccination  was  safe  and  well tolerated,  and  there  was  no  new  safety  concern  between  Day  43  and  Day  361  after  the  priming vaccination. With  regard  to  the  pandemic  observational  study  820901,  safety  analysis  from  a  total  of  3,216 subjects aged 2 months to 92 years were provided in the final study report. The data confirmed that a two-dose vaccination regimen, with Celvapan H1N1 containing 7.5 μ g antigen strain A/H1N1/California/07/2009 was well tolerated across all age strata.  Low systemic and local reaction rates after both vaccinations were reported and the safety follow-up raised no specific safety concern until 6 months after the second vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Incidence of fever in the analysis group of commonly observed reactions was low within the 7 days observational window after the first and second vaccination. The rate of fever was highest in subjects aged 2 to 8 years after the first vaccination, and in subjects aged 2 to 23 months after the second vaccination.  Fever  rates  in  adults  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the  H1N1  clinical  study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

820902; instead they were slightly higher in children aged 9 to 17 years and lower in children aged 2 months to 8 years as compared to the paediatric study 820903.

In study 820901 a total of 648 and 583 subjects were included in the analysis set for assessment of commonly  observed  adverse  reactions  after  the  first  and  second  vaccination.  As  compared  to  the clinical study in children aged 6 months to 17 years (study 820903), a higher frequency of systemic reactions, i.e. irritability, crying, drowsiness and loss of appetite in children up to 5 years of age, and headache, fatigue and muscle pain in children 6 to 17 years of age, was reported in the commonly observed adverse reactions subset. Similar results were seen for adults aged 18 years and older, with systemic reactions higher in study 820901 in comparison to the clinical study 820902 in adults above 18  years  of  age.  These  observations  can  be  partially  explained  by  the  inclusion  of  events  with  unassessable causality as 'related' events, and also by differences in the recruitment strategy between the observational and  the clinical studies. Whereas  no  specific exclusion criteria except the contraindications  to  vaccination  as  specified  in  the  SmPC  has  been  applied  for  recruitment  to  the observational study 820901, subjects who were not considered healthy at the time of vaccination were strictly excluded from participation to the clinical study. Overall, considering the safety data available from observational study 820901 and from the paediatric study 820903, the safety profile of Celvapan remains unchanged.  The use of Celvapan H1N1 during pregnancy  does  not  raise  any  safety  concern,  although  the  data  available  is  limited.  The  product information was updated taking into account these latest results. 1.4. Changes to the Product Information The MAH proposed the following changes (additions: italic; deletion: strikethrough) to the PI, to which the CHMP agreed:  SmPC section 4.2 (Posology) Children aged 6 to 35 months Limited data are available in infants and young children aged 6 months to 35 months. If vaccination is considered necessary, the dosing should be in accordance with the recommendations given for children 3to 17 years of age. One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.  SmPC section 4.6 (Pregnancy and Lactation) Fertility, p regnancy and lactation There are currently no data available on the use of Celvapan in pregnancy. The safety of Celvapan in pregnancy and lactation has been assessed in a limited number of pregnant women. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The use of Celvapan may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations.

Celvapan may be used in lactating women.

## Post-marketing surveillance

## Pandemic Observational Study with Celvapan (H1N1)v

Preliminary results from the pandemic observational study with Celvapan (H1N1)v confirmed the safety profile as observed in the clinical studies.

In an observational safety study including 3216 subjects aged 6 months to 60 years and older, the nature of adverse events was consistent with those observed in other clinical studies in adults and children. The following adverse reactions were reported at a higher frequency category than in the other clinical studies:

Very common: Injection site pain, injection site redness, muscle pain

The MAH took this opportunity to update in section 4.8 the number of subjects enrolled in clinical trials with  a  version  of  Celvapan  containing  a  H5N1  vaccine  strain  from  'approximately  3500'  to 'approximately 3700' as the safety dataset now includes additional data that have become available from a Phase I/II clinical study (clinical study protocol 810802) conducted in 230 subjects aged 18 to 60 years. Furthermore in section 5.1 a sentence that safety and immunogenicity data is available in special risk groups with the A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine has been added as a result of a

Adults aged 18 years and older: Uncommon: influenza like illness Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years: Very common: fatigue, headache Uncommon: cough Children aged 6 months to 5 years: Very common: Injection site redness, drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, crying Preliminary safety data from 425 children (above 5 years of age), adolescents and adults showed that within 7 days after the first vaccination 37. 9% of subjects reported systemic reactions and 25.4% reported injection site reactions. In 91 children aged 6 months to 5 years systemic reactions were reported after the first vaccination in 35.2% and injection site reactions occurred in 23.1% of subjects. After the second dose adverse reactions occurred at a lower frequency. Very common reactions reported in adults: Injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, increased sweating. Very common reactions reported in children above 5 years of age and adolescents: Injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms Very common reactions reported in children aged 6 months to 5 years: Injection site reactions, drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, diarrhea  SmPC section 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties) Safety and immunogenicity data obtained three weeks after administration of two doses of Celvapan (H1N1)v to healthy children aged 6 months to 17 years were included in this section. For details of the changes please refer to the annexed PI in track change. During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the SmPC section 5.1 for better readability and inclusion of the booster response from the paediatric study 820903.  Additional changes to the SmPC Medicinal product no longer authorised

Phase III clinical study (clinical study protocol 810705) that included approximately 300 immunocompromised and approximately 300 chronically ill subjects.

Safety  data  from  studies  810802  and  810705  were  submitted  in  context  of  the  initial  MAA  for  the prepandemic H5N1 vaccine Vepacel. The data are already assessed and discussed by the CHMP. The currently approved product information of Vepacel reflects these study results accordingly. Therefore the MAH's proposal to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 with these minor details was agreed by the CHMP.

-  Additional changes to the PI Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. In addition, minor linguistic amendments were made in the SmPC and in the Labelling.  Changes to the Annex II The CHMP agreed with the MAH proposal to update the list of obligations in Annex II as reported in section 4 of this assessment report, based on their fulfilled status. The completed obligations are the following: 1. SOB 30 (pharmacovigilance, The MAH will conduct a prospective cohort safety study in at least 9,000 patients in different age groups, including immunocompromised subjects, in accordance with the protocol submitted with the Risk Management Plan. Observed-to-Expected analyses will  be performed) :  study 820901 was submitted on 03/12/2009. Variations II-12, II-13 and II-19/G originated from this observational study. 2. FUM 37 (quality, The final stability study reports for the PMVH, MVB and final container should be  submitted  as  soon  as  they  become  available ):  the  final  container  data  (FCP)  have  been submitted via variation IB-18 received on 10/03/2011. 3. FUM  40 (clinical, The  MAH  commits  to  provide  the  final  Reports  for  the  following  study performed in children: Study 820903 ((H1N1)v clinical trial) Part B (Day 181) + Part C (up to Day  381 ):  the  interim  results  for  this  study  were  submitted  on  01/04/2010  and  with  the consequent measures as the data became available (FUMs 40.1, 40.2, 40.3). Variations II-15 and II-19/G have originated from this paediatric study. 4. S-PSURs (Pharmacovigilance, The  MAH  commit  to  submit  on  a  monthly  basis  a  report including: i) a frequency table of all spontaneous cases per country, stratified according to type of  report  (medically  confirmed  or  non-medically  confirmed)  and  seriousness,  for  the  period covered  by  the  report  and  cumulatively;  ii)  a  frequency  table  of  all  spontaneous  adverse reactions by SOC, High Level Term (HLT) and Preferred Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports,  for  the  period  covered  by  the  report  and  cumulatively;  iii)  a  line  listing  of  Adverse events  of  special  interest  (as  defined  in  the  CHMP  Recommendations  [EMEA/359381/2009]) reported  from  countries  of  the  European  Economic  Area.

PSU11  was  received  on  30-11-2009  and PSU16 covered the period from 09 Mar 2010 through 05 Apr 2010. There was no additional distribution  of  the  vaccine  within  the  EU  and  outside  the  EU  since  05  Apr  2010.  Thus,  the safety profile of Celvapan did not change since assessment of the sixth PSUR. The variation II13 was submitted to update section 4.8 of the SmPC. The first full PSUR (PSU43) covered the Medicinal product no longer authorised

period 06.10.09 - 30.04.10. No new relevant safety information emerged after the cut-off date of the sixth simplified PSUR.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The  MAH  provided  the  final  results  on  antibody  persistence,  booster  and  safety  follow-up  from  the clinical study 820903 performed in children and adolescents.

| Variation(s) accepted   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Type   |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the results on immunogenicity and safety from the pandemic observational study 820901 (SOB 30) and the paediatric study 820903 (FUM 40). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include minor amendments in the SmPC and Labelling.

The antibody persistence profile following two-dose vaccination with Celvapan H1N1 was shown to be largely stable up to D181 after the first dose, as compared with the data at Day 43 after the first dose. Booster response data has shown that priming with two doses of vaccine was robust and capable of inducing immunologic memory resulting in a high booster response to the A/H1N1/California/07/2009 strain of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine administered approximately one year after the first vaccination.  Booster  vaccination  was  safe  and  well  tolerated,  and  there  was  no  new  safety  concern between Day 43 and Day 361 after the priming vaccination. The  final  safety  data  from  a  total  of  3,216  subjects  aged  2  months  to  92  years  enrolled  in  the observational pandemic study 820901 confirmed that a two-dose vaccination regimen with Celvapan containing  7.5 μ g  HA  was  well  tolerated  across  all  age  strata.  Low  systemic  and  local  reaction  rates after both vaccinations were reported and the safety follow-up raised no specific safety concern until 6 months after the second vaccination.  In addition the use of Celvapan H1N1 during pregnancy did not raise any safety concern, although the data available from post-marketing are limited. The product information was appropriately amended to reflect these results. In  conclusion  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  results  discussed  for  this  group  of  variations  do  not impact on the product benefit/risk balance, which remains positive. 3. Recommendations Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  group  of  variations acceptable  and  therefore  recommends  the  variations  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation, concerning the following changes: Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

<!-- image -->

Update of sections 4.2, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the results on immunogenicity and safety from the pandemic observational study 820901 and the paediatric study 820903. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include minor amendments in the SmPC and Labelling. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version  8.1.  Some  of  the  obligations  (Conditions  to  the  Marketing  Authorisation)  have  been  deleted from the Annex II as fulfilled. Summary The final results on antibody persistence, booster and safety follow-up from the clinical study 820903 performed in children and adolescents were provided. The antibody persistence profile following twodose vaccination with Celvapan H1N1 was shown to be largely stable up to D181 after the first dose, as  compared  with  the  data  at  Day  43  after  the  first  dose.  Booster  response  data  has  shown  that priming with two doses of vaccine was robust and capable of inducing immunologic memory resulting in a high booster response to the A/H1N1/California/07/2009 strain of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine administered approximately one year after the first vaccination. Booster vaccination was safe and  well  tolerated,  and  there  was  no  new  safety  concern  between  Day  43  and  Day  361  after  the priming vaccination. The  final  safety  data  from  a  total  of  3,216  subjects  aged  2  months  to  92  years  enrolled  in  the observational pandemic study 820901 confirmed that a two-dose vaccination regimen with Celvapan containing  7.5 μ g  HA  was  well  tolerated  across  all  age  strata.  Low  systemic  and  local  reaction  rates after both vaccinations were reported and the safety follow-up raised no specific safety concern until 6 months after the second vaccination.  In addition the use of Celvapan H1N1 during pregnancy did not raise any safety concern, although the data available from post-marketing are limited. The  PI  was  updated  to  reflect  these  new  data  and  the  obligations  which  have  been  fulfilled  were deleted from Annex II. Medicinal product no longer authorised
