| Update of the SPC further to the revised class labelling relating to lactic acidosis, safety related changes further to analyses of Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) and other safety reports and harmonisation with Ziagen, Epivir and Combivir product information. The changes consist in the update of symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions in section 4.4 ('Special warnings and special precautions for use') and 4.8 ('Undesirable effects'), inclusion of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as undesirable effects not associated with hypersensitivity reactions in section 4.8, and the inclusion of pure red cell aplasia, aplastic anemia and hepatitis in section 4.8. As a consequence, the Package Leaflet has been updated according to the above and according to the latest EMEA/QRD template. In addition, the list of local representatives has been revised. | II-0005              | II                       | 25.07.02                            |                                         |
