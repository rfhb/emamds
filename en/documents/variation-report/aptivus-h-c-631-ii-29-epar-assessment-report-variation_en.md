## 1. Introduction

Aptivus  (tipranavir  -  TPV)  was  developed  for  treatment-experienced  patients  who  have  Human Immunodeficiency  Virus  type  1  (HIV-1)  strains  with  Protease  Inhibitor  (PI)  resistance  associated mutations. On 25 October 2005, TPV 250 mg soft capsules were authorised in the European Union (EU)  under  exceptional  circumstances  for  combination  antiretroviral  (ARV)  treatment  of  HIV-1 infected  adult  patients  who  are  treatment-experienced  and  infected  with  HIV-1  strains  resistant  to more than one PI. The recommended dose is 500 mg TPV, co-administered with 200 mg ritonavir (RTV;  if  used  as  booster  =/r),  twice  daily  (b.i.d.).  In  February  2008,  following  the  2 nd annual reassessment of Aptivus, the CHMP recommended that the exceptional circumstances be lifted since all specific obligations had been fulfilled.

At  the  time  of  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA)  for  Aptivus,  the  company submitted  the  interim  results  of  a  phase  I/IIa  (1182.14)  study  conducted  in  treatment  naïve  and experienced  children  using  an  oral  solution  formulation.  Patients  were  stratified  according  to  age (i.e. 2  to  &lt;6  years,  6  to  &lt;12  years  and  12 to  18  years)  and randomised  into  one  of  2  different  dose regimens:  high  dose  group  (TPV  375  mg/m 2 with  RTV  150  mg/m 2 )  and  low  dose  group  (TPV 290 mg/m 2 with RTV 115 mg/m 2 ).

Only  limited  data  from  37  children  were  available  at  the  time  of  the  initial  opinion.  Out  of  these 37 children,  33  received  TPV  with  RTV  for  4  weeks.  The  mean  trough  concentration  was approximately 30% higher with the higher dose as compared to the lower dose. Considering the very limited  clinical  data  available  and  the  lack  of  bioequivalence  between  the  oral  solution  and  the capsules, the CHMP concluded at the time that TPV should not be used in children and that further data  were  needed  before  a  marketing  authorisation  for  the  oral  solution  could  be  granted.  The provision of the final reports from Study 1182.14 was part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled in the post-authorisation setting.

The  MAH  submitted  the  48-week  results  from  Study  1182.14  in  July  2006  in  the  framework  of FUM 021.  Following  the  review  of  these  data,  the  CHMP  requested  additional  information  in December 2006 and responses were submitted by the MAH in February 2007. Although the duration of Study 1182.14 was 48 weeks, an optional safety extension was planned, for which 100-week results have now become available.

Based  on  these  data,  the  MAH  has  now  applied  for  an  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  to include  HIV-infected  paediatric  patients  aged  2  years  and  older.  The  proposed  Body  Surface  Area (BSA) based dose for children (age 2 to 18 years) is 375 mg/m² TPV co-administered with 150 mg/m² RTV, b.i.d.. The paediatric dose should not exceed the adult dose.

In parallel to this variation application, the MAH also submitted an extension application for a new pharmaceutical form of TPV, i.e. a 100 mg/ml oral solution intended for use in paediatric and adult patients. This line extension application is assessed in parallel within the procedure EMEA/H/C/631/X/30.

In  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  proposed  to  update  sections  4.1  'Therapeutic  indications', 4.2 'Posology  and  method  of  administration',  4.4  'Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use', 4.8 'Undesirable effects', 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties' and 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties' of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include information on the treatment of paediatric patients.  The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  is  revised  accordingly.  In  addition,  a  user  testing  has  been performed  on  the  proposed  PL  for  the  oral  solution.  This  readability  testing  is  discussed  within procedure X/30. Consequential changes were proposed for the PL of the soft capsules.

## 2. Non-clinical aspects

## Toxicology

At the time of initial MAA, a complete toxicological programme was performed with TPV. It included single dose studies (mice, rats and dogs), repeated dose studies (TPV alone in mice, rats and dogs and TPV + RTV in rats and dogs), genotoxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies (rats and rabbits). Effects of TPV in repeat-dose toxicity studies with TPV were observed primarily in the liver, the gastrointestinal tract, the coagulation system and the testes. Liver was a target organ of TPV in  all  tested  species:  rats,  mice  and  dogs.  Hepatic  effects  of  TPV  common  to  all  species  included increased  liver  weights  and  hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  Testicular  effects  consisted  of  decreased weights and bilateral seminiferous tubule degeneration and/or atrophy observed in a 26-week TPV/r study in rats  at  a  dose  level  of  1200/320  mg/kg/day  TPV/r  and  in  the  39-week  study  in  dogs  after administration of 320 mg/kg/day TPV alone. Further review of these findings led to the conclusion that  the  testicular  effects  were  not  attributable  to  TPV.  Lymphocytolysis  was  also  observed.  An immunotoxicity study has been conducted in mice treated for 28 days to TPV/r the highest dose being 300/80 mg/kg. TPV/r had no effect on the antibody response following immunisation with a T-cell dependent antigen.

When  assessing  the  need  for  additional  toxicity  studies  in  juvenile  animals,  differences  between children  and  adults  in  the  structure  and  function  of  organ  systems  resulting  from  growth  and development  should  be  considered  to  determine  if  the  standard  battery  of  toxicology  studies  is sufficient. Several organ systems are not of concern in children aged 2 years and older due to their maturation at an earlier time point (e.g. pulmonary and renal systems), or the lack of effects on these systems in the standard battery of repeat dose toxicology studies (e.g. skeletal system). Although the nervous  system  continues  to  develop  until  puberty,  safety  pharmacology  studies  and  repeated  dose toxicity  studies  did  not  raise  any  safety  concern  related  to  nervous  central  system  in  adults,  and therefore this organ system was not considered to be potentially affected in the juvenile population.

Safety concerns pertaining to the immune and reproductive systems could be expected in the juvenile population.  However,  additional  data  provided  during  the  initial  MAA  evaluation  were  reassuring. Finally,  since  liver  is  in  a  mature  state  in  children  aged  2  years,  no  difference  was  expected  in hepatotoxicity in  children compared to adults. Therefore, in accordance with the 'Guideline on the need  for  non-clinical  testing  in  juvenile  animals  of  pharmaceuticals  for  paediatric  indications' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005), the CHMP agreed that there was no need to perform any further study in juvenile animals.

Since the initial MAA, two investigative studies in male rats were performed to evaluate the effects of TPV  on  the  coagulation  cascade  and  to  determine  if  vitamin  E-TPGS,  an  esterified  derivative  of vitamin E present in TPV oral solution, would modulate the changes induced by TPV. Bleeding events were  observed,  associated  with  prolonged  prothrombin  time  (PT),  activated  partial  thromboplastin time  (aPTT)  and  a  decrease  in  some  vitamin  K  dependent  factors.  Coadministration  of  TPV  with vitamin E-TPGS resulted in an exacerbation of the anticoagulant effects of TPV, specifically causing increases  in  PT,  aPTT,  and  Thrombotest  levels  and  decreases  in  vitamin  K  dependent  factors.  Coadministration  of  TPV  with  vitamin  E  should  be  used  with  caution  and  at  doses  not  higher  than 1200 IU vitamin E per day. This information was included in the SPC (Variation II/23 - Commission Decision on 7 July 2008). Co-administration of TPV with vitamin E-TPGS, an esterified derivative of vitamin E, resulted in an exacerbation of the anti-coagulant effects of TPV in male rats, specifically causing increases in PT, aPTT, and Thrombotest levels and decreases in vitamin K dependent factors.

## 3 Clinical aspects

## 3.1 Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics

The Bioavailability (BA) of TPV oral solution was evaluated through two studies:

- a  Phase  I  study  (1182.45)  to  assess  the  relative  BA  of  TPV  from  capsule  and  oral  solution formulations at 500 mg b.i.d., each co-administered with RTV 200 mg b.i.d (TPV/r 500/200).
- a Phase I study (1182.100) to assess the relative BA of TPV/r 500 mg/200 mg at steady state when TPV and RTV are administered as oral solutions versus capsules in the fed and fasted state.

These studies are discussed within procedure X/30.

In support of this application for a paediatric indication, the MAH submitted data from Study 1182.14, a multicentre, open-label, randomised Phase I/IIa study of two doses of TPV oral solution with low dose RTV in HIV-infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. The design, efficacy and safety findings from this study are presented in sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 of this report. Efficacy aspects include  the  issues  of  viral  load  dynamics,  TPV  concentrations,  baseline  viral  resistance  and  viral response. The main pharmacokinetic (PK) results from Study 1182.14 are presented hereafter.

## Model-based pharmacokinetic analyses in Study 1182.14 (4-week interim analysis)

In model-based analyses of steady-state population PK among 52 children in Trial 1182.14, during the first  28  days  of  TPV/r  oral  solution  administration,  low  and  high  dose  TPV/r  were  evaluated  and stratified  according  to  age  group.  Dosing  for  this  trial  was  determined  by  allometric  scaling  of  the adult dose, with TPV/r 290/115 mg/m 2 b.i.d. (the low dose) projected to be approximately equivalent to the adult dose and 375/150 mg/m 2 b.i.d. projected to be a 30% increase in the adult dose. The main PK results are shown in Table 1.

Higher concentrations for TPV Cp0,12h, Cmax and AUC0-12h were observed in the 375/150 mg/m 2 dose group in the two lower age groups (2 to &lt;6 and 6 to &lt;12 years) compared to the lower TPV/r dose. Values were approximately equal in the 12 to 18 year age stratum. It should be noted that the dose was limited to 500/200 mg and that more patients in the TPV/r high dose in the 12 to 18 age group reached that limit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  illustrated  in  Table  2,  a  comparison  of  paediatric  and  adult  data  showed  that  TPV  systemic exposure  (AUC), trough  and  maximum  concentrations  obtained  in  children  receiving  the  low  dose were closer to those observed in adults. For both doses, the largest variability (approximately 70%) was observed in trough concentrations.

| 500 mg       | Geometric Mean |          35.6 |        77.6 |          710 |         1.3  | 10.2     |
| N=106 males  | gCV %          |          54   |        22   |           30 |        30    | 5        |
| 500 mg       | Geometric Mean |          41.6 |        94.8 |          851 |         1.2  | 7.7      |
| N=14 females | gCV %          |         153   |        24   |           44 |        44    |          |

Further analyses showed that the higher variability may be mainly driven by the 12-18 year group, which  may  reflect  a limited compliance  in these patients. When  considering  the  individual demographic and PK parameters, it was noted that in the low dose group the youngest patients were most frequently under-dosed (difference of more than 10 mg less between dose actually administered and dose calculated according to BSA) as compared to the older age groups. The opposite trend was observed for the high dose group (older age groups more frequently under-dosed). However patient numbers in each age group were too small to allow for a reliable comparison.

In  conclusion,  both  the  low  and  high  doses  met  protocol-defined  PK  criteria  for  dose  selection: geometric mean TPV Cmin &gt;16 µ M and geometric mean TPV AUC0-12h &gt;483 h· µ M.  However, PK results at Week 4 suggested that the low dose (290 mg TPV) was the most comparable to the adult dose.

## Steady-state trough concentrations in Study 1182.14

Plasma TPV and RTV trough concentrations collected 10-14 hours after administration were evaluated by patient age group (2 - &lt;6 years, 6 - &lt;12 years and 12-18 years) and TPV/r dose group (290/115 mg/m 2 and 375/150 mg/m 2 ). Table 3 summarises the individual plasma concentrations collected from patients over 8 to 100 weeks of study and includes the 25% of patients (N = 23 patients of the total 93 patients) where the TPV/r dose was changed over those weeks of study.

Note: High Dose (375/150) : Low Dose (290/115)

For  the  TPV/r  low  dose  group,  the  geometric  mean  plasma  TPV  trough  concentrations  were approximately 33 µ M for patients 2 to &lt;6 years and 6 to &lt;12 years old and were approximately 50 µ M for  patients  12  years  and  older.  For  those  patients  receiving  TPV/r  high  dose,  the  geometric  mean plasma TPV trough concentrations were approximately 47, 61 and 55 µ M for the age groups 2 to &lt;6, 6 to &lt;12 and 12-18 years, respectively. For the TPV/r low dose group, the geometric mean plasma RTV trough concentrations were 0.11, 0.12 and 0.23 µ g/ml for patients in the age groups 2- &lt;6, 6- &lt;12 and 12-18 years, respectively. For the high dose group, geometric mean plasma RTV  trough concentrations were 0.14, 0.22 and 0.44 µ g/ml for patients in the age groups 2- &lt;6, 6- &lt;12 and 12-18 years, respectively. The CHMP questioned the relevance of these PK data in the lower dose group as well as the comparison of the TPV trough levels for the two doses, since data from patients having switched  doses  after  48  weeks  were  included  in  the  analysis  and  their  proportion  per  age  group  is unknown.

## 3.2 Clinical efficacy

## Design of Study 1182.14

Study 1182.14 is a multicentre, open-label, randomised Phase I/IIa study of two doses of TPV oral solution with low dose RTV in HIV-infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of TPV oral solution and  soft-gel  capsules  each  with  low-dose  RTV  in  HIV-1  infected  children  and  adolescents  and  to provide information regarding the PK-PD characteristics of two dose levels of TPV and RTV in this age group. The secondary objective of this study was to determine the dose of TPV/r in children and adolescents  between  2  and  18  years  of  age  required  for  an  adult  equivalent  systemic  exposure  of TPV/r 500/200 mg. Based on these objectives, an optimal treatment dose of TPV/r in children was to be selected and the benefits of formulation options were to be determined.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

HIV-infected  (viral  load  &gt;1500  RNA  copies/ml)  patients  2  to  18  years  of  age  could  be  included regardless of prior ARV therapy or HIV resistance status. This approach was considered questionable by the CHMP, in view of the safety profile of TPV; however, only 3 treatment- naïve patients were enrolled in the trial. To be included, children had to have acceptable screening laboratory values i.e. severity  not  higher  than  Grade  1  for  all  tests  defined  by  the  DAIDS  (&gt;3  months  of  age)  Table  for Grading  Severity  of  Paediatric  Adverse  Experiences  with  the  following  exceptions:  Grade  2  GGT, Grade  2  cholesterol,  Grade  2  triglycerides.  Active  hepatitis  B  or  C  disease  defined  as  HBsAg positivity or HCV antibody or RNA positivity with AST/ALT above Grade 2 were among exclusion criteria.

## Study design and treatment arms

Following the screening period, eligible patients were randomised to one of two doses of TPV/r:

- TPV/r low dose group: TPV 290 mg/m 2 + RTV 115 mg/m 2 b.i.d.
- TPV/r high dose group: TPV 375 mg/m 2 + RTV 150 mg/m 2 b.i.d.

Patients were stratified according to age (i.e., 2 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to 18 years). All patients started treatment with TPV oral solution. Children who were 12 years or older and reached TPV/r 500/200 mg dose were eligible to switch to TPV soft capsules after Week 4. HIV genotype testing was performed at the screening visit, but was not part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and was used to guide investigators in selecting optimal background antiretroviral regimen. At least two background antiretroviral agents were required in addition to TPV/r. No other PIs were allowed in the trial.

## Dose selection

The two TPV/r doses used in this trial are allometrically scaled doses of the adult recommended TPV/r 500/200 mg dose. The low dose (TPV 290 mg/m 2 + RTV 115 mg/m 2 ) is BSA-equivalent of the adult dose,  derived  by  dividing  the  adult  dose  with  mean  adult  BSA  of  1.73  m 2 .  The  high  dose  (TPV 375 mg/m 2 + RTV 150 mg/m 2 ) was calculated by dividing the adult dose with 1.33 m 2 (12 year old male BSA). Actual dosing of TPV and RTV was based on the BSA to reduce potential inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. BSA was calculated at randomisation and at each study visit and TPV/r dosing was adjusted as needed. The maximum TPV/r dose allowed was 500/200 mg b.i.d. regardless of the patient's BSA.

A  protocol  defined  interim  analysis  for  optimal  dose  selection  was  performed  on  a  subset  of 52 patients  who  completed  4  weeks  of  treatment  and  pseudorandom/intensive  PK  sampling.  The following criteria were applied to select the optimal dose: &lt;20% severe AEs; &lt;20% DAIDS Grade 3 or 4  laboratory  abnormalities;  median  viral  load  (VL)  decrease  greater  than  0.5  log10  copies/ml; geometric mean TPV Cmin &gt;16 µ M and geometric mean TPV AUC0-12h &gt;483 h· µ M.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- TPV 290 mg/m 2 + RTV 115 mg/m 2 b.i.d.: Entered: 58; treated: 58; analysed (for primary endpoint): 58
- TPV 375 mg/m 2 + RTV 150 mg/m 2 b.i.d.: Entered: 57; treated: 57; analysed (for primary endpoint): 57

The interim analysis subset (IAS) dataset included 52 patients who completed intensive/pseudorandom pharmacokinetic  evaluation  at  Week  2  and  completed  4  weeks  of  treatment.  The  full  analysis  set (FAS) population through 48 and 100 weeks of study treatment exposure consisted of 115 randomised and treated patients.

## Endpoints

The primary  endpoint  was  the  assessment  of  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  TPV/r  oral  formulation. Efficacy and pharmacokinetic endpoints were assessed as secondary endpoints.

## Efficacy endpoints:

- Proportion of patients reaching and maintaining a VL &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 48;
- Assessment of patient compliance with administration of study medication;
- Change in mean CD4 count from baseline to Week 48;
- Time to treatment failure.

## Safety endpoints:

Adverse  events  and  laboratory  measurements  using  the  DAIDS  standardised  Toxicity  Table  for Grading Severity of Paediatric (&gt;3 months) Adverse Experiences

## Pharmacokinetic endpoints:

- TPV and RTV pharmacokinetic parameters at steady-state (Cmax, Cp0, Cp10h, Cp12h, AUC0-10h, AUC0-12h, tmax, CL, V, t1/2 ;
- Relative bioavailability of TPV oral solution and TPV soft-gel capsules.

## Statistical methods and definitions

Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic, and virologic parameters. Most analyses were stratified for age (2 to &lt;6, 6 to &lt;12, and 12 to 18 years of age) and evaluated with respect to TPV/r treatment.

## Study populations:

- FAS: The complete set of patients that included all randomised and non-randomised patients who took at least one dose of TPV/r.
- On treatment (OT): Missing data in these analyses were not replaced. This approach was used for all endpoints.  On treatment was a method to derive a valid measurement as close to the planned visit as possible within a 'window' around a planned visit.
- Non-completer considered failure (NCF): Missing values replaced by an indicator for failure. This approach was applicable only for binary endpoints (e.g., VL reduction &lt;400 copies/ml). If  a  rebound  was  immediately  preceded  by  consecutive  missing  values  the  NCF  approach considered them as failures.

The time to treatment failure was analysed using standard Kaplan-Meier (KM) statistical methods. The NCF method of dealing with missing data, utilising the FAS population was used.

## Compliance:

Compliance with the study intake regimen was defined as a treatment adherence rate between 95% and 120%. Treatment adherence was measured at each study visit by measuring the amount of oral solution or capsules that were returned.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Virologic parameters:

For all analyses of HIV RNA, values were expressed as log10 copies/ml.  The baseline was defined as the mean of the last two observations after log10 transformation, prior to the start of treatment with TPV/r. Sensitivity analyses used both the last observation carried forward (LOCF) and OT approaches to investigate the influence of missing data. The median and mean baseline VL and the median and mean change in VL from baseline were derived. Additionally, the proportion of patients who achieved an RNA level below the limit of quantification (e.g., &lt;400 and &lt;50 copies/ml) and the proportion of patients who had ≥ 1 log10 reduction were presented in a descriptive fashion and analysed separately for each of the two dose groups at Week 48.

## Immunologic parameters:

For the CD4 cell count and CD4 percentage (CD4%) analysis, the median and mean baseline value for each  treatment  group  were  derived.  The  CD4% is  defined  as  the  percent  of  total  lymphocytes  that express  the  CD4  marker.  The  change  in  CD4  cell  counts  from  baseline  through  Week  100  was assessed using descriptive statistics.  Both the LOCF and OT methods, utilising the FAS populations were used.

## Resistance parameters:

The measures of resistance included the following scores:

- TPV score: number of mutations present in any of the following protease gene codons L10V, I13V, K20M/R/V, L33F, E35G, M36I, K43T, M46L, I47V, I54A/M/V, Q58E, H69K, T74P, V82L/T, N83D, and I84V;
- FDA score: number of protease gene mutations at codons 30, 32, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 73, 82, 84, 88, and 90;
- IAS score:  number of protease gene mutations at any of the following codons: 10, 20, 24, 30, 32, 33, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 63, 71, 73, 77, 82, 84, 88, and 90;
- 'Lamivudine  (3TC)  and/or  tenofovir  (TDF)  mutations'  include  reverse  transcriptase  gene mutations K65R, M184I/V, and Q151M as well as any insertion at codon 69;
- 'Thymidine analog  mutations  (TAMs)'  which  include  reverse  transcriptase  mutations  41L, 67N/G, 70R, 210W, 215F/Y, 219Q/E/N'

Phenotypic  susceptibility  was  expressed  as  'x'-fold-change  from  wild-type  control  50%  inhibitory concentration (FC in IC50) for the individual medicinal products tested (i.e., TPV, lopinavir).

A genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) was derived as a measure of sensitivity to the ARV background regimen. Each background ARV medication was assigned a value of 0, 0.25, or 1 based on defined criteria. The GSS was the sum of these values for each patient.

The genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ) is defined as the geometric mean TPV concentration divided by the number of TPV mutations at baseline.

## Study duration

The planned duration of the study was 48 weeks.  However, continued TPV/r treatment was permitted for  patients  who  achieved  a  viral  load  &lt;400  copies/ml  or  a  viral  load  reduction  of  0.5  log 10 from baseline at the 48-week visit, or who had not fulfilled the criteria and rules for stopping treatment, in the optional safety extension (OSE). The study is ongoing.

## Discussion on the design

The  following  deficiencies,  which  may  hamper  the  validity  of  the  results,  were  identified  by  the CHMP:

- the study was conducted in an 'open-label' manner;
- the study was not powered for a comparison of the efficacy of the different dosing/formulation groups;
- no (external) comparator group was included;
- the  switch  to  TPV  capsules  in  the  12-18  year-old  patients  was  not  conducted  in  a  randomised manner.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy results from the 4-week interim analysis

A more pronounced decrease in VL was observed in the TPV/r low dose group. Furthermore a lower virological response was observed in the 12-18 year group when compared to other age groups in both TPV dose groups. The defined criteria of median VL decrease &gt;0.5 log10 copies/ml was not met in the 12-18 year group receiving high dose TPV/r.

## Interim analysis conclusions

With the exception of the efficacy criterion for the 12-18 year/high dose group, both doses met the five protocol defined criteria for dose selection (PK and safety results are presented in sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 of this report, respectively) .  However, the TPV low dose provided TPV trough concentrations closer to those in adults while allowing an overall better safety profile with no loss of efficacy. Even if no  statistical  analysis  was  performed,  a  general  trend  for  higher  early  virological  response  was reported in the low dose group. These results in favour of the low dose group were mainly apparent for the two youngest age groups (2 to &lt;6 age and 6 to &lt;12). Based on these results, the low dose (TPV/r 290/115 mg/m 2 b.i.d.) was selected and patients were switched to this dose. However, at the time the switch was implemented, all but 4 patients had already reached Week 48.

## Efficacy results at Week 48

A total of 115 randomised patients were included in the 48-week analysis, 58 in the TPV/r low dose and 57 in the TPV/r high dose group.

## Baseline data

The population mostly consisted of male children of white race. The baseline HIV characteristics of patients  showed  that  immunologic  and  virologic  parameters  were  comparable  between  the  two treatment groups overall, with a median baseline HIV RNA of 4.7 log10 copies/ml, CD4 cell counts of 379 cells/mm 3 , and CD4% of 20%. Twelve patients (10.4%) had positive clinical markers for hepatitis B  co-infection.  There  were  no  patients  with  HCV  co-infection.  The  majority  of  the  patients  (93%, 107/115) acquired the HIV infection through mother-to-child transmission.

The CHMP highlighted that based on the demographic and HIV-related baseline characteristics, the 12-18 years old patients continuing the oral solution differed from those switching to the soft capsules. Patients  switching  were  older  and  came  more  often  from  European  study  sites.  Moreover,  in 'switchers', number of PI resistance mutations and VL were lower, CD4 cells (absolute count as well as percentage) were higher. These differences indicate that the 'non-randomised' option to switch the formulation may have led to imbalances impacting the validity of the comparison of the performance of the two formulations.

Median number of previously used ARVs was 3 in the 2 to &lt;6 age group, 8 in the 6 to &lt;12 age group and  10  in  the  12  to  18  age  group.  Assessment  of  the  mutations  related  to  TPV  showed  higher resistance patterns in the older age groups. Resistance to all PIs was 20.0% (5/25) in the 2 to &lt;6 age group compared to 47.4% (18/38) in 6 to &lt;12 age group and 65.4% (34/52) in the 12 to 18 age group. The same pattern was present for individual PIs, as well as for ARVs from other classes. Efavirenz (EFV) was the most frequently used NNRTI (17.4%, 20/115). Enfuvirtide (ENF) was used by 13% (15/115) patients, 10.5% (4/38) in the 6 to &lt;12 age group and 21.2% (11/52) in the 12 to 18 age group.

## Treatment compliance

Despite the unpleasant taste of RTV and TPV oral solutions, the overall compliance was comparable between TPV/r high dose and low dose. The compliance was significantly higher in younger children (92% in low dose group vs. 67% in high dose group) than in older age groups (29-33% in low dose group and 50-53% in high dose group). The difference in favour of the higher dose group may be explained  by  the  fact  that  more  patients  in  this  group  were  allowed  to  switch  to  capsules  as  they reached per BSA-based calculation the maximum dose of TPV/r 500/200 mg. Moreover, many (24) of the patients who were supposed to take RTV oral solution switched to RTV capsules because of bad taste.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patient disposition

There were more patient discontinuations in the TPV/r low dose group than in the TPV/r high dose group  at  both  Weeks  24  and  48.  The  frequency  of  other  reasons  (virological  failure)  was  notably higher in the TPV/r low dose group 10.3% (6/58) than in the TPV/r high dose group 5.3% (3/57) at Week 48.

## Results

Overall,  45.6%  (26/57)  patients  achieved  VL  &lt;400  copies/ml  in  the  TPV/r  high  dose  compared  to 39.7 % (23/58) in the TPV/r low dose, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.57). A total of 34.5% (20/58) patients in the TPV/r low dose group vs. 35.1% (20/57) patients in the TPV/r high dose group achieved &lt;50 copies/ml. Median VL decrease was -0.80 log10 copies/ml in the TPV/r low  dose  group  compared  to  -1.24  log10  copies/ml  in  the  TPV/r  high  dose  group.  The  difference between the two doses at Week 48 was not statistically significant. The overall proportion of patients achieving  VL  decrease ≥ 1  log10  copies/ml  was  43.1%  (25/58)  in  the  TPV/r  low  dose  and  45.6% (26/57) in the TPV/r high dose at Week 48 (p=0.85). Both dose groups showed overall increase in CD4 cell count and CD4% through Week 48.

As shown in Table 4 above, a higher proportion of patients achieved VL&lt;400 copies/ml in the 2 to &lt;6 age group than in the 6 to &lt;12 age group and the 12 to 18 age group. Likewise, the proportion of patients with virologic response was higher in younger children (e.g. 50% of patients in the 2- &lt;6 year group achieved VL &lt;50 copies/ml vs. 25% in the 12-18 year group). Although there was an overall trend  towards  better  virological  response  with  the  TPV/r  high  dose,  no  statistically  significant difference  was  observed.  This  trend  for  higher  response  with  the  high  dose  was  mainly  due  to  the better results observed in the 6 to &lt;12 years old and 12 to 18 years old age cohorts. In the 2 to &lt;6 year group there was on the contrary a trend for higher virological response with the TPV/r low dose group.

A logistic  regression  was  performed  modelling  the  effects  of  treatment  group,  genotypic  inhibitory quotient (GIQ), baseline viral load, age group, TPV adherence, and genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) on the outcome at Week 48 for the three virologic endpoints of HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/ml, HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/ml, and ≥ 1 log10 reduction of HIV RNA from baseline.

Greater baseline resistance tended to result in a lower proportion of virologic responders.  Increasing TPV mutation scores were associated with decreased rates of virologic response, particularly for the low dose patients.  In those patients with more baseline resistance, the high dose groups had higher viral response rates, especially in the group with ≥ 5 TPV mutations.

The GIQ is a reflection of TPV concentration and baseline resistance to TPV.  It was determined for each patient by dividing the geometric mean of TPV Ctrough obtained at steady state by the number of TPV mutations present at baseline.  Patients with the largest number of TPV mutations (i.e. patients with more advanced infections and more extensive prior treatment) had the lowest GIQ values.

However, this baseline resistance was countered in the high dose group by the achievement of higher concentrations of TPV.  Overall, the median GIQ values were larger among TPV/r high dose-treated patients (12.33 for low dose vs. 19.04 for high dose), a trend that was observed within each age group as  well.    Moreover, among the age groups, the 2 to &lt;6 year-olds exhibited the largest median GIQ score, with the 6 to &lt;12 year-olds given high dose TPV/r having a lower score, followed by 12 to 18 year-olds having the lowest score, reflecting that the younger children had fewer baseline mutations, which translated into higher GIQ and thus better virologic response rates.

Multivariate  analyses  revealed  that  GIQ  level  and  adherence  to  treatment  were  each  statistically significant predictors of viral load response.  When these parameters were included in the model, age was no longer an important factor.  Overall, higher GIQ scores led to higher odds ratios for response compared to the lowest GIQ quartile.  This suggests that treatment response can be improved by using the higher dose of TPV/r, resulting in an increase in TPV concentration and a higher GIQ.

Four (4) patients, all in the TPV/r low dose group, developed an AIDS defined illness. Kaplan-Meier probability  of  reaching  an  AIDS  defining  illness  up  to  Week  48  was  7.8%  in  the  TPV/r  low  dose group vs. 0.0% in the TPV/r high dose group (p = 0.04).

## Discussion on the 48-week results

The MAH concluded that TPV/r high dose, TPV 375 mg/m 2 + RTV 150mg/m 2 , is the appropriate dose for paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years as it provided a higher and more durable response with an acceptable safety profile (safety results are presented in section 3.3.3) . Therefore, although the interim analysis results at 24-week led to selection of the TPV/r low dose, all patients were switched to the TPV/r high dose following analysis of the 48-week results.

Theses  changes  highlight  the  difficulty  of  identifying  the  appropriate  dosing    based  on  a  rational argument as overall the results were not consistent across the different age groups: the low dose gave better response rate in the 2-6 and in the 12-18 age groups whereas the high dose gave better response rate in the 6-12 age group.

However, when analysing the efficacy results for both dose groups by 48 weeks for all age groups, the percentage of patients with VL &lt;50 copies/ml, results were similar for the low dose and the high dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(34.5% and 35.1%, respectively). This inconclusiveness of findings, not giving a clear picture on the effective dose within a good safety margin, highlights the paucity of the available data.

Specifically for the 12-18 year-old patients, only a small virologic impact was observed, i.e. -0.26 in TPV/r low dose group to -0.62 log10 copies/ml in the TPV/r high dose group (-0.2 in the oral solution group  and  -0.4  in  the  capsule  group).  Nevertheless,  comparison  with  other  clinical  trials  of  RTV boosted PIs show similar results. For all of them, efficacy results markedly decreased for adolescents when compared to children.

GIQ and adherence were shown to be significant predictors of Week 48 response rates while the age group was not a significant predictor. For this reason, the MAH believes that the higher dose of TPV/r is appropriate, especially for children who fulfil the current indication for TPV/r, and are infected with HIV that has failed prior therapy. In principle, the CHMP considered the use of the dose that provides the  higher  GIQ  in  this  target  population  with  viral  strains  harbouring  multi-resistance  reasonable. However, clinical data to substantiate this dose in children remain limited.

In addition, regarding the use of the capsule formulation in children, it is important to note that:

- -the  clinical  experience  gained  with  the  capsule  formulation  is  only  derived  from  the  use  in children above 12 years of age,
- -the  capsule  formulation  is  not  suitable  for  the  recommended  BSA  based  dosing  regimen  in children less than 12 years of age

Taking into account on the one hand the effect on viral load and on the other the above limitations, TPV/r  may  have  a  place,  even  if  very  limited,  in  the  treatment  strategy  for  HIV  infected  children harbouring  a  multi  resistant  virus.  In  view  of  the  limitations  of  clinical  data  in  children  with  the recommended  dose,  TPV/r  as  capsules  could  be  considered  for  the  treatment  of  children  above 12 years of age when no other therapeutic options are available.

During the procedure the MAH agreed to restrict the paediatric indication to children from 12 years of age and proposed a new wording for an indication in this age group for the capsule formulation.

## Efficacy results at Week 100

As  discussed  above,  based  on  the  48-week  data,  the  MAH  selected  the  TPV/r  high  dose  for  the continuation of the study, i.e. patients who were on low dose from the beginning of the trial and those who were on high dose and switched to low dose after the first interim analysis received the TPV/r high dose after Week 48.

## Disposition of patients

The rate of discontinuation during the extension phase was similar to that during the first 48 weeks of the  study  (around  25%). More patients in the 12-18 year group discontinued prior to Week 100 as compared to the younger groups (43% vs. 32%), mainly for non-adherence, adverse events and 'other reasons'. The discontinuation rate was the highest in the 12-18 years old children still receiving the oral solution, in particular during the first 48 weeks (44%). Only 6 patients in this subgroup were still in the study at week 100.

## Treatment compliance

The  compliance  was  not  assessed  at  Week  100.  The  CHMP  highlighted  that  data  on  long-term compliance would have been of interest.

## Results

The  100-week  efficacy  analyses  were  mainly  focussed  on  the  comparison  of  the  two  formulations (oral  solution  and  soft  capsules)  but  not  on  the  different  dose  regimens  investigated  in  the  first  48 weeks of the study. Changes from baseline in viral load, CD4 and CD4% and virological response rates are summarised in Tables 7 and 8 respectively.

## Discussion on the 100-week results

According to the MAH, these results suggest a comparable efficacy between the two TPV formulation treatment  groups  based  on  the  NCF  analysis  of  the  number  of  patients  with  VL  reduction  &lt;400, &lt;50 copies/ml  and  at  least  1  log 10 sustained  VL  reduction  from  baseline  virologic  endpoints.  The results  also  showed  an  advantage  among  capsule  treated  patients  over  oral  solution  treated  patients LOCF median changes from baseline in virologic and CD4-cell endpoints.

Due to the design of study, in particular in view of the 'non-randomised' switch of formulations in the 12-18  year  group,  a  valid  comparison is  difficult. Therefore,  the  CHMP  could not  conclude  on  the therapeutic equivalence of the two formulations based on the above results. Overall, the response rate in this study was significantly low. In both formulation groups, only approximately 20% of the 12-18 year-old patients had VL &lt;50 copies/ml at week 100 (NCF), which is considered worrying. The 100week efficacy data confirmed a lower virologic response in the12-18 year group compared to younger groups.

A Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to treatment failure (VL &gt;50 copies/ml) among patients 12-18 years of  age  per  formulation  showed  that  the  rate  of  patients  never  achieving  VL&lt;50  copies/ml  was important, especially for the OS formulation (70.8% vs. 58.6%). The analysis indicates that over the whole study period of 100 weeks the patients on TPV capsules had a consistently lower probability for virologic failure as compared to the group treated with OS. The difference became less pronounced towards the end of the observational period, but was still noticeable despite all patients being treated with  the  higher  TPV/r  dose  after  48  weeks.  This  is  essential,  as  not  only  patients  with  a  loss  of virological response are counted as failures, but also patients discontinuing study treatment for any reason (i.e. also side effects). Since the switch from oral solution to soft-gelatin capsule was conducted in  a  non-randomised manner, patients staying on oral solution can be considered as pre-selected in terms of tolerability of the liquid formulation. Nevertheless, globally the capsule compares favourable to the oral solution.

## Resistance analyses

## Patient population included in the resistance analyses

Thirty-six (36) paediatric HIV-infected patients who experienced virologic rebound or failure in Study 1182.14 were selected for on-treatment resistance testing. Among these patients, 5 (13.9%) patients were 2 to &lt;6 years old, 7 (19.4%) were 6 to &lt;12 years old, and 24 (66.7%) were 12 to 18 years old.

Out of 115 patients randomised in Study 1182.14, three were treatment-naïve, one in each age group. In  the  Rebound  subgroup,  only  1  patient  was  treatment-naïve.  Prior  treatment  with  the  three  main classes  of  ARVs  (NRTIs,  NNRTIs,  and  PIs)  was  extensive  and  8  patients  had  been  treated  with enfuvirtide.

Protease gene mutations associated with nelfinavir, lopinavir, and amprenavir use commonly present at baseline included: D30N (9.6%), M46I/L (39.1%), I47V (9.6%), V82A (29.6%), I84V (14.8%), and L90M (44.3%). More than half of the study population had 3 or more TAMs present at baseline and had resistance mutations associated with lamivudine and tenofovir use.

## Analyses of response by genotype

As expected, the overall response decreased as the number of mutations increased (see Table 9).

The CHMP noted that the above results were too conflicting and the sample sizes by age strata too limited to allow drawing any conclusion on the optimal dose in children.

## Emergence of protease gene mutations

Paired  genotype  results  (at  baseline  and  on-treatment)  were  available  for  28  patients  among  the 36 with  virologic  failure  or  rebound.  To  evaluate  the  mutations  emerging  with  TPV  treatment,  the 28 paired  genotypes  were  compared  and  each  codon  of  the  protease  gene  was  evaluated  for  any amino-acid shifts and corresponding shifts in TPV IC50 fold-change from baseline.

Numerous protease gene mutation gains and losses were observed. Mutations emerged at 26 codon positions (14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 45, 47, 55, 57, 58, 61, 66, 70, 71, 77, 82, 84, 85, 89, 92, 93, and 95). The largest net gain of mutations with TPV/r exposure was seen at codons 33, 36, 82 and 84,  each  with  a  net  gain  of  4  mutations.  At  codon  54,  the  I54V  mutation  was  selected  with  TPV/r

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment whereas the I54L mutation was de-selected. The previously reported emergence of the V82L mutation  in  patients  with  wild-type  (WT)  virus  and  the  shift  from  pre-existing  V82A  to  T  was confirmed  in  these  paediatric  patients.  The  predominant  emerging  mutations  with  TPV  treatment currently described in the SPC are L33F/I/V, V82T/L and I84V. Therefore, the emerging mutations observed in paediatric patients are consistent with those observed in adults.

## Phenotypic data

Phenotype  could  not  be  determined  for  6  of  the  isolates;  thus,  results  for  30  of  the  patients  were available. As illustrated in Table 11, the median TPV baseline phenotypic susceptibility was 1.2-fold WT  IC50  with  75%  of  isolates  having  susceptibility  below  2.6-fold  WT  IC50.  This  is  within  the susceptible range for TPV as established in adult patients (0-3 FC IC50 susceptible, &gt;3-10 decreased susceptibility, and &gt;10 resistant). All isolates were at least partially susceptible to TPV (max 6.6-fold WT IC50). Baseline phenotype analysis for other proteases showed reduced susceptibility according to the  clinical  cut-offs  reported  in  the  product  information  of  these  medicinal  products:  lopinavir &lt;10 susceptible, 10-40 partially susceptible, &gt;40 resistant; saquinavir 2.5, amprenavir 2.5, indinavir 3.0, nelfinavir 4.0, atazanavir 4.0, and darunavir 10.0.

%R=Percent reduced susceptibility

In  summary,  with  the  exception  of  darunavir  and  TPV,  the  majority  of  isolates  had  reduced susceptibility to PIs. This supports the value of TPV/r in patients harbouring viral strains with reduced susceptibility to other PIs.

Considering that LPV/r is currently considered as the PI of choice in paediatric patients, it is expected that children that could receive TPV/r would have been previously treated by LPV/r. An analysis of response  rates  focussing  on  the  subgroup  of  patients  presenting  a  genotypic  resistance  to  LPV/r showed that the virologic response in the group of patients with 0-2 LPV mutations had a VL decrease of more than 2 log10 copies/ml and more than 60% of patients achieving &lt;400 copies/ml. Patients with 3-5 LPV mutations still showed strong virologic responses with median VL decrease of 1.14 copies/ml and 42.9% of patients achieving &lt;400 and &lt;50 copies/ml in the TPV/r high dose group.

The difference between the TPV/r low dose group and the TPV/r high dose group was not statistically significant; however, the study was not powered for efficacy analysis. Even in the group of patients with 6-9 LPV mutations, about 25% of patients showed virologic response. Patients with up to 5 LPV mutations at baseline showed a good response, particularly in the TPV/r high dose group. These data show  that  patients  who  developed  resistance  to  LPV/r  treatment  would  benefit  from  the  TPV/r treatment.    The  CHMP  concluded  that  these  analyses,  although  based  on  very  limited  subgroup  of patients, give support to the selection of the higher dose besides the PK/PD reasoning.

On-treatment TPV phenotypic susceptibility was reduced for 20 of 30 patients. This is due in large part to the acquisition of protease gene mutations since TPV phenotype correlated with the number of TPV score mutations. Paired genotype/phenotype data were available for 30 baseline samples and for 22 on-treatment samples. At baseline, reduced susceptibility (TPV FC IC50 &gt;4) was noted only among

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

those isolates with 7 or more TPV score mutations. However, on-treatment, virus with 4 or more TPV score mutations showed reduced TPV susceptibility, with median TPV FC IC50 ranging from 10.2 to 37.7.

## Conclusion on efficacy

Overall,  as  for  the  adult  population,  this  medicinal  product  can  be  only  considered  as  a  last  line therapy in highly pre-treated paediatric patient. Based on the data provided Aptivus capsule is only a treatment option in children above 12 years of age with virus resistant to multiple protease inhibitors and with no other therapeutic options. The age restriction is necessary as the experience gained with the capsule formulation is only derived from the use in children above 12 years of age. The capsule formulation is not suitable for the recommended BSA based dosing regimen in children less than 12 years of age. A deep salvage therapy is mainly expected to be observed in adolescents as compared to younger  children  (apart  for  the  situation  of  transmission  of  multi-resistant  strain  from  the  mother). The  use  of  TPV/r  is  expected  to  be  marginal  in  children  below  12  years.  Indeed,  the  younger  the children  are,  the  less  likely  is  the  presence  of  HIV  harbouring  multiple  PI  resistance  mutations. However, it is recognised that TPV/r could still potentially address a medical need in situations of lastline therapy for children of younger ages (see assessment report of EMEA/H/C/631/X/30).

## 3.3 Clinical safety

## Safety results from Study 1182.14

## Interim analysis

As shown in Table 12, there were slightly more patients with adverse events (AEs) in the TPV/r high dose group (69.2%, 18/26) than in the TPV/r low dose group (61.5%, 16/26).

TPVr high dose = TPV 375 mg/m2 / RTV 150 mg m2

This difference was greater in the two youngest age groups (83.3% vs. 58.3% in the 2 to &lt;6 age group and 62.5% vs. 50.0% in the 6 to &lt;12 age group), while in the 12 to 18 age group there were more patients with adverse event in the TPV/r low dose group (83.3%, 5/6) than in the TPV/r high dose group (50.0%, 3/6).

There were also more patients with study treatment related AEs, i.e. Adverse Drug Report (ADRs) in TPV/r high dose group, 42.3% (11/26) compared to 30.8% (8/26) in TPV/r low dose group. In the 12 to 18 age group, there were more patients with ADRs in the TPV/r low dose group (66.7%, 4/6) than in the TPV/r high dose group (33.3%, 2/6).

Two patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), both in the TPV/r low dose group. However, in both cases events were considered not related to study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Laboratory evaluations showed 7 patients with DAIDS Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, 2 in the TPV/r low dose group (7.7%) and 5 (19.2%) in the TPV/r high dose group. Only one of these events reached DAIDS Grade 4 severity, one case of increased amylase (TPV/r high dose group). Overall, both doses showed a similar early safety profile although there appeared to be more study treatmentrelated adverse events and Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the TPV/r high dose group.

## Safety results up to 100 weeks

## Exposure

The overall median exposure was 724 days for a total of 179.2 patient exposure years (PEY). For the 12-18 year group, median exposure and total patient exposure years were higher in the TPV capsule group as compared to the TPV oral solution group. More patients received study medication for at least 100 weeks in the younger groups.

## Adverse events

A total of 93.9% patients reported at least one AE at 48 weeks and 96.5% patients at 100 weeks with a lower incidence in the 2- &lt;6 year old patients receiving TPV oral solution (84.0%) at 48 weeks. SAEs were  reported  by  25.2%  (29/115)  of  patients  at  48  weeks  and  30.4  %  (35/115)  of  patients  at  100 weeks, with the fewest events (16.0%) in the 2- &lt;6 year group on TPV oral solution at 48 weeks and (20.0%)  at  100  weeks  as  compared  to  25%-37.5%  in  the  other  age  groups  and  formulations.  The lowest incidence of SAEs was seen in the 12-18 year-old patients on TPV capsule at both time points.

Vomiting  was  the  most  frequent  AE  reported  overall  by  37.4%  (43/115)  and  40.0%  (46/115)  of patients at 48 and 100 weeks, respectively, followed by cough (27.8%, 32/115 at 48 weeks and 33.0%, 38/115 at 100 weeks), diarrhoea (25.2%, 29/115 at 48 weeks and 29.6%, 34/115 at 100 weeks) and pyrexia (23.5% 27/115 at 48 weeks and 29.6%, 34/115 at 100 weeks). The events were observed with similar frequency among the age groups receiving TPV oral solution as well as the older age group receiving TPV capsules. Oral candidiasis and herpes simplex were among the more common events in the oldest age group receiving TPV capsules, at both time-points, reflecting the more advanced stage of HIV in these children.

Several  events  were  present  at  100  weeks  that  were  not  seen  at  48  weeks  of  treatment,  e.g., rhinorrhoea,  rash  papular,  lymphadenopathy,  influenza,  back  pain,  epistaxis,  and  rash,  with  the incidence of rash papular (10.3%) and back pain (13.8%) both highest in the 12-18 year-old patients on TPV capsules.

## Medically selected terms

Three  medically  selected  terms  (MSTs)  for  AEs  (i.e.,  bleeding,  hepatitis  and  skin  rash)  of  special interest for children receiving TPV were evaluated and the results are presented in Table 13.

1 Percentages are calculated using total number of patients per treatment as the denominator.

2 Patient group of 12 to 18 year olds includes Patient No. 5406 who entered the trial at 11.5 years of age and switched from TPV OS to TPV SEDDS at 12 vears of age.

The most frequently reported events within the Skin Rash MST were eruption, rash, rash papular, rash macular, rash maculo [papular], and urticaria. Skin rash MST events were almost twice as frequently reported in 12-18 year-old patients receiving TPV capsules than in those receiving the oral solution.

The most frequently reported events within the Hepatitis MST were GGT increased, ALT increased, hyperbilirubinemia, AST increased and liver function test abnormal. Overall there was an increase of three patients with Hepatitis MST events from 48 (15.7%) to 100 weeks (18.3%).

The most frequently reported events within the Bleeding MST were epistaxis, haematoma, gingival bleeding, haematochezia, menorrhagia, and diarrhoea hemorrhagic. Overall bleeding events increased from 48 to 100 weeks (7.8% to 13%). The frequency of Bleeding MST events was higher in children receiving  TPV  capsules  than  in  those  receiving  the  oral  solution  at  48  weeks.  At  100  weeks  the frequency of bleeding events was more uniform between age groups and formulation with the fewest events in the 2- &lt;6 year group. There was one fatal case of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (17 year-old male receiving the oral solution).

## Adverse events leading to discontinuation

A total  of  13.9%  (16/115)  of  patients  permanently  discontinued  from  the  trial  due  to  AEs  through 100 weeks. Ten (8.7%) of  these  patients  had  already  discontinued  at  48  weeks.  The  most  frequent events leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal AEs, all in the 12-18 year group, as well as increased  liver  transaminase  levels  (all  increases  in  GGT  except  one  case  of  increased  ALT).  The highest  frequency  of  permanent  discontinuation  was  observed  in  the  6-  &lt;12  year  and  12-18  year groups receiving the oral solution (6 interruptions in each group).

## Deaths and serious adverse events

There were no deaths reported during the first 48 weeks of the study. There were 2 deaths as of the data  cut-off  for  the  100-week  analyses.  Both  of  these  patients  had  multiple  underlying  conditions contributing to these fatal events. One patient, a 17-year-old male treated with TPV oral solution, died of  gastrointestinal  bleeding.  The  other,  a  10-year-old  male,  treated  with  TPV  oral  solution,  died  of renal failure, secondary to B-cell lymphoma. Both of these events were considered by the investigator unrelated to study medication.

Serious AEs were reported by 25.2% (29/115) patients at Week 48 and by 28.7% (33/115) patients at Week 100, with the most events experienced by the 12-18 year group of patients treated with TPV oral solution at both time points. Serious AEs in the Infestations and infections System Organ Class (SOC) were the most frequent overall, reported by 18.3% (21/115) of patients at 48 and 100 weeks, with the lowest incidence among the 12-18 year-old patients treated with TPV capsules. Serious AEs in the Gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC  were  the  next  most  common  (4.3%,  5/115  at  48  weeks  and  7.0%, 8/115 at 100 weeks), predominantly in the youngest age groups (2 - &lt;12 years of age) treated with TPV oral solution.

The most common SAE was pneumonia 5.2% (6/115) at Week 48 and 6.1% (7/115) at Week 100, followed by herpes zoster at 48 weeks and herpes zoster, diarrhoea, and pyrexia at 100 weeks. There was no pneumonia reported by the 12 - 18 year-olds at 48 or 100 weeks on TPV capsules. During the 100 weeks of study, 8 patients (all on TPV oral solution) experienced 10 serious AEs considered to be related to study  medication (vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, urticaria, GGT increased, anaemia). Two of the 8 patients were 2- &lt;6 years old, three were 6- &lt;12 years old and three were 1218 years old. Five of the patients required hospitalisation and all recovered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical laboratory evaluation

The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities  were  increased  GGT  (10.7%, 12/112 at 48 weeks and 11.6%, 13/112 at 100 weeks) and increased creatinine phosphokinase (10.7%, 12/112 at 48 weeks and 15.2%, 17/112 at 100 weeks). The GGT increases were highest among the 1218 year-old patients on TPV oral solution.

Two patients had Grade 4 ALT elevations. More patients in the 12-18 year group on TPV capsules at 48 weeks and at 100 weeks experienced increased levels of ALT (14.3% at 48 weeks and 17.2% at 100 weeks). Based on Kaplan-Meier analyses, by 48 weeks of treatment, 15.1% of 12-18  year-old patients  on  TPV  capsules  experienced  Grade  &gt;2  ALT/AST  elevations  as  compared  to  5.6%  of  the 12-18 year old patients on TPV oral solution. No ALT/AST elevations above Grade 2 were observed in children 2 - &lt;6 years on TPV oral solution and only two patients (6.0%) 6 - &lt;12 years of age were observed with elevations.

By 100 weeks of treatment, 19.8% (5 patients) of the 12-18 years old on TPV capsules experienced Grade &gt;2 ALT elevations compared to 5.6 % (1 patient) of the 12 - 18 years old on TPV oral solution, with no elevations seen in children 2 - &lt;6 years on TPV oral solution and only two patients (6.0%) 6 &lt;12 years of age experiencing an elevation on TPV oral solution.

No  patients  experienced  an  increased  cholesterol  levels  or  increased  triglyceride  levels  through 100 weeks of exposure with the exception of one patient in the 6 - &lt;12 year group who experienced increased Grade 3 triglyceride levels at 100 weeks.

## Discussion on safety results from Study 1182.14

Data from Study 1182.14  (especially  long-term  results)  are  considered  too  limited  to  draw  reliable conclusions on the safety profiles of TPV oral solution and capsule formulation in paediatric patients. As previously discussed, the 'non-randomised' switch of formulations in the 12-18 year group further precludes the comparison of the two formulations. It can however be noted that patients receiving the oral solution in the 12-18 year group had a higher incidence of SAEs and permanent discontinuations than those receiving the capsules.

The frequency of some AEs and some laboratory findings were influenced by patient age, i.e. the 2-6 year  group  tended  to  experience  fewer  severe  events,  fewer  MST  events,  fewer  protocol-defined significant  AEs,  and  none  of  these  patients  had  Grade  3  or  4  elevations  in  ALT.  The  incidence  of vomiting  decreased  with  age  in  children  receiving  TPV  oral  solution,  with  the  highest  incidence observed in the 2-6 year group at both 48 and 100 weeks. In children aged 2-6 years, 52% of the children experienced vomiting and 24%, respectively, had diarrhoea and pyrexia. All these reactions have considerable impact on patients' daily activities. In the 12-18 year group, children taking TPV capsules experienced cough at a rate of 39.3%.

These examples indicate that the safety profile of TPV in children may overall be comparable to that in adults, but with marked variability depending on the age group. Therefore, the MAH, on the CHMP request, inserted a table in section 4.8 of the SPC of the TPV capsules describing the reported adverse events and laboratory abnormalities at 48 weeks of study 1182.14 in the group of paediatric patients aged 12-18 years (given the requested age restriction for the indication), together with the respective frequencies.

No new safety concerns emerged after 100 weeks of study medication, with the exception of bleeding events which increased from 48 to 100 weeks (7.8% vs. 13%). This reinforces the existing concerns about the safety profile of TPV and bleeding, in particular with respect to intracranial haemorrhages.

According to the result presented the safety profile of TPV/r in paediatrics seems to be comparable to that  observed  in  adults.  The  CHMP  re-emphasised  that  during  the  assessment  of  the  initial  MA  of TPV/r  in  adults,  the  severe  safety  profile  of  TPV  has  been  considered  as  a  main  issue,  notably regarding its poor hepatic tolerability, which for example resulted in the premature closure of clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

trials in ARV naïve adults. Therefore, when prescribing TPV/r to a paediatric patient, the same close safety monitoring (e.g. liver function) as in adults is recommended.

TPV/r oral solution was characterised by a high rate of vomiting. It was discussed that the high rate of vomiting may be related to the bad taste of the RTV oral solution. RTV oral solution presents a very bad taste which may induce nausea and vomiting. However, TPV oral solution has a very bad taste on its own, therefore it is difficult to judge which of the two oral solutions contribute more to the poor palatability.  The  poor  palatability  of  ARV  oral  solutions  is  indeed  a  main  issue  in  the  treatment  of HIV-infected children that does not only lead to a poor gastro-intestinal tolerance but also to a poor compliance with the related risks of treatment failure and emergence of resistance.

## Safety data from other clinical trials

There  were  25  paediatric  patients  from  the  Expanded  Access  Program/Emergency  Use  Program (EAP/EUP) (trials 1182.16, 1182.58, and 1182.67) and trials 1182.33 and 1182.48 for whom exposure data were available. Of these 25 patients, 18 (72%) had treatment exposure of ≥ 24 weeks, and of these 18, 12 (67%) had exposure of &gt;48 weeks. The range of exposure was 8 days to approximately 2 years. Thirteen (52%) of the 25 patients were 18 years old and 12 (48%) were 11 to 17 years old; 14 (56%) were males and 11 (44%) were females. There were 12 (48%) patients with a baseline CD4 cell count of &lt;50 cells/mm 3 , and 7 (28%) had a CD4 cell count of 50 to 200 cells/mm 3 . Thirteen (52%) had a VL of &lt;100,000 copies/ml.

SAEs were reported among 9 (36%) of the 25 patients; SAEs were infections in 5 of these patients. Three patients discontinued due to AEs (all from EAP/EUP):  1 from Trial 1182.16, due to abdominal pain,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting;  and  2  from  1182.58,  1  with  incapacity  to  swallow  TPV capsules,  and  the  other  with  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  which  led  to  a  fatal  outcome. Significant medical history for this patient included recurring cerebral toxoplasmosis. Two patients in the EAP/EUP had SAEs relating to hepatic toxicity: 1 patient had hepatic failure and the other patient had  cytolytic  hepatitis.  One  patient  in  Trial 1182.16  experienced  septic  shock  that  led  to  a  fatal outcome.  This patient had multiple underlying conditions contributing to this fatal event, including cryptococcosis and atypical mycobacterial infection.

The CHMP identified a number of insufficiencies in the initially submitted RMP. All concerns were satisfactorily addressed by the MAH. The following two points will require an update of the RMP that will be submitted together with the next PSUR number 7 in February 2010.

- -It is agreed that the safety profile of TPV in paediatric population may possibly be comparable to adults, but available safety data remain still very limited. Further data to substantiate the safety of TPV in this target population is needed. On the CHMP request the MAH agreed on a surveillance with one of existing cohorts, e.g. Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study (CHIPS), to obtain more safety  information  on  children  exposed  to  TPV  in  real  life  settings  and  commit  to  review  12 months  after  Marketing  Authorisation  the  feasibility  of  providing  meaningful  safety  data  and analyses from the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study (CHIPS), and provide data and analyses where possible.
- -On CHMP request the pharmacovigilance plan will include activities focusing on the safety in paediatric population. The target paediatric population who might receive TPV is actually limited, but still needs to be carefully monitored and followed to confirm the safety profile of TPV.

Activities focusing on the safety of the paediatric population will specifically include the following: If paediatric  case  reports  are  received,  the  team  of  safety  reviewers  will  determine  if  additional information  should  be  requested  from  the  reporter,  in  order  to  improve  the  interpretability  of  the report, and evaluate the impact on the safety of TPV. Cases will be followed up accordingly with the reporter. Globally, all postmarketing adverse-event reports received over the year 2008 - there were 46 reports from sources spontaneous reporting and Health Authority - have been described and discussed individually in the pertaining TPV PSUR which contains a separate section about the use in children and adolescents, with three such cases reported in one year.  The MAH will continue to monitor the use of TPV in children carefully and include all relevant information in the upcoming PSURs.

## 4. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

In support to the extension of indication of TPV/r in paediatric patients from 2 years of age, the MAH has submitted a randomised, open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of TPV/r  in  HIV-infected,  treatment  experienced  paediatric  patients  aged  2-18  years.  In  this  study performed in 115 children, two (low and high) dosing regimen were tested, 290 mg/m 2 TPV + 115 mg/m2 ritonavir b.i.d. and 375 mg/m2 TPV + 150 mg/m 2 ritonavir b.i.d.

The validity of the study results were hampered by several factors, possibly introducing bias:

- the study was conducted in 'open-label' manner
- no (external) comparator group was included
- the studied patients were more heterogeneous and overall less treatment-experienced as compared to the adult population, for which TPV/r has been approved.
- the study was not powered for a comparison of the efficacy of the different dosing/formulation groups
- the switch to TPV capsules in the 12-18 age group was not conducted in a randomised manner

The dose selection was not regarded as appropriately justified. The MAH concluded that TPV/r high dose, TPV 375 mg/m 2 + RTV 150mg/m 2 , is the appropriate dose for paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years as it provided a higher and more durable response with an acceptable safety profile. Therefore, although the interim analysis results at 24-week led to selection of the TPV/r low dose, all patients were switched to the TPV/r high dose following analysis of the 48-week results.

Theses  changes  highlight  the  difficulty  of  identifying  the  appropriate  dosing    based  on  a  rational argument as overall the results were not consistent across the different age groups: the low dose gave better response rate in the 2-6 and in the 12-18 age groups whereas the high dose gave better response rate in the 6-12 age group. However, when analysing the efficacy results for both dose groups by 48 weeks for all age groups, the percentage of patients with VL &lt;50 copies/ml, results were similar for the low dose and the high dose (34.5% and 35.1%, respectively). This inconclusiveness of findings, not giving a clear picture on the effective dose within a good safety margin, highlights the paucity of the available data.

Specifically for the 12-18 year-old patients, only a small virologic impact was observed, i.e. -0.26 in TPV/r low dose group to -0.62 log10 copies/ml in the TPV/r high dose group (-0.2 in the oral solution group and -0.4 in the capsule group). Nevertheless, comparison with other clinical trials of ritonavir boosted PIs show similar results. For all of them, efficacy results markedly decreased for adolescents when compared to children.

GIQ and adherence were shown to be significant predictors of Week 48 response rates while the age group was not a significant predictor. For this reason, the MAH believes that the higher dose of TPV/r is  appropriate, especially for children who fulfil the current indication for TPV/r, i.e. those infected with HIV and having failed on prior therapy.

In  principle,  the  CHMP  considered  the  use  of  the  dose  that  provides  the  higher  GIQ  in  this  target population  with  viral  strains  harbouring  multi-resistance  reasonable.  However,  clinical  data  to substantiate this dose in children remain limited.

Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that patients with up to 5 LPV mutations at baseline showed a good response,  particularly  in  the  TPV/r  high  dose  group.  These  data  show  that  patients  who  developed resistance to LPV/r treatment would benefit from the TPV/r treatment.  The CHMP concluded that these analyses, although based on a very limited subgroup of patients, give support to the selection of the higher dose.

In addition, regarding the use of the capsule formulation in children, it is important to note that:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -the  clinical  experience  gained  with  the  capsule  formulation  is  only  derived  from  the  use  in children above 12 years of age,
- -the  capsule  formulation  is  not  suitable  for  the  recommended  BSA  based  dosing  regimen  in children less than 12 years of age

Taking  into  account  on  the  one  hand  the  effect  on  viral  load  and  on  the  other  hand  the  above limitations, TPV/r may have a place, even if very limited, in the treatment of HIV infected children harbouring  a  multi  resistant  virus.  In  view  of  the  limitations  of  clinical  data  in  children  with  the recommended dose, TPV/r as capsules could only be considered for the treatment of children from 12 years of age when no other therapeutic options are available.

Data from Study 1182.14  (especially  long-term  results)  are  considered  too  limited  to  draw  reliable conclusions on the safety profiles of TPR oral solution and capsule formulation in paediatric patients. As previously discussed, the 'non-randomised' switch of formulations in the 12-18 year group further precludes the comparison of the two formulations. It can however be noted that patients receiving the oral solution in the 12-18 year group had a higher incidence of SAEs and permanent discontinuations than those receiving the capsules.

The frequency of some AEs and some laboratory findings were influenced by patient age, i.e. the 2 &lt;6 year group tended to experience fewer severe events, fewer MST events, fewer protocol-defined significant  AEs,  and  none  of  these  patients  had  Grade  3  or  4  elevations  in  ALT.  The  incidence  of vomiting  decreased  with  age  in  children  receiving  TPV  oral  solution,  with  the  highest  incidence observed in the 2- &lt;6 year group at both 48 and 100 weeks. In children aged 2-6 years, 52% of the children experienced vomiting and 24%, respectively, had diarrhoea and pyrexia. All these reactions have considerable impact on patients' daily activities. In the 12-18 year group, children taking TPV capsules experienced cough at a rate of 39.3%.

These examples indicate that the safety profile of TPV in children may overall be comparable to that in adults, but with marked variability depending on the age group. Therefore, the MAH, on the CHMP request, inserted a table in section 4.8 of the SPC of the TPV capsules describing the reported adverse events and laboratory abnormalities at 48 weeks of study 1182.14 in the group of paediatric patients aged 12-18 years (given the requested age restriction for the indication), together with the respective frequencies.

No new safety concerns emerged after 100 weeks of study medication, with the exception of bleeding events which increased from 48 to 100 weeks (7.8% vs. 13%). This reinforces the existing concerns about the safety profile of TPV and bleeding, in particular with respect to intracranial haemorrhages.

According to the results presented with the capsule the safety profile of TPV/r in paediatrics, as, seems to be comparable to that observed in adults. The CHMP re-emphasised that during the assessment of the initial MA of TPV/r in adults, the grave safety profile of TPV has been considered as a main issue, notably its poor hepatic tolerability, which for example resulted in the premature closure of clinical trials in ARV naïve adults. Therefore, when prescribing TPV/r to a paediatric patient, the same close safety monitoring (e.g. liver function) as in adults is recommended.

Taking into account the efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in the supportive data, the CHMP concluded  that  the  benefit  risk  balance  of  TPV/r  (500  mg/200  mg)  capsules  could  be  considered positive only in a very restricted indication of last line therapy in children and adolescents above the age of 12 with virus resistant to multiple protease inhibitors and for whom no other treatment options are available.

The final adopted indication reads as follows:

'APTIVUS,  co-administered  with  low  dose  ritonavir,  is  indicated  for  combination  antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1 infection in highly pre-treated adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with virus  resistant  to  multiple  protease  inhibitors.  APTIVUS  should  only  be  used  as  part  of  an  active combination antiretroviral regimen in patients with no other therapeutic options.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This indication is based on the results of two phase III studies, performed in highly pre-treated adult patients (median number of 12 prior antiretroviral agents) with virus resistant to protease inhibitors and of one phase II study investigating pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of APTIVUS in mostly treatment-experienced adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years (see section 5.1) '.
