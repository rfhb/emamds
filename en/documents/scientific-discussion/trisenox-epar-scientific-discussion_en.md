## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures,  which have been finalised before 30 November 2004. For scientific information on procedures after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Voisin Consulting S.A.R.L. The applicant has applied in February 2001 via the Central Procedure for marketing  authorisation  of  Trisenox  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  acute  promyelocytic  leukemia  in adult patients, characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the PML/RARα gene.

## Acute promyelocytic leukemia

Acute  promyelocytic  leukemia  (APL)  is  a  rare  disease,  accounting  for  10-15%  of  all  the  acute myelogenous leukemia in adults.

APL is characterised by the accumulation of clonal hemopoietic precursors blocked at specific stages of development. APL is a rare disease with an incidence of 1,000 to 1,500 newly diagnosed patients a year in the United States and 700 to 800 in the European Union.

APL is classified under the French-American-British (FAB) morphological scheme as subtype M3 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The bone marrow morphology is characterised by greater than 30% blasts and abnormal promyelocytes; multiple Auer bodies, sometimes in bundles, heavy granulation obscuring the basophilic cytoplasm, and strong positive cytochemistry.

The  disease  involves  a  typical  balanced  translocation  involving  chromosomes  15  and  17  (t15:17) although  exceedingly  rare  variants  of  this  leukemia  show  balanced  translocations  of  chromosomes 11/17 and 5/17. As a result of these translocations APL blasts invariably synthesize aberrant fusion forms of the retinoic receptor type alpha, PML-RAR α in the case of t15:17, PLZF-RAR α and NPMRAR α in  the  case  of  t11:17  and  t5:17,  respectively.  In  addition  the  breakpoint  of  the  t15:17 chromosomal translocation is heterogeneous, leading to at least three molecular types of PML-RAR α fusion  proteins.  The  PML/RAR α fusion  protein  is  considered  to  have  an  important  role  in  APL pathogenesis by causing a maturation block at the promyelocyte stage of myeloid differentiation.

These molecular defects allow the classification of APL patients in two categories: all-trans-retinoic acid  (ATRA)-sensitive  and  ATRA-resistant.    Patients  with  the  t15:17  and  t5:17  translocations  are ATRA-sensitive, and those with the t11:17 translocation are resistant.

Among other actions, this mutant protein disaggregates PML Oncogenic Domains (PODs), which are spherical nuclear bodies that are attached to nuclear matrix. This disorganisation of the PODs is also thought to play a crucial role in APL pathogenesis by causing inhibition of apoptosis mechanisms. The t(15;17)  translocation  may  be  evidenced  with  reverse  transcriptase-polymerase  chain  reaction  (RTPCR) using specific PML and RAR α oligonucleotides. Depending of the RT-PCR technique used, its sensitivity level may vary between 1/10 4 and 1/10 6 cells.

Hence  the  hallmark  of  APL  is  the  presence  of  abnormal  promyelocytes  either  circulating  in  the peripheral blood or present in bone marrow. Because of the presence of these differentiated leukaemic promyelocytes,  APL  is  biologically  distinct  from  other  types  of  AML  and  is  associated  with coagulation abnormalities including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), plasmin-dependent fibrinogenolysis, and  diffuse proteolysis. Coagulopathy  may  be  responsible  for  massive  fatal haemorrhages  potentially  exacerbated  by  chemotherapy,  adding  to  the  mortality  associated  with induction therapy especially in patients with high white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis.

Treatment options

The treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  APL  patients  consists  of  two  phases:  Induction  phase  to  obtain remission (defined by bone marrow clearance), then a consolidation phase. This initial treatment is currently followed by a maintenance treatment.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is considered as the APL standard treatment. The current therapeutic approach  is  ATRA  in  combination  with  several  cycles  of  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy.  This combination has significantly improved results compared to conventional chemotherapy alone.

With first line treatment combining ATRA and anthracycline based chemotherapy (CT), about 90% of the patients achieve complete response (CR). Molecular complete remission rate is 15 to 20 %, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

depends  on  the  time-schedule  of  the  RT-PCR  analysis  and  its  sensitivity  level,  and  about  30  % subsequently relapse. ATRA can also be used at several phases of APL treatment: as the maintenance of  treatment,  ATRA  possibly  combined  to  chemotherapy  can  further  reduce  the  risk  of  relapse  to about 15 %.

Most of APL patients who have a first relapse after treatment with CT alone can achieve a second CR with  ATRA.  Patients  who  have  relapsed  after  first  line  treatment  including  ATRA  can  achieve  a second CR with ATRA; the response rate depends on the interval between the last administration of ATRA and the time of relapse. Results appear to be better when the interval is longer, but are difficult to evaluate precisely as CT is often rapidly added to ATRA in such circumstances. Salvage therapy with  ATRA  alone  (as  reported  from  MSK  historical  series)  offers  results  inferior  to  those  of  CT. When CT is added to ATRA, toxicity is increased with up to 10 % toxic death in large published series.

With various chemotherapy regimens, patients can achieve CR (55 to 86%) according to the number of previous relapse(s), but toxicity is very high, and intensive chemotherapy cannot be administered in all cases.

So, in patients with APL relapse, there is a clear need for treatment that would allow to achieve CR with tolerable toxicity, or without the toxicity of concomitant CT.

## Arsenic trioxide

Although As2O3 is a well-known poison, it has been in medical use for a long time. In 1865, arsenic compounds, in  the  form  of  potassium  arsenic,  were  already  described  for  the  treatment  of  chronic myelogenous  leukaemia.  Because  of  its  chronic  toxicity,  this  treatment  was  replaced  by  the chemotherapeutic  agent  busulfan  in  the  middle  of  the  20 th century.  After  a  large  scale  clinical screening, therapeutic effects were identified in some human cancers such as leukaemia, oesophageal carcinoma,  and  lymphoma.  The  mechanisms  of  action  underlying  the  apoptogenic  and  cytodifferentiating action of Trisenox are still largely unknown.

Trisenox contains arsenic trioxyde as active substance. The rationale for the development of arsenic trioxide  (ATO)  is  based  on  both  pharmacology  data  and  previous  human  experience  (with  another ATO compound) conducted in China. ATO seems to have concentration-dependent dual effects on leukaemic cells: induction of apoptosis at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 2.0 µ M/L) and partial differentiation  at  lower  concentrations  (0.1  to  0.5  µM/l).  The reported results in  this series  of  APL patients  that  have  relapsed  after  ATRA-anthracycline/cytarabine  combination  treatment  suggested  a high rate of CR, comparable to those obtained with chemotherapy.

The clinical development program was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ATO for the reinduction of remission and for consolidation in APL patients who were refractory to, or had relapsed from, retinoid and anthracycline chemotherapy, or for whom anthracycline-based chemotherapy was contraindicated.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

TRISENOX 1 mg/ml, concentrate for solution for infusion, is presented as a sterile, clear, colourless aqueous solution contained in a 10 ml clear sealed type borosilicate glass ampoule. The product is terminally sterilised.

The  manufacturing  process  of  the  product  involves  compounding  filtration,  filling  and  terminal sterilisation.

## Composition

The finished product is presented as sterile pyrogen-free solution for injection. Apart from the active ingredient  ATO,  the  other  excipients  are  water  for  injections,  adjusted  with  sodium  hydroxide  and hydrochloric acid to a pH of 8. The solution is contained in a Type I borosilicate glass ampoule.

## Active substance

Arsenic trioxide As2O3 is a non-stoichiometric solid, prepared by roasting arsenic-containing ores and is  purified  by  a  re-sublimation  process.  The  'cubic  crystal  form'  is  used.  It  is  sparingly  soluble  in water although the solubility increases at pH 12.0. On dissolution in water it undergoes hydrolysis to arsenious acid (pKa1=9.2), one representation of which may be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, depending on pH, temperature, ionic strength etc., a number of arsenic-containing species could also be present in equilibrium in solution, possibly as the sodium salts under the slightly alkaline conditions  of  the  finished  product.  Therefore,  the  precise  definition  of  the  active  substance  or substances,  which  are  present  in  solution  in  the  product,  would  be  difficult  both  qualitatively  and especially quantitatively. 'Arsenic trioxide' may be regarded as the 'active substance' by conventional agreement in this particular case, although it is accepted that there may be other arsenic-containing species which are eventually present in solution in the finished product and which may be ultimately responsible for the pharmacological activity in the proposed therapeutic indication.

## Specification

The active substance specification for arsenic trioxide As2O3 is relevant for a substance to be used in parenteral  products  and  comprises  tests  for  physical  appearance,  identity,  As  (III)  assay  clarity  of solution, residue on ignition, content of As (V), related substances (antimony, lead, etc.) particle size, loss on drying, microbial bioburden and endotoxin.

Batch analyses confirm satisfactory uniformity and compliance with the agreed, justified specification.

## Stability

Three batches of active substance have been studied under normal long-term test conditions (25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH, 100 ml glass bottles with polypropylene closures) and accelerated conditions (40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH). Characteristics studied were physical appearance, assay, As (V) content, loss on drying and, particle size  distribution.  (Bioburden  and  endotoxins  were  checked  annually).  A  photostability  study  was conducted on one sample with the conclusion that the active component is not light sensitive. The claim for retesting  after  one  year  when  stored  in  tightly  closed  glass  bottles  between  15  and  30°C  is  sufficiently justified.

## Other ingredients

The other ingredients of the formulation, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, water for injections all complies  with  PhEur  monographs.  There  are  no  ingredients  of  animal  origin  which  give  rise  to concerns related to TSE.

## Product development and finished product

The  choice  of  dosage  form  and  formulation  of  the  product  was  influenced  by  the  unknown  oral bioavailability of As2O3, the data reported in the clinical literature, and the limited solubility of As2O3 in water.

The manufacturing process itself is a simple dissolution/mixing and sterilisation procedure. The filled ampoules are terminally sterilised in a steam autoclave, subjected to a dye immersion test, visually inspected, labelled, packaged and placed in quarantine.

The in-process controls, including all the test limits, are all satisfactory.

Six lots, three of 50 litres and three of 300 litres, have been used for validation. Biological indicators are  included  in  each  sterilisation  cycle.  The  cycle,  including  autoclave  loading  patterns,  has  been validated. The validation of the manufacturing process appears to have been thorough and the details provided indicate that the process is under control.

## Product Specification

The finished product specification at release comprises tests for physical appearance (clear, colourless solution),  As  (III)  identification  and  assay,  As(V)  assay,  particulate  matter,  volume  in  container, sterility and  endotoxins.

The development of analytical methods applied to the finished product is fully described; reference is made, when possible, to PhEur methods. Full details have been provided for eight batches of finished product. They all complied with the specifications.

## Stability of the Product

Five lots of finished product have been placed on stability. Stability trials were done in the commercial primary  packaging  in  accordance  with  ICH  testing  conditions  for  narmal  long  test  and  accelerated conditions.

Parameters tested were product appearance, As (III) and As (V) assay, pH, container appearance and particulate  matter  (visual);  particulate  matter  (NIAC),  sterility  and  endotoxins  are  tested  yearly. Specifications and methods are identical to those used for release.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results on assay of As (V) show that the amount of this impurity remains constant at levels which do not raise a toxicological concern in the context of use of the product.

A photostability study was conducted in the commercial ampoule and in an ampoule with a secondary carton  package.  The  finished  product  is  not  light  sensitive.  A  freeze-thaw  study  indicated  that  the finished product is not adversely affected by multiple cycles of freezing and thawing.

In general, no significant changes were observed in product quality during storage, and the shelf life as defined in the SPC is justified by the accumulated stability results. No specific labelling requirements are needed with regard to temperature.

## In-use stability of the finished product

The stability and compatibility of the finished product relevant to the context of clinical use has been studied  in  5%  dextrose,  0.9%  sodium  chloride  and  Ringer's  lactate  solutions  for  infusion  in  their commercial containers. The parameters tested over 72 hours at room temperature ( ∼ 25°C) and in a refrigerator ( ∼ 4°C) were appearance, assay of As(III), As(V), UV spectroscopy and particulate matter. Adequate methods (anion-exchange HPLC and atomic absorption spectroscopy) were developed and validated to quantify As(III) and total arsenic. On the basis of the results, an in-use shelf-life of 24 hours (aseptic preparation and administration) and 48 hours under refrigeration are proposed and this is reflected in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

It  sometimes  happens  that  the  molecular  species  responsible  for  the  pharmacological  activity  of  a product is not the same as the active substance stated to be present in the product (this may follow from  biotransformation in  vivo for  example).  However,  it  is  desirable  to  define  the  strength  of  the product as far as possible in terms of those substances that are actually present in the product, and which  lead  to  its  pharmacological  activity.  In  this  case,  the  precise  qualitative  and  quantitative definition of those arsenic species actually present in solution in the finished product has been a matter of  debate.  The  chemistry  of  arsenic  compounds  is  not  simple.  However,  it  has  been  accepted  by conventional agreement in this case that 'arsenic trioxide' may be regarded as the 'active substance' in the product, although as above, it is accepted that there may well be other species present in solution which may be responsible for the activity in the clinical indication.

The purity of ATO and the control of the manufacturing process and finished product indicate reliable reproducibility of the product and indicate in turn a reliable performance in the clinic.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The majority of preclinical data on toxicity and pharmacokinetics comes from published scientific and medical information, from formal reviews by official agencies (WHO and US EPA) as part of their evaluation of the risk  to man of arsenical contamination of water and air. Whether these published works comply with GLP cannot be ascertained. However, the consistency of the results, the fact that they were obtained from peer-reviewed scientific publications, and that reviews by eminent experts have  reached  similar  conclusions  indicates  that  the  available  knowledge  about  the  mechanisms  of action of arsenical compounds, the doses or concentrations required and the toxic effects produced can be accepted with confidence.

## Pharmacodynamics

Based on in vitro studies in cellular models of APL (the immortalized cell lines NB4 and UF-1), ATO has strong apoptogenic and anti-proliferative effects on APL cells. It does not trigger apoptosis in the PML-RAR α -negative cell lines, possibly implying that the oncogene PML-RAR α (the product of the t15:17 chromosomal translocation) may be a primary target for the activity of ATO and its degradation a first important step in the process of apoptosis.

In APL cells, the expression of PML-RAR α results in delocalisation of the normal PML protein from nuclear  bodies  (NB)  to  other  areas  of  the  nucleus.  Treatment  of  APL  blasts  with  ATRA  results  in progressive  degradation  of  PML-RAR α and  relocalisation  of  the  PML  protein  into  NBs.  A  similar effect is observed after treatment of APL cells with ATO. The apoptogenic and cyto-differentiating effects of ATO in the ATRA-resistant MR2 cell line indicate that the compound acts on APL cells regardless  of  their  sensitivity  to  retinoids.  ATO-induced  apoptosis  is  not  due  to  chelation  of  thiol

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups in proteins. Indeed, while ATO causes apoptosis in ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells, phenylarsine oxide reduces the intracellular concentration of NADH, but does not induce programmed cell death.

A cellular environment with low levels of gluthathione peroxidase (GPX) seems to be favourable for the  apoptogenic  activity  of  ATO.  The  GPX  inhibitor  mercaptosuccinic  acid  sensitizes  cells  to  the apoptogenic  action  of  ATO,  while  raising  GPX  by  pre-treatment  with  selenite  makes  NB4  cells relatively resistant to the arsenical. Regardless of the upstream molecular determinants, ATO causes programmed cell death through a mitochondrial pathway, which involves cytochrome-c release from the mitochondria into the cytosol, activation of terminal caspases  (such as caspase-3 and caspase-7), nuclear fragmentation, and DNA degradation.

ATO activity is not limited to APL and extends to other types of leukemia and solid tumors. In vitro , it inhibits,  the  growth  of  a  panel  of  megakaryocytic leukemia  cells  and induces apoptosis. The  PMLRAR-alpha negative HL-60 myeloblastic cell line shows much lower sensitivity to ATO. ATO and melarsoprol  (an  organic  arsenical)  cause  apoptosis  in  a  panel  of  human  myeloma  cells.    Exposure times between 24 and 48 hours are necessary to inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis of target cells. The cytotoxic activity of ATO has been tested on the NIH panel of neoplastic cell lines (60 cell lines representing different types of leukemia and solid cancer). LOX IMVI (melanoma), HOP-92 and NCIH226 (lung carcinoma) and CAKI-1 (renal carcinoma) were the most sensitive lines.

Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have described the effects of ATO on neuroblastoma tumors:

- ATO (1.5 µM to 5µM) was able to induce cell death of different cultured human NB cell lines (IMR-32, LAN-1, LAN-2, SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y, and SMS-MSN).
- ATO was also able to repress in vivo growth of xenotransplanted human NB cells: nude mice were injected with SK-N-BE cells and received ATO (200 to 400 µg). These mice showed a dose dependent inhibition of tumor growth.

Interferon  alpha  (IFN)  interacts  synergistically  with  ATO  and  causes  cytotoxicity  in  adult  T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells.

There is very little need to support the anti-leukemic activity of ATO in pre-clinical in vivo animal models of APL since convincing data in humans is already available. However, animal models are valuable insofar as they may give information about the in vivo mechanisms of action underlying the anti-leukemic activity of the arsenical. A single in vivo study using grafts of leukemic cells from PMLRAR α transgenic animals found an approximately two-fold increase in the survival of animals after i.p.  injection  of  the  arsenical. This  effect  is  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  after  treatment  with ATRA. Interestingly,  co-administration  of  ATO  and  ATRA  results in  a strong  synergistic  effect  in terms of survival, suggesting a complementary pharmacological action.

ATO  (1-2  µM)  is  effective  in  vitro  against  various  human  myeloid  leukaemia  cells  known  to  be resistant  to  a  number  of  apoptotic  stimuli,  inducing  pre-apoptotic  mitochondrial  events,  cytosolic cytochrome c accumulation, caspase activities, and hyperacetylation of histones. ATO mediates also anti-myeloma activity both directly on tumor cells and indirectly to overcome myeloma growth and survival factors in the bone marrow microenvironment.

Another study demonstrated that ATO can induce apoptosis of clinically acquired RA-resistant APL cells in vitro and in vivo.

## Pharmacokinetics

Most  of  the  preclinical  data  about  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ATO  in  animals  come  from  published information on inorganic forms of arsenic. The justification for this unusual application is that it was considered unethical and unnecessary to undertake extensive animal studies just to obtain information on what was already known for humans.

Inorganic  arsenic  compounds  show  good  oral  absorption  (90%  of  a  single  oral  dose),  which  aids extrapolation from the results of oral to parenteral studies. Arsenic distributes rapidly to red cells and to tissues, is retained in skin and hair longer than other tissues, but does not markedly accumulate in any organs or tissues of any species. The pattern of tissue distribution in the mouse is similar to that in humans, who show the highest levels in the kidney and spleen.

The  distribution  of  arsenic  in  the  rat  is  quite  different  from  other  animal  species.  In  rat,  a  large majority of the arsenic becomes bound to haemoglobin in red blood cells, and very little reaches other tissues.  For  this  reason,  the  rat  is  probably  not  an  appropriate  toxicokinetic  model  for  distribution, metabolism, or excretion of arsenic by humans.

In mice the highest concentrations of arsenic a few hours after I.V. arsenite were in the liver, kidneys, bile, lung, spleen, epididymis, and  gastrointestinal tract. At  72  hours post-dose, the highest

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations  were  in  the  skin,  hair,  epididymis,  liver,  and  stomach.  At  30  days,  the  maximum concentrations were in skin, hair, and the lens of the eye.

In pregnant mice, rats, hamsters, and primates, inorganic arsenicals cross the placental barrier when given  orally  or  by  injection,  and  arsenic  is  generally  distributed  in  the  late-term  fetus  in  a  manner similar to the adult animal.

The metabolism of arsenic has been extensively studied in humans and animals. There is metabolism to mono- and dimethyl derivatives, and some generation of dimethyl arsine by bacterial action in the colon.  The  effect  of  hepatic  damage  has  not  been  investigated.  Trivalent  inorganic  arsenic  is metabolised  by  methylation  to  methylarsonic  acid  (MAA)  and  rapidly  to  dimethlyarsinic  acid (DMAA).  The  metabolic  detoxification  requires  hepatic  methylases  that  are not involved  in conventional pathways of drug metabolism and clearance.

Since  the  methyl  derivatives  of  arsenic  appear  to  be  less  toxic  than  inorganic  arsenic,  and  since methylation tends to result in lower tissue retention of inorganic arsenic, the methylation process is usually  viewed  as  a  detoxification  mechanism.  Because  methylation  is  an  enzymatic  process,  an important issue is the dose of arsenic that saturates the methylation capacity of an organism. Limited data from studies in humans suggest that methylation may begin to become limiting at doses of about 0.2-1  mg/day.  However,  with  these  few  observations,  the  dose  rate  at  which  methylation  capacity becomes saturated cannot be precisely defined.

Elimination of arsenic following parenteral exposure of animals is similar to that seen following oral exposure. The major pathway of elimination in all species was renal, fecal excretion accounting for &lt;10%. Excretion  in  urine  was  initially  quite  rapid  in  most  species  (t 1/2 2  -  6  hours,  followed  by  a slower t1/2 of 15 days). In rabbits and mice, urinary excretion within eight hours usually accounts for about 50-80 % of the dose. Somewhat lower levels are excreted in the urine of marmoset monkeys probably  because  of  the  absence  of  methylation  in  these  species.  Whole-body  clearance  studies  in mice indicate that  the  clearance  of  arsenate  is  lower  (65  %  removed  within  24  hours)  than  that  of arsenite is about (86% removed at 24 hours). Inorganic arsenic is initially excreted in urine in trivalent and  pentavalent  forms,  and  the  organic  methylated  metabolite  DMAA  is  the  most  prevalent  form during the slower phase.

## Toxicology

## Single-dose toxicity

A single-dose toxicity study of ATO has not been carried out. However, a review of the Registry of Toxic Effects Chemical Substances (RTECS) shows that ATO has been extensively evaluated in acute toxicity  studies.  There  is  a  remarkable  consistency  among  various  species,  regardless  of  the administration route, in both lowest lethal dose and LD50 values for ATO. The LD50 (mg/kg) in mice were 10.7 i.v., 9.8-12.3 s.c., 11.0-11.8 i.p. and 39.4 p.o.

## Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated toxicity studies were performed in four animal species commonly used in chronic toxicity studies. The low oral doses ranged between 0.1 and 5 mg/kg/day, and the i.p. doses were between 1.3 and 2 mg/kg/day. All results indicate that the low doses cause no important toxicity. The principal toxic  actions  of  chronically  administered  arsenics  are  lesions  of  the  skin,  damage  to  the  liver  and kidneys,  peripheral  neuropathy,  and  some  depression  of  hematopoiesis.  In  rodents,  the  NOEL  was about 1-1.7 mg/kg/day for up to two years, and in man it is probably about 0.5-1 mg/kg/day.

The systemic toxic  effects  of  arsenic  exposure  in  animals  were  similar  to  those  in  humans.  NOEL values, determined from subchronic exposure in mice (0.8 mg/kg/day), chronic exposure in rats (1.7 mg/kg/day),  and  dogs  (0.3  mg/kg/day;  1.25  mg/kg/day),  and  the  minimal  toxicities  in  adolescent monkeys  receiving  3.75  mg/kg/day,  provide  a  safety  factor  of  approximately  2  or  more  for  i.v. administration of 0.15 mg/kg/day ATO in humans.

## Reproductive toxicology

Reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted by the Applicant and are normally not required for anticancer agents such as ATO. However, inorganic arsenicals are teratogenic and cause maternal and fetal toxicity in the mouse and rat but not in the rabbit. They do not affect female fertility; male fertility  has  not  been  formally  tested.  The  NOEL  for  developmental  effects  is  1-5  mg/kg/day  in rodents. Postnatal development of the mouse was affected by prenatal exposure to 2 mg/kg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Genotoxicity

Arsenite and ATO can be mutagenic in mammalian cells in culture. The mechanism of genotoxicity is not  clear,  as  the  conventional  Ames'  test  has  usually  given  a  negative  result.  The  effects  indicate chromosomal damage and deletions but not simple point mutations.

In vivo ,  a  significant  dose-related  increase  in  micronuclei  was  observed in the mouse bone  marrow micronucleus test up to 5 mg/kg i.p., but no effect in a male dominant lethal test, indicating that there is no heritable risk. The compound seems to cause DNA damage by several mechanisms and affects DNA repair mechanisms in mammalian cells.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  conducted  by  the  Applicant  and  are  normally  not  required  for anticancer agents such as ATO. ATO is a proven human carcinogen under certain circumstances of chronic exposure. There may be a threshold dose below which it does not have that action.

## Local tolerance

The local tolerance to intravenous injections of ATO was studied in a repeated dose sub-acute study in dogs.  There  were  no  clinical  observations  of  inflammation  at  the  injection  site.  No  necrosis  or inflammatory  cells  were  observed  in  the  skin  surrounding  the  injection  site  on  histopathological analysis of the area around the injection site.

## Environmental risk assessment/Ecotoxicity

Considering  of  the  administered  doses  of  Trisenox  and  the  rarity  of  the  disease  to  be  treated,  its medical use should not add appreciably to the environmental burden of arsenic. There is no reason to expect  any  risk  to  the  community,  to  people  in  close  proximity  to  patients  or  to  other  biota  in  the environment.

## Discussion on pre-clinical and toxicological aspects

The  applicant  has  presented in  vitro and in  vivo data  demonstrating  that  ATO  has  anti-leukaemic activity in appropriate experimental models of APL. The one in vivo study indicates that ATO has a selective effect on leukaemic cells and does not seem to cause overt toxicity in animals. This results in a significant increase in the lifespan of ATO-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated animals. It would be important to strengthen these data in other in vivo models of APL.

The mechanisms of action underlying the apoptogenic and cyto-differentiating action of ATO are still largely unknown. It seems that the pharmacological activity is not related to its ability to interfere with intracellular sulfhydryl groups, and this indicates dissociation between the molecular mechanisms of the anti-leukaemic and toxic action of arsenicals. Furthermore, the anti-leukaemic activity of ATO is different from that of organic arsenicals, such as melarsoprol. As to the molecular determinants of the drug's  apoptogenic activity,  some  results indicate  a  possible  mediation by  oxygen  peroxides,  which may damage mitochondria and lead to the activation of a classical apoptotic program. Whether the anti-leukaemic  action  of  ATO  is  specific  for  APL  and  involves  targeting  upon  PML-RAR-alpha remains to be clarified.

No formal safety pharmacology investigation has been carried out. Toxic effects of arsenic inhalation or  administration  are  also  well  known.  Levels  of  significant  exposure  for  each  route  of  arsenic exposure are available in a broad range of already published reviews and articles. An analysis of the toxic effects of arsenic is complicated by the fact that arsenic can exist in several different valence states  and  many  different  inorganic  and  organic  compounds.  However,  even  if  data  on  arsenic inhalation or oral exposure are required to fully understand the toxic potential of arsenic, those effects are not totally the same after i.v. administration.

The absence of experimental safety study does not permit to evaluate all the general effects that may be potentially  induced  by  the i.v.  administration  of ATO.  However,  a  various number  of  published clinical data are focused on this subject, in particular on cardiovascular, respiratory or renal disorders.

In conclusion, Arsenic is a well-known and described product. Simultaneous exposure to arsenic and other genotoxic compounds may increase the DNA damage and the carcinogenic risk. This calls for caution in clinical application of sodium arsenite.

## 4. Clinical aspects

The application included clinical data from two main clinical trials (PLRXAS01 and 97-66) and trial extensions (PLRXAS02 and 98-13). A total of 52 patients with APL entered the treatment phase of the studies  (Table  1).  Data  from  two  supportive  studies  with  a  total  of  58  patients  with  advanced haematological  (n=24  with  3  patients  already  recruited  in  the  main  studies)  or  non-haematological malignancies (n=34) were also provided. The safety population consists of 107 patients from the main studies and 141 patients enrolled in compassionate use studies.

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

Data from a pharmacodynamic study on APL patients treated with ATO were provided. The study was conducted since arsenic is known to increase the QT electrocardiographic (ECG) interval, which may lead  to  a  very  serious,  sometimes  even  fatal,  type  of  arrhythmia.  The  study  focussed  on  the  ECG alterations induced by the arsenical in patients treated with a typical cycle. Data were available for a total of 99 patients included in the clinical trials. The results in terms of anti-tumour activity of ATO are provided in the Clinical Efficacy section of this report.

A total of about 1000 ECG were taken at the beginning of the treatment (baseline ECG), during the induction phase and during the consolidation phase.  The following primary parameters were taken into consideration:  QTc interval at  baseline,  maximum  QTc interval during the infusion, maximum QTc  interval  during  the  steady-state  phase  of  infusion,  difference  from  baseline  in  QTc  interval, maximum change in QTc interval from baseline observed during the steady-state phase of infusion and difference from baseline in the heart rate. QTc intervals were stratified as normal, borderline or prolonged.

The results were analyzed as a whole or stratified according to sex and fertility status, as well as for age distribution.

After the first course of ATO, there was a statistically significant QTc prolongation in both males and females. The steady-state QTc prolongation is longer in men than women and steady-state values are attained sooner - as indicated by the half-life - in women than men. QTc interval prolongation was comparable  for  both  sexes  during  the  second  course  of  arsenic  therapy.  These  discrepancies  are currently unexplained. No significant differences were observed in any of the parameters taken into consideration for the various age-groups. Surprisingly, the QT prolongation appeared to decline with increasing dosage, although this effect was not statistically significant. In evaluating these data, it must also  be  noted  that  the  administered  dose  is  just  a  rough  proxy  for  ATO  plasma  levels,  a  more important parameter that was not determined in this study.

After treatment with ATO, heart rate increases from baseline level. The increase was not dependent on gender or dosage. A second course of ATO only influenced the heart rate increase in females in whom a  second  course  of  ATO  was  associated  with  a  lower  elevation  of  heart  rate  than  during  the  first course.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics of arsenic was investigated in relapsed or refractory APL patients (study 97-66) as well  as  in  two  studies  conducted  in  patients  with  advanced  haematological  or  non-haematological malignancies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Total  elemental  arsenic  concentrations  including  inorganic  arsenic,  its  methylated  metabolites,  and other  forms  of  organic  arsenic  were  determined  in  both  plasma  and  red  blood  cells  (RBCs)  blood fractions, with a lower limit of quantification at 5 ng/ml (0.07 µ M). In addition urine samples were collected at Day 1, at Day 2 and Day 3, and at the first day of subsequent weeks during induction. The lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/ml.

The  12  patients  with  APL  enrolled  in  the  97-66  study  were  included  in  this  pharmacological evaluation  (Table  2).  One  paediatric  patient  received  5  mg/dose  (0.17  mg/kg/dose),  6  patients including one paediatric patient received 10 mg/dose (0.06 to 0.18 mg/kg/dose), 1 patient received 15 mg/dose  (0.16 mg/kg/dose),  and  2  patients  received  0.15  mg/kg/dose  (14.3  and  15  mg/dose, respectively). ATO was administered over 2-hour, 3-hour, or 4-hour time periods.

|     |        | Mean ± SD | 3.2 ± 1.9  | 27.4 ± 9      | 100 ± 72   | 450 ± 119  |

In the nine APL patients treated with 0.12 to 0.18 mg/kg/dose, the maximal concentration (Cmax) after a 4-hour i.v. infusion was comprised between 18 and 40 ng/ml (0.24-0.53 µ M) in the plasma fraction and  between  16  and  35  ng/ml  (0.21-0.47 µ M)  in  the  RBCs  fraction.  The  time  at  maximal concentration (tmax) was 1 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life (t1/2) was comprise between 19 and 197 hours in the plasma fraction and between 6 and 98 hours in the RBCs fraction.

There was a progressive increase in plasma arsenic concentration with daily dosing. Concentrations after one week of treatment were approximately 2-5 times the Cmax on the first day of dosing. They reached a steady state comprised between approximately 50 and 125 ng/ml (0.67-1.7 µ M/l) during the second week of treatment and thus might be considered as a good parameter for safety monitoring and overdose diagnosis.

One patient treated at 15 mg/dose (0.16 mg/kg/dose) presented a continuously progressive increase until approximately 200 ng/ml (2.7 µ M)  after one month of dosing. This patient required haemodialysis for the management of renal insufficiency from Day 14 of ATO administration.

Inorganic arsenic (trivalent forms) is metabolised by methylation to methylarsonic acid (MAA) and to dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA, also known as cacodylic acid). The main site of methylation in vivo is the liver, but it also occurs in the kidney and blood. Pentavalent arsenic does not undergo methylation; it  is  therefore  eliminated  by  excretion  in  urine  as  unchanged  compound  or  by  transformation  to trivalent arsenic.

Complete  urine  samples  were  collected  over  a  24-hour  period  from  seven  patients  with  cancer following daily doses of ATO: The amount of total arsenic detected in urine during a 24-hour period following the first dose approximated 10% of the administered dose.

The  amount  of  arsenic  recovered  in  urine  increased  with  repeated  daily  dosing.  With  a  urinary excretion  half-life  for  arsenic  of  3  to  5  days,  it  is  estimated  that  18-30  days  would  be  required  to recover  100%  of  a  single  dose.  When  urine  samples  were  collected  on  days  beyond  when  plasma concentrations  appeared to  have  achieved  steady-state  (8  to  10  days),  the  average  peak  quantity  of arsenic  excreted  in  24  hours  was  60%  of  the  administered  daily  dose.  Based  on  PK  and  clinical observations,  a  2-week  or  3-week  free  interval  has  to  be  managed  between  two  consecutive  ATO cycles.

In the hematological cancer patients (Study 98-23) after 1 to 4 h i.v. infusion of doses from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg, the t max of total arsenic in plasma and RBC ranged from 1 to 4 h and the C max from 11 to 53

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ng/mL, with a slightly wider range in RBC (10 to 74 ng/mL). The average C max and AUC 0-8h values for plasma and RBC showed a dose-response relationship.

In patients with solid tumours (Study 98-46) treated with one daily 2-h i.v. Trisenox infusion at doses of 0.5 to 0.35 mg/kg, total arsenic measured on the first day of dosing peaked at or near the end of the infusion and then slowly declined. Average plasma and RBC C max  and AUC 0-8h  for Regimen A (blood collections before, during and after the first infusion on day 1, and at the beginning and end of the day 2  infusion  in  the  first  cycle)  essentially  increased  with  the  dose,  suggesting  a  dose-concentration relationship,  while  for  Regimen  B  (blood  collections  over  96  h  during  and  after  a  single  infusion) mean plasma and RBC arsenic concentrations increased over the course of the treatment, achieving a steady state on day 10.

Data on the tissue distribution of arsenic come from suicide victims; the highest concentrations were found in the liver and kidneys, with uniformly lower concentrations in muscle, heart, spleen, pancreas, and lungs. Arsenic is known to accumulate in skin, hair, nails, and brain and binds to blood and tissue proteins.

Inorganic arsenic species cross the placenta when given to pregnant rodents and non-human primates. ATO is excreted in human milk.

Interactions between ATO  and oxidatively biotransformed drugs are unlikely because the methyltransferases involved in arsenic metabolism are not members of the cytochrome P-450 family. ATO did not cause concentration-dependent inhibition of any of the enzymes examined (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP 3A4/5 and CYP4A9/11)  and  would  therefore  not  be  expected  to  inhibit  the  clearance  of  drugs  that  are metabolised primarily by these enzymes, at least at concentrations lower than 15,000 ng/ml.

## Discussion on clinical Pharmacology

Arsenic is known to increase the QT electrocardiographic interval, which may eventually lead to a very serious, and sometimes fatal, type of arrhythmia. The results presented are in line with what is known from the literature on the cardiotoxicity of arsenic. Some uncertainties remain as to the reasons why  the  sex  differences  in  QTc  interval  prolongation  are  observed  only  during  the  first  course  of treatment  with  ATO.  Also,  the  inverse  relationship  between  dose  administered  and  QTc  interval prolongation is unexplained. Correlative studies involving measurements of ATO plasma levels and QTc interval prolongation remain of interest.

The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  of  intravenous  ATO  has  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  relapsed  or refractory APL (study 97-66) and patients with advanced hematological (study 98-23-PK) and nonhematological malignancies (study 98-46-PK). In no population was the pharmacokinetics of trivalent arsenic, the active species of Trisenox, adequately characterized because the analytical method did not distinguish between the different forms of arsenic. Additionally, no formal pharmacokinetic analysis was planned and only descriptive statistics have been provided. Nevertheless on the first day of dosing there appeared to be some dose-relation for mean exposure to the drug. Exposure to the drug increases with  daily  dosing,  approaching  a  steady  state  by  approximately  two  weeks,  in  terms  of  0  and  4h plasma  and  RBC  concentrations.  Unfortunately  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  not  calculated  at steady state. So it is not possible to ascertain whether the pharmacokinetic behaviour of ATO is linear after repeated dosing.

No pharmacokinetic studies have formally investigated elderly patients and patients with hepatic or renal impairment. The SPC cautions about the use of this drug in paediatric patients. The SPC also cautions  about  the  use  of  Trisenox  in  patients  with  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  as  its  safety  and effectiveness  have  not  been  studied.  However,  the  fact  that  renal  excretion  is  the  main  route  of elimination  of  arsenic  and  the  case  of  progressive  drug  accumulation  in  one  patient  who  required haemodialysis for the management of renal insufficiency suggests that a survey on the effect of renal impairment on arsenic disposition would be useful (see Follow-up measures/Specific obligations).

## Clinical Efficacy

The main clinical efficacy data submitted consisted of data derived from two non-randomised studies, which  recruited  a  total  of  52  patients  with  APL  who  had  relapsed  after  retinoid  and  anthracycline chemotherapy, or for who anthracycline-based chemotherapy was contraindicated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Main Studies

The two main studies submitted had similar design. Study 97-66 was a non-randomised study titled 'Pharmacokinetics of Arsenic in Patients with  Relapsed or Refractory Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia'.  Study  PLRXAS01  was  a  non-randomised  study  titled  'Multicenter  Study  of  ATO  in Relapsed or Refractory Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia'.

## Methods

Selection criteria for the studies included diagnosis of APL by bone marrow morphology during the present relapse (with confirmation by cytogenetics, FISH or RT-PCR after registration of the patient into  the  trial)  and  relapse  from  or  resistance  to  standard  antileukaemic  therapy.  Relapse  from  or resistance  to  standard  antileukaemic  therapy  was  defined  as  at  least  one  course  of  induction chemotherapy using an anthracycline antibiotic and at least one course of induction or maintenance therapy using either alltrans retinoic acid or 9cis retinoic acid.

The Phase I/II  study  97-66  was  conducted  at  the  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center  and  the Phase II PLRXAS01 study was conducted at nine centres in the United States.

There were differences in the dose regimen (reflecting the range of doses explored in the Phase I/II study) aims of one of the two studies. In the Phase I/II study, the dosing consisted of 10mg/dose, as derived  from  the  Shanghai  series  (Shen  Z-X et  al. ,  1997)  and  was  escalated  to  15  mg/dose.  One paediatric patient received 5 mg/dose. To accommodate paediatric patients, dosing was lastly changed to fixed 0.15-mg/kg/dose regimens.

Induction  therapy.  The  dose  of  0.15  mg/kg/day  was  used  for  the  PLRXAS01  study  and  ATO  was administered until bone marrow remission was observed (see definition of CR) for up to a maximum of 60 doses (but only three patients received more than 49 doses). Review of the available data had suggested that dosing for up to 60 doses might be required to induce bone marrow remission, and that a consolidation course following CR during the initial treatment might prolong remission. Induction treatment  was  to  be  discontinued  when  the  patient  met  the  criteria  for  bone  marrow  remission,  if substantial toxicity, overdose, or disease progression occurred, or after 60 doses had been administered.

Consolidation  treatment.  Patients  who  achieved  clinical  CR  were  eligible  to  receive  one  course  of consolidation treatment with ATO, beginning 3 to 4 weeks after completion of the induction therapy. One course of consolidation treatment was defined as ATO at the same dose as administered during induction, on weekdays only, continuous daily, or some combination thereof, until the cumulative total of 25 treatments was reached. All therapy during consolidation was to be completed within 5 weeks ( ≤ 35 days). Patients who failed to reach CR after the induction period were not eligible for further treatment on this study.

Patients  who  remained  in  CR  after  the  consolidation  treatment  were  eligible  to  participate  to extensions  of  the  corresponding  protocols  (98-13  and  PLRXAS02,  respectively).  Patients  were allowed to receive up to an additional 4 courses of maintenance therapy at the same dose and schedule as they had received for consolidation.

## Dose modification and protocol treatment discontinuation

Phase II protocol treatment was to be discontinued if symptoms suggesting potentially serious acute arsenic  toxicity  appeared  (overdose),  progressive  disease(hyperleukocytosis  by  itself  was  not  to  be considered evidence for disease progression in the absence of abnormal promyelocytes) or significant toxicity.  Significant  toxicity:  Treatment  with  ATO  could  be  interrupted,  adjusted,  or  discontinued before the  scheduled end of therapy  at  any  time  that  a  toxicity  Grade  3  or  greater  on  the  National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria, version 1 (NCI-CTC), was observed. Treatment was to be interrupted in the case of significant:

-  hepatotoxicity (defined as an increase in serum bilirubin, SGOT or alkaline phosphatase to &gt;5 times baseline values),
-  nephrotoxicity (defined as serum creatinine &gt;4 times the upper limit of normal),
-  significant neurological impairment (defined as somnolence, seizures, or impaired mentation),
-  severe peripheral neuropathy or any non-hematologic Grade 4 toxicity.

Patients  who  experienced  such  adverse  events  classified  as  probably  drug  related  could  resume treatment only after resolution of the toxicity or (recovery to baseline status). In such cases, treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was  to  resume  at  50%  of  the  preceding  daily  dose.  If  the  toxicity  did  not  recur  within  3  days  of restarting treatment at the reduced dose, the daily dose could be escalated back to 100% of the original dose. Patients who experienced a recurrence of toxicity were to be removed from the study and not retreated. Patients with therapy interrupted for conditions that were not considered probably related to ATO treatment could resume treatment at the full dose at the discretion of the investigator.

At the earliest signs of ATRA-like syndrome, patients were to be treated with a short course of high dose corticosteroids (10 mg of dexamethasone intravenously twice per day for 3 days). Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  study  PLRXS01  was  to  determine  the  rate  and  duration  of  complete remission and the safety profile of ATO for the treatment of patients with APL who had relapsed or become refractory to conventional anti-leukaemic therapy. Secondary objectives were to determine the overall, failure-free and relapse-free survival. The primary objective of study 97-66 was to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of ATO in patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. A secondary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of As2O3.

Clinical Complete  Remission was  defined  as  cellular  bone  marrow  aspirate  with  &lt;5%  blasts  (and absence of leukemic cells), peripheral blood leukocyte count ≥ 3,000/mm 3 or absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm 3 ,  and  platelet  count ≥ 100,000/mm 3 .  The date of CR was the last of the dates on which these criteria were met. In addition to the conventional criteria for CR described above, bone marrow cells were assessed for t(15:17) by conventional cytogenetics and/or by molecular cytogenetics using RT-PCR for PML/RARα or FISH. Disappearance of t(15;17) was considered supportive evidence for CR.  Abnormalities  confined  to  reports  of  cytogenetic  or  molecular  studies,  absent  these  clinical abnormalities, were not considered clinical relapse. Failure-free survival was calculated as the time from first ATO to relapse or death, whichever first; relapse-free survival was calculated as the time from CR to relapse or death, whichever first. Follow-up is planned to continue until at least five years after the beginning of induction therapy.

## Evaluations

Evaluations of bone marrow aspirates were to be performed at least once on or before day 28, then weekly until bone marrow CR, before beginning consolidation treatment, between 7 and 21 days after completion of consolidation treatment and then approximately once every 3 months during the first year after achieving CR. Bone marrow morphology, differential count, and conventional cytogenetics were to be performed at the study sites; aliquots of the bone marrow samples were also to be sent for PML/RAR α RT-PCR testing, which was conducted in a central laboratory.

In the main clinical studies, adverse events were classified as serious if they were fatal, immediately life-threatening, permanently or significantly disabling or required or prolonged hospitalization. The medical  monitor  who  designated  events  as  serious  or  not  based  on  criteria  stated  in  the  protocols reviewed  adverse  events.  EKGs  were  obtained  at  baseline  and  weekly  or  twice  weekly  during treatment as ATO was known to cause prolongation of the QT interval. Physical examinations and vital signs were required at baseline and twice each week during induction therapy with ATO. These were  also  obtained  at  the  end  of  treatment  and  during  follow-up.  During  consolidation  treatment, physical examinations and vital signs were measured weekly. Standard clinical laboratory evaluations were performed at baseline, during treatment with ATO and at the final visit.

## Sample size

The sample-size of study  PLRXAS01 was calculated assuming a 50% CR for ATO and aiming to exclude a CR of 33% or lower, based on a one-sided lower confidence limit (alpha=0.05). All patients should have received at least one dose of ATO to be included in the efficacy analysis. The proportion of CR is reported together with 2-sided exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the proportion.

## Results

## Participant flow, recruitment and baseline data

Tables 3-5 summarise the baseline characteristics and flow of participants in the two trials according to the different stages of ATO treatment. All selected patients started protocol treatment and received ATO for at least two weeks, except one patient from the 97-66 study who received ATO only for five days.

Study  97-66  was  conducted  during  the  8  months  from  October  16,  1997  to  June  5,  1998.  Twelve patients  entered  and  11  completed  induction  therapy;  these  11  patients  entered  and  completed consolidation therapy. One patient died due to cerebral haemorrhage on the 6 th day of induction. Two additional  97-66  patients  died  within  30  days  after  last  study  treatment  (both  due  to  cerebral

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haemorrhage after APL recurrence and in one patient in the context of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis). The last follow-up contact for the 6 surviving patients was July 18, 2000.

The Phase II PLRXAS01 study was conducted during the 15 months from April 22, 1998 to July 5, 1999. The last follow-up contact for the 26 surviving patients was on July 28, 2000. Forty patients entered  and  34  completed  induction  therapy;  30  patients  entered  and  28  completed  consolidation therapy. Of the 34 patients from PLRXAS01 eligible for the consolidation phase six did not start it (two received stem cell transplantation), two had refused further treatment for personal reasons (non related adverse events), one had persistent worsening of peripheral neuropathy, and one had diseaserelated seizure and pulmonary hemorrhage). Conversely, 2/6 patients entered consolidation treatment without having achieved CR during induction. Two PLRXAS01 patients died during induction (one on  the  39 th day  due  to  GI  bleed,  hypotension  and  stroke;  one  on  the  16 th day  due  to  cerebral haemorrhage).  One  additional  patient  died  during  consolidation  (due  to  pulmonary Aspergillus infection).

Two PLRXAS01 patients eligible for the consolidation phase received Stem Cell Transplant (SCT). Four other  patients  were  eligible  for  consolidation  but  did  not  receive  it;  two  patients  for  personal reasons,  one  patients  due  to  persistent  worsening  of  peripheral  neuropathy,  and  one  patient  due  to disease  related  seizure  activity  and  pulmonary  haemorrhage.  Two  patients  entered  consolidation treatment without having achieved CR during induction. All patients started protocol treatment and were included in the efficacy analysis.

## Clinical Efficacy Results

The main clinical efficacy results presented are summarised in table 6 for individual studies as well as for the merged data set (N=52). No patient was excluded from the main efficacy analysis.

CR rate: In the phase II study, 34/40 (85%)  patients achieved a clinical CR. Overall, 45/52 (87%), APL patients enrolled in the two pivotal studies achieved a clinical CR. The median time to clinical CR was 57 days. At the  time  of  last  follow-up  (July  28,  2000),  24  of  45  (55%)  patients  with  CR remained free of disease. Sixteen had undergone allogeneic SCT (14 while in remission and 2 after further  relapse).  Three had  undergone  autologous  SCT  while in remission. Thirty-one  of  45  (69%) patients with CR were alive at last contact with median follow-up of 18.5 months (range 11.7 to 32.4). The response rate seemed consistent across different patient subgroups although the power to detect any differences was small due to the small sample size and definitive conclusions could not be drawn. Overall,  5/7  paediatric  patients  (&lt;18  years)  and  2/4  (&lt;  12  years)  achieved  CR.  There  were  only  11 elderly  patients  and  9/11  (&gt;60  years)  and  7/8  ( ≥ 65)  years  achieved  CR.  CR  was  observed  in  5/7 patients that had relapsed after prior SCT and in 40/45 without prior SCT. No difference was observed in CR rate by time from last ATRA therapy (6 or 12-months cut-points). CR was observed in 20/22 in patients who had received only one prior treatment regimen versus 25/30 in the remaining group.

Forty-five  patients  were  evaluated  for  conversion  to  normal  cytogenetics:  41  of  them  actually converted to normal karyotype and became negative for t(15:17). RT-PCR for PML-RAR α was used to  document CR in the 45 patients with CR: 35 patients in clinical CR (78% of CR patients) were negative for RT-PCR at the sensitivity level of 10 -4 .  The median time to cytogenetic remission was longer than the median time to clinical CR. Seven patients (16%) did not obtain molecular remission, and  3  were  not  evaluated  for  PML/RARα  (2  patients  who  were  not  evaluated  did  not  receive consolidation and all 3 received bone marrow transplants).

Overall survival: At last follow-up, 32 of 52 patients were alive with a median follow-up time of 18.3 months (range 12 to 32). The Kaplan-Meier estimate for 18-month survival was 66% (Table 6). Figure 1  shows  the  overall  survival  for  the  combined  pivotal  studies.  A  separate  analysis  of  survival censoring the 19 SCT patients at the time of transplants showed similar results. Overall, 31/45 (69%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with CR were alive at last contact, with median follow-up of 18.5 months (range 11.7 - 32.4). The estimated one-year survival was 57% in patients with prior SCT and 73% in those without prior SCT. The estimated 18-month survival for patients with one prior regimen was 86% compared to 55% and 50% for patients with two and more than two prior regimens.

Relapse-free survival: 21/45 patients who achieved a CR have relapsed or died. Two of these patients relapsed after stem cell transplantation. The 1-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse-free survival was 64%, censoring follow-up at the time of stem cell transplantation (Table 6, Figure 2).

Failure-free survival: At the time of last follow-up, 27/52 patients had either relapsed or died (1-year failure-free survival = 62%).

## Clinical Safety

The safety database consists of the data collected for 251 patients treated with ATO, divided into 3 populations for assessment (n=52, 58 and 141 patients based on the main clinical studies in APL, on clinical  trials  in  other  malignancies  and  from  the  compassionate  use  programme,  respectively). Patients who started treatment were considered evaluable for safety and all patients were included in the clinical safety analysis.

## Patient exposure

Exposure data is summarised in tables 7-8. All patients but one received ATO for at least two weeks. Combining both main studies, the median cumulative number of doses administered during induction was  31.5  (range,  5-60).  The  median  cumulative  doses  during  consolidation  was  25  (range,  14-42), including the patient who received re-induction instead of consolidation. The median cumulative dose administered per patient during induction was 4.81 mg/kg (range, 0.75-9.) or 390 mg (range, 75-820). The median cumulative dose administered during consolidation was 3.74 mg/kg (range, 1.53-6) or 288 mg  (range,  91.5-506).  For  the  25  patients  who  received  treatment  in  the  extension  protocols  the median cumulative number of doses administered during the extension treatment was 9.4 (range, 315). The total median cumulative doses, including induction, consolidation and extension treatment for 52 patients in the pivotal and extension studies was 11.7 mg/kg (range, 0.75-27.9) or 905 mg (range, 75-2886), including the patient who received re-induction instead of consolidation.

## Withdrawals due to Adverse Events in Pivotal Studies

The  only  patient  who  discontinued  treatment  from  study  97-66  died  on  day  6  from  subarachnoid hemorrhage and cardiac arrest which were considered unrelated to the ATO treatment. Six patients were  withdrawn  from  study  PLRXAS01  due  to  adverse  events,  four  of  which  were  serious.  Three patients were withdrawn due to events that proved fatal within a few days after withdrawal.

Two coagulopathies associated with APL (GI bleeding leading to hypotension and stroke in one patient and  an  intracranial  hemorrhage  in  another  patient).  The  third  death  resulted  from  pulmonary aspergillosis that was present at the start of the study in a patient who had bone marrow and leukocyte remission  but  no  platelet  recovery  due  to  graft-versus-host-disease  from  a  prior  bone  marrow transplantation. None of the three deaths were considered related to ATO.

One  patient  with  diffuse  alveolar  hemorrhage  necessitating  intubation  and  ventilation  discontinued protocol treatment. The event was considered probably related to APL but possibly related to ATO. The remaining two adverse events that lead to discontinuation were a Grade 3 neuropathy and a severe bone marrow necrosis with bone pain.

## Adverse events

Frequently  occurring  adverse  events  and  adverse  drug  reactions  for  the  main  clinical  studies  are summarised in tables 9-10.

All  107  patients  experienced  some  drug-related  adverse  events.  The  most  common  adverse  events (occurring in 20 patients or more) were fatigue (76), edema (67), nausea (64), hyperglycemia (56), headache (52), pyrexia (50), diarrhea (44), vomiting (44), cough (43), dyspnea (41), tachycardia (39), hypokalemia (35), dermatitis (34), pruritus (31), sore throat (31), abdominal pain (30), insomnia (29), rigors  (29),  constipation  (27),  parasthesia  (27),  dizziness  (27),  arthralgia  (25),  blood  magnesium decreased (24), weight gain (23), anxiety (21), anorexia (20, hypertension (20). The most common drug-related AE were hyperglycemia, fatigue, nausea, headache, hypokalemia, and parasthesia.

Sixty-three  patients  (59%)  experienced  severe  or  life  threatening  (grade  3  and  4)  treatment-related adverse  events.  The  most  common  were  hyperglycemia  (12),  dyspnea  (11),  hypokalemia  (10), neutropenia (7), thrombocytopenia (7), fatigue (7), increased ALT (6), and hypoxia (6) (see Appendix 2 Part I page 690-693). Thirty-seven (35%) experienced possibly, probably or related severe or lifethreatening (grade 3 and 4)  treatment-emergent  AE.  Hypokalemia  (10),  hyperglycemia  (10), neutropenia (6), and increased ALT were the most common drug-related, severe and life-threatening adverse events.

The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  toxicity  was  similar  in  different  age,  gender,  ethnic  and weight groups. The number of prior regimens received or prior BMT did not increase the number of adverse events experienced by patients treated with ATO.

## Serious Adverse Events

In  patients  with  haematological malignancies, 37/107 patients (34%) experienced 61 related serious adverse effects.

## Non-fatal SAEs in Main Clinical Studies

Besides  non-fatal  serious  adverse  events  that  were  not  unexpected  in  this  population,  due  to  their underlying disease, detailed safety data on the recurrence of pulmonary or thoracic symptoms, EKG changes,  neurological  toxicities,  and  myelosuppression  was  presented.  Many  patients  experienced various thoracic symptoms including respiratory failure, with or without pulmonary hemorrhages, with or without hypotension and renal failure, with or without worsening DIC. Some patients had pleural or pericardial effusions. These usually occurred during the first three weeks of ATO treatment. In the minority of these patients, these events were classified as ATRA-like syndrome ('arsenic syndrome'). It is clear that ATRA-like syndrome may occur under ATO treatment in APL patients.

ECG changes: ECG changes with or without prolonged QT interval were reported as serious adverse events possibly or probably related to ATO in three patients enrolled in the main studies. One patient had concomitant palpitations subsequently diagnosed as Torsade de Pointes (see further).

Prolonged  QT/QTc  interval:  An  important  adverse  event  attributed  to  ATO  is  prolongation  of  the QT/QTc interval seen on electrocardiogram (ECG). Two patients from the pivotal PLRXAS01 study and two patients from the SAE only population presented QT prolongation under ATO administration. In one patient, QT interval was normal at baseline and had increase starting on day 7 with maximum values on day 21 and persistent prolonged QT until day 111. In another patient, a prolonged QT was noted at day 30 on routine ECG. This patient experienced a brief, spontaneously resolving episode of torsade de pointes detected on telemetry monitoring. The patient went onto consolidation treatment without further evidence of QT-prolongation.

In  fact,  QT  prolongation  has  been  associated  with  torsade  de  pointes,  a  polymorphic  ventricular tachycardia that occurs in the setting of an abnormally long QT interval. This ventricular arrhythmia has been associated with episodes of syncope and sudden cardiac death. The most common cause for torsade de pointes is administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval. Congenital cases (Long-QT Syndrome  [LQTS])  have  been  described  and  relatively  large  numbers  of  individuals  have  been identified who carry silent mutations on LQTS genes. These patients may be especially sensitive to drugs that affect potassium currents as these channels are affected by the abnormal genes. There are a number of baseline characteristics that identify a patient at increased risk for torsade de pointes. The following are risk factors associated with drug-induced torsade de pointes: female gender,

hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, diuretic use, recent  conversion  from  atrial  fibrillation, congestive  heart  failure  or  cardiomyopathy,  QT-prolongation  during  drug  administration,  baseline prolonged-QT.  Other  causes  of  prolonged  QT  such  as  hypocalcemia  or  hypothyroidism  are  rare causes.  There  are  a  number  of  drugs  commonly  used  in  cancer  patients  undergoing  induction chemotherapy, which are known to cause prolongation of QT, and other commonly used drugs which affect  metabolism  of  drugs  with  a  potential  to  cause  prolonged  QT.  The  treatment  for  torsade  de pointes  is  careful  attention  to  fluid  and  electrolyte  balance  and  administration  of  potassium  and magnesium to maintain this electrolyte well in the normal range. Cautious patient management should minimize the patient's risk of developing torsade de pointes. Management entails ECG monitoring of QT  prolongation  at  regular  intervals,  withholding  drug  when  a  threshold  of  &gt;460  msec  has  been reached, monitoring electrolytes and maintaining potassium and magnesium levels within the normal range and judicious use of concomitant medications.

An expert cardiology review of approximately 1,000 ECGs obtained in 99 patients receiving infusions of ATO confirmed that treatment with arsenic gradually prolongs the QT interval until steady state is reached. In this group, mean QTc prolongation was 47 plus or minus 5 msec and the half-time for approach to steady state was 6 plus or minus 2 days. QTc prolongation resolved after discontinuation of arsenic infusions. Infusions of arsenic seemed  to  have no effect on  AV  conduction  or intraventricular conduction except in a subject who developed transient atrial fibrillation with a right bundle branch block and slow ventricular response in the setting of severe hyperkalemia. Heart rate was increased by approximately 10 beats during therapy compared to baseline. This effect was noted immediately after the first infusion and did not increase further as therapy progressed.

Peripheral  neuropathy:  Peripheral  neurological  events  were  reported  in  the  pivotal  and  supportive populations. Twenty-three patients reported paresthesias, most of which were mild to moderate. Mild and moderate peripheral neuropathic events were reported which resolved upon cessation of the drug. Neuropathic events were observed as follows: paresthesias (32), hypoesthesia (8), abnormal gait (5), peripheral  neuropathy  (5),  and  one  patient  each  reported  hyperesthesia,  hyporeflexia,  myasthenic syndrome,  unspecified  neurological  symptoms  and  peripheral  motor  neuropathy.  Two  patients  had severe paresthesias (1 hand and foot and the other associated with muscle weakness), which resulted in discontinuation early from study drug treatment. One APL patient who discontinued early during consolidation  went  on  to  the  extension  study  and  received  further  ATO  treatments,  which  were intermittently  held  while  his  neuropathy  improved  and  then  restarted.  There  were  no  grade  3  or  4 peripheral  neuropathic  adverse  events  reported.  Seizures  were  reported  in  two  patients  in  the PLRXAS01 study (one patient at day 1 and 3 of ATO therapy and again later at day 28 and 31 in the context of a severe Gram-negative sepsis; in another patient, seizure activity occurred while the patient was under mechanical ventilation at day 32 of ATO treatment, leading to its discontinuation). Of note, peripheral neuropathy was not graded as a serious adverse event, except in one case of presumptive neuropathic pain (although neurologic examinations did not confirm this).

Myelosuppression:  Chronic  exposure  to  arsenic  is  known  to  cause  myelodysplastic  features  in  the bone  marrow  associated  with  cytopenia.  Such  an  effect  is  hard  to  assess  in  patients  with  acute leukemia during the first induction cycle but not during consolidation and maintenance cycles. The analysis of individual WBC counts before and during the consolidation and maintenance cycles (data not  shown)  showed  that  approximately  40%  of  these  treatment  courses  were  associated  with  a significant  decrease  in  WBC.  Treatment-related  neutropenia  was  usually  mild.  Febrile  neutropenia was observed in patient (at the end of the consolidation cycle).

## Non-fatal SAEs in supportive Studies

In  study  98-23 (patients with advanced hematologic malignancies), non-fatal serious adverse events were  mainly  non-documented  or  documented  infections  in  10  patients.  One  patient  experienced hemolysis  on  day  16,  following  a  RBC  transfusion.  Two  patients  (1062  and  1069)  had  abdominal symptoms related to an underlying chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in one patient and to a Clostridium difficile infection  in  the  other  one.  These  events  were  not  related  to  ATO  treatment.  One  patient experienced  an  asymptomatic  QT  prolongation  (570  ms)  associated  with  a  decrease  in  serum potassium to 2.9, on day 36. This event was considered possibly related to ATO (1107). In 7 cases, ATO was discontinued due to adverse events.

In study 98-46 (patients with advanced solid tumors), non-fatal adverse events were mainly related to cancer progression (10 events in 10 patients). One patient (1080) with a history of adult onset DM presented  a  severe  hyperglycemia  with  serum  glucose  621  mg/dL  related  to  ATO.  A  75-year-old

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient experienced severe fatigue and severe increased ALT related to ATO. In 3 cases, ATO was discontinued due to adverse event.

Among the 141 patients treated in compassionate use, 25 patients had a total of 29 serious adverse events. Thirteen patients died. Study drug was discontinued in 16 patients due to SAE. Fifteen patients experienced related SAE including fatal atra syndrome (1), fatal sepsis (1), diarrhea and abdominal pain (1), fatal pain hypotension and hypoxia (1), dyspnea (1), bone pain and neutropenic fever (1), grade 3 neutropenia (1), neuropathy (2), worsening headache (1), fatal cerebral edema (1), fatal CNS infarct (1), QTc prolongation (1), myocardial injury (1), spontaneous abortion (1).

## Deaths

In the 97-66 study, one patient died due to cerebral haemorrhage on day 6 after receiving 5 doses of ATO. Two additional patients died within 30 days after last study treatment, both in the context of APL progression after one induction and one consolidation ATO cycle. No deaths were considered to be related to ATO and were instead considered consistent with the known complications of APL. In the  PLRXAS01  study,  no  patients  died  while  receiving  study  treatment,  but  three  patients  were withdrawn due to SAEs that proved fatal within a few days after the withdrawals. Two of the three deaths were due to coagulopathies (one GI bleed leading to hypotension and stroke in one patient and one intracranial haemorrhage in another patient) associated with APL. Neither of these patients had achieved CR before the time of death.  The third death resulted from pulmonary aspergillosis that was present  at  study  start  in  a  patient  who  had  bone  marrow  and  leukocyte  remission,  but  no  platelet recovery due to GVHD from a prior BMT. Again, none of these deaths was considered to be related to ATO treatment.

Concerning  supportive  studies,  five  deaths  have  been  reported  on-study  in  study  98-23.  All  were considered  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  disease  progression  (1  refractory  APL,  1  AML,  3  nonHodgkin lymphomas). No deaths on-study or within 30 days after last study drug have been reported in study 98-46.

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

Hematology and coagulation profile: Given the hematological perturbations related to the presence of the underlying disease, it is difficult to assess the hematological consequences of ATO treatment in patients enrolled in the pivotal studies. Hyperleukocytosis that occurred during induction cycle in APL patients only and putative myelosuppression that might occurred after prolonged ATO administration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in all patients are discussed above. Coagulation disorders occurring during the induction cycle in APL patients were considered as clearly related to the underlying leukemia.

Clinical  chemistry:  The  most  recurrent  and  relevant  abnormalities  are  hypokalemia,  hyperglycemia and  increased  liver  enzymes  levels.  These  abnormalities  are  not  unexpected  in  such  a  complicated patient  population.  However,  the  recurrence  of  hyperglycemia  and  mild  hepatic  toxicity  during  the second consolidation cycle has to be noted.

Hepatic toxicity including increased total bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, and/or alkaline phosphatase values may be considered to be related to ATO administration. However, no patient met the protocol-defined criteria for significant hepatic toxicity (5 x baseline for SGOT, bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase) and there  was  no  treatment  discontinuation  for  this  reason.  Of  note  the  elevation  was  transient  and reversible in the majority of patients with either treatment or the discontinuation of ATO.

Vital  signs  and  weight:  Weight  gain  (23%)  and  hypotension  (20%)  were  usually  observed  in  APL patients.  Both  symptoms  may  be  related  to  the  differentiation  syndrome  ('arsenic  syndrome'),  as observed  under  ATRA  therapy  (ATRA  syndrome).  This  syndrome  is  discussed  in  the  following section.

Hyperleukocytosis and arsenic syndrome (differentiation syndrome): Two syndromes (hyperleukocytosis and differentiation syndrome)  have been associated with  ATO  and  other differentiation  agents  in  the  treatment  of  APL  that  are  thought  to  confer  increased  morbidity. Differentiation  syndrome  (ATRA  syndrome  and  arsenic  syndrome)  are  often  linked  to  a  clinical syndrome manifested by fever, weight gain, hypotension, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural or pericardial effusions with or without marked increase in WBC. This syndrome is considered as a clinical  consequence  of  APL  cell  activation  during  the  differentiation  process.  Recommended treatment is to initiate high dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg twice a day for 3 to 5 days) at the first  suspected  sign  or  symptom  of  the  syndrome.  Cytotoxic  chemotherapeutic  intervention  and/or leukopheresis may be indicated in cases of life-threatening hyperleukocytosis. Hyperleukocytosis is not a prerequisite for differentiation syndrome, nor does every patient with hyperleukocytosis develop a clinical differentiation syndrome. As mentioned before, the presence of a differentiation syndrome requiring  the  introduction  of  steroid  therapy  may  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  especially  in  patients without associated hyperleukocytosis. Many  signs may  be confounded with infection-related symptoms which theoretically contra-indicate steroid administration. Furthermore, the duration of the differentiation  process  that  may  reach  3  or  4  weeks  and  therefore  may  result  in  prolonged  steroid administration in these patients.

Four patients had SAEs reported as differentiation syndrome during ATO treatment. Twelve patients had hyperleukocytosis, 4 of whom had values above 100,000/ µ L. One patient treated under the NCI compassionate  use  program  died  from  cerebral  infarct  and  had  concomitant  hyperleukocytosis.  No markers  to  identify patients at higher  risk for developing  either differentiation  syndrome  or hyperleukocytosis were found.

Coagulation disorders: Other adverse events associated with APL are coagulation disorders including DIC. This syndrome is characteristic of APL and also thought to be worse in patients with treatmentinduced hyperleukocytosis. The majority (41 of 52) pivotal patients had symptomatic DIC at baseline. Treatment  with  ATO  did  not  appear  to  exacerbate  the  incidence  of  DIC.    Mortality  in  the  pivotal studies from DIC associated hemorrhage was approximately 11%, consistent with the 10 to 15% early mortality reported in the literature.

## Late adverse events

Relationship between chronic arsenic ingestion and the development of skin and internal cancers has been reported. A recent study from Taiwan reported a dose-response relationship between the longterm arsenic exposure to high-inorganic arsenic artesian well water and the incidence of lung, bladder, and all sites cancers. In multivariate analysis, a cumulative arsenic exposure &gt; 20 mg/liter x duration of drinking artesian well water (year) was predictive of cancer development. Over the 7-year followup of this study, such a cumulative arsenic exposure corresponds to a cumulative ingested dose of 25 to 50 gr.

A  quantitative  assessment  performed  by  the  EPA  using  Taiwan  data  showed  that  for  the  U.S. population,  the  risk  of  developing  skin  cancer  from  lifetime  exposure  to  ingested  arsenic  of 1 ug/kg/day ranges from 1 to 2 individuals per 1000. Assuming a 70 year lifetime and an average body weight of 70 kg, a cumulative exposure to arsenic of 1800 mg is associated with a risk of skin cancer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in 1-2 individuals per 1000. Other studies have suggested an elevated, but  not quantifiable, risk for cancer of internal organs from exposure to arsenic.

The  median  cumulative  dose  of  ATO  for  APL  patients  treated  with  induction,  consolidation,  and maintenance was 906 mg (range 75 to 2886 mg). One milligram of ATO contains 0.757 mg of arsenic, so the median exposure to arsenic was 686 mg (range 57 to 2185 mg). The maximum arsenic exposure is approximately equal to the cumulative dose of arsenic associated with an incidence of 1 to 2 cases of skin cancer per 1,000 people.

It was therefore considered very unlikely that the extent of exposure to ATO in these patients might represent  a  significant  factor  for  further  cancer  development  and  the  demonstrated  benefit  for  APL patients receiving ATO therapy clearly outweighs the potential risk for subsequent cancer.

## Drug interactions

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Drugs that can potentially bind to arsenic like N-acetyl cysteine, chelators or antioxidants like vitamin E may block the activity of ATO.

## Discussion on clinical safety

Although the safety database is based on a small number of patients, the data presented are sufficient to assess the safety profile of ATO. The duration of exposure and the median total cumulative dose of ATO reported were higher for APL-patients than for non-APL patients.

The toxicity observed was not unexpected with ATO. The main toxicity included metabolism disorder including  hyperglycemia  and  hypokalaemia,  respiratory  disorder  and  ALT  increase.  Seven  patients (13%)  were  withdrawn  due  to  adverse  effect.  No  patient  died  from  toxicity.  Twenty  six  patients (44.8%) experienced nonfatal serious adverse events. Only three cases were treatment-related serious adverse events.

Ten patients (17%) have discontinued ATO treatment due to adverse events. In the main studies, only 3  patients  (5.7%)  were  withdrawn  from  studies  due  to  related  adverse  effects.  In  this  context  of relapsed or refractory leukemia, this percentage is low.

Particular caution is requested in patients with renal failure receiving ATO, as renal excretion is the main route of elimination of arsenic. Recommendations on monitoring of the patient are included in the SPC.

QT prolongation was a serious concern. Additional data regarding the predictability and the degree of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes were requested. The applicant provided data from previously treated patients (survivors from pivotal study and patients from ongoing studies) with cardiac toxicity. The applicant also submitted a US 'dear health provider' on QT prolongation and risk of torsade de pointes in March 2001, due to a recent publication of Unnikrishnan reporting 3 cases of QT interval prolongation  with  torsade  de  pointes.  Two  patients  died  from  cardiac  arrythmia.  These  cardiac toxicities were collected with another ATO. The applicant reminded that 40% of patients treated with ATO experienced at least one QT interval prolongation greater than 500msec, with one non fatal case of  torsade  de  pointes.  Prolongation  of  QTc  was  observed  between  1  and  5  weeks  of  daily  ATO infusion, and returned to baseline by the end of 8 weeks after Trisenox infusion. This last information was added in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Adequate  recommendations  are  provided  in  the  SPC  including  monitoring  of  electrocardiogram, electrolytes  and  renal  function  (see Special  precautions  for  use ).  Recommendations for  monitoring and  treating  hyperleukocytosis  and  leukocyte  activation  syndrome  (APL  differentiation  syndrome) have also been provided in the SPC, section 4.4.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  important  quality  characteristics  of  ATO  are  well  defined  and  controlled,  and  the  product  is formulated, manufactured and controlled in a way that is characteristic of a solution for injection. The specifications  and  batch  analytical  results  indicate  a  consistent  product  with  uniform  clinical performance  from  batch  to  batch.  There  are  no  outstanding  quality  issues,  which  have  a  negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

There are no substantial problems in toxicology, since the effects of ATO have been studied for a long time.  The  compound's  safety  profile  and  the  doses  proposed  for  this  specific  therapy  are  not  of particular  concern  as  long  as  the  recommendations  of  the  SPC  are  carefully  followed.  A  better understanding  of  the  ATO  mechanism  of  action  could  help  optimise  the  dose,  since  the  one  now proposed is based on empirical criteria.

## Efficacy

The dose used (0.15 mg/kg/d) was approximately 50% of the maximum tolerated dose. Intravenous infusion of 10 mg ATO daily for one to two months was observed to induce significant CR of APL, and there was no cross-resistance between ATO and other anti-leukaemic agents, including ATRA. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive data to establish that the chosen dose and duration of treatment are the most effective and safe ones. The rationale for restricting the number of treatment days to 50 courses is that only four patients received more than 44 doses in the 2 clinical trials. It is possible to conclude that if a patient does not achieve a bone marrow remission within 50 days then it is unlikely that further dosing will be effective (see SPC, section 4.2, Posology and method of administration ).

Eleven of 12 and 34 of 40 patients achieved CR :overall CR rate: 87%. The CR rate observed with ATO  was  comparable  to  that  of  90%  with  ATRA  combined  with  intensive  timed  sequential chemotherapy, reported in a recent study in patients that had relapsed from prior chemotherapy (11 patients) or ATRA/chemotherapy (39 patients) after a median first complete remission of 17 months (Thomas et al. ,  2000). The patient population in the Thomas paper was in 1 st relapse, had age ≤ 65, and  did  not  have  a  prior  marrow  transplant.    In  the  ATO  patients,  ½  the  patients  were  in  2 nd or subsequent relapse, 15% were over age 65, and 13% had a prior transplant before ATO treatment.The efficacy of ATO in terms of a high rate of CR in relapsed APL patients is promising. However, the induction of remission with ATO is oftenwas not sufficient to obtain molecular remission in 22% of cases  (16%  excluding  patients  that  were  not  evaluated)  and  its  better  efficacy  in  combination  with ATRA or chemotherapy  should  be  tested  in  terms  of  rate  of  molecular  remission  and  duration  of clinical remission.

Now it is known that after CR in relapsed patients, chemotherapy in combination with ATO as postremission  therapy  gives  better  survival  than  ATO  alone.  This  is  in  line  with  the  observation  that remission  induction  with  ATO  is  not  sufficient  in  most  cases  to  obtain  a  molecular  remission,  as judged by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for PML-RAR alpha fusion transcripts. The in  vivo  effect  of  ATO  seems  to  be  related  to  the  expression  of  APL-specific  PML-RAR  alpha oncoprotein, and a synergistic effect between ATO and ATRA has been shown in the APL mouse model. Like with ATRA in APL, early relapses within a few months after ATO treatment were not infrequent (10% within six months), possibly, indicating that resistance to ATO. can emerge rapidly. In the follow-up of relapsed cases over 7 to 48 months, the estimated disease-free survival (DFS) rate at  two years  was  41%,  and  the  median  DFS  was  17 months.  Patients  with  white  blood cell  (WBC) count below 10 x 109/L at relapse had better survival than those with WBC count over 10 x 109/L.

The follow-up is still too short to draw firm conclusions, and there is no clear evidence that despite the high  remission  rate  achieved  with  ATO  in  relapsed  APL  patients,  this  single  agent  can  guarantee sustained  long-term  remission.  Several  competing  strategies  have  successful  in  the  treatment  of clinical or molecular relapse in APL including combinations of ATRA and chemotherapy, autologous and  allogeneic  transplantation  and,  more  recently,  monoclonal  antibodies  against  CD33.  Therefore, prospective clinical trials based on ATO in combination with ATRA or chemotherapy must formally provide evidence of prolonged clinical activity as measured by molecular monitoring and duration of clinical remission. It is acknowledged that randomised studies in this population are difficult to carry out due to the rarity of APL, especially in relapse situations as the occurrence of relapse has recently decreased because of new therapeutic strategies (ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy). The applicant has committed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ATO in frontline APL in a randomised controlled clinical trial. This will help to further define therapeutic strategy with ATO, and controlled study in relapse situation does not seem necessary.

In conclusion, the results in terms of clinical efficacy presented so far in relapsed APL patients are promising.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  undertake,  among  others,  randomised  clinical  trials  to evaluate  the  role  of  combining  ATO  with  ATRA versus ATRA  alone  in  the  treatment  of  newly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

diagnosed APL patients who are not eligible for the current therapeutic regimens based on ATRA and chemotherapy.

## Safety

The safety  profile  of  ATO  in  the  data  presented  showed  adverse  effects  that  were  not  unexpected: metabolism disorders (hyperglycemia, hypokalemia), respiratory disorders (hypoxia, dyspnea), hematological  disorders  (neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  differentiation  syndrome),  peripheral neuropathy, and increased alanine aminotransferase.

A particular concern with ATO treatment was QT prolongation: 40 % of patients treated with ATO experienced at least one QT interval prolongation greater than 500 ms, with one non fatal case of TDP. Furthermore, QT interval prolongation with torsades de pointes (TDP) were recently reported in ATO treated patients (Unnikrishnan et al ., Blood 2001; 97). The mechanism of QTc prolongation remains unknown. The applicant has committed to provide a pharmacokinetic study in which blood samples will be  collected at specified  times  in  conjunction  with  serial  ECG's  to  adequately  characterise  the concentration of ATO and its methylated metabolites versus time profile and QT measurements. In the lack of clear predictive and prognosis factors, regular assessments of QT intervals are necessary, and constant  ECG  monitoring  is  possibly  required  at  the  beginning  of  induction  treatment:  such recommendations are included in the SPC.

Concerning  treatment-related  deaths,  no  fatal  drug  reactions  were  observed  with  in  ATO  studies (despite a more heavily pre-treated population) whilst this was close to 10% in patients treated with ATRA+chemotherapy, in the same setting.

In conclusion, in the particular context of the proposed indication, Trisenox presented an acceptable safety profile, even if some particular concerns remained in the monitoring some adverse events, i.e: differentiation syndrome, respiratory disorders, and increased liver enzymes.

## Benefit/risk assessment

The mainstay of APL management is currently based on ATRA plus chemotherapy, which has been shown to be superior to either chemotherapy or ATRA alone. However, a small proportion of patients (approximately  15%)  are  refractory  to  ATRA  plus  chemotherapy-induced  remission  and  30-40% experience relapse a number of years after remission. Thus a proportion of APL patients would benefit from active alternative treatment.

Following initial assessment, the CPMP's concerns related mainly to the lack of control group in the submitted  clinical  studies,  the  QT  interval  prolongation,  the  selected  dosage,  and  to  the  lack  of pharmacokinetic  and  safety  data in specific populations (patients with renal failure or liver impairment).

Despite the lack of randomised controlled studies, the CR observed with ATO in the clinical trials presented shows that Trisenox has at least similar clinical efficacy to that reported in published series that investigated treatment with ATRA+chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease. However, the relatively short follow-up for the ATO trials does not guarantee that long-term remission is maintained in  a  high  proportion  of  patients.  Also,  the  induction  of  clinical  remission  with  ATO  was  often  not sufficient  to  obtain  molecular  remission  in  22%  of  cases  (16%  excluding  patients  that  were  not evaluated)  and  therefore,  combination  treatment  of  ATO  with  ATRA  or  chemotherapy  should  be tested in order to improve the rate of molecular remission and duration of clinical remission. Because of the few patients studied or the lack of evidence of particular benefit, the efficacy-safety profile of ATO in certain subgroups, such as patients with early relapse after ATRA, with contra-indications to anthracycline, with prior or eligible for SCT, and elderly patients, is still not defined. Other strategies, such  as  combinations  of  ATRA  and  intensive  chemotherapy,  autologous  and  allogeneic  BMT,  and monoclonal antibodies against CD33, are now available for the treatment of clinical and molecular relapses  and  some  of  these  alternative  approaches  should  be  compared  with ATO,  even  in  patients apparently suitable for ATO treatment.

ATO was associated with potentially serious toxicity and vigilant monitoring is warranted. Compared to existing regimens, however, ATO showed a more favourable toxicity profile in terms of treatmentrelated deaths. These were observed in up to 10% of patients in the published series, whilst none were observed in the trials with Trisenox.

Overall,  the  activity  observed  with  ATO  is  promising  in  terms  of  clinical  efficacy  in  the  proposed indication,  which  represents  a  disease  setting  in  which  so  far  patients  could  only  benefit  of  few treatment  options.  Due  to  the  rarity  of  the  indication,  it  is  considered  that  the  applicant  cannot

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reasonably  be  expected  to  provide  comprehensive  evidence  in  respect  of  the  particular  therapeutic indication  in  relapsed  disease.  To  this  end,  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  complete  an  agreed programme of studies within a specified timeframe, the results of which shall form the basis of an annual reassessment of the benefit/risk profile.

The programme of studies includes:

-  Phase I Study of Trisenox (arsenic trioxide) injection in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
-  Phase  III  randomized  study  of  concurrent  tretinoin  and  chemotherapy  with  or  without  arsenic trioxide (As2O3) as initial consolidation therapy followed by maintenance with intermittent tretinoin therapy  versus  intermittent  tretinoin  plus  mercaptopurine  and  methotrexate  for  patients  with untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia.
-  Phase II Study of Arsenic Trioxide in Patients with APL in Molecular Relapse

In  addition, the applicant has committed to specifically address several issues within the context of ongoing or new clinical trials:

-  To present a survey of Trisenox  injection in Adult Cancer Patients with Renal Dysfunction
-  To study the relationship between pharmacokinetics and QT prolongation in APL patients
-  To assess the value of ATO in consolidation treatment for patients at high-risk of relapse
-  To provide valuable prospective information on the therapeutic implications of a positive or negative RT-PCR
-  To evaluate the value of combining ATO with ATRA versus ATRA alone in the treatment of newly diagnosed APL patients who are not eligible for the current therapeutic regimens based on ATRA and chemotherapy

## Recommendation

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Trisenox for induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptoralpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene (previous treatment should have included a retinoid and chemotherapy), was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances, to be reviewed annually.
