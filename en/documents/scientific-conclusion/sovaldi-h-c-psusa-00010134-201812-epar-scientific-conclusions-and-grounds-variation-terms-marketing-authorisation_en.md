## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sofosbuvir, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

1. Decrease in immunosuppressive therapy concentrations requiring dose modification has been observed during  the  course  of  hepatitis  C  treatment  in  patients  taking  tacrolimus,  as  immunosuppressant,  and direct-acting antivirals (DAA), such as sofosbuvir. Based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion  profile  of  immunosuppressant  drugs  and  sofosbuvir,  a  significant  pharmacokinetic  interaction between these agents is not expected, as reflected in current SmPC of Sovaldi. However, the sustained inflammatory  response  associated  with  hepatitis  C  infection  may  lead  to  downregulation  of  certain drug-metabolizing  enzymes,  including  CYP3A.  Initiation  of  DAA-based  therapy  leads  to  a  rapid  viral clearance, normalization of liver function tests and a reduction in inflammation, which thereby leads to enhanced metabolism of CYP3A substrates, such as tacrolimus. Owing to the narrow therapeutic index of tacrolimus, appropriate clinical monitoring and management of immunosuppression with tacrolimus or other drugs with a narrow therapeutic margin that are metabolized by the liver should be carried out.

2. The Product Information does not make specific recommendations to dose adjustment of immunosuppressive  agents  at  initiation  of  co-administration,  but  prescribers  should  be  aware  of  the potential  impact  of  direct-acting  antiviral  therapy  on  immunosuppressive  drug  levels  (and  other  drugs metabolized by the liver) during therapy, so that they are better alerted on the potential need for dose adjustment.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sofosbuvir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sofosbuvir is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
