## Additional indication:

Treatment of  patients  with  advanced  carcinoma  of  the  ovary  (AOC)  or  with  residual  disease ( &gt; 1 cm) after initial laparotomy, in combination with cisplatin  as first-line treatment.

It has been demonstrated (see module 6: Scientific discussion, section 6) that paclitaxel marketed as Taxol and paclitaxel marked as Paxene have identical formulations on the basis of chemical/physical properties,  in  vitro  behaviour  (in  particular  on  micelle  formation)  and  in  vivo  pharmacokinetics. Therefore, it is acceptable for clinical data produced with Taxol to be applied in order to support new indications for Paxene.

Taxol (paclitaxel, MAH: Bristol Myers Squibb) was approved in the EU in 1993, and -among other indications- is currently approved for first-line treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with advanced carcinoma of the ovary or with residual disease (&gt;1 cm) after initial laparotomy in combination with cisplatin.

Clinical aspects Proof of efficacy of paclitaxel /cisplatin combinations as first-line chemotherapy in advanced ovarian carcinoma was based on two multicenter, randomised, controlled phase III trials  (B-MS CA139-209, B-MS CA139-022; published by Piccart et al. 2000, McGuire et al. 1996). In addition to these data, which  constitute  the  primary  basis  of  the  current  submission,  a  literature  update  of  the  two  new indications  including  9  phase  III  clinical  trials  published  since  1996  in  the  first-line  therapy  of advanced ovarian cancer) is provided.  No new clinical pharmacological data is provided. Clinical efficacy In study CA139-022 410 patients were randomised to receive a maximum of 6 courses of paclitaxel (135 mg/m 2 over  24 h)  followed  by  cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ),  or  cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 followed by  cisplatin  75 mg/m 2 ).  Median  progression  free  survival  was  significantly  longer  (p&lt;0.001)  with paclitaxel/cisplatin (17 months vs 13 months). Median survival also favoured the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm  (36  months  vs  24  months,  p&lt;0.001).  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between treatment arms in terms of clinical response (60% and 50% for paclitaxel/cisplatin and cyclophosphamide/cisplatin arms, respectively),  although  for  pathological  response  rate  there  was  a significant difference in favour of the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm (34% vs 20%, p=0.001).

In  study  CA139-209,  680  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  paclitaxel  (175 mg/m 2 over  3 h) followed by cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ),  or  cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2. Median progression free survival was 15.5 months in the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm vs 11.5 months in the cyclophosphamide/cisplatin  arm  (p=0.0005).  This  primary  efficacy  result  was  supported  by  the secondary efficacy endpoints: median survival 35.6 vs 25.8 months (p=0.0016), overall response rate 59% vs 45% (p=0.01), and complete response rate 41% vs 27% (p=0.01), for paclitaxel/cisplatin and cyclophosphamide/cisplatin, respectively.

Superiority of paclitaxel/cisplatin over standard therapy (cyclophosphamide/cisplatin) was demonstrated.  Paclitaxel/cisplatin  became  the  accepted  standard  first-line  therapy  for  patients  with advanced ovarian cancer or residual disease.

Long-term follow-up results from the two pivotal Taxol studies reported in a further study (Piccart et al. 2003, table 7.1). The median follow-up time of the two pivotal Taxol studies was approximately 3 years.  6.5-year  follow-up  data  is  now  available.  In  each  case,  an  11%  absolute  gain  in  survival favouring  the  paclitaxel  arm  is  shown;  this  advantage  remains  both  statistically  and  clinically significant and supports a role for paclitaxel in first line chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer.

## Literature Review

With  modern  cytoreductive  surgery  followed  by  a  combination  of  platinum  and  paclitaxel,  modest improvements in overall survival of advanced ovarian cancer were seen. However, despite increasing survival  rates,  advanced  ovarian  cancer  is  rarely  cured  and  more  than  50%  of  patients  die  within 5 years  of  diagnosis  therefore,  tolerability  of  treatment  and  quality  of  life  (QoL)  remain  important issues and development of more effective therapy is a clear priority. With regards to paclitaxel/platinum-based therapy several issues remain to be clarified, including the optimal number of cycles, relative value of combined vs. sequential therapy with taxanes, the role of maintenance or consolidation and the most effective carboplatin dose (AUC 7.5 or lower). Results from 8 phase III studies,  published  since  2000,  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  paclitaxel-containing  first  line  therapy  of advanced ovarian cancer are presented in table 7.2 and discussed.

# = GFR determined by radioisotope method or 24-h urine; ## = GFR determined by Cockcroft formula n.r. = not reported; CIS = cisplatin; PTX = paclitaxel; CYC = cyclophosphamide; CAR = carboplatin; EPI = epirubicin; DOX = doxorubicin Clinical response was evaluated in 5 controlled studies. For paclitaxel/cisplatin, the overall response rate was 61-81%, with CR rates of 35- 43%. The highest response rates were achieved with paclitaxel/cisplatin (185 mg/m 2 over 3 h/75 mg/m 2 ); however, no additional survival benefit was observed. These results are consistent with those observed in the pivotal BMS studies: overall response rates of 60% and 59% (B-MS CA139-022 and B-MS CA139209) respectively. For  paclitaxel/carboplatin-containing  regimens,  the  overall  response  rates  range  from  65-80%,  with 31-55% of patients achieving CR. An increased dose of paclitaxel (185 mg/m 2 over  3  h)  combined with carboplatin AUC 6 did not result in higher response rates. (Bolis et al. 2004). In comparison to paclitaxel/carboplatin, paclitaxel/cisplatin response was significantly better in only one study (Du Bois et al. 2003b) and no survival benefit was observed. In another clinical trial no significant differences were observed between paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin (Neijt et al.  2000).  Response  rates  with  paclitaxel  monotherapy  were  significantly  lower.  There  were  no significant differences between paclitaxel/carboplatin and the new triple combination paclitaxel/carboplatin/epirubicin. Survival and Progression-Free Survival Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall survival and progression-free survival were determined in 6 studies; 4-year rates were reported by Bolis et al. (2004). Survival parameters are defined as primary endpoint in 5/7 trials. The results are summarised in Table 7. 3.

For  paclitaxel/cisplatin  regimens,  OS  ranged  from  26.3-  52.2  months,  PFS  from  14.1-22.2  months. Two dosage regimes of Paxene are proposed: 175 mg/m 2 administered as a 3-hour, or 135 mg/m 2 as a 24-hour  i.v.  infusion,  followed  by  cisplatin  75 mg/m 2 every  three  weeks.  Comparable  results  were obtained with paclitaxel/cisplatin 135 mg/m 2 over 24 h/75 mg/m 2 (OS  26.3- 52.2 months, PFS 14.122.2 months) and 175 mg/m 2 over  3  h/75  mg/m 2 (OS 30-36.1 months, PFS 16-17.3 months). These results  are  consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  pivotal  BMS  studies  paclitaxel/cisplatin-treated patients:  median  OS  durations  of  38  and  35.6  months  (B-MS  CA139-022  and  B-MS  CA139-209, respectively).  The  corresponding  PFS  figures  were  18  and  15.5  months,  respectively.  An  increased dose of paclitaxel (185 mg/m 2 over 3 h) in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) does not result in a survival  benefit  (Du  Bois  et  al.  2003b).    The  best  results  (OS  52.2  months;  PFS  22.2 months)  are reported by Markman et al. (2001), who treated optimally debulked patients with 135 mg/m 2 paclitaxel over 24 h, and 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For paclitaxel/carboplatin-containing regimens (175 mg/m 2 /AUC 5-7.5), OS of 32.0-57.4 months and PFS from 16.0-20.7 months) are reported. Increasing the dose of paclitaxel (185 mg/m 2 over 3 h) in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 or high-dose paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen (225 mg/m 2 over 3 h/AUC 6), Bolis et al. (2004), did not lead to a survival benefit. The best results (OS 57.4 months; PFS 20.7 months) are reported by Ozols et al. (2003), who treated optimally debulked patients with 175 mg/m 2 paclitaxel  over  3  h,  and  carboplatin  AUC  7.5.  Three  studies  concluded  that  paclitaxel/ carboplatin achieved comparable efficacy paclitaxel/cisplatin (Du Bois et al. 2003b, Ozols et al. 2003 and Neijt et al. 2000). It was associated with better gastrointestinal and neurological tolerability but higher  frequency  of  haematological  toxicity  (neutropenia, ≥ grade  2  thrombocytopenia)  and  better QoL and should be considered an important alternative to standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

In  a  single  study  of  2074  patients  (ICON  Group  2002)  comparing  paclitaxel/carboplatin  vs. carboplatin  monotherapy  or  cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin  similar  efficacy  was  noted  for carboplatin alone and combination therapy, and carboplatin alone was associated with fewer toxicities. It  was  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of  single-agent  carboplatin  and  triple  therapy  equals  that  of  the standard  therapy  as  first-line  treatment  for  women  requiring  chemotherapy  for  ovarian  cancer.  The favourable toxicity profile of carboplatin monotherapy suggests that this drug is a reasonable option as first-line  chemotherapy  for  ovarian  cancer.  Further  investigations  are  required  to  demonstrate  the potential advantage of carboplatin alone over standard therapy.

In  comparison  to  paclitaxel/cisplatin,  the  corresponding  carboplatin-containing  regimen  showed generally comparable results with respect to survival criteria but a better non-haematological toxicity profile and in a single study a better QoL. Thus paclitaxel/carboplatin may be considered a preferable first-line therapy for women with advanced ovarian cancer.

In comparison to paclitaxel monotherapy (200 mg/m 2 over 24 h), OS (25.9 vs 26.3 months) and PFS (10.8 vs 14.1 months) are longer for combination paclitaxel/cisplatin. In comparison to paclitaxel/platinum,  cisplatin  monotherapy  (100  mg/m 2 )  or  carboplatin  monotherapy  (AUC  5  or  6) lead to comparable survival and progression-free survival times.

## New combinations

New combinations using gemcitabine, topotecan 1 or  anthracyclines are  currently  being  investigated. To date, only one full report has been published comparing paclitaxel/carbopatin with paclitaxel/epirubicin/carboplatin.  However,  only  results  of  response  are  available  CR  55%  vs.  65% respectively; survival results are still awaited.

## Clinical safety

Paclitaxel  has  been  in  clinical  use  for  more  than  10 years  for  treatment  of  patients  with  ovarian carcinoma,  breast  carcinoma,  NSCLC,  and  AIDS-related  Kaposi's  sarcoma.  Its  safety  profile  has remained consistent  and  is  well  known,  being  summarised  in  various  standard  manuals  and  review articles  (Eisenhauer  &amp;  Vermorken  1998,  Dollery  1999,  Fan  1999,  Ginsberg  et  al.  1997,  Sweetman 2002,  Spencer  &amp;  Faulds  1994,  Sweetman  2002,  Wiseman  &amp;  Spencer  1998).  The  most  common adverse  events  are  neutropenia,  anaemia,  peripheral  neuropathy,  myalgia/arthralgia,  mucositis,  and alopecia (Wiseman &amp; Spencer 1998). In addition, thrombocytopenia, infection, cardiovascular events, hepatic  abnormalities  (increases  in  bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase,  aspartate  aminotransferase)  mild gastrointestinal effects, and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported (Eisenhauer &amp; Vermorken 1998,  Spencer  &amp;  Faulds  1994).  Detailed  clinical  safety  data  from  the  publications  of  the  pivotal studies with Taxol in ovarian cancer and NSCLC and supportive safety data from literature review on on paclitaxel-containing combinations in 20 additional studies are provided in section 8.

1 At least two-phase III studies are currently ongoing, comparing paclitaxel/carboplatin with paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by topotecan or paclitaxel/carboplatin with paclitaxel/carboplatin/gemcitabine (Du Bois et al. 2003a).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The severity of neutropenia, febrile neuropenia, alopecia, and peripheral neurotoxicity was significantly greater (p ≤ 0.05), in the paclitaxel/cisplatin group. Although neutropenia of grade 3 and 4 developed  in  the  majority  of  women  in  the  paclitaxel/cisplatin  group,  the  incidence  of  febrile neutropenia  was  low  and  was  consistent  with  the  brevity  of  paclitaxel-induced  myelosuppression. Peripheral  neurotoxicity  was  more  common  in  the  paclitaxel  group  but  overall  was  very  mild.  As expected,  substantially  more  patients  in  the  paclitaxel/cisplatin  group  experienced  severe  myalgia, neurosensory and neuromotor symptoms, alopecia, and hypersensitivity reactions.

In  summary,  myelosuppression  (particularly  neutropenia,  leukopenia)  was  the  most  frequently reported haematological adverse event and occurred with all paclitaxel-containing regimens. Neuropathy (both sensory and motor), arthralgia/myalgia, asthenia, and alopecia (mainly grade 1 to 2) were  the  most  frequently  observed  non-haematological  adverse  events  with  paclitaxel-containing regimens. Neurological toxicity occurred significantly more often with high-dose single agent cisplatin compared to high-dose single agent paclitaxel. Inconsistent results were obtained with paclitaxel/cisplatin  versus  cisplatin  monotherapy:  in  one  study  paclitaxel/cisplatin  was  superior  to cisplatin  with  regard  to  neurotoxicity  while  in  another  investigation  cisplatin  was  superior  to  the doublet regimen.  Furthermore,  in  several  studies  paclitaxel/carboplatin  was  associated  with  a  lower incidence  of  neuropathy  in  comparison  with  paclitaxel/cisplatin  but  various  authors  observed  no significant  differences  between  both  treatments.  Nausea/vomiting  and  diarrhoea  were  the  most frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse events with paclitaxel-containing regimens. Significantly more  patients  experienced  nausea  and  vomiting  with  cisplatin  monotherapy  compared  to  the paclitaxel/cisplatin. Paclitaxel/carboplatin showed a better tolerability than paclitaxel/cisplatin for nonhaematological toxicities.

The  majority  of  the  reported  adverse  events  were  labelled  such  as  hypersensitivity  reactions, haematological  toxicity,  nervous  system  disorders  (i.e.  neuropathy  and  encephalopathy),  and  nail changes. There were 33 reported adverse events, which are not listed in the currently approved SPC, which  were  addressed  during  the  assessment  of  renewal.  Subsequently,  the  SPC  has  been  update accordingly.

Post-marketing experience In the United States, paclitaxel is approved as Onxol (paclitaxel) Injection by IVAX; the product is identical to Paxene (paclitaxel) Injection, distributed by IVAX in Europe (IVAX Research Inc. 2003). For Onxol in total 12 Quarterly Adverse Drug Experience Reports are available, covering the period from  15/9/00  to  14/903.  During  this  3-year  period  the  MAH  received  a  total  of  80  adverse  events reports from approximately 30,000 to 40,000 patients exposed to Onxol. The  marketing  of  Paxene  started  in  May  2004.  All  previous  PSURs  submitted  to  the  EMEA  were based on published data and Onxol only. In  the  renewal  of  the  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Paxene  submitted  in  April  2004 (EMEA/H/C/216/R/22), the 7 th PSUR (which covered the period from July 1999 to January 2004 and also included the USA data from January 2000 to December 2003) summarised a total of 113 cases of adverse  events  from  a  total  estimated  patient  exposure  of  approximately  77,000  patients.  Fourteen were  spontaneous  reports  received  by  Ivax  Pharmaceuticals  from  healthcare  professionals  and  the remaining 99 cases identified from the literature. Fifty-three cases were considered to be serious and 8 had a fatal outcome. Twenty-two serious unlabelled adverse events were reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall,  based  on  the  cumulative  data  collected  in  the  respective  periods,  the  safety  profile  of paclitaxel is considered to be acceptable.

## Benefit -Risk assessment

Based primarily on the  data  from  two  pivotal  BMS  studies  (B-MS  CA139-022  and  B-MS  CA139209), in which the superiority of paclitaxel/cisplatin over cyclophosphamide/cisplatin was demonstrated, paclitaxel/cisplatin has become the accepted standard first-line therapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer or with residual disease. Subsequent studies in which paclitaxel/cisplatin has been  evaluated  support  the  pivotal  BMS  data  and  confirm  that  paclitaxel-containing  combinations, paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin, produce a favourable treatment response, improvement

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  survival,  and  progression-free  survival  in  patients  with  advanced  ovarian  cancer.  Therefore paclitaxel plus cisplatin is still considered as first-line therapy in ovarian cancer.

Myelosuppression (particularly neutropenia, leukopenia) was the most frequently reported haematological adverse event and occurred with all paclitaxel-containing regimens. Neuropathy (both sensory and motor), arthralgia/myalgia, asthenia, and alopecia (mainly grade 1 to 2) were the  most frequently observed non-haematological adverse events with paclitaxel-containing regimens. Neurological  toxicity occurred significantly more  often  with  high-dose single agent cisplatin compared to high-dose single agent paclitaxel.

Based  on  the  pivotal  paclitaxel  studies,  and  the  subsequent  literature,  the  efficacy  of  paclitaxel  in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of patients with advanced carcinoma of the ovary or with residual disease (&gt; 1 cm) after initial laparotomy (first line chemotherapy) has been demonstrated. The CHMP considered the benefit/risk profile of paclitaxel in the proposed indication is acceptable.
