## Antiviral activity in vitro

The susceptibility of atazanavir was examined against single clinical isolates from subtypes A to G of the HIV-1 M group, as well as one primary strain from group O. The anti HIV activities of atazanavir were performed using PBMC cells infected with these clinical isolates. Atazanavir exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all 8 primary isolates tested, with EC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 6.9 nM. The anti-HIV activities of atazanavir were also measured against 4 isolates of HIV-2, with EC50 values ranging from 1.9 to 3.2 nM.

A further analysis of clinical isolates was performed using recombinant viruses generated from virus from individuals involved in atazanavir clinical studies AI424007, AI424008 and AI424034. Subtype B  was  the  most  prevalent  subtype,  representing  174  (74%)  of  the  isolates  evaluated.  The  range  of atazanavir susceptibilities for subtype B isolates was  0.3 to 6.5.  The  non-B subtypes had susceptibilities ranging from 0.4 to 1.8, well within the range of protease susceptibilities observed for subtype B isolates (Table 1). These results indicate that atazanavir susceptibility is retained not only among B subtype viruses, but also viruses of the other subtypes.

## In vitro resistance

## In vitro selection of resistance from WT HIV-1 virus

Three  HIV-1  strains  (RF,  LAI,  NL4-3)  were  passaged  in  MT-2  cells  in  the  presence  of  increasing concentrations of atazanavir. Breakthrough virus was first observed by viral-induced cytopathic effect that  was  subsequently  confirmed  by  drug  susceptibility  analysis.  Table  2.1  provides  more  detailed information concerning the in vitro selection of resistance from WT HIV-1 virus.

Following 1 month of passage in drug concentrations up to 25 nM, the RF strain of HIV-1 showed a 4-fold  decrease  in  susceptibility  to  atazanavir  (Table  2.1).  This  virus  contained  a  single  N88S substitution  in  the  protease  gene.  Additional  substitutions  accumulated  with  time  and  increased atazanavir concentrations as shown. LAI and NL4-3 viruses with reduced susceptibility to atazanavir took longer to break through, but viral variants did appear with prolonged drug selection. The LAI viruses that emerged at 2.6 and 4.7 months displayed 36- and 93-fold decreases in susceptibility to atazanavir, respectively. The NL4-3 viruses selected at 3.9 and 6 months post initiation of treatment displayed 4.6- and 96-fold reductions in susceptibility to atazanavir, respectively (Table 2.1).

## In vitro cross resistance of clinical isolates resistant to other drugs

A  panel  of  950  HIV-1  recombinant  clinical  isolates  were  profiled  for  their  susceptibility  to amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir and atazanavir. The in vitro cross-resistance to clinical isolates resistant to other compounds of same drug class is summarised in Table 2.2.

## DE NOVO MUTATIONS IN PATIENTS FAILING ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR

## De novo mutations in treatment experienced patients failing atazanavir/ritonavir

De  novo mutations  in  treatment-experienced  patients  failing  therapy  are  presented  in  Table  3.1  by frequency  (i.e.  &gt;  20  %  or  10%  to  20%)  followed  by  a  short  description  of  correlation  observed between specific mutations and change in phenotypic sensitivity.

| Frequency   | de novo PI substitutions (n = 35) a, b                |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| > 20%       | M36, M46, I54, A71, V82                               |

- a Number of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/ml).

b Ten  patients  had  baseline  phenotypic  resistance  to  atazanavir  +  ritonavir  (fold  change  [FC]  &gt;  5.2).    FC susceptibility  in  cell  culture  relative  to  the  wild-type  reference  was  assayed  using  PhenoSense  (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, California, USA).

Viral resistance profiles were consistent with prior resistance assessments of antiretroviral-experienced atazanavir-treated patients who subsequently had virologic failure. Baseline phenotypic resistance to atazanavir, ritonavir and lopinavir were low in both treatment regimens. Few on-study substitutions occurred in viral strains from these subjects with virologic failure. De novo mutations emerged at a frequency of &gt; 20% in a minority of virologic failure subjects. Five substitutions emerged de novo in &gt; 20% of subjects and none of these substitutions are specific to atazanavir. A greater number of de novo substitutions were present in 10% to 20% of subjects. Similar to the more frequently observed substitutions,  none  are  specific  to  atazanavir.  These  new  substitutions  may  reflect  re-emergence  of archived resistance on atazanavir + ritonavir in Study AI424045 treatment-experienced population.

## De novo mutations in treatment naïve patients failing atazanavir/ritonavir

In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naïve patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution for  atazanavir.  Resistance  levels  to  atazanavir  ranged  from  3.5-  to  29-fold  without  evidence  of phenotypic  cross  resistance  to  other  PIs.  In  clinical  trials  of  antiretroviral  treatment  naive  patients treated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline PI substitutions.  The  N88S  substitution  has  been  rarely  observed  in  patients  with  virologic  failure  on atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to atazanavir when it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does not always lead to phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical efficacy.

| Frequency   | de novo PI substitution (n=26) a   |

a Number of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/ml.

The M184I/V substitution emerged in 5/26 atazanavir/ritonavir and 7/26 lopinavir/ritonavir virologic failure patients, respectively.
