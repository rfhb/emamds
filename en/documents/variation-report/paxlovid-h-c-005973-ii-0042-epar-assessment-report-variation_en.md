## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 24 March 2023 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic information, based on updated results from studies C4671005 (EPIC-HR), C4671002 (EPIC-SR) and C4671006 (EPIC-PEP) as well as a supplemental report to Pop PK analysis PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323, following the reanalysis of data after the removal of data related to four sites from the Paxlovid data analysis.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## GLP/GCP inspections

This type II variation relies on the outcome of a systematic FDA inspection during the review process of the MAA (after the Emergency Use Authorisation).

## 2. Introduction

Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the coronavirus 19, including the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Inhibition of the M pro  renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein precursors which leads to inhibit viral replication.

Nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir (acting as a PK enhancer) to achieve and maintain exposures greater than the in vitro antiviral EC90 throughout the duration of the dosing interval. Ritonavir is not active against SARS-CoV-2 M pro  and is not expected to have any antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir tablets; ritonavir tablets) is indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID19.

The recommended oral dose is 300 mg PF-07321332 (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) all taken together orally twice daily (BID) for 5 days. The dose is adjusted to PF07321332 (single 150 mg tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) in patients with moderate renal impairment.

The drug product is available as a film-coated tablets containing PF-07321332 (one single strength 150 mg) and film-coated tablets containing ritonavir (one single 100 mg strength).

In the current type II variation, the marketing authorization holder (MAH) proposed to update the Product Information removing data from sites with GCP and data anomaly issues following interactions and correspondence with US FDA and US FDA site inspections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

A new Pop PK analysis of nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) was submitted (Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP41323-Supplement). This analysis follows two type II variations where a Pop-PK model was developed on a limited PK dataset, (please refer to EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008, Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323) and a full PK dataset (please refer to EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0037, Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-Other1463).

Therefore, the methodology used for the PopPK model development and qualification in the current submission is the same as previously described as part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 and EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0037 and will not be detailed in this report (full information contained in assessment reports for these specific variations).

Then, in addition to update a previously developed Pop PK model (without PK data from 2 study sites) an objective of this analysis was to:

- -generate post-hoc predictions of plasma nimatrelvir exposures co-administered with RTV and compute secondary PK parameters as Cmin, Cmax and AUC tau at steady state for adults with COVID-19 in the EPIC-HR study C4671005 (Study 1005), and
- -calculate the percentage of participants achieving Cmin≥ 90% of EC90 for adults with COVID -19 in the EPIC-HR study 1005.

## 3.2. Results

In the EPIC-HR study 1005, 71 participants enrolled (48 in 1 site and 23 in another) accounting for n=210 observations (144 in 1 site and 66 in another) were excluded.

The total PK dataset consisted of 1166 participants, including 150 healthy subjects from Phase 1 studies and 1016 patients from Phase 2/3 study 1005 contributing 4249 PK samples (Table 1).

Final PK parameter estimates with and without exclusion of subjects are provided in Table 2. In comparison to the previous Pop PK model parameter estimates reported in PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 (refer to EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008), the parameter estimates from the updated Pop PK model with exclusion of participants enrolled in the EPICHR Study 1005 did not deviate more than 10%.

The exceptions are for the nCLCR breakpoint (from 70.1 to 84.1 mL/min/1.73 m2), the exponent of the power model for nCLCR effect on CL (from 1.05 to 0.812), and IIV in V2 (from 27.3% to 31.7%) and ka (60.7% to 69.6%). It is anticipated that these chang es would have minimal impact on the nirmatrelvir exposure predictions.

## Model-based simulations

The studied dosing regimen nirmatrelvir/RTV 300 mg/100 mg BID for 5 days was simulated for participants in Study 1005 using the updated Pop PK model and individual's post hoc PK parameters. Table 3 and Table 4 show the predicted nirmatrelvir exposure parameters and the percentage of subjects achieving Cmin \\_ EC90 of 292 ng/mL on Day 1 and Day 5. Predictions based on the Pop PK model without site exclusions are available in Table 3 and Table 4 for references.

In comparison to the previous nirmatrelvir exposure predictions for nirmatrelvir/RTV 300 mg/100 mg reported in PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323, the geometric mean of the predicted Day 5 nirmatrelvir exposure parameters (Cmin, Cmax, AUC t ) using the updated Pop PK model were higher but within the previously reported 10 th and 90 th percentile range. Similar to the previous predictions , &gt;99% of participants in the EPIC-HR Study 1005 following a dose of nirmatrelvir/RTV 300 mg/100 mg BID achieve Cmin \\_ EC90 of 292 ng/mL on Day 1 after the first dose and on Day 5.

## 3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The current report is a supplemental report to PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 and presents the results of updating the final PopPK model PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 by removing data from participants enrolled in 2 sites in the EPIC HR study 1005.

Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-DP4-1323 was submitted as part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 , and the CHMP concluded that the developed PopPK model and model-based simulations were not considered valid. During this submission several critical issues have been raised (High RUV &gt;100%, High Eta -shrinkage &gt;50%, biased pcVPC, exclusion of the RUV during the model -based simulations) and remained unsolved. As part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0037 , where an update PopPK model was submitted, despite significant efforts made by the applicant, these same several critical issues remained and the developed PoPK model was again not considered valid.

Then, it appears obvious that discarding PK data of 71 subjects from the 2 study sites  of study 1005 would have minimal impact on both the fixed and random effects, as demonstrated by the applicant with less than 10% of deviation between PK parameter estimates ( Table 2). Similarly, RUV and eta-shrinkage were slightly decreased (RUV of 134% vs 139% and eta -shr &gt; 54% vs 55%) and diagnostic plots were not provided.

In conclusion, given the preceding as part of this submission, the proposed PopPK model and modelbased simulations are not considered valid. Therefore, the MAH was asked, in the first round, to delete the predicted exposure metrics at steady-state (model-based simulations) from patients of EPIC-HR reported in section 5.2 of the SmPC. This was agreed and the SmPC has been revised according to this recommendation.

## 4. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 4.1. Methods - analysis of submitted data

The pivotal clinical development for the treatment of non-hospitalized, symptomatic adult participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illnesses was supported by one Phase 2/3 trial: Study C4671005 (abbreviated Study 1005).

During the clinical study conduct of Study 1002, Pfizer conducted an audit and noted that a site not reported to the US FDA was used for data collection and that the Principal Investigator's (PI) oversight of the study was inadequate. Pfizer decided to terminate this site for GCP noncompliance and participants were transferred to another site. The termination of the site from Study 1002 in common with Study 1005 was previously communicated in the interim Study 1002 CSR dated 16 June 2022 and in both the interim 1005 and in LPLV CSR's, dated 21 November 2021 and 6 June 2022, respectively submitted to the US FDA and EMA. The US FDA also inspected this site and following the inspection requested that all clinical and safety data from this site be excluded from Study 1005 and Study 1002 analyses.

In addition, the US FDA performed a marketing application GCP inspection for studies 1005 and 1002 in 3 sites . The FDA noted unusual patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and/or COVID-19 symptom diary data from these sites. Based on the findings, Pfizer conducted a review of all site data in the Study 1005 and Study 1002 to identify unexpected data patterns related to SARS CoV-2 viral RNA, COVID-19 symptom data, vital signs, adverse events, laboratory safety data, demographics, PK parameter and ECG parameter data. No unusual patterns of symptom diary data were identified. Differences in virology and patient symptom data were observed in 1 site. Pfizer performed an in-depth review of the differences and noted a level of homogeneity between virology results which could not be biologically explained. The data differences in virology and symptom data were assessed and determined to not be the result of vendor or technical issues. Pfizer performed a review of safety laboratory data, and this review did not identify any concerns. Based on a review of data from all sites, Pfizer identified no additional sites with unusual data patterns.

Following interactions and correspondence with US FDA and US FDA site inspections, a decision was made to remove data from the analysis for 2 sites (1 site due to GCP noncompliance and 1 site due to data anomaly issues) in Study 1005. Of note, data from the analysis were removed for 4 sites in Study C4671002 (abbreviated Study 1002), and 2 sites in Study C4671006.

Reanalysis of the data was performed without data from the excluded sites (including those participants who transferred to another site) for Study 1005.

## 4.2. Results

The following section presents the main results before and after the exclusion of the sites in order to compare the changes removing the data.

N=number of participants in the analysis set.

The cumulative proportion of participants hospitalised for the treatment of COVID-19 or death during the first 28 days of the study was estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method. The difference of the proportions in the 2 treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval, and p -value based on Normal approximation of the data are presented.

a. Average time at risk for event is computed as time for first event, or time to last day of participation, or Day 28, whichever is earlier.

b. Average study follow-up is computed as time to last day of participation, or Day 28, whichever is earlier.

Participants enrolled at sites (including those switched) are excluded.

## 4.3. Discussion

The pivotal clinical development of Paxlovid was based on a single Phase 2/3 trial conducted in participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe disease: Study C467-1005. Two additional studies were also conducted by the MAH: Study C4671002 (treatment of participants with COVID-19 who are at low risk of progressing to severe illness) and Study C4671006 (preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult household contacts of individuals with symptomatic COVID19). These studies are out of the scope of the current indication and did not meet the primary endpoints, therefore they are not considered further.

Following the MAH's audit of a study site during the conduct of the Study 1002 (this study site was common to both Study 1005 and Study 1002), and a US FDA routine marketing application GCP inspection for studies 1005 and 1002, 2 sites included in Study 1005 were identified by US FDA as presenting major issues.

Considering that there were no apparent signs towards a systemic nature of the issues identified and that it was rather judged that the inadequacy of the study process was confined to the 2 sites, it was decided to remove the data from the two sites. This removal was anticipated as being of limited impact on the study results considering the total number of sites (2 sites among n=343) and the total number of participants (133 participants among N=2246).

The results after the sites exclusion are largely consistent with the results on the totality of the data, and efficacy outcomes are only marginally impacted by removing the data. No case of death was removed from the results in mITT as well as in mITT1 (mITT1 is considered as the population of interest). However, 2 cases of hospitalization due do COVID-19 were coming from the 2 identified sites in the mITT1. Nonetheless, the size effect as well as the 95% confidence interval remain very close: the estimated difference from placebo in proportion of participants with COVID-19-related-hospitalization or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

death from any cause through day 28 in mITT1 was 5.522 (95%CI: -7.122, -3.923) before sites exclusion, and 5.638 (95%CI: -7.308, -3.967) after sites exclusion.

Therefore, it is acceptable to update the Product Information with results after sites exclusion. However, considering that study site was not a stratification factor at randomisation, some blocks of randomisation may be incomplete. Thus, the information indicating that data from 2 sites were removed after completion of the study should be mentioned in describing Study C4671005 in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 5. Clinical Safety aspects

## 5.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The datasets used to determine ADR frequencies for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were Studies C4671005 (LPLV), C4671002 (LPLV), and C4671006 (LPLV) with data from the aforementioned sites excluded (Section 2.5). These 3 data sets consisted of a total of 3515 participants who were treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2585 participants who received placebo.

The ADR is coded based on MedDRA, Version 25.0. Based on the determination of ADR frequencies with the site exclusions and the inclusion of final C4671002 data, the frequencies for Hypersensitivity, Anaphylaxis, Dysgeusia, Headache, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal Pain, Malaise, and Hypertension have been updated. However, based on these updates there were no changes to frequency category for any of the ADRs.

## 5.2. Results

An overview of the ADR frequencies and categories are provided in Table 6 and Table 7.

Across the 3 studies, 3515 participants received a dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2585 participants received a dose of placebo. The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 1% incidence in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group and occurring at a greater frequency than in the placebo group) were dysgeusia (5.9% and 0.4%, respectively) and diarrhoea (2.9% and 1.9%, respectively).

## 5.3. Discussion

The safety reanalysis was based on the subjects included in studies C4671005, C4671002, and C4671006 with data from the aforementioned sites excluded and included a dataset of 3515 subjects treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2585 participants who received placebo. In comparison, the latest safety analysis used a safety pool including both studies C4671005, C4671002 and C4671006 with a total of 3643 participants who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 2668 participants who received placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the safety profile remains consistent between the primary safety analysis and the reanalysis, with no changes of frequency category for the ADRs. The impact of the exclusion of the identified sites for the analysis of the safety profile of Paxlovid is minor.

The PI has been slightly modified with the updated ADRs frequencies of dysgeusia (4.6 %), diarrhoea (3.0 %) , headache (1.2 %) and vomiting (1.2%) based on the frequency reported in the pivotal study C4671005, which is endorsed. For consistency with the assessment of the variation II/0026/G (i.e., not supporting that the population included in studies C4671005, C4671002 and C4671006 was homogeneous considering that study C4671002 targeted a population at standard risk ,and C4671006 a population for a post exposure prophylaxis with a treatment duration up to 10 days while the current indication is the high risk population with a treatment duration of 5 days, the ADR frequencies of the pivotal study C4671005 were used in section 4.8 of the SmPC instead of the pooled safety data for the ADRs already identified during the MAA, and the pooled safety data was used for the frequency of new emerging ADRs. The safety profile from these 3 studies was comparable which support the use of the pooled data for the estimation of ADR frequency for new emerging ADRs. Nevertheless since 'vomiting' was already identified as an ADR in the pivotal study targeting the intended population and treatment duration, the frequency should remain 'common'.

## 6. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The pivotal clinical development for the treatment of non-hospitalized, symptomatic adult participants with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illnesses was supported by one Phase 2/3 trial: Study C4671005 (abbreviated Study 1005).

Following interactions and correspondence with the US FDA and US FDA site inspections, a decision was made to remove data from the analysis for 2 sites (1 site  due to GCP noncompliance and 1 site  due to data anomaly issues) in Study C4671005.

This Type II variation includes a reanalysis of the data performed without data from the excluded sites (including those participants who transferred to another site )  for Study 1005, accordingly with identified site by US FDA.

Similarly, from a clinical pharmacology perspective, the MAH submitted a Pop-PK analysis (Report PMAREQDD-C467a-DP4-1323-Supplement), developed without PK data collected in patients from the excluded sites from Study 1005.

This analysis is an update of a Pop-PK model (Report PMAR-EQDD-C467a-1323) submitted as part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 where the CHMP considered that the Pop-PK model and model-based simulations were not valid / reliable. Therefore, the same limitation raised as part of EMEA/H/C/005973/II/0008 remains in this current submission. Consequently, the applicant was asked to delete the predicted exposure metrics (model-based simulations) from patients of EPIC-HR reported in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

Overall, the updated clinical results with excluded sites are consistent with the results submitted at the time of the marketing authorization. It is thus agreed to update the Product Information accordingly. The MAH was requested to mention the sites exclusion in section 5.1 of the SmPC. This reference was included.
