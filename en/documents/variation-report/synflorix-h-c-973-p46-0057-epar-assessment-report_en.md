## 1. Introduction

On June 29, 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study, as well as an extension study, for Synflorix in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The study has not been conducted in accordance with the agreed Synflorix investigation plan.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Synflorix and therefore no amendments to the product information have been identified.

A short critical expert overview of each study has been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002; 'A phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine coadministered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants when administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age'.

Study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-004 BST:002; 'A phase II, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine as a booster dose in children aged 12 to 18 months, previously primed with the same vaccine in the primary vaccination study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002 (112157)'. Study DTPa-HBV-IPV=HibMenC-TT-004 BST:002 is the extension of study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002, to assess booster vaccination in children aged 12 to 18 months.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The study vaccine was a combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine. This new combination vaccine is prepared by extemporaneous mixing of the DTPa-HBV-IPV vaccine ( Infanrix penta ) with the HibMenC-TT vaccine ( Menitorix ). The combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine ( Infanrix hexa ) and meningococcal serogroup C vaccine ( Menjugate ) were used as active controls. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( Synflorix ) and human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine ( Rotarix ) were used as coadministered vaccines.

In both studies, Synflorix was administered using the currently approved formulation.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH has initiated the development of a combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Hib and group C meningococcal diseases. This clinical trial was the first to assess the immunogenicity and safety of this investigational DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine compared to the licensed DTPa- HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa) and meningococcal serogroup C vaccine ( Menjugate) when administered to infants at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH submitted final reports for:

-  Study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002; 'A phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenCTT vaccine coadministered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants when administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.

## 2.3.2. Clinical studies

## Study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002

'A phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine coadministered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants when administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age'.

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

Primary

-  To demonstrate that GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is non-inferior to GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine co-administered with Novartis' meningococcal serogroup C vaccine, in terms of seroprotection to MenC one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.

Non-inferiority for MenC will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [HexaMnC minus Hepta] in the percentage of seroprotected subjects is ≤ 10%.

-  To demonstrate that GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is non-inferior to GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine co-administered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in terms of seroprotection to Hib one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.

Non-inferiority for Hib will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [HexaPn minus Hepta] in percentage of seroprotected subjects is ≤ 10%.

## Secondary

-  To demonstrate that GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is non-inferior to GSK

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine co-administered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in terms of seroprotection to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, and in terms of concentration of antibodies to pertussis one month after the third dose of primary vaccination.

Non-inferiority with regard to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliovirus will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [HexaPn minus Hepta] in percentage of seroprotected subjects is ≤ 10%. Non-inferiority with regard to pertussis antigens will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the GMC ratio [HexaPn divided by Hepta] is &lt; 1.5.

-  To assess the immunological response to the study vaccines in terms of seroprotection/seropositivity, geometric mean concentrations/titres to all antigens and in terms of vaccine response to pertussis antigens.
-  To assess the pre-vaccination immunological status to MenC and Hib.
-  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine coadministered with GSK Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in terms of solicited, unsolicited, local and general symptoms and serious adverse events.

## Study design

This was a phase 2, open-label, randomised, multicenter study in healthy infants receiving a threedose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age conducted in Poland. There were three parallel groups:

-  Hepta group: three doses of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT and three doses of 10Pn-PD-DiT ( Synflorix ) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.
-  HexaMnC group: three doses of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib ( Infanrix hexa ) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age, and two doses of Novartis' meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine ( Menjugate ) at 3 and 4 months of age.
-  HexaPn group: three doses of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib ( Infanrix hexa ) and three doses of 10PnPD-DiT ( Synflorix ) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.
-  Subjects in all groups also received Rotavirus Vaccine ( Rotarix ) at 2 and 3 months of age.

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion

Healthy male or female infant aged between 8 and 12 weeks at the time of first vaccination, born after a gestation period between 36 and 42 weeks who had received one dose of hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine at birth according to the local recommendations. The subject should not have had diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio, Hib, pneumococcal and/or MenC vaccination or disease(s). Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/legally acceptable representative (LAR) of the subject before entry into the study.

## Treatments

The target sample size was 420 enrolled subjects (140 per group) in order to reach 378 evaluable subjects (126 per group) at the time of the analysis.

The randomisation was performed at GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, using MATEX, a programme developed by GSK Biologicals for use in SAS® (Cary, NC, USA).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To allow GSK Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than anticipated at individual centres in this multicentre study, and to thus reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over-randomisation of supplies was prepared.

The vaccine doses were distributed to the study centre while respecting the randomisation block size.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoints

Immunogenicity one month after the third dose of primary vaccination:

-  Anti-PRP seroprotection status
-  rSBA-MenC seroprotection status

## Secondary endpoints

Immunogenicity one month after the third dose of primary vaccination:

-  Anti-PRP, rSBA-MenC, anti-PSC, anti-tetanus, anti-diphtheria, anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN, anti-HBs, anti- poliovirus type 1, anti-poliovirus type 2, anti- poliovirus type 3 and antipneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F and protein D antibody concentrations or titres, and seroprotection or seropositivity status.
-  Vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN.

Immunogenicity before the first dose of primary vaccination:

-  Anti-PRP, rSBA-MenC, anti-PSC, PT, FHA and PRN antibody concentrations or titres.

## Statistical Methods

The primary analysis was based on the According to protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. If, for any group, the percentage of enrolled subjects with serological results excluded from this ATP cohort was 5% or more, a second analysis based on the total vaccinated cohort was to be performed to complement the ATP analysis. The analysis of safety was based on the Total vaccinated cohort. Since less than 5% of the vaccinated subjects in each group were eliminated, the analysis on the ATP safety cohort was not done.

## Derived and transformed data

-  A seronegative subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was below the defined assay cut-off.
-  A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to the defined assay cut-off. The following seropositivity thresholds were applicable:
- o anti-PT, anti-FHA or anti-PRN antibody concentrations ≥ 5 EL.U/mL
- o anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 3.3 mIU/mL
- o anti-PSC antibody concentrations ≥ 0.3 µg/mL
- o anti-pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F antibody concentrations ≥ 0.05 µg/mL
- o anti-PD antibody concentrations ≥ 100 EL.U/mL
-  A seroprotected subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to the level defining clinical protection. The following seroprotection thresholds were applicable:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/mL
- o rSBA-MenC antibody titres ≥ 8
- o anti-diphtheria or anti-tetanus antibody concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL
- o anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL
- o anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody titres ≥ 8
-  The following other cut-offs were also used:
- o anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 1 µg/mL
- o anti-PSC antibody concentrations ≥ 2 µg/mL
- o anti-pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 µg/mL
-  Vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN, was defined as appearance of antibodies in subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e. with concentrations &lt; cut-off value) or at least maintenance of pre-vaccination antibody concentrations in subjects who were initially seropositive (i.e. with concentrations ≥ cut-off value), taking into consideration the decreasing maternal antibodies.
-  Vaccine response to MenC, was defined as antibody titres ≥ 1:32 for initially seronegative subjects or a ≥ 4-fold increase in post-primary vaccination antibody titres, for initially seropositive subjects.
-  The GMT/ GMC calculations were performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log10 titre/ concentration transformations. Antibody titres/concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT/GMC calculation.

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 421 subjects were enrolled in the study after having been checked for the inclusion and exclusion criteria; for details refer to table 1.

Of the 421 subjects vaccinated in this study, 413 subjects completed the study and eight subjects were withdrawn from the study.

The reasons for withdrawal of the subjects were as follows:

-  One subject in the Hepta group was withdrawn from the study as a result of a SAE.
-  The parents/LARs of seven subjects (two in the Hepta group, three in the HexaMnC group and two in the HexaPn group) withdrew consent. None of these consent withdrawals was due to an adverse event.

## Immunogenicity results

The primary analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. Since at least 5% of the subjects with available immunogenicity data in a given group were excluded from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, the analysis on total vaccinated cohort was also performed to complement the ATP analysis. Immunogenicity analysis of the total vaccinated cohort yielded similar results as the ATP cohort analysis and are not further presented in this report.

## Immune response to the Heptavalent vaccine

## Primary Objectives (Non-inferiority in terms of anti-PRP and anti-rSBA-MenC response)

Anti-PRP response

The seroprotection rates, the percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 µg/mL, and anti-PRP GMCs at the pre- and post-primary vaccination time points are presented in Table 3.

## One month post-primary vaccination:

-  The immune response of the heptavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine coadministered with Synflorix was demonstrated to be non-inferior to that of Infanrix hexa co-administered with Synflorix in terms of seroprotection rate against Haemophilus influenzae type b, as the upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (HexaPn group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of seroprotected subjects was below 10%, the predefined clinical limit for non-inferiority.
-  Seroprotection rates to PRP were 100% in the Hepta group, 93.2% in the HexaMnC group and 99.2% in the HexaPn group.
-  The percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 1 µg/mL was 90.5% in the Hepta group, 52.3% in the HexaMnC group and 64.1% in the HexaPn group.
-  Anti-PRP GMCs were 4.255 µg/mL in the Hepta group, 1.123 µg/mL in the HexaMnC group and 1.721 µg/mL in the HexaPn group.

## Assessor´s comment

Seroprotection rates to PRP were higher in the Hepta and HexaPn groups, respectively, compared to the HexaMnC group. This difference might potentially be explained by the fact that Synflorix was coadministered in the Hepta and HexaPn groups but not in the HexaMnC group, as Synflorix is previously known to have the ability to increase the anti-PRP response (refer to EPAR:

EMEA/H/C/000973/P46/040 for details). The positive effect by Synflorix on the anti-PRP response might potentially also be reflected in the generally higher levels of anti-PRP antibody concentrations and anti-PRP GMCs in the Hepta group than the other two groups.

No further regulatory action is required based on these results regarding Synflorix

## rSBA-MenC response

The seroprotection rates, percentage of subjects with titres ≥ 1:128, and GMTs for rSBAMenC antibodies at the pre- and post-primary vaccination time points are presented in Table 4. Subjects in the HexaPn group did not receive a MenC vaccine and therefore only the results of the Hepta and Hexa MenC groups are discussed.

## One month post-primary vaccination:

-  The immune response of the heptavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine was demonstrated to be non-inferior to Menjugate co-administered with Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection rate for rSBA MenC, as the upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (HexaMnC group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of seroprotected subjects was below 10%, the predefined clinical limit for non-inferiority.
-  Seroprotective rSBA-MenC antibody titres ≥ 1:8 were observed in 98.4% of subjects in the Hepta group and 97.7% of subjects in the HexaMnC group.
-  High percentages (94.4% in the Hepta group and 97.7% in the HexaMnC group) of subjects exhibited anti-rSBA-MenC titres ≥ 1:128. rSBA-MenC GMTs were 786.9 µg/mL in the Hepta group and 2674 µg/mL in the HexaMnC group.

## Secondary objectives (Non-inferiority in terms of anti-tetanus, anti-diphtheria, antipertussis, anti-HBs and anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 response)

The non-inferiority of the immune response of the heptavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib- MenC-TT vaccine co-administered with Synflorix (Hepta group) to that of Infanrix hexa co-administered with Synflorix (HexaPn group) concerning the secondary endpoints was assessed in a sequential manner according to the ranking: tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis B and the three poliovirus types. A conclusion on one objective was only possible if the primary objective and all objectives with a lower rank were demonstrated before.

## One month post-primary vaccination:

-  Non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates against tetanus and diphtheria was demonstrated since the upper limits of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

differences (HexaPn group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of seroprotected subjects were below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for noninferiority.

-  The upper limit of the 95% CI on the GMC ratio (HexaPn group divided by Hepta group) was below 1.5, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority, in terms of immune response to PT and FHA. The upper limit of the 95% CI on the GMC ratio for anti-PRN was 1.57, and exceeded the pre-defined non-inferiority margin. Therefore non-inferiority in terms of pertussis immune response was not demonstrated.
-  For hepatitis B, the upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (HexaPn group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of seroprotected subjects was below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority. However since non-inferiority for the higher ranking anti-pertussis antibodies was not demonstrated, non-inferiority for hepatitis B could not be concluded.
-  For hepatitis B, the upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (HexaPn group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of subjects with post-vaccination antiHBs concentrations ≥100 mIU/mL as measured by ELISA was below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority. (Note that this is a post-hoc analysis, which is not part of the primary analysis.) (Amended: 14 January 2014)
-  For poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, the upper limits of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (HexaPn group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of seroprotected subjects were all below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for noninferiority. However since non-inferiority for the higher ranking anti-pertussis antibodies was not demonstrated, noninferiority for the three polioviruses could not be concluded

## Assessor´s comment

The primary objectives of the present study were met; i.e. the non-inferiority of the study vaccine, coadministered with Synflorix , to Infanrix hexa and Menjugate regarding immune response to PRP and MenC was shown. Concerning the secondary objectives, the non-inferiority of the study vaccine coadministered with Synflorix to Infanrix hexa co-administered with Synflorix was shown for seroprotection rates to tetanus and diphtheria. Regarding the pertussis antigens, hepatitis B and the three poliovirus types, non-inferiority could not be concluded.

No further regulatory action is required regarding Synflorix based on these results.

## Immune response to the co-administered 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine

The geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of antibodies against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) and the percentage of subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations ≥ the assay cut-off of 0.05 µg/mL and ≥ the threshold value of 0.20 µg/mL, one month post-primary vaccination are presented in Table 6.

Subjects in the HexaMnC group did not receive a pneumococcal vaccine and therefore only the results of the Hepta and HexaPn groups are discussed.

One month post-primary vaccination:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The percentage of subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations ≥ the threshold value of 0.20 µg/mL was at least 97.6% for all serotypes except 6B (74.8%) and 23F (81.4%).
-  All subjects but one had measurable antibodies against protein D (≥ 100 EL.U/mL).

Exploratory group comparisons indicated that the GMCs against serotype 18C in the Hepta group were significantly higher than those in HexaPn group. 18C is the serotype conjugated to TT.

Assessor´s comment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

97.6% of subjects in the Hepta group had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL for all pneumococcal serotypes included in Synflorix, except 6B and 23F. These results are in line with previous study results of Synflorix , demonstrating a lower immune response to serotypes 6B and 23F. Consequently, no further action based on these results are required.

## Additional analysis (Amended 14 January 2014)

A risk was identified that subjects whose post-vaccination titres were initially measured between 10 and 100 mIU/mL might have been informed of an incorrect seroprotection status. Individual seroprotection of the study subjects was reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the seroprotection status at other available time-points. Retesting was performed as an urgent precaution using a commercial assay used for routine testing. The results of that retesting, were communicated to the investigators to allow individual counselling of the impacted study subjects or their parents/legally authorized representatives, including revaccination when appropriate. Since the testing was only performed on a limited number of subjects based on an individual need, and since the assay has not been validated by GSK Biologicals for the purpose of clinical research, the results of that testing were not taken into account for study analyses.

One month post-dose 3, three subjects had anti- HBs antibody concentrations which were initially measured between 10 and 100 mIU/mL.

For one subject, the results of anti-HBs retesting were above 10 mIU/mL showing that this subject was seroprotected. Since no change in seroprotection status was found, no other actions were taken.

For two other subjects, the results of anti-HBs retesting could not be determined since an insufficient quantity of the sample was available, suggesting that the subjects might not be seroprotected. This was communicated to the investigator on 22 November 2012 to allow individual counselling.

As per follow-up information from the investigator, one subject had an additional blood collection on 8 May 2013, with a result of anti-HBs antibody concentrations of 0.08 mlU/mL. The subject returned to the site for revaccination on 10 May 2013.

One subject had an additional blood collection on 24 June 2013, with a result of anti-HBs antibody concentrations of 572 mlU/mL. Since no change in seroprotection status was found, no other actions were taken.

## Serious adverse events

No deaths were reported during this study. Non-fatal SAEs were reported for a total of 14 subjects during the entire study period. Among these, five subjects belonged to the Hepta group, six subjects were from the HexaMnC group and three were from the HexaPn group. One of these SAEs belonging to the Hepta group was considered to be potentially related to vaccination by the investigator. Eight days after the third dose of the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT and Synflorix vaccines and 39 days after the second dose of Rotarix , this subject developed thrombocytopenia. On 22 Nov 2009 the subject experienced blood in stools. A few days later the subject developed mild purpuric rash. The subject was treated with immunoglobulins and steroids and the event was reported as resolved 116 days after the onset of symptoms. No SAE was still ongoing at the end of the study.

One subject in the Hepta group had an SAE that led to premature discontinuation of the study vaccines.

## Assessor´s comment

The frequency of AEs reported was approximately the same among the treatment groups (Hepta, HexaMnC and HexaPn). Overall, all the vaccines in the present study seem to have a tolerable safety profile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SAE reported for one subject, i.e. thrombocytopenia, was considered to have a potential causal relationship to the vaccination. As the subject received multiple vaccines, it is difficult to assess the causal relationship of the SAE to individual vaccines, but rather as related to vaccination in general. As the affected subject received Synflorix , it can not be excluded that this was the reason behind the SAE. An increased reactogenicity has previously been seen when Infanrix is co-administered with Synflorix compared to Infanrix given without Synflorix . However, as this was a single event which was resolved with proper treatment, and considering the fact that no causal relationship to a specific vaccine can be established, no new safety concerns are raised based on these results.

## Study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-004 BST:002

A phase II, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine as a booster dose in children aged 12 to 18 months, previously primed with the same vaccine in the primary vaccination study DTPaHBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002 (112157).

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

Primary

-  To demonstrate that GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine is non-inferior to Menjugate co-administered with Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection to MenC one month after the booster dose.

Non-inferiority would be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [MnC-CRM group minus Hepta group] in the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titres ≥ 1:8 is ≤ 10%.

-  To demonstrate that GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine is non-inferior to Infanrix hexa co-administered with NeisVac-C in terms of seroprotection to PRP and MenC, one month after the booster dose.

Non-inferiority would be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [MnC-TT group minus Hepta group] in the percentage of subjects with anti-PRP concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/ml is ≤ 10%.

and

Non-inferiority would be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [MnC-TT group minus Hepta group] in the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titres ≥ 1:8 is ≤ 10%.

## Secondary

-  To demonstrate that GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine is non-inferior to Infanrix hexa co-administered with NeisVac-C in terms of seroprotection to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, and in terms of antibody GMCs to pertussis antigens one month after the booster dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Non-inferiority for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliovirus would be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI on the group difference [MnC-TT Group minus Hepta Group] in the percentage of seroprotected subjects is ≤ 10%

and

Non-inferiority for pertussis antigens would be demonstrated if the UL of the 95% CI on the GMC ratio [MnC-TT Group divided by Hepta Group] is ≤ 1.5.

-  To assess the persistence of the immune response to the study vaccines in terms of seroprotection/seropositivity rates and geometric mean concentrations/titres (GMCs/Ts) for all antigens, before the booster dose.
-  To assess the immune response to the study vaccines in terms of seroprotection/seropositivity, GMCs/Ts to all antigens, in terms of booster response to pertussis antigens and GMC fold change in rSBA-MenC titres and anti-PRP concentrations.
-  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccines in terms of solicited, unsolicited, local and general symptoms and serious adverse events.

## Study design

This was an open-label, controlled, multi-centre study with three parallel groups. It was a booster study following primary vaccination study 112157 (DTPA-HBV-IPV=HIB-MENC-TT-002):

-  Hepta Group (subjects who received the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine and Synflorix in the primary study) - received a booster dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine.
-  MnC-CRM Group (subjects who received Infanrix hexa co-administered with Menjugate in the primary study) - received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa co-administered with Menjugate .
-  MnC-TT Group (subjects who received Infanrix hexa and Synflorix in the primary study) received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa co-administered with NeisVac-C .

Synflorix was administered at Visit 2 to subjects in the Hepta and MnC-TT groups to complete the vaccination schedule started in the primary study but no study endpoints were associated with this vaccine. Blood samples were drawn for all subjects: just before the administration of the booster dose, and approximately one month after the booster dose.

## Immunogenicity results

The analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity. Since, for any vaccine group, not more than 5% of the vaccinated subjects with serological results were eliminated from the Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity, no analyses were performed on the Booster total vaccinated cohort.

Since not all objectives in the primary study (DTPA-HBV-IPV=HIB-MENC-TT-002) were met, formal conclusions on the inferential objectives of the present (booster) study cannot be made. The below sections describe whether the results observed in this study were within the limits for non-inferiority pre-specified in the protocol.

Primary Objectives (Non-inferiority in terms of rSBA-MenC and anti-PRP response)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## One month post-booster vaccination

-  The upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference ( MnC-CRM group minus Hepta group) in terms of MenC seroprotection rates was below 10%, the predefined clinical limit for non-inferiority.
-  The upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference ( MnC-TT group minus Hepta group) in terms of MenC seroprotection rates was below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority.
-  The upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (MnC-TT group minus Hepta group) in terms of PRP seroprotection rates was below 10%, the predefined clinical limit for non-inferiority.

## Assessor´s comment

The primary objectives regarding seroprotection rates of MenC and PRP showed non-inferiority of the study vaccine to the control groups.

## Secondary objectives (Non-inferiority in terms of anti-tetanus, anti-diphtheria, antipertussis, anti-HBs and anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 response)

## One month post-primary vaccination:

-  For diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, the upper limits of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (MnC-TT group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of seroprotected subjects were all below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority.
-  For hepatitis B, the upper limit of the standardised asymptotic 95% CI on the group difference (MnC-TT group minus Hepta group) for the percentage of subjects with post-vaccination antiHBs concentrations ≥100 mIU/mL as measured by ELISA was below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority. (Note that this is a post-hoc analysis, which is not part of the primary analysis.) (Amended: 14 January 2014)
-  The upper limit of the 95% CI on the GMC ratio (MenC-TT group GMC divided by Hepta group GMC) was below 1.5, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority, for anti-PT and anti-FHA GMCs but not for anti-PRN GMCs.

## Assessor´s comment

Regarding the secondary objectives, the predefined non-inferiority criteria for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, the three poliovirus types, and the pertussis components PT (pertussis toxoid) and FHA (filamentous haemagglutinin) were reached. Regarding the third pertussis component PRN (pertactin), pre-defined non-inferiority criteria was not met.

No further regulatory action regarding Synflorix is required based on these results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity conclusions

Since not all the secondary objectives of the primary vaccination trial [112157 (DTPa- HBV-IPV=HibMenC-TT-002)] were met, formal conclusions based on the results of the present booster trial could not be made.

-  The pre-defined non-inferiority criteria for the primary objectives in terms of immune response to MenC and PRP were met.
-  The pre-defined non-inferiority criteria linked to the secondary endpoints of diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 and PT and FHA were met. The pre-defined non-inferiority criterion for PRN was not met.
-  Following the booster dose of the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine (Hepta group), all* subjects were seroprotected against MenC, PRP, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and the three poliovirus types; and all subjects were seropositive for anti-PT, FHA and PRN antibodies.

*For one subject from the Hepta group, the results of anti-HBs retesting were below 10 mIU/mL suggesting that the subject might not be seroprotected (Amended: 14 January 2014).

## Assessor´s comment

The immunogenicity results are generally in accordance with what has been reported from other booster studies. It is not possible to draw any specific conclusions on the immunogenicity of Synflorix based on the results of the present study, as no endpoints regarding this vaccine were included.

## Safety results

All 391 enrolled subjects in this study received the booster dose of their allocated vaccine.

The safety analysis was performed on the Booster total vaccinated cohort since less than 5% of subjects in each group were eliminated for the ATP cohort for safety.

The overall incidence of symptoms (solicited and unsolicited, local and general) reported during the 8day follow-up period after vaccination is presented in Table 14. None of the subjects experienced an adverse event that led to premature discontinuation of the study vaccine or withdrawal of the subject from the study.

-  Redness at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in the three groups (incidence of redness was 50.7%, 57.9% and 57.5% in the Hepta, MnCCRM and MnCTT groups, respectively). Redness was also the most common grade 3 symptom (reported for 14%, 15% and 14.2% of the vaccinees in the Hepta, MnCCRM and MnC-TT groups, respectively).
-  Large injection site reactions (either localized large swelling at the injection site or diffuse swellings not involving the adjacent joint) were reported for 11 subjects (five in the Hepta group, four in the MnC-CRM group and two in the MnC-TT group). All these reactions were limited to the immediate injection area; with a size of 60 to 100 mm. Functional impairment was reported for only one subject (in the MnC-CRM group). This was of intensity 1 (easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities). All subjects recovered without sequelae.

## Solicited general adverse events

The incidence of solicited general symptoms reported during the 8-day follow-up period after booster vaccination, for the Booster total vaccinated cohort is presented in Table 16.

-  Irritability was the most frequently reported general symptom across groups, observed in 47.8%, 48.9% and 55% of subjects in the Hepta, MnC-CRM and MnCTT groups, respectively.
-  The most common grade 3 solicited general symptom in the Hepta and MnC-TT groups was irritability reported for 4.4% and 5.8% of subjects, respectively. In the MnC-CRM group,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- irritability of grade 3 intensity was reported for 1.5% of the subjects. Drowsiness was the second most frequently reported grade 3 adverse event.
-  The majority of solicited general symptoms following booster dose in the three groups were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

## Serious adverse events

SAEs were reported for seven subjects (three in the Hepta group, two in the MnC-CRM group and two in the MnC-TT group) during the entire study period (Table 18). None of the SAEs were considered to be potentially related to vaccination by the investigator. No SAE was ongoing at the end of the study. No deaths were reported during this study.

## Assessor´s comment

During the follow-up period of 31 days, at least one unsolicited AE was reported for 32.8%, 21.8% and 28.9% of the subjects in the Hepta, MnC-CRM and MnC-TT groups, respectively. Synflorix was administered at visit 2 to the subjects in Hepta and MnC-TT groups to complete the vaccination started in the primary study. The increased reactogenicity in these two groups might potentially be explained by the co-administration of Synflorix , which have been reported from previous studies.

No further regulatory action is required based on these results.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The submitted study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002 was intended to assess the immunogenicity and safety following vaccination with a new combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Hib and group C meningococcal diseases. The results showed non-inferiority of this new combination vaccine (i.e. DTPa-HBV-IPV/hib-MenC-TT) to Infanrix hexa and Menjugate regarding immune response to PRP (Hib) and MenC (Meningococci group C). The study vaccine was also shown to be non-inferior to Infanrix hexa coadministered with Synflorix regarding seroprotection rates to tetanus and diphtheria. For the pertussis antigens, non-inferiority was not demonstrated as the results exceeded the pre-defined limit. Regarding hepatitis B and the three poliovirus types, noninferiority could not be concluded, because of the sequential nature of the analysis and the higher ranking objective linked to anti-pertussis response which did not met the criteria for non-inferiority.

Concerning Synflorix , one month after the third dose, the vast majority of subjects reached acceptable antibody concentrations for the majority of the pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. This

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was true for both study groups where the subjects received Synflorix (i.e. Hepta and HexaPn groups, respectively). The results generally confirm what is already known regarding immunogenicity and safety of Synflorix . Consequently, no amendments of the SPC or other regulatory action considering Synflorix is required, based on the presented results.

The extension study DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-004 was designed to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of booster vaccination at 12-18 months of age with GSK Biologicals ' investigational DTPa- HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine in toddlers who had received the same vaccine in primary vaccination.

Whereas in the primary infant vaccination study (i.e. DTPa-HBV-IPV=Hib-MenC-TT-002), Synflorix was co-administered either with the combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib-MenC-TT vaccine or with Infanrix hexa , no study endpoints were associated with the booster dose of Synflorix in the current study. Based on the submitted results, no regulatory actions regarding Synflorix are considered necessary.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

This article 46 submission is considered satisfactory and no further regulatory action regarding Synflorix is required.
