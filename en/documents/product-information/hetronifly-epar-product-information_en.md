## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

HETRONIFLY 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 10 mg of serplulimab. One vial of 10 ml of concentrate contains 100 mg of serplulimab.

Serplulimab is a humanised antibody (IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilising sequence alteration in the hinge region) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology.

## Excipient with known effect

Each 10 ml vial contains 0.98 mmol (22.5 mg) sodium and 2.0 mg polysorbate 80 (E 433).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).

Colourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution, pH 5.2-5.8, osmolality of approximately 280-340 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

HETRONIFLY in combination with carboplatin and etoposide is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of cancer.

## Posology

The recommended dose is 4.5 mg/kg bodyweight serplulimab every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Dose delay or discontinuation (see also section 4.4)

Dose escalation or reduction of HETRONIFLY is not recommended. Dose withholding or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. Dose withholding for up to 12 weeks for tolerability is acceptable (see section 4.4).

Recommended management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are described in Table 1.

Note: Toxicity grades are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0).

- # : Serplulimab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
- † : ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ULN, upper limit of normal.
- *: The safety of retreatment with serplulimab in patients who experienced immune-mediated myocarditis is not clear.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) (see section 5.1 and section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild (CRCL=60-89 ml/min) or moderate (CRCL=30-59 ml/min) renal impairment. There are insufficient data and no dose recommendation can be made in patients with severe (CRCL=15-29 ml/min) renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN or bilirubin &gt; 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with moderate (bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairments and no data are available in severe (bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairments . No dose recommendation can be made for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of serplulimab in the paediatric population in the indication of small cell lung cancer.

## Method of administration

## HETRONIFLY is for intravenous use.

The initial infusion rate should be set up to 100 ml per hour. If the first infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be shortened to 30 minutes (± 10 minutes).

When administered in combination with chemotherapy, HETRONIFLY should be given first followed by chemotherapy on the same day. Use separate infusion bags for each infusion.

HETRONIFLY must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.

The total dose of HETRONIFLY required should be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (see section 6.6).

For instructions on dilution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Immune-mediated adverse reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Most immune-mediated adverse reactions occurring during treatment were reversible and managed by withholding treatment, administration of corticosteroids, and/or supportive care (see section 4.2). Immune-mediated adverse reactions have also occurred up to 3.6 months after the last dose. Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously.

For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, treatment should be withheld, and corticosteroid administered. For most Grade 2 and some specific Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated adverse reactions, administration should be withheld until recover or improve to Grade 1. Serplulimab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 4 and some specific Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions. For Grade 3, 4 and some specific Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions (e.g., immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated myocarditis), corticosteroid (1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) and other symptomatic treatments should be given according to the clinical symptoms until recover or improve to Grade 1. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Rapid tapering may lead to worsening or recurrence of the adverse reaction. Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., infliximab) should be added if there is worsening or no improvement despite corticosteroid use.

## Immune-mediated lung disease

Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving HETRONIFLY (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pneumonitis such as radiographic changes (e.g., focal ground glass opacities, patchy filtrates), dyspnoea, and hypoxia. Suspected immune-mediated pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging, and other causes excluded. For treatment modification, see section 4.2.

## Immune-mediated colitis

Immune-mediated colitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated colitis, such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mucus, or blood in stool. Infection and other disease-mediated aetiologies should be ruled out. For treatment modification, see section 4.2. The potential risk of gastrointestinal perforation should be taken into consideration and confirmed by radiographic imaging and/or endoscopy if necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immune-mediated hepatitis

Immune-mediated hepatitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for changes in liver function and clinical signs and symptoms of immune-mediated hepatitis such as transaminase and total bilirubin elevations periodically (every month). Infection and diseases-related aetiologies should be ruled out. The frequency of liver function test should be increased, if immune-mediated hepatitis occurs. For treatment modification, see section 4.2.

## Immune-mediated nephritis and renal insufficiency

Immune-mediated nephritis and renal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function and clinical signs and symptoms of immune-mediated nephritis and renal insufficiency periodically (every month). The frequency of renal function test should be increased, if immune-mediated nephritis occurs. Most patients present with asymptomatic increases in serum creatinine. Disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. For treatment modification, see section 4.2.

## Immune-mediated endocrinopathies

## Thyroid diseases

Thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis, have been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. For Grade 2 or 3 symptomatic hypothyroidism, serplulimab should be withheld and thyroid hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. For Grade 2 or 3 symptomatic hyperthyroidism, serplulimab should be withheld and anti-thyroid medicinal product should be initiated as needed. If acute inflammation of the thyroid is suspected, serplulimab should be withheld and initiate hormone therapy. Treatment may be resumed when symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism are controlled, and thyroid function is improved. For life-threatening hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, serplulimab must be permanently discontinued. Thyroid function should be monitored continuously to ensure appropriate hormone replacement (see section 4.2).

## Pituitary disorders

Hypophysitis has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, and other causes should be ruled out. For Grade 2 or 3 symptomatic hypophysitis, serplulimab should be withheld, and hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. If acute hypophysitis is suspected, corticosteroids should be initiated. For life-threatening Grade 4 hypophysitis, serplulimab must be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Adrenal insufficiency

Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms, and other causes should be ruled out. For Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency, serplulimab should be withheld and hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. For life-threatening Grade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency, serplulimab must be permanently discontinued. Adrenal gland function and hormone levels should be monitored continuously to ensure appropriate hormone replacement (see section 4.2).

## Hyperglycaemia

Hyperglycaemia or type 1 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for blood glucose level and related clinical signs and symptoms. Insulin replacement therapy should be initiated as needed. For type 1 diabetes mellitus with poor blood glucose control, serplulimab should be withheld, and insulin replacement therapy should be initiated until the symptoms are improved. For life-threatening Grade 4 type 1 diabetes mellitus, serplulimab must be permanently discontinued. Blood glucose levels should be monitored continuously to ensure appropriate insulin replacement (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immune-mediated skin reactions

Immune-mediated skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). For Grade 1 or 2 rash, serplulimab can be continued, and symptomatic treatment or local corticosteroids treatment can be given. For Grade 3 rash, serplulimab should be withheld, and symptomatic treatment or local corticosteroids treatment should be given. For Grade 4 rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), serplulimab should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Immune-mediated pancreatitis

Immune-mediated pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels and fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for changes in serum lipase and amylase (at the beginning of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation), and clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Serplulimab should be withheld for Grade 3 or 4 increase in serum amylase or lipase levels, and Grade 2 or 3 pancreatitis. For Grade 4 pancreatitis or recurrent pancreatitis of any grade, serplulimab should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Immune-mediated myocarditis

Immune-mediated myocarditis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving serplulimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of myocarditis. Suspected immune-mediated myocarditis should be confirmed with myocardial enzyme examinations, and other causes excluded. For Grade 2 myocarditis, serplulimab should be withheld, and corticosteroid treatment should be given. The safety of restarting serplulimab treatment in patients previously experiencing immune-mediated myocarditis is unclear. A multidisciplinary discussion is recommended before restarting serplulimab in patients with previous Grade 2 myocarditis, and the decision should be based on various clinical factors, including the degree of cardiac recovery, oncological response to the treatment, availability of alternative oncology treatments and prognosis. For Grade 3 or 4 myocarditis, serplulimab must be permanently discontinued and corticosteroids therapy should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of myocarditis is established, serplulimab should be withheld or permanently discontinued. Myocardial enzymes and cardiac function should be monitored closely for any grade myocarditis (see section 4.2).

## Immune-mediated uveitis

If uveitis and other immune-mediated adverse reactions occur at the same time, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, systemic corticosteroids should be given to prevent permanent blindness.

## Other immune-mediated adverse reactions

Given the mechanism of action of serplulimab, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur. Other fatal and life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reactions have been observed in patients treated with serplulimab in clinical trials across doses and tumour types: thrombocytopenia, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction and immune-mediated encephalitis (see section 4.8). For other suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology and exclude other causes. Based on the severity of adverse reactions, serplulimab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions which occur for the first time. For recurrent Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions (except endocrinopathies) and Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse reactions, serplulimab must be permanently discontinued. Corticosteroids can be initiated as clinically indicated (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infusion-related reactions

Infusion-related reactions have been reported in patients receiving serplulimab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Patients with Grade 1 infusion-related reactions may continue administration under close monitoring. The rate of infusion should be reduced, or treatment should be interrupted in patients with Grade 2 infusion-related reactions. Antipyretic and antihistamines may be considered. Treatment with serplulimab may be resumed under close monitoring when Grade 2 infusion-related reactions are controlled. For Grade ≥ 3 infusion-related reactions, infusion should be stopped immediately, treatment should be permanently discontinued, and appropriate treatment should be given (see section 4.2).

## Patients excluded from clinical trials

Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: a history of active or prior documented autoimmune disease, patients with active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to serplulimab administration, patients with any active infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose, history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, patients with active brain metastases, history of significant cardiovascular disease (e.g. myocardial infarction within half a year), a history of hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody, systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to receiving serplulimab.

## Excipients with known effect

This medicinal product contains 0.98 mmol (or 22.5 mg) sodium per 10 ml vial, equivalent to 1.1% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

This medicine contains 2.0 mg of polysorbate 80 (E 433) in each 10 ml vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

For instructions on dilution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## Patient card

The prescriber must discuss the risks of serplulimab therapy with the patient. The patient will be provided with the patient card with each prescription.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug metabolising enzymes, inhibition, or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of HETRONIFLY.

The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting serplulimab should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat immunemediated adverse reactions after starting serplulimab (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/contraception

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of serplulimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

There is no data on the use of serplulimab in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1 pathway causes embryofoetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier and serplulimab is an IgG4; therefore, it has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Serplulimab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether serplulimab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, serplulimab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

## Fertility

Studies to evaluate fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of serplulimab on male and female fertility is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Serplulimab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue (see section 4.8), patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain that serplulimab does not adversely affect them.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy is based on data in 389 patients with ES-SCLC. The most common adverse reactions were neutropenia (82.8%), leukopenia (74.0%), anaemia (72.8%), thrombocytopenia (56.0%), alopecia (54.2%), nausea (36.2%), hyperlipidaemia (32.1%), decreased appetite (28.3%), hypoproteinaemia (25.4%), and hyponatraemia (25.4%).

Serplulimab was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5.4% of patients.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported in clinical trial and in post-marketing experience are listed by system organ class and frequency (see Table 2). Unless otherwise stated, the frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies identified in ASTRUM-005 trial, in which 389 patients were exposed to serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for a median duration of 22 weeks. See section 5.1 for information about the main characteristics of patients in the pivotal clinical trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell death-1/death ligand 1) inhibitors ATC code: L01FF12.

## Mechanism of action

Serplulimab (HLX10) is a humanised monoclonal IgG4 antibody, which binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

microenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Serplulimab potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands.

The PD-1 receptor occupation of peripheral T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) release ability in vitro were studied in the phase 1 trial involving 29 Chinese patients with advanced solid tumour that were injected with single and multiple doses (0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) of serplulimab. The result showed that serplulimab could stably maintain the saturation state of receptor occupation and sustained functional blockage at the dosage from 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks interval.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin plus etoposide) for the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC was evaluated in ASTRUM-005 trial (NCT04063163), a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multiregional clinical trial. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by independent radiology review committee (IRRC) and investigator based on RECIST 1.1. Analysis for the primary endpoint was performed at 25 and 33 months since the start of the clinical trial. The study treatment regimens were unblinded after the primary analysis.

The trial included adult patients (18 years or older) with ES-SCLC (according to the Veterans Administration Lung Study Group [VALG] staging system) who had not been treated with systemic therapy and with an ECOG performance-status score of 0 or 1. Patients were excluded if they had active or untreated central nervous system metastases; active autoimmune disease; administration of systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 14 days prior to the first dose.

A total of 585 patients were enrolled and randomised (2:1) to receive one of the treatment regimens described in Table 3. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression level (negative: tumour proportion scores [TPS] &lt; 1%, positive: TPS ≥ 1%, or not evaluable/not available, measured by PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit), brain metastasis (yes versus no), and age (≥ 65 years versus &lt; 65 years).

Table 3. Intravenous treatment regimens

| Treatment regimen   | Induction (Four 21-Day Cycles)                                                                | Maintenance (21-Day Cycles)   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| A                   | Serplulimab (4.5 mg/kg) a + carboplatin (AUC=5, up to 750 mg) b + etoposide (100 mg/m 2 ) b,c | Serplulimab (4.5 mg/kg) a     |
| B                   | Placebo + carboplatin (AUC=5, up to 750 mg) b + etoposide (100 mg/m 2 ) b,c                   | Placebo                       |

a. Serplulimab was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

b. Carboplatin and etoposide were administered until completion of 4 cycles, or progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first.

c. Etoposide was administered on day 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle.

Baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. Among the patients enrolled, 68.5% were Asian (401 patients), and 31.5% were non-Asian (184 patients), all of which were White. The median age was 62 years (range: 28-83) with 39.3% of patients ≥ 65 years of age, and 1.9% of patients ≥ 75 years of age. 82.2% of patients were men. Baseline ECOG performance-status score was 0 (17.6%) or 1 (82.4%). 16.9% of patients were PD-L1 positive (TPS ≥ 1%). 13.3% of patients had a history of brain metastases.

At the time of the interim analysis cut-off on 22 October 2021 when 66% of predefined OS events were observed (defined approximately 226, actual 246 OS events), patients had a median survival follow-up time of 12.3 months. OS, PFS and ORR results from the interim analysis are summarised in Table 4.

## Immunogenicity

The immunogenicity of serplulimab was evaluated in 389 patients treated with serplulimab at 4.5 mg/kg Q3W in the ASTRUM-005 trial. Seven patients (1.8%) were ADA positive at any visit, of whom 6 patients (1.5%) were treatment-emergent ADA positive, defined as at least one post-baseline ADA positive.

In dose escalation and dose expansion study HLX10-001, ADAs were observed in 13 out of 66 patients (19.7%).

Neutralising antibodies were not observed in either of the key studies. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed. However, data are still limited.

## Elderly patients

In the ASTRUM-005 trial, of the 389 patients in the serplulimab group in the overall population, 153 (39.3%) were ≥ 65 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between elderly patients and younger patients.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with serplulimab in all subsets of the paediatric population for lung cancer (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Serplulimab pharmacokinetics has been investigated in a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis that included 1 144 patients with lung cancer (including ES-SCLC) and other solid cancer types from 8 studies. The patients received serplulimab intravenously as monotherapy or combination therapy in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 4.5 mg/kg Q3W, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q4W. The PK was described by a two-compartment model with time-dependent clearance (CL). Inter-individual variability (coefficient of variation, CV) in base CL and central volume of distribution (Vc) was 25.8% and 15.4%. The mean (CV) observed trough concentration at steady state

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the ASTRUM-005 trial was 62.5 µg/mL (36.3%).

## Absorption

Serplulimab is administered by intravenous infusion and is therefore immediately and completely bioavailable. Other routes of administration have not been investigated.

## Distribution

Based on a popPK analysis the volume of distribution of serplulimab is approximately 5.73 L.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of serplulimab has not been characterised. Serplulimab is expected to be catabolised into small peptides and amino acids by general protein degradation processes.

## Elimination

Based on a popPK analysis, serplulimab clearance (CL) after the first dose is 0.225 L/day. The clearance decreases over time by a maximum of 30.5% (CV 26.3%) with 106 days to reach half of the maximum effect. The half-life at steady state is approximately 24.3 days.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Serplulimab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg Q2W (including flat doses of 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q3W and 400 mg Q4W) both after single and multiple doses.

## Special populations

No dedicated studies have been performed in special populations. A popPK analysis suggested no difference in the total systemic clearance of serplulimab based on age (23-83 years), race (n=247 Whites and n=895 Asians), and ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1). Serplulimab clearance increased with increasing body weight.

## Renal impairment

No effect of creatinine or creatinine clearance (CRCL) (Cockcroft-Gault) was found on serplulimab CL based on a popPK analysis in patients with mild (CRCL=60-89 ml/min; n=448), moderate (CRCL=30-59 ml/min; n=102), and severe (CRCL=15-29 ml/min; n=1) renal impairment, and normal renal function (CRCL≥ 90 ml/min, n=591). There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment for dosing recommendations (see section 4.2) .

## Hepatic impairment

No effect of ALT, AST or total bilirubin was found on serplulimab CL based on a popPK analysis in patients with mild (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN or bilirubin &gt; 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST; n=176) and moderate (bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST; n=2) hepatic impairment, and normal (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN; n=956) hepatic function. There are insufficient data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations. Serplulimab has not been studied in patients with severe (bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Repeat-dose toxicity

In the repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys dosed for up to 31 weeks, a high incidence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of pharmacology-related perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration in the brain choroid plexus was observed at 100 mg/kg. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 31-weeks toxicity study was 50 mg/kg/week, which produced exposure 36 times (calculated by AUC0-t) the exposure in humans at dose of 3 mg/kg every two weeks.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed.

The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is thought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of PD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in an increase in foetal loss.

Two anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys for reproductive and developmental toxicity and were shown to cause premature delivery, foetal loss and premature neonatal death when administrated to pregnant monkeys.

Therefore, potential risks of administering serplulimab during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. Based on its mechanism of action, foetal exposure to serplulimab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response and immune-mediated disorders that have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice.

## Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity

No studies have been performed to assess the genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of serplulimab.

## 1. What Hetronifly is and what it is used for

Hetronifly is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance serplulimab. It is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that is designed to recognise and attach to a specific target in the body called programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor which is found on the surface of T and B cells (types of white blood cells that form part of the immune system, the body's natural defences). When PD-1 is activated by cancer cells it can switch off the activity of T cells. By blocking PD-1, Hetronifly prevents it from switching off your T cells which helps your immune system fight the cancer.

Hetronifly is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). It is used when the cancer:

-  has spread within the lungs (or to other parts of the body) and
-  has not previously been treated.

If you have any questions about how Hetronifly works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Hetronifly will be given in combination with chemotherapy. It is important that you also read the package leaflets for the specific chemotherapy you may be receiving. Ask your doctor If you have any questions about these medicines.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Hetronifly

## You should not be given Hetronifly

If you are allergic to serplulimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine.

If you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Hetronifly.

-  Confirm the dose of the product and calculate the required volume of Hetronifly.
-  Withdraw a volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection corresponding to the volume of infused product from the target intravenous bag using a sterile syringe and discard.
-  Use a syringe to withdraw the required volume of Hetronifly from the vial and inject it into the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration range from 1.0 to 8.0 mg/ml. Mix the diluted solution by gentle inversion.
-  Administer the infusion solution intravenously using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 to 5.0 μm in-line or add-on filter.
-  Set the initial infusion rate to 100 ml per hour (25 drops per minute is recommended). The infusion rate can be adjusted if infusion-related reactions occur. If there is no infusion-related adverse reaction in the first infusion, the duration of subsequent administration can be shortened to 30 minutes (± 10 minutes).
-  From a microbiological point of view, the product, once diluted, should be used immediately. The diluted solution must not be frozen. If not used immediately, the diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. This 24-hour hold may include up to 6 hours at room temperature (≤ 25°C). If refrigerated, the vials and/or intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use.
-  At the end of infusion, the infusion tube is flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution according to the routine operation procedure of the hospital.
-  Do not co-administer other medical products through the same infusion line.
