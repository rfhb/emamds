## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for the products containing fentanyl as a single active substance in transmucosal formulations , including nasal spray, buccal tablet, sublingual tablets, buccal soluble film and lozenges, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

There  is  no  new  information  that  would  have  an  impact  on  benefit  of  transmucosal  fentanyl  in  the approved indication. In addition, for the time being, no new risks with transmucosal formulations of fentanyl  containing  medicinal  products  have  been  identified.  However,  some  known  risks  remain  of particular  concern.  Therefore,  whilst  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  fentanyl  remains  favourable  in  the management of breakthrough pain in adults who are already receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain, some changes were recommended to be made to the product information for all transmucosal formulations as detailed below.

The PRAC is of the view that the systemic effects of the transmusocal formulations are expected to be the same, regardless of the formulation. So the PRAC considered that the product information of the transmucosal fentanyl should share a similar safety profile. Therefore, in view of the available data regarding fentanyl, and the results of signal evaluation, the following changes were recommended to be  made  to  the  section  4.3,  4.4,  4.5,  4.6,  4.8  and  5.3  for  all  of  the  transmucosal  formulations  of fentanyl containing medicinal products based on the evidence of the data summarised below:

- Some known risks remain of particular concern, such as the risk of respiratory depression and the risk of abuse and dependence. Therefore an update of section 4.3 was recommended for all fentanyl containing transmucosal formulations to contraindicate the use in patients without maintenance opioid therapy, and to contraindicate the use for the treatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain. Respiratory  depressant  effect  should  also  be  reflected  in  section  4.8  for  all  the  fentanyl  containing products.

-  Having reviewed the available data on bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia, an update of section 4.4 was requested to reinforce this warning for all the fentanyl containing transmucosal formulations.

- Since there is a world-wide co-prescription of serotoninergic drugs with fentanyl and considering the potential interaction between opioids such as fentanyl and Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors as well as case reports and literature data (Ailawadhi et al 2007), it was considered that the risk of serotonin syndrome warranted an update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 for all the fentanyl containing transmucosal formulations.

- For the time being, no study provides results regarding quantities of fentanyl in breast milk 48 hours after  the  last  administration  of  fentanyl.  However,  given  that  the  terminal  half-life  elimination  after administration of transmucosal fentanyl is approximately 20 hours, the PRAC considered safer to wait 48 hour after the last administration of fentanyl before breastfeeding and requested that the section 4.6 is updated accordingly for all the fentanyl containing transmucosal formulations.

-  Further  to  the  detection  of  new  signals,  the  PRAC  recommended the addition of following adverse effects:  fall,  flushing  and  hot  flush,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  malaise,  peripheral  oedema,  convulsion, hallucination to the section 4.8 for all the fentanyl containing transmucosal formulations.

-  Further  to  the  evaluation  of  data  from  a  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  showing  evidence  of  brain lesions,  an  update  of  section  5.3  was  requested  for  all  the  fentanyl  containing  transmucosal formulations.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for the transmucosal fentanyl products, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing the active substance fentanyl (single  substance-  transmucosal  formulations)  is  favourable  subject  to  the  proposed  changes  to  the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
