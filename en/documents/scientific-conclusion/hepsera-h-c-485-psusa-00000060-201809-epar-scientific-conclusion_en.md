## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for adefovir, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Based on a PRAC request, the MAH has reconsidered the frequency categories of Fanconi syndrome and proximal renal tubulopathy in the SmPC for Hepsera. The safety data derived from 5 pivotal randomized controlled studies, including a total of 1,174 patients, were reviewed. On the basis of an algorithm defining possible  proximal  renal  tubulopathy  and/or  Fanconi  syndrome  as  confirmed  abnormalities,  28  cases  of proximal  renal  tubulopathy  (including  possible  Fanconi  syndrome)  were  retrieved  in  the  clinical  safety dataset. After reviewing the description of the cases, 5 cases of possible proximal renal tubulopathy and/or Fanconi syndrome were sufficiently well documented with no alternative aetiology and/or having a temporal association  with  Hepsera  treatment.  On  the  basis  of  these  data,  the  frequency  of  these  adverse  drug reactions is calculated to be 0.4% corresponding to the frequency category uncommon. As a result, the frequency  category  of  proximal  renal  tubulopathy  and  Fanconi  syndrome  is  revised  from  unknown  to uncommon  in  section  4.8  of  Hepsera  SmPC  and  in  the  corresponding  section  of  the  package  leaflet. Moreover, to emphasize that the frequency is more driven by the more common event proximal renal tubulopathy, the terms are combined as follows 'Proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome)' rather the two terms separated. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) On the basis of the scientific conclusions for adefovir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing adefovir is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
