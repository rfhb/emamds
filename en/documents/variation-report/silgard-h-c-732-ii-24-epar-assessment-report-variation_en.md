## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Silgard is a quadrivalent (HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) recombinant HPV (qHPV) vaccine licensed on 24 September 2006. Silgard  is  indicated  in  the  prevention  of  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal), cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  causally  related  to  Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. The current indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of qHPV vaccine in adult females 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year old children and adolescents. In November 2008 the MAH submitted a type II variation  to extend the age of indication for women up to 45 years old, based on submission of efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of the qHPV vaccine in female subjects 24 to 45 years of age from a phase III study (Protocol 019) after a median duration follow-up  of  2.2  years.  Following  a  major  objection  the  MAH  accepted  to  limit  the  application  to  an update of SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6. 4.8, and 5.1 to reflect the study results obtained in midadult women (MAW). This type II variation received a positive CHMP opinion 23 July 2009. The present type II variation containing the end-of-study data on efficacy, immunogenicity and safety from the clinical study conducted in mid-adult women 25-45 year of age (Protocol 019) aims to modify sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and section 1 of the PL. The median duration of followup for this study was 4.0 years. The proposed modification of the current indication of the SmPC is as follows: Silgard is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18  (see section 5.1). The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Silgard in adult females 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Silgard in 9- to 15-year old children and adolescents. Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1). See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information regarding vaccine efficacy and immune responses to  vaccination  in  different  age  groups  from  9  years  of  age  onwards  and  study populations and by gender . The use of Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The final clinical study report (CSR) of Protocol 019 included in the present type II variation fulfils FUM 014 at the same time.

The HPV attack rate is high in sexually active adults and women remain at risk for acquisition of new infections  throughout  their  sexual  lives.  The  incidence  of  HPV  disease  peaks  within  10  years  after sexual debut. However, social changes (e.g. later marriage, increasing divorce rate) have increased

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the risk in women in their late 20s, 30s and 40s. The literature review provided by the MAH showed that  HPV  incidence  rates  in  mid-adult  women  (MAW)  varied  by  country,  in  general  decreased  with increasing age, but were still noticeable at older ages. The published data suggest that at least 60% of MAW will remain susceptible to vaccine HPV type infection and can potentially benefit from the qHPV vaccine. Therefore, the MAH has conducted this efficacy study in MAW.

1.2 Clinical efficacy 1.2.1 Protocol 019 1.2.1.1 Methods The claim of efficacy in mid-adult women (MAW) is based on one randomized controlled efficacy trial Protocol 019 (summarized in table 1) including 3819 healthy sexually active 24- to 45-year old women. The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy in MAW with respect to the composite co-primary endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and clinical disease (CIN, AIS and EGLs). Randomisation was stratified by age in approximately 1:1 ratio into 2 groups, those 24 to 34 years and those 35 to 45 years. Within each age stratum subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio to qHPV vaccine or placebo. Table 1: Summary of study P019 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Study participants

The study subjects were healthy 24 to 45-year-old women. The studies did not include pre-screening visit for HPV status. Thus, both naïve individuals and individuals who had been exposed to HPV prior to enrolment were included. All subjects had at inclusion:

-  Serum anti-HPV testing for vaccine types, HPV 6, 11, 16, 18
-  Pap test
-  Cervicovaginal sampling for PCR HPV DNA typing

 Colposcopy if Pap test showed some abnormalities To enrich the population with HPV naïve subjects, intact cervix (i.e. those without hysterectomy) was used  as  screening  criterion.  Subjects  who  had  surgical  treatment  (such  as  conisation,  LEEP,  laser cervical cryotherapy) or subjects who had a cervical biopsy taken within 5 years were not eligible for further evaluation. Populations The following populations were considered for the HPV-specific efficacy analysis: Per-protocol efficacy:  Received all 3 doses of study vaccine  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 to Month 7  Did not have general protocol violations  Cases counted starting 30 days postdose 3 (Month 7). The Per-Protocol Efficacy (PPE) population was used as the primary efficacy population. HPV-Naïve to the Relevant-HPV-Type (HNRT) population*  Received at least 1 vaccination  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1  Cases counted starting after Day 1 (*This population was similar to the Modified Intention to Treat-2 (MITT-2) population for young adult women (YAW) (used in P005, P007, P013, P015) but for MITT-2, cases counted starting after Day 30) The HNRT population was used as a supportive population Full Analysis Set (FAS)*  Received at least 1dose of study vaccine  Regardless of PCR status at Day 1  Had at least one follow-up visit after Day 1  Cases counted starting after Day 1 (*This FAS population is similar to the MITT-3 population in studies in YAW.  In the MITT-3 population, cases were counted started after Day 30) The FAS population represents the general (female) population (ITT) in this age group. For the analyses that were not HPV-vaccine-type specific (population benefit analyses) the following populations were defined: Generally HPV-naïve (GHN) population*  Received at least 1 vaccination  Were seronegative and PCR negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1;  Were PCR negative to non-vaccine HPV type for which testing were available (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59) at Day 1, Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Had a negative-for-SIL Pap test result at Day 1;
-  Had at least one follow-up visit following Day 1.
-  Cases were counted starting after Day 1

(*For  studies  conducted  in  YAW,  the  generally  HPV-naïve  (GHN)  population  was  referred  to  as  the RMITT-2 population. In the RMITT-2 population, cases were counted starting after Day 30 instead of after Day 1)

The GHN population represents the primary analysis population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HPV-naïve to the relevant type (HNRT)

-  Received at least 1 vaccination
-  Were sero- and PCR-negative at Day 1 to the appropriate vaccine HPV type (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18);  were  PCR-negative  at  Day  1  to  the  appropriate  non-vaccine  HPV  type  for  which  PCR assays were available (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, or 59), or had a negative Day 1 Pap test result;
-  Cases were counted starting after Day 1.

The HNRT population is a supportive population Full Analysis Set (FAS) General population (ITT) as defined above. Treatments Subjects  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either  quadrivalent  HPV  VPL  vaccine  (20/40/40/20mcg  + 225mcg  amorphous  aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulphate  (AAHS)  adjuvant)  or  placebo  (225mcg Aluminium adjuvant in normal saline) at Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6. Objectives The  primary  efficacy  study  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  that  administration  of  the  HPV  vaccine would reduce the combined incidence of:  HPV6/11/16/18-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer,  vaginal cancer,  CIN,  AIS,  and  cervical  cancer,  compared  with  placebo  in  24-  to  45-year-old  women who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline.  HPV16/18-related persistent infection, genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, CIN, AIS, and cervical cancer, compared with placebo in 24- to 45-year-old women who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline. The secondary efficacy study objectives were to demonstrate that administration of the HPV vaccine would reduce the combined incidence of:  HPV6/11-related persistent infection, genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, CIN, AIS, and cervical cancer, compared with placebo in 24- to 45-year-old women who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline.  HPV  31/33/35/52/58-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer, vaginal  cancer,  CIN,  AIS,  and  cervical  cancer,  compared  with  placebo  in  24-  to  45-year-old women who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline. Outcomes/endpoints Primary efficacy endpoint First co-primary endpoint: the combined incidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18-related persistent infection CIN (any grade), AIS, or EGLs. The definition of the persistent infection endpoint for the first primary endpoint encompassed:  Persistent  vaccine-type  infection  without  confirmed  CIN  -  defined  as  detection  of  HPV positivity for the same HPV type by the HPV 6/11/16/18 PCR assay in 2 or more consecutive cervicovaginal specimens obtained at least 6 months apart (within ± 4-week windows). Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Vaccine-type  HPV  infection  with  confirmed  CIN  -  defined  as  a  consensus  Pathology  Panel diagnosis of CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, AIS or cervical cancer plus detection of the corresponding HPV vaccine type in specimens obtained from the same lesion, plus detection of HPV vaccine type on the routine visit immediately prior to colposcopy visit in which the biopsy showing CIN, AIS or cervical cancer was obtained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Second co-primary endpoint: the combined incidence of persistent HPV 16 and HPV 18 infection and HPV 16- and 18-related CIN (any grade), AIS or EGLs.

## Secondary efficacy endpoint

-  The number of subjects in the PPE population who developed a HPV 6- and HPV 11-related persistent infection, external genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, CIN (any grade), AIS, and cervical cancer.

 The number of subjects in the PPE population who developed a HPV 31/33/35/52/58-related persistent infection, external genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, CIN (any grade), AIS, and cervical cancer. 1.2.1.2 Results A total of 3819 subjects were enrolled in the study. At End-of-Study (EOS), the median follow-up time was 4.0 years per study participant (mean follow-up time was 3.8 years). A total of 89.7% and 88.6% of study subjects completed their Month 36 and Month 48 visits, respectively Thirty-eight  study  centers  located  in  7  countries  in  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Columbia,  Philippines, Thailand  and  the  US  conducted  the  study.  The  3  countries  with  the  highest  number  of  recruitment were Colombia (43% of study population), Thailand (20%) and the US (14%). Europe enrolled 12.6% of the study population. Overall,  96.7% of all  subjects  completed the vaccination phase and 90.7% completed the follow-up phase. The proportions of subjects who discontinued during the vaccination period and follow-up and the  reasons  for  discontinuation  within  this  period  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  2 vaccination groups. Few subjects discontinued due to clinical adverse events. Baseline data The 2 vaccination groups were well balanced with respect to baseline demographics. Sexual demographics were comparable between vaccination groups. Overall, 99.9% of subjects had experienced sexual debut. The median age at first intercourse among non-virgins was 18 years and the median number of lifetime sex partners was 2. In  both  vaccination  groups  approximately  30%  of  subjects  were  positive  to  a  HPV  vaccine  type  by serology  and  approximately  8%  were  positive  by  PCR.  Altogether  67%  of  the  population  was seronegative and PCR negative to all vaccine HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (64.6% of 24 to 34 yearolds; 69% of 35 to 45 year-olds). By age, the proportion of subjects who were PCR positive was lower in  the  35  to  45  year-old  stratum  than  in  the  24  to  34  year-olds  (5.6%  vs.  10.2%)  whereas  with respect to serology the proportions were similar (28.8% vs. 30.7%). The  vaccination  groups  were  comparable  with  respect  to  the  overall  proportions  of  subjects  with detectable vaccine HPV type DNA at baseline. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Efficacy against HPV 11-related endpoints could not be confirmed, due to the fact that too few and no cases, respectively, were observed. Table 2: Analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection (PI), CIN or EGL (PPE population) Of the 96 HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint cases, 10 cases occurred in the vaccine group. Of these 3 were  identified  during  the  2007  endpoint  driven  analysis.  Of  the  7  new  cases  observed  during  the additional follow-up, 5 cases had infections of high risk non-vaccine HPV prior to detection of persistent HPV  16  infection.  Two  cases  had  HPV  6-related  persistent  infection.  None  of  the  7  cases  observed during additional follow-up were cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN or EGL.

## HNRT population

Results for this population are presented in table 3. Vaccine efficacy was 79.9% (95% CI 69.4, 87.3).

VE was lower in the older age stratum versus the younger stratum (VE: 71.3% vs. 83.7).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compared to the previous 2007 analysis (20 cases) there were 7 additional cases of HPV 6/11/16/18 PI, CIN or EGL in the vaccine arm observed in the end-of study analysis. All these cases were detected in the PPE analysis.

## Efficacy against HPV vaccine type related persistent infection

## PPE population

Results of analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection (table 6) are similar to the results of analysis of efficacy against the composite HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection and disease endpoint because persistent infection comprises the majority of the composite persistent infection and disease endpoint. Most of the persistent infection endpoints in the qHPV vaccine group were HPV 16-related. Efficacy estimates with regard to HPV 16/18- and 6/11-related persistent infection within each of the 2 protocol-defined age strata were comparable. No HPV 18- related persistent infections were observed in the qHPV vaccine group.

An exploratory  analysis  of  efficacy  against  HPV16/18-related  PI  was  conducted.  The  estimate  of  VE against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  of ≥ 12  months  duration  was  somewhat  lower  to  the estimate of VE against persistent infection based on the protocol defined duration of ≥ 6 months (±1 month) (77.2% vs. 86.2%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

VE against persistent HPV 6/11 infection was 95%. The clinical relevance of this finding was questioned in the previous 2007 procedure. However, at EOS there are more clear indications that the HPV 6/11 persistent  infection  results  in  the  development  of  lesions.  The  likelihood  ratios  used  in  the  study  to measure the value of persistent  infection  as  a  predictor  of  subsequent  progression  to  disease  were very high (LR+=37.2), which support the use of PI due to HPV 6/11 as a surrogate for condyloma.

Overall vaccine efficacy estimates were substantially lower in this population compared with the PPE population,  as  could  be  explained  by  the  inclusion  of  subjects  with  infections  that  were  present  at vaccination onset (table 8). Compared with the 2007 endpoint driven analysis, the estimate of efficacy against the HPV 16/18-related endpoint has increased from 23.9% (-1.7, 43.2) to 44.8 % (25.5, 56.3) during  the  additional  follow-up  time.  Also  as  regards  HPV  16  and  18-related  persistent  infection statistically significant results were observed at end-of study.

HNRT population The efficacy estimates were lower in the HNRT population compared to the PPE population (see table 7). The findings with respect to persistent infection were similar to the results of analyses of efficacy against the composite HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint.

The results of analysis of efficacy against persistent infection related to the 10 non-vaccine HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) showed no statistically significant VE in the qHPV vaccine group (relative to placebo) in any of the study populations.

Exploratory statistical analysis (N-weighted average efficacy analysis in the FAS) When analysed separately for each of the Day 1 HPV-naïve and Day 1 HPV-non-naïve cohorts within the  FAS,  results  were  different.  In  the  Day  1  HPV-naïve  cohort,  the  estimate  of  VE  against  HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection was 82.6% (95% CI: 70.2, 90.5).  In the Day 1 HPV-non-naive cohort, the estimate of VE against HPV 6/11/16/18- related persistent infection was 23.9% (95% CI: -0.5, 42.5). The estimate of the expected value of VE in the FAS against the HPV 6/11/16/18- related persistent infection endpoint was 71.0% (95% CI: 58.3, 79.9); against the HPV 16/18-related persistent infection endpoint  was  69.7%  (95%  CI:  53.7,  80.2)  and  against  the  HPV  6/11-related  persistent  infection endpoint is 78.1% (95% CI: 59.4, 88.1).

## Efficacy against vaccine HPV type-related CIN

## PPE population

The results of the PPE analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN showed VE of 94.1%, with 1 case in the vaccine group versus 17 cases in the placebo group (Table 9). The one case of HPV 16-related  CIN  2  in  the  vaccine  group  was  already  detected  in  the  2007  endpoint-driven  analysis. During additional study follow-up through EOS, no cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (or worse) was observed in the vaccine group, while additional 8 cases were observed in the placebo group.

Table 9: Efficacy against HPV vaccine type related CIN (PPE-population) Statistical significance was not reached in the CIN 2/3+ endpoint, but clear numerical reductions were seen and an estimate in the range of that seen for CIN (any grade). The study was not powered to demonstrate VE against the CIN 2/3+ endpoint. The case of HPV 16-related CIN 2/3 in the vaccine group was already observed in the previous 2007 analysis.

## HNRT population

In the HNRT analysis, VE was 89.0% (table 10).

There were 3 cases of HPV 6/11/16/18 CIN in the vaccine group that was observed already in the 2007 endpoint-driven analysis.

Table 10: Efficacy against HPV vaccine type related CIN (HNRT-population) During  additional  study  follow-up  through  EOS,  no  cases  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  2/3+  was observed in the vaccine group, while additional 4 cases were observed in the placebo group. At EOS, the estimate of VE against HPV 6/11/16/18- related CIN 2/3+ is 62.7% (95% CI: -55.5, 93.6). The estimate  of  VE  against  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3+  is  similar  to  the  estimate  of  VE  against  HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3+, as most of the cases of vaccine-HPV type related CIN 2/3+ were related to HPV type 16.

## FAS population

Efficacy against the HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (or worse) endpoint was demonstrated at EOS with an  estimate  of  VE  of  47.5%  (95%  CI:  16.3,  67.7).  (Table  11)    Compared  with  the  2007  endpoint driven analysis, 4 additional cases occurred in the vaccine group (all HPV 16-related; 2 CIN1 and 2 CIN3) at EOS and 14 cases in the placebo group (1 HPV 6-, 2 HPV 11- and 12 HPV 16-related).

The results of analysis of VE against HPV 16/18-related CIN (or worse) separately for each of the Day 1 HPV-naïve and Day 1 HPV-non-naïve cohorts within the FAS  showed VE of  85.3% (50.3, 97.2) and 6.9% (-65.5, 48.0) respectively. The estimate of the expected value of VE in the FAS against the HPV 16/18-related CIN (or worse) is 77.6% (95% CI: 42.2, 91.3).

## Efficacy against CIN (or worse) related to any of 10 non-vaccine HPV types

No  statistically  significant  efficacy  was  observed  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  (relative  to  placebo) against the CIN endpoint related to the 10 non-vaccine HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) in any of the populations studied. In the FAS population 65 cases (vaccine = 40, placebo = 25) of CIN 2/3+ related to non-vaccine HPV types  were  observed.  This  imbalance  between  the  two  study  groups  was  observed  in  the  2007 endpoint-driven  analysis  and  was  due  to  an  imbalance  in  Day  1  prevalent  infections.  There  was  no imbalance in acquisition of non-vaccine HPV type CIN 2/3+ in the vaccine and placebo groups during the additional follow-up through EOS. Efficacy against any CIN (or worse) (regardless of HPV type) In the assessment of efficacy against the endpoint Any CIN (or worse) regardless of HPV type, the PPE and HNRT analysis populations are undefined because the PPE and HNRT populations are comprised of subjects who are naïve to the specific HPV type to which a particular endpoint is related. The \"HPVnaïve\" population that is relevant in the assessment of efficacy against CIN (or worse) regardless of HPV type is the generally HPV-naïve (GHN) population. The GHN population is comprised of subjects who were Day 1 HPV-naïve to all 14 tested HPV types (i.e., 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59). No statistically significant results were obtained in any of the study populations, except for as expected CIN related to the 4 vaccine types in both populations. The VE against Any CIN regardless of HPV type over all age groups was 34.5% (95% CI: -12.5, 62.5) in the GHN population and 5.5% in the FAS population.  The  estimates  of  VE  in  the  CIN  2/3  endpoint  were  lower  and  even  negative  in  the  FAS population. Efficacy against vaccine HPV type-related EGL PPE-population: There  were  7  cases  (vaccine  =  0,  placebo  =  7)  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-  related  EGL observed in the PPE population at EOS. All 7 cases were HPV 6-related condyloma (vulvar n=6, vaginal n=2). At EOS, the estimate of VE against HPV 6-related condyloma (100%; 95% CI: 30.7, 100) was statistically significant, while not so during the endpoint driven analysis conducted in 2007 (VE 100% (95%CI: -49.2, 100). There was no high grade HPV 6/11/16/18-related VIN or VaIN (i.e., grades 2/3) nor vulvar or vaginal cancers observed in the PPE population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

HNRT-population: There were 13 cases (vaccine = 2, placebo = 11) of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL observed in the HNRT population at EOS. All 11 placebo group cases were HPV 6-related genital warts (1 also with VaIN 1). The 2 cases in the qHPV vaccine group had prevalent infection of high risk HPV type at Day 1. The estimate of VE against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL (81.9%; 95% CI: 17.2, 98.1) was statistically significant. There was no high-grade HPV 6/11/16/18-related VIN or VaIN (i.e., grades 2/3) nor vulvar or vaginal cancers observed in the HNRT population.

FAS  populatio n: There were a total of 23 cases (vaccine = 11, placebo = 12) of HPV 6/11/16/18related  EGL  observed  at  EOS.  Of  these,  9  cases  (vaccine  =  8,  placebo  =  1)  were  due  to  Day  1

prevalent infections and 13 (vaccine = 2, placebo = 11) were due to incident infections and 1 case of HPV 6-related genital warts in the vaccine group with unknown HPV 6 PCR status at Day 1. In the FAS (pooled population), the estimate of efficacy of the qHPV vaccine against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL is 8.5% (95% CI: -126.6, 63.4).

The estimate of the expected value of VE in the FAS (that accounts for HPV infection status at Day 1) against the HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL is 61.1% (95% CI: -67.0, 90.9). Other efficacy Analyses - Evaluation of population benefit of the vaccine No significant efficacy results were obtained in the population benefit endpoints. No efficacy against the  overall  burden  of  cervical  or  external  genital  HPV  disease  could  be  demonstrated.  The  qHPV vaccine was efficacious in preventing HPV 16/18-related Pap abnormalities of ASC-US positive for highrisk HPV probe or worse in all study populations, but no significant efficacy could be shown against Pap abnormalities due to any HPV type or in the reduction in the incidence of cervical or external genital procedures. The number of endpoints was insufficient to detect a statistically significant effect. Therapeutic efficacy Clearance of prevalent infection related to vaccine HPV types The impact of a 3-dose vaccination regimen on the clearance of vaccine HPV type DNA among subjects who were PCR-positive at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type was analysed. The  current  analysis  at  EOS  again  shows  a  higher  clearance  of  HPV  16  DNA  in  the  placebo  group versus the vaccine group (percent incidence reduction 54.8 % (95% CI: 018.6, 75.5)) among subjects who were Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative (table 12).

Table 13 shows the results of analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection and disease among subjects seropositive and PCR negative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1. The estimate of VE at EOS against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection that is of ≥ 6 months duration over consecutive visits 6 (±1) months apart among subjects who were seropositive and PCRnegative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1 was 66.8% (95% CI: 3.8, 90.5). Among the 35 to 45 yearold seropositive and PCR-negative subjects, the estimate of VE was 81.3% (95% CI: 14.4, 98.0). Table  13:  Analysis  of  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  persistent  infection  and  disease  in subjects who were PCR negative and seropositive  for the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1 There were no cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade) or EGL observed among subjects who were seropositive and PCR-negative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1 during the course of the study. In a post hoc analyses of individuals (who received at least one vaccination) with evidence of a prior infection  with  a  vaccine  HPV  type  (seropositive)  no  longer  detectable  (PCR  negative)  at  vaccination onset the efficacy of Silgard to prevent conditions due to the recurrence of the same HPV type was 100% (95% CI: 62.8, 100.0; 0 vs. 12 cases [n = 2572 from pooled studies in young women]) against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related CIN 2/3, VIN 2/3, VaIN 2/3, and genital warts in women 16 to 26 years. Efficacy was 68.2% (95% CI: 17.9, 89.5; 6 vs. 20 cases [n= 832 from studies in young and adult women combined]) against HPV 16- and 18-related persistent infection in women 16 to 45 years. 1.2.1.3 Discussion Medicinal product no longer authorised

The main goal of the study was to provide data to support that efficacy in MAW was comparable to that shown in young adult women (YAW). The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy in MAW with respect to the composite co-primary endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and clinical disease (CIN, AIS and EGLs). The scientific basis for these endpoints constituted the natural history of HPV and the results of the clinical program in YAW. The original licensure of the

qHPV vaccine was based on histologically-confirmed efficacy endpoints, i.e. HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 and AIS, as surrogates for cervical cancer. Subsequent to the demonstration of robust efficacy in this endpoint in YAW, a virological endpoint was applied in the study of MAW. Persistent HPV infection is recognised as a necessary pre-requisite for the development of cervical cancer. Comparable efficacy against HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and CIN 2/3 was demonstrated in the YAW studies. The CHMP´s  ad-hoc  expert  HPV  meeting  on  December  3rd  2009  recommended  the  use  of  persistent infection due to oncogenic HPV types of 6 months duration as a surrogate endpoint for cervical cancer in  efficacy  trials  of  HPV  vaccines.  The  MAH  conducted  an  exploratory  analysis  of  efficacy  against HPV16/18 persistent infection based on duration of &gt;12 months and results showed a similar VE to the protocol defined definition of 6 months. In this study (P019), the likelihood ratios of persistent infection as  a  predictor  of  type-specific  mediated  disease  due  to  HPV  6/11/16/18,  HPV  16/18  and  HPV  6/11 were high in MAW. Based on all these findings the use of 6 months persistent infection is considered justified including for HPV 6/11.

Regarding baseline HPV status, it was demonstrated that 67% of the mid-adult women (64.6% of the 24- to 34-year-olds and 69% of the 35- to 45-year-olds) were seronegative and PCR negative to HPV 6,  11,  16  and  18  at  Day  1  and  thus,  susceptible  to  all  4  vaccine  HPV  types  at  study  entry.    The corresponding  percentage  in  YAW  was  73%.  However,  as  a  reflection  of  the  higher  cumulative exposure of HPV and the lower number of new sexual partners in older women, the MAW had lower baseline  HPV  DNA  prevalence  and  higher  seroprevalence  than  YAW.  Within  the  MAW,  HPV  DNA prevalence  was  lowest  in  the  35-  to  45-year-olds  (5.2%)  compared  with  the  24-  to  34-year-olds (10.2%)  whereas  the seroprevalence was  comparable  (~30%).  Overall, the  HPV  sero-/DNAprevalence data observed in P019 are consistent with literature estimates. However, in the integrated summary  report  of  natural  history  in  P019,  it  was  shown  that  HPV  sero-/DNA-  prevalence  varied greatly by countries/continents, which has to be considered in the evaluation of efficacy results. Efficacy: PPE population: The findings at end of study confirm the efficacy of the qHPV vaccine in MAW in the PPE  population  demonstrated  in  the  2007  endpoint  driven  analysis.  The  qHPV  vaccine  was  highly efficacious in the PPE population with respect to the relevant endpoints, persistent infection, CIN and EGL. Efficacy was observed overall and in each age stratum. High efficacy was observed with respect to HPV 6, 16 and 18 individually; with respect to persistent infection alone and with respect to disease endpoints (CIN, AIS, or EGL) alone. There were no cases of HPV 11 infection or disease observed in the PPE population due to the rarity of this HPV type. VE was 88.7% against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection (PI)/disease,  84.7%  against  HPV  16/18-related  PI/disease,  94.7%  against HPV6/11-related PI/disease and  94.1%  against  vaccine type related CIN, which is generally comparable  to  VE  obtained  in  the  YAW  studies.  No  statistical  significance  was  reached  in  the  HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 endpoint (VE 83.4%; 95%CI: -36.7, 99.6). There were 7 new endpoint cases (5 HPV16 PI and 2 HPV6 PI) in the vaccine group and 46 new cases in the placebo group detected during the  additional  follow-up  since  the  2007  analysis.  All  of  these  7  cases  of  persistent  infection  had preceding  infections  with  multiple  non-vaccine  HPV  types.  There  were  no  new  cases  of  HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN or EGL reported in the qHPV group since the first analysis. In contrast there were 8 new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade), 2 new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3 or worse and 3 new cases of EGL in the placebo group during the same period.

HNRT  population:  During  the  assessment  of  the  2007  endpoint-driven  report  concerns  were  raised since the number of CIN 2/3 cases in the vaccine group was the same as in the placebo group (3 vs. 4 cases). It was clarified that all cases in the vaccine group had non-vaccine HPV types at baseline and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had  very  early  detection  of  HPV  16-related  disease  suggesting  the  presence  of  prevalent  HPV  16 infection at baseline. At EOS no new cases of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 were observed in the vaccine group, while additional 4 cases were observed in the placebo group. The estimate of VE against HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3+ was 63% (95% CI -54.6, 93.7). No HPV 18-related CIN lesion was detected.

For  all  endpoints,  efficacy  was  somewhat  lower  in  the  HNRT  population.  The  lower  efficacy  was  a function of the presence of infections with onset detected at the Month 7 visit (such infections were acquired between Day 1 and Month 7 and not a result of waning immunity. The observed efficacy in P019 followed the same pattern for similar endpoints seen in YAW for a similar duration of follow-up and that efficacy continues to increase over time.

Day 1 seropositive  and  PCR  negative:  Analysis  of  efficacy  against  the  recurrence  of  persistent  HPV 6/11/16/18 infection among subjects who were seropositive and PCR negative to the relevant HPV type at baseline showed statistically significant results. The estimate of VE at EOS against HPV 6/11/16/18related persistent infection that is of ≥ 6 months duration over consecutive visits 6 (±1) months apart was 66.8% (95% CI: 3.8, 90.5). Among the 35 to 45 year-old seropositive and PCR-negative subjects, the estimate of VE was 81.3% (95% CI: 14.4, 98.0). Based on these data, which are consistent with and similar to data from the efficacy studies in young women that show efficacy against both CIN and

FAS  (ITT)  population:  Improved  efficacy  results  were  demonstrated  during  the  additional  follow-up since  the  2007  analysis  with  VE  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  PI/disease  of  47.2%  (33.5,  58.2). Four new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN were detected in the vaccine group of FAS during the additional follow-up through EOS. It is noted that at least three of these cases also were infected by non-vaccine serotypes. VE in the more important HPV 16/18-related PI/disease endpoint now reached statistical significance (VE: 41.6% (24.3, 55.2). These point estimates are lower than those observed among YAW. With respect to HPV 16/18 CIN2/3 only an efficacy trend was observed (VE: 22.4% (42.5, 58.3), but the estimate was improved relative to the 2007 analysis (VE: 9.9%). There were no new cases of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3+ in the vaccine group since the 2007 analysis. There were a total of 48 (qHPV=21, placebo =27) cases of vaccine type related CIN 2/3 in the FAS population. An exploratory statistical analysis N-weighted analysis was conducted whereby the expected value of VE in the  FAS  was  computed  to  account  for  the  anticipated  VE-by-  Day  1  HPV  status  interaction.  This analysis gave higher efficacy estimates than the pooled analysis and provides a reasonable estimate of vaccine efficacy in a population with unknown HPV status at the time of vaccination and constitutes an appropriate complementary analysis of the FAS population. Other efficacy populations: Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative: The observation of a significantly higher clearance of HPV 16 DNA in the placebo group versus the vaccine group in the first 2007 analysis remained and was even stronger at end of study (percent incidence reduction  54.8%  (95% CI: 18.6, 75.5) among subjects who were Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative to HPV 16. A two-fold higher prevalence of co-infection in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group probably explains the longer persistence of HPV 16. A time-to-clearance analysis of HPV infection showed that in the cohort with co-infection at any time from Day 1 to EOS some subjects in the vaccine group compared to placebo exhibited delay in clearance of prevalent HPV 16 infection whereas in the cohort of subjects without co-infection there was  no  difference  between  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  with  respect  to  HPV  16  clearance.  The imbalance  in  co-infections  likely  explains  the  unexpected  reverse  therapeutic  efficacy  observed. Moreover, it is difficult to understand by which mechanism the qHPV vaccine would exert a negative effect on on-going HPV infections. Medicinal product no longer authorised

EGL, as well as persistent infection, the MAH has a claim of protection against recurrent HPV infection in the Day 1 seropositive and PCR negative population and section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated with data from the post hoc analyses performed by the MAH.

No significant efficacy results were obtained in the population benefit endpoints. No efficacy against the  overall  burden  of  cervical  or  external  genital  HPV  disease  could  be  demonstrated.  The  qHPV vaccine was efficacious in preventing HPV 16/18-related Pap abnormalities of ASC-US positive for highrisk HPV probe or worse in all study populations, but no significant efficacy could be shown against Pap abnormalities due to any HPV type or in the reduction in the incidence of cervical or external genital procedures. The number of endpoints was insufficient to detect a statistically significant effect.

Protocol 019 included the immunogenicity evaluation. The study enrolled a total of 3819 subjects in 2 approximately equal age  strata  (24-  to  34-year-olds  and  35-  to  45-year-olds).  All  subjects  were  to undergo serology testing for anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 levels at Day 1, and Months 7, 12, 24, 36, and 48. The primary immunogenicity evaluations were to be conducted in the per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population. The 2007 endpoint driven analysis presented results from  all  visits  through  13-July-2007  (corresponding  primarily  to  the  Day  1,  Month  7  and  Month  24 visits). The new results presented in this end-of-study report pertain to immunogenicity responses at Months 12, 36, and 48 and maternal transfer of anti-HPV (exploratory immunogenicity objective).

Non-vaccine serotypes: There was no imbalance in acquisition of non-vaccine HPV type CIN 2/3+ in the vaccine and placebo groups  during  the  additional  follow-up  through  EOS.  The  original  imbalance  observed  in  the  2007 endpoint-driven  analysis  was  due  to  an  imbalance  in  prevalent  infection  at  Day  1  between  the  two groups.  The  65  cases  (vaccine  =  40,  placebo  =  25)  of  CIN  2/3+  related  to  non-vaccine  HPV  types observed in the FAS: i) do not represent evidence suggesting that the qHPV vaccine allows non-vaccine HPV type disease to replace vaccine HPV type-related disease in vaccinated subjects; and ii) do not support a view that the qHPV vaccine accelerates progression of existing non-vaccine HPV type-related infection  to  pre-cancerous lesions in subjects vaccinated with the qHPV vaccine. No cross-protective could be demonstrated, probably due to the sample size and the relative lack of power to detect a significant result. The collection of data on possible HPV type replacement in the MAW population will only be performed in the 019 study in Columbia. The conditions are not ideal since the Columbian cohort is very limited and there will be no population-based data on background HPV types available. However, the observed HPV  types  after  vaccination  will  be  compared  with  data  from  another  population  in  Bogota.  This approach will probably be informative. In addition, HPV type replacement will be studied in the YAW population  in  two  large  studies  from  which  data  to  some  degree  may  be  extrapolated  to  the  MAW population. It is noted that an overview on how the MAH plans to assess the potential occurrence of type replacement following vaccination with qHPV vaccine is detailed in the current risk management plan. An updated version of the RMP will be submitted in June 2010. The type replacement issue will therefore be the subject of further discussion. In conclusion the results at end of study of Protocol 019 confirmed the efficacy of the qHPV vaccine in mid-adult women 24 to 45 years of age. Long-term follow up of efficacy for a duration of at least 10 years will be performed in the Colombian cohort of study 019 1.3 Immunogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.3.1  Methods

The below characteristics are specific for the immunogenicity analysis.

Study population Per-Protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population The per-protocol population for immunogenicity (PPI) analysis generally included subjects who were seronegative  and  PCR  negative  to  the  relevant  HPV  type(s)  at  Day  1,  remained  HPV  PCR  negative through 1 month post dose 3 (month 7), received all 3 vaccinations within pre-specified time intervals, and no deviation from the study protocol. Exploratory immunogenicity populations Day 1 seronegative and PCR positive (S0P1) Day 1 seropositive and PCR negative (S1P0) Day 1 seropositive and PCR positive (S1P1) Objectives The immunogenicity objectives were: To  evaluate  the  kinetics  and  age  dependence  of  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16,  and  18  responses  following administration of a 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine To observationally compare anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 responses following administration of a 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine among HPV-naïve women 24 to 45 years of age enrolled in P019 and HPVnaïve women 16 to 23 years of age from P011, P012 (substudies of P013) and the Consistency Lot substudy of P015. The immunogenicity of the HPV vaccines was measured using the method competitive Luminex-based immunoassay (cLIA). The method was requalified as cLIA version 2. Outcomes/endpoints The immunogenicity endpoints for the clinical program have focused on 2 parameters: Anti-HPV levels (geometric mean titers [GMTs]), The proportion of subjects who became seropositive to each of the 4 HPV antigens 4 weeks after the third dose.

## The immunogenicity time points of interest were:

Month 7: The primary immunogenicity endpoint was anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 serum cLIA levels at Month 7 in the defined PPI population, as this time point reflected the time frame during which peak vaccine-induced immune responses were expected.

Persistence time points. Depending on the protocol, subjects underwent serology testing at 6- to 48month intervals  following  the  Month  7  visit.    The  data  collected  at  these  time  points  were  used  to evaluate the durability of vaccine-induced anti-HPV responses.

GMTs Table  14  shows  the  anti-HPV  6,  anti-HPV  11,  anti-HPV  16,  and  anti-HPV  18  geometric  mean  titers (GMTs)  for  each  of  the  vaccine  group  and  placebo  group  in  the  per-protocol  immunogenicity  (PPI) population at Day 1, Month 7, Month 12, and every 12 months thereafter through Month 48. For each of the vaccine HPV types, and at all the time points evaluated, the GMTs in the placebo group were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay. In the vaccine group for each vaccine HPV type, measurable immune responses well above the LLOQ were induced by a 3-dose vaccination of qHPV vaccine at Month 7 (table 14 ). For each of anti-HPV-6, 11, -16, and -18, the GMTs declined from Month 7 through Month 24. The Month 24 GMTs were then sustained through Month 48.

The percent seroconversion at Month 7 was at least 97% for each of the vaccine HPV types. For each of anti-HPV-6, -11, and -16, the percent seropositive at Month 7 declined by no more than 10 percentage points through Month 48. For  anti-HPV  18,  the  percent  seroconversion  at  Month  7  declined  by  approximately  50  percentage points through Month 48 and the percentage seropositive was 47.9%. Vaccine-type anti-HPV responses by age group in the HPV naïve population When  analysed  by  age  strata  no  significant  differences  in  the  distribution  of  anti-HPV  GMTs  or seroconversion  rates  were  observed.  The  antibody  decay  profile  by  time  was  similar  in  both  age groups. Overall the distribution of HPV titers was slightly lower in the 35 to 45 year-olds compared to 24  to  34  year-olds.  At  Month  48,  50.7%  of  the  younger  women  and  45%  of  the  older  remained seropositive to HPV 18. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Comparison of 16 to 23 year-olds and 25 to 45 year-olds

The vaccine-induced anti-HPV GMTs were lower (except for anti-HPV 16) in MAW compared with the younger women, both at Month 7 and Month 24. The GMTs decreased as the age progressed and were lowest in the 35 to 45 age stratum. At the current stage, the clinical relevance of the decreased GMTs in MAW is not known, since no immunological correlate of protection has been identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  seroconversion  rate  for  each  HPV  vaccine  type  was  generally  comparable  in  all  age  groups  at Month 7, but was somewhat lower at Month 24 in the older age groups. For HPV 18, the seropositivity rate at Month 48 was 61% in women 16 to 23 years of age, 51% in women 23 to 34 years of age and 45% in women 35 to 45 years of age.

Vaccine HPV type anti-HPV responses in populations with prior HPV exposure

<!-- image -->

The vaccine induced a significant Month 7 immune response to all HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 types in MAW and seroconversion rate was above 97% for each of the vaccine HPV types. The strongest responses were demonstrated against HPV 16 and the weakest response to HPV 18. At Month 24 the GMTs had decreased  substantially,  in  particular  with  respect  to  anti-HPV  18  (GMT:  28mMU/mL),  but  then remained stable until Month 48 including for anti-HPV 18 (23 mMU/mL). The antibody level for HPV18 at  Month  24-48  is  below  that  measured  in  naturally  infected  subjects  (37  mMU/mL).  The  percent seroconversion was maintained above 91% through Month 48 for anti-HPV 6, 11 and 16. In contrast

Seropositive/PCR negative population (S1P0) At Day 1 anti-HPV GMTs were comparable in the two vaccination groups. At Month 7 the GMTs in the vaccine group increased at greater magnitude compared to those in the HPV-naïve, S1P1 and S0P1 populations. In general, for each of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the distribution of anti-HPV in this population declined from Month 7 through Month 24, and the distribution of anti-HPV at Month 24 was sustained through Month 48. The antibody levels were higher than those in the HPV naïve women at all time points. However, the sample size was very small compared to the sample size of the HPV naïve population. Seropositive/PCR positive population (S1P1) The number of evaluable patients was limited. In the placebo group GMTs were somewhat higher than those observed in the seropositive/PCR negative group. The results showed that the antibody levels were higher than those in HPV naïve women at all times. Seronegative/PCR positive population(S0P1) The  number  of  evaluable  patients  was  small.  In  general  the  anti-HPV  GMTs  were  lower  than  those observed in the seropositive populations.  It is to be noted that the trends observed are not necessarily robust due the very small sample size of the Day 1 seronegative and PCR positive population. Analysis of maternal transfer of Anti-HPV This investigation aimed at characterising the titer of anti-HPV type 6/11 in both peripartum maternal blood and in cord blood of infants born to women who received blinded therapy in P019 in Thailand and the  Philippines.  It  was  a  pre-specified  exploratory  immunogenicity  objective  in  P019.  There  were  a total of 44 subjects with mother-infant serology data of which 24 originated from the vaccinated group and  20  from  the  placebo  group.  The  maternal  serum  and  cord  blood  samples  were  obtained  at  a median time of 28 months post-dose 3. The results showed that for each of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 maternal anti-HPV was detected in cord blood samples. Moreover, HPV titers in cord blood samples were highly positively correlated with maternal HPV titers. 1.3.3 Discussion Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for HPV 18, only 48% of the subjects were still seropositive at Month 48.  Despite the nominal loss of seropositivity, no cases of HPV 18 infection or disease were observed in the PPE population during the 4 year follow-up period. In the HNRT population, there was one case of HPV 18 persistent infection that started during the vaccine period Day 1 and Month 7.

In  the  previous  2007  procedure  the  MAH  addressed  the  issue  regarding  the  choice  of  serological testing  methodology.  The  currently  used  serological  cLIA  assay  may  not  be  the  optimal  method  to measure long-term vaccine induced HPV immunity. This assay might be too specific measuring only antibodies  against  a  single  type-specific  neutralizing  epitope  on  L1  VLPs  and  not  all  relevant neutralizing  antibodies.  Therefore,  the  MAH  have  committed  to  perform  serological  studies  using broader  neutralization  assays,  i.e.  pseudo-neutralization  assays  (see  letter  of  undertaking),  and submitted the validation protocol and final results using the newly developed assay measuring the VLPspecific total IgG. When analysed by the two pre-specified age strata, no significant differences in the distribution of antiHPV GMTs or seroconversion rates were observed. The antibody decay profile by time was similar in both  age  groups.  Overall  the  distribution  of  HPV  titers  was  slightly  lower  in  the  35  to  45  year-olds compared to 24 to 34 year-olds. At Month 48, 50.7% of the younger women and 45% of the older remained seropositive to HPV 18. The study demonstrated that administration of the vaccine to baseline HPV vaccine-type naïve 24- to 45-year-old women resulted in anti-HPV 6/11/16/18 responses at Month 7 that were lower than those observed in 16- to 23- year-old (non-overlapping 95% CIs up to Month 24). The exception was antiHPV 16 GMTs that were comparable between the two age groups. The GMTs decreased as the age progressed and were lowest in the 35 to 45 age stratum. At the present time, the clinical relevance of the decreased GMTs in MAW is not known, since no immunological correlate of protection has been identified.  The  seroconversion  rate  for  each  HPV  vaccine  type  was  generally  comparable  in  all  age groups at Month 7, but was somewhat lower at Month 24 in the older age groups. For HPV 18, the seropositivity rate at Month 48 was 61% in women 16 to 23 years of age, 51% in women 23 to 34 years of age and 45% in women 35 to 45 years of age. Subjects who were positive to the relevant HPV type at baseline had substantially higher GMTs. These data suggest the qHPV vaccine induces an anamnestic response in individuals seropositive as a result of prior natural infection. In  an  exploratory  analysis  maternal-infant  transfer  of  anti-HPV  antibodies  was  demonstrated  at  a median of 28 months postdose 3 and showed high correlation coefficients for all HPV types. The clinical significance  of  the  antibody  titers  measured  in  the  cord  blood  of  infants  is  not  known  since immunological correlates of protection have not been established. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In conclusion the vaccine-induced immune responses in MAW seem robust, but were lower than those observed in younger 16- to 23- year-old women. The consequence of these lower antibody responses in MAW for long-term efficacy is not known since no minimum anti-HPV level that confers protection has been defined. The low persistence of GMTs and seropositivity for HPV 18 at end-of-study did not translate  into  loss  of  efficacy,  but  will  have  to  be  closely  monitored  in  the  future.  The  MAH  has committed  to  conduct  a  10-year  follow-up  of  Protocol  019  in  Columbia  to  evaluate  long  term

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunogenicity and efficacy in mid-adult women, which is satisfactory. The MAH has also committed to apply broader neutralization assays to further characterize the vaccine induced immune responses.

## 1.4 Clinical safety

The post-marketing experience with qHPV vaccine is summarised from the International Birthdate (1 June 2006) in 6-monthly PSUR's. More than 51,000,000 doses of this vaccine were distributed as of 31 May 2009, data lock point of the most recent PSUR. The post licensure experiences with the vaccine collected through passive reporting of spontaneous adverse experiences to the MAH has shown a low frequency of reported serious adverse experiences. The MAH submitted complete summaries for all new fatal and nonfatal SAEs and discontinuations due to an adverse experience not reported in the Protocol 019 CSR for safety data (interim report) and new medical history collected through 23 June 2009. In addition, the complete summaries for pregnancies and lactation outcomes were provided. 1.4.1 Protocol 019 Patient exposure The Safety Population is defined as all subjects who were enrolled in P019 and who received at least one vaccination. This population included 3810 subjects (1908 subjects who received qHPV vaccine and 1902 subjects who received placebo). The new data in the current submission are adverse events reported during the follow-up period till end of the study i.e. from July 14, 2007 till June 23, 2009. The  final  study  visit  associated  with  the  end-of-study  (i.e.  the  last  visit  in  which  last  subject  who required follow-up for an HPV-related abnormality observed on an end-of study visit) occurred on 30 April 2009. The last date in which pregnancy outcomes data were collected was 23 June 2009. Adverse events A  total  of  14  (0.7%)  subjects  who  received  qHPV  vaccine  and  16  (0.8%)  of  subjects  who  received placebo experienced a Serious Adverse Experience at any time during the study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

During the period 13 July 2007 until 23 June 2009, there was 1 non-related SAE's in the 1 vaccine group and 2 in the placebo group. There were no Serious Adverse Experiences judged by the study investigator to be vaccine-related. The vaccination groups were also comparable with respect to the types of serious adverse experiences reported. The most common serious adverse experiences in both vaccination groups were infections and pregnancy complications. Overall, 9 subjects discontinued from the  study  due  to  an  adverse  experience.  Of  these  subjects  7  (0.4%)  received  qHPV  vaccine  and  2 (0.1%) received placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse events and deaths

## Deaths

A total of 8 deaths have been reported in Protocol 019 as of 23 June 2009. A total of 7 deaths (0.4%) have been reported in the qHPV group and 1 death (0.1%) has been reported in the placebo group. All deaths in the study were determined by the investigator to be \"definitely not\" related to the vaccine. Since the interim CSR for Protocol 019, there are 3 additional subjects with fatal adverse experiences. All  3  were  in  the  qHPV  group.  In  none  of  the  described  3  additional  fatal  events  which  occurred  in connection  with  a  history  of  administration  of  qHPV  vaccine  was  a  close  temporal  relationship  to administration of dose 3 and the fatal events were considered not to be related to study therapy. Serious adverse events In  addition  to  the  8  fatalities,  24  subjects  (9  in  the  qHPV  group  and  15  in  the  placebo  group) experienced  nonfatal  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences  during  the  entire  study  period.  Since  the endpoint-driven  CSR,  there  have  been  3  additional  subjects  with  nonfatal  serious  clinical  adverse experiences. One is in the group that received qHPV (cervical bleeding) and 2 are in the group that received  placebo  (cervical  bleeding  and  vaginal  bleeding).  The  described  adverse  events  were  all considered to be related to study procedure i.e. cervical biopsies as part of the study protocol but not to the study therapy. New medical history in the safety population The most commonly reported new medical conditions during the Day 1 to Month 7 and the post Month 7 follow-up period, respectively were infections such as bacterial vaginosis, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection; with similar incidence in both groups. Safety in special groups The proportions of subjects who reported new medical history consistent with potential autoimmune phenomena were comparable between the vaccination group. The AE non-specific arthritis/arthropathy is specifically addressed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Two new cases of arthritis were reported in the qHPV vaccination group and 1 new case in the placebo group. Although listed such events should be continuously monitored and reported on in future PSURs, Pregnancy Overall, 499 subjects (~13% of the study population) reported at least one pregnancy from Day 1 to 23 June 2009. At the time of the closing of the study database for this EOS analyses, outcomes were available for 95.3% of pregnancies in the qHPV vaccine group and 96.0% of pregnancies in the placebo group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  proportions  of  pregnancies  resulting  in  fetal  loss  were  comparable  between  the  2  vaccination groups. A total of 12 congenital anomalies were reported for pregnancies (live births, fetal losses) in subjects in Protocol 019. Of these, 6 were in infants and 2 in a fetus of subjects in the group that received qHPV vaccine and 5 were in infants and 1 in a fetus of subject in the group that received placebo. New congenital anomalies were reported in 4 infants and 1 fetus of subjects who received qHPV vaccine  (1  infant  each  with  ankyloglossia,  Meckel's  diverticulum,  mesenteric  cyst,  syndactyly,

CHMP variation assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and trisomy 21). New congenital anomalies were reported in 3 infants and 1 fetus of subjects who received placebo (1 each of inguinal hernia, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary artery stenosis, and trisomy 13, Turner's syndrome). None of these observed congenital anomalies, however, indicated any safety signal which could be considered related to the study therapy.

Since the primary endpoint analysis in 2007 (interim report), 246 new pregnancies were reported in 194 subjects (97 in the qHPV group and 97 in the placebo group.  During the whole study, a slightly smaller proportion of subjects in the qHPV vaccine group became pregnant compared with the placebo group (12.4% vs. 13.8% respectively). The proportions of pregnancies resulting in live birth and fetal loss  were  comparable  in  the  group  that  received  qHPV  vaccine  compared  with  the  placebo  group (78.9% versus  76.9%,  and  18.8%  versus  21.4%  for  subjects  receiving  qHPV  vaccine  and  placebo, respectively).

The MAH has submitted a revised Risk Management Plan (version 4) in December 2009. The revised RMP has been adequately updated in relation to the extension of the indication to mid-adult women, including a commitment to perform a long-term observational study on viral type replacement, longterm effectiveness/immunogenicity and long-term safety in Columbia. The assessment of the outline of this study protocol is ongoing. Furthermore the MAH has submitted a further revision of the RMP that is under evaluation.

The proportions of pregnancies with natural outcomes that ended in a negative outcome were 19.1% (49/257) in the group that received qHPV vaccine and 20.3% (56/276) in the placebo group. Administration of qHPV vaccine to lactating women No SAEs were reported among subjects who were breast-feeding during the study. Discussion The present safety data support the conclusion that qHPV vaccine is generally well tolerated in 24-45 year old women. There were no new vaccine-related serious adverse experiences. No safety signals have been identified  with  the  exception  of  the previously  observed  increased  incidences of  transient injection-site adverse experiences and low-grade fever following vaccination. Use of qHPV vaccine did not  impact  overall  pregnancy  outcomes.  Administration  of  qHPV  vaccine  to  nursing  mothers  did  not affect the health of the mother or the nursing child. The additional data obtained in the follow-up of Protocol-019 further confirm the profile observed before. Additionally the MAH committed to update the CHMP with regard to the feasibility of extending to 45 years of age the ongoing PGRx studies. The objective of the ongoing PGRx studies is to assess whether the use of Silgard is associated with a modified risk for 8 autoimmune diseases in females aged 14-26 years old, residing in France (see letter of undertaking). 1.5 Pharmacovigilance system 1.5.1 Risk Management Plan Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.6 Overall discussion and benefit-risk assessment

The  results  at  end  of  study  confirmed  and  extended  the  efficacy  of  the  qHPV  vaccine  in  MAW demonstrated in the 2007 endpoint driven analysis. The qHPV vaccine was highly efficacious in the PPE population with respect to the relevant endpoints, persistent infection, CIN and EGL. High efficacy was observed with respect to HPV 16 and HPV 18 individually, with respect to persistent infection alone and with  respect  to  disease  endpoints  (CIN,  AIS,  or  EGL)  alone.  There  were  no  new  cases  of  HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN or EGL reported in the qHPV group since the first analysis. Hence, the results in study 019 showed significant vaccine efficacy in HPV naïve MAW and in similar magnitude as that shown  in  YAW.  In  the  FAS  population  improved  efficacy  results  were  demonstrated  during  the additional 2-year follow-up. The efficacy estimates against HPV 16/18-related PI/disease endpoint now reached statistical significance. There were a total of 48 (qHPV=21, placebo =27) cases of vaccine type related CIN 2/3 in the FAS population with no new cases in the vaccine group since the first analysis. The issues raised during the previous regulatory procedure, which included efficacy against HPV 16/18related  persistent  infection  by  duration  of  infection  (6  or  12  months),  relevance  of  the  HPV  6/11related persistent infection endpoint, poor vaccine efficacy in the FAS population, delayed clearance of HPV 16 infection in the Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative population of the vaccine group, and the potential  of  vaccine-induced  acceleration  of  disease  and  of  replacement  by  non-vaccine  types,  were properly addressed. The  vaccine-induced  immune  responses  in  MAW  were  robust,  but  lower  than  those  observed  in younger 16- to 23- year-old women. The consequence of these lower antibody responses in MAW for long-term  efficacy  is  not  known  since  no  minimum  anti-HPV  level  that  confers  protection  has  been defined. The low persistence of GMTs and seropositivity for HPV 18 at end-of-study did not translate into loss of efficacy, but need to be closely monitored in the future. The MAH has already committed to conduct a 10-year follow-up of Protocol 019 in Columbia to evaluate long term immunogenicity and efficacy  in  mid-adult  women,  which  is  satisfactory.  The  MAH  has  also  already  committed  to  apply broader neutralization assays to further characterize the vaccine induced immune responses (see letter of undertaking). Administration of qHPV vaccine is generally well tolerated in 24- to 45-year-old women. The present safety  data  support  the  conclusion  that  qHPV  vaccine  is  well  tolerated  and  displays  a  safety  profile similar  to  that  shown  in  previous  submissions.  No  safety  signals  have  been  identified  with  the exception of increased incidences of transient injection-site adverse experiences and low-grade fever following vaccination. There were no new vaccine-related serious adverse experiences in the present report. Additionally the MAH committed to update the CHMP with regard to the feasibility of extending to 45 years of age the ongoing PGRx studies (see letter of undertaking). The revised RMP version 4 in relation to the extension of the indication to mid-adult women has been adequately updated, including a commitment to perform a long-term observational study on viral type replacement, long-term effectiveness/immunogenicity and long-term safety in Columbia (see letter of undertaking). The assessment of the outline of the study protocol is on going. Annex II was updated with the revised version of the RMP. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The overall expected benefit of the qHPV vaccine in mid-adult women is lower than in the young adult women population, due to the higher level of baseline sero-/PCR-positivity and the much lower risk of acquiring of new HPV infection at older ages. However, based on the result in Protocol 019 it is evident that efficacy in HPV naïve older women is of the same magnitude as that in young adult women. Since the overall expected benefit of the qHPV vaccine in mid-adult women is lower than in the young adult women  population  the  CHMP  considered  important  to  alert  the  prescribers  that  HPV  exposure  and potential benefit should be considered in the decision to vaccinate an individual adult women. Further

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

important information for prescribers already mentioned in the product information include statements that  the  vaccine  does  not  protect  against  all  HPV  types  and  therefore  it  is  critical  that  the  women continue to attend routine cervical screening according to local recommendations and that Silgard is for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established clinical disease.

The product information was updated to reflect these data as detailed in section 3.7 and the above mentioned commitments were included in the letter of undertaking.

- external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types.

1.7 Changes to the product information Further to the assessment of the different proposals of the MAH to amend the Product Information and in the light of the assessment of the submitted data, the Product Information was revised as follows: Summary of Product Characteristics Section 4.1 'Therapeutic indication' The  MAH's  applied  to  extend  the  age  of  the  indication  for  women  up  to  45  years  old,  based  on submission of 4 years data of study 019. Furthermore the CHMP took the opportunity of this variation to simplify the wording of the indication and to harmonise it between the HPV vaccines. Since statistically significant efficacy results in the primary HPV16/18-related endpoint were demonstrated  in  the  ITT  population  at  end-of  study  (the  general  mid-adult  population  that  will  be vaccinated in clinical practice) the indication was revised to include the vaccination of women from the age of 9 years on wards. To harmonise the indication between the HPV vaccines and to simplify the wording of the indication the vaccine HPV types were replaced by 'certain oncogenic HPV types' since for both vaccines some cross protection  against  related  non-vaccine  HPV  types  have  been  demonstrated.  The  CHMP  included  the word 'certain' to make prescribers aware that the vaccine does not protect against all HPV oncogenic types. The information on the different HPV types is covered by a cross reference to section 5.1 where these data are presented. The paragraph detailing the basis for the indication: 'the indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Silgard in females 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Silgard  in  9-  to  15-year  old  children  and  adolescents.  Protective  efficacy  has  not  been  evaluated  in males.' was amended with the new data up to 45 years and moved to section 5.1. This paragraph was not considered necessary any longer in the indication since data were submitted for mid adult women and since a cross reference to sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication was included in this section. Therefore the new indication is as follows: 'Silgard is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of: -  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal)  and  cervical  cancer  causally  related  to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types Medicinal product no longer authorised

See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication.

The use of Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations.'

## Section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since  the  data  at  end-of  study  after  4  years  of  follow-up  now  demonstrate  statistically  significant vaccine efficacy in the FAS population for mid-adult women the relevant sentence based on the 2007 endpoint driven analysis was removed from this section.

Since the overall expected benefit of the qHPV vaccine is lower in sexually experienced women than in HPV naïve children/adolescents and substantially lower in mid-adult women than in the young adult women population the CHMP considered important to alert prescribers that HPV exposure and potential benefit  should  be  considered  in  the  decision  to  vaccinate  an  individual  adult  women.  Therefore,  the following sentence was modified and moved to the beginning of this section: 'the decision to vaccinate an individual woman should take into account her risk for previous HPV exposure and her potential benefit from vaccination'.

On 24 June 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet.

Section 4.6 'Pregnancy and lactation ' The MAH proposal to revise the numbers of women in the clinical development program that reported pregnancy was endorsed by the CHMP. Section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' The CHMP endorsed the update of the numbers in the safety population. Section 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties' The following paragraph: 'the indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Silgard in females 16 to 45 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Silgard in 9- to 15-year old children  and  adolescents.  Protective  efficacy  has  not  been  evaluated  in  males.'  was  moved  from section 4.1 to this section and updated based on new data. Efficacy in woman 24 through 45 years was updated with results from the PPE and FAS analyses after a follow up of 4 years.
