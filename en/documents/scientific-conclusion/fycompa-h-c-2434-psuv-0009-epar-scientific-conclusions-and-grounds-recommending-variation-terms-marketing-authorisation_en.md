## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Fycompa, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

Analysis of the data contained within this PSUR did not reveal any new safety concerns, new safety signals or adverse events not adequately reflected in the current perampanel SPC.

The PRAC considered that the overall risk/benefit of FYCOMPA remained favourable.

However, following a review of 6 events reported during this period with the code MedDRA SMQ of hostility/aggression, the PRAC agreed that amendments to the warning on aggression already present in section 4.4 of the SmPC were warranted as described below:

## Aggression

Aggressive  and  hostile  behaviour  has  been  reported  in  patients  receiving  perampanel  therapy.  In perampanel-treated  patients  in  clinical  trials  aggression,  anger  and  irritability  were  reported  more frequently  at  higher  doses.  Most  of  the  reported  events  were  either  mild  or  moderate  and  patients recovered  either  spontaneously  or  with  dose  adjustment.  However,  thoughts  of  harming  others, physical assault or threatening behaviour were observed in some patients (&lt;1% in perampanel clinical studies). Patients and caregivers should be counselled to alert a health care professional immediately if significant changes in mood or patterns of behaviour are noted. The dosage of perampanel should be reduced if such symptoms occur and should be discontinued immediately if symptoms are severe.

Cases of aggression have been reported and are dose related since they were more frequently reported with  higher  doses.    Most  of  these  events  were  either  mild  or  moderate  and  recovered  either spontaneously or with dose adjustment.  However, in some cases, reports of aggression were severe which led to discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, the dose titration should be followed (see section 4.2) and a dose reduction should be considered in case of persistence of aggressive symptoms.

These changes have been reflected in Section 2 of the PL as described below:

## Fycompa  may  make  you  aggressive,  angry  or  violent.  It  may  also  cause  you  to  have  unusual  or extreme changes in behaviour or mood.

No  new  relevant  information  on  efficacy  and  effectiveness  in  the  authorised  indication  became available during the period covered by this PSUR.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Fycompa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance perampanel is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
