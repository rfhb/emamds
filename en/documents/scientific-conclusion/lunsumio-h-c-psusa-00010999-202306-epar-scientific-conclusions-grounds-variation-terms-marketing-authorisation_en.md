## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for mosunetuzumab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports, reasonable temporal relationship, a plausible mechanism of action, and a possible class effect, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between mosunetuzumab and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing mosunetuzumab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mosunetuzumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing mosunetuzumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
