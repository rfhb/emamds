## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for naltrexone / bupropion, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data from cumulative reviews, including cases with a reasonable temporal relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of pharmacokinetic interaction with serotonergic agents, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between administration of naltrexone/bupropion and serotonin syndrome is at least a reasonable possibility.

In addition, based on data from cumulative reviews, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers that there is at least a reasonable possibility for a causal association between administration of naltrexone/bupropion and hypertensive crisis.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for naltrexone / bupropion the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing naltrexone / bupropion is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
