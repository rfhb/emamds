## I.INTRODUCTION

Roche submits, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) N°1901/2006, to the EMA the final report for study

'NV20911 - A phase I/II study of Invirase boosted with ritonavir in HIV infected infants and children 4 months to less than 6 years old' Previous studies PACTG397 and HIVNAT017 have provided data on the pharmacokinetics, safety and activity of saquinavir boosted with low dose ritonavir in HIV-infected children aged 4 to 16 years old. However,  these  studies  were  restricted  to  those  subjects  who  were  able  to  swallow  capsules  or tablets. Study  NV20911  was  therefore  designed  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics,  safety  and  antiviral activity  of  saquinavir/ritonavir  in  combination  with  background  ARVs  in  HIV-1  infected  infants  and children  4  months  to  &lt;6  years  of  age.  For  children  who  could  not  swallow  capsules,  the  capsules were  opened  and  the  powder  mixed  with  a  vehicle  before  the  dose  was  administered  following  a meal. II.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RATIONALE The purpose of this file is to summarize paediatric data on ritonavir-boosted Invirase collected by the MAH in a study with infants and children that has not been previously submitted to EMA. III.SUBMITTED DATA Study NV20911 An open label, multicenter study in HIV infected infants and young children stratified into 2 groups. · Group A: Infants 4 months to &lt;2 years old · Group B: Children 2 years to &lt;6 years old Objective(s): Primary 1. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir that, when boosted with ritonavir, provides a systemic exposure in HIV-1 infected infants and children 4 months to &lt;6 years similar to that which has been shown to be safe and effective in older children and adults. 2. To determine the safety and tolerability of saquinavir when boosted with ritonavir in HIV-1 infected infants and children 4 months to &lt;6 years of age. Secondary 1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir when given as a booster in combination with saquinavir in HIV-1 infected infants and children 4 months to &lt;6 years. 2. To evaluate the antiviral activity of saquinavir when boosted with ritonavir against HIV-1 infection in infants and children 4 months to &lt;6 years. Number of subjects: 18 (5 patients 4 months to &lt;2 years old and 13 patients 2 years to &lt;6 years old) Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: HIV-1  infected  infants  and  children  4  months  to  &lt;6  years  of  age  who,  in  the  judgment  of  the investigator, had a medical need for boosted PI therapy were to be included in the study.

Nucleoside  analogues  were  the  most  commonly  reported  previous  antiretroviral  treatment  with lamivudine  (67%;  12/18)  and  zidovudine  (39%;  7/18)  being  the  most  frequently  used  previous treatment in this class among both age groups.

Dosage and Administration: Patients received  saquinavir mesylate (Invirase 200 mg HC and/or Invirase 500 mg FCT) 50 mg/kg BID up to the adult dose of 1000 mg BID and  ritonavir (Norvir 80 mg/mL oral solution) 3 mg/kg BID for children weighing 5 to 15 kg or 2.5 mg/kg BID for children weighing 15 to 40 kg up to a dose of 100 mg for children weighing &gt;40 kg BID  in combination with other ARVs. At home saquinavir and ritonavir were to be taken concomitantly with food. On days on which blood sampling for pharmacokinetics occurred, dosing in the morning was to occur approximately 30 minutes after the start of breakfast. Patients could revise their ARV regimen when initiating saquinavir and ritonavir: Patients  with  a  viral  load  &lt;50  copies/mL  at  study  entry  could  continue  on  pre-study  nucleoside; patients with a detectable viral load had their nucleoside background ARV regimen optimized based on prior history, and results of genotypic resistance testing at screening, if possible. All patients had to be receiving &gt;2 nucleoside ARVs as background therapy in combination with saquinavir/ritonavir (lopinavir was also allowed). For patients who could not swallow saquinavir capsules, the 200 mg capsule(s) were opened and the contents  of  the  capsule  administered  in  a  vehicle  [sugar  syrup  (sorbitol  syrup  for  children  with diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance), jam or baby formula] and ritonavir oral solution. The choice of  vehicle  was  determined  by  patient/caregiver  preference.  Vehicle  could  be  changed  during  the course of the study. If the child started the study using opened saquinavir capsule(s) and then was able  to  swallow  capsules/tablets,  the  child  could  switch  to  closed  capsules/tablets.  Instructions  to prepare the medication were provided in the protocol. For patients who could swallow capsules and or tablets no vehicle was required. The Invirase 500 mg FCT was not to be crushed prior to administration. Norvir was dosed with a calibrated dosing syringe. Assessor's comments: Only one European centre included 8 Caucasian patients, the other patients were of Oriental origin. Mean age was 0.8 years in group A and 4.0 years in group B; mean weight was 9.4kg and 15.2kg in group A and B, respectively. Looking at the data listings only three children of the High Age Group were able to swallow Invirase capsules.  All  others  received  medication  by  opening  the  capsules  and  mixing  the  contents  with different vehicles, which might have introduced considerable variability. Previous Medications Previous Antiretroviral Therapy Ninety four percent (17/18) of all patients reported at least one previous antiretroviral therapy at screening. One patient in the High Age Group had no previous antiretroviral experience. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Concomitant Medications

Concomitant Antiretroviral Treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 18 patients were receiving concomitant antiretroviral treatment at baseline. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues were the most commonly used concomitant antiretroviral treatment at  baseline  with  lamivudine  (100%,  18/18  patients),  zidovudine  (67%,  12/18  patients)  and didanosine (28%, 5/18 patients) being the most commonly used agents in this class.

Assessments: Results Treatment Adherence Patients and their parent/caregiver were counselled on the importance of adherence to antiretroviral drugs  at  each  study  visit  where  assessments  of  adherence  were  performed  by  retrospective questioning and investigator assessment. The trial  treatment  was  in  general  well  accepted  with  a  high  degree  of  adherence.  The  saquinavir dose was missed on one ore more occasions by three patients. Disposition of patients Two  patients  were  withdrawn  prematurely  from  study  treatment  during  the  study  period.  One  of these patients (118176/4101) completed all scheduled study assessments. Patient 118168/1302 a Caucasian male patient &lt;1 year of age was withdrawn from study treatment on day 73. The reason for withdrawal was given on the CRF as 'failure to return'. Patient 118176/4101, a one year-old Oriental female patient was withdrawn from SQV/r treatment on  day  84  (due  to  insufficient  SQV/r  levels).  The  reason  for  withdrawal  was  given  on  the  CRF  as 'insufficient therapeutic response'. Assessor's comments: Two patients were withdrawn prematurely from study treatment during the study period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Adjusted to 50mg/kg (%CV,range): Ritonavir In general, dose normalized ritonavir exposures appeared to be higher the High Age Group patients: 13.6 vs. 21.8 hr*ug/mL for AUC0-12h, 577 vs. 995 ng/mL for Ctrough, and 2050 vs. 3370 ng/mL for Cmax  (table  not  shown).  In  addition,  dose  normalized  ritonavir  exposures  were  in  general comparable to the exposures observed in the HIVNAT 017 study. Assessor's comments: In  the  low  age  group  (A),  saquinavir  doses  ranged  from  400  mg  to  600  mg.  As  expected,  the exposure parameters exhibited a large inter-patient variability: AUC0-12h ranged from 2.10 to 43.8 hr*ug/mL, Cmax ranged from 331 to 6860 ng/mL, and average Ctrough ranged from 26.6 to 1090 ng/mL. In the high age group (B), saquinavir doses ranged from 600 mg to 1000 mg. Similar to Group A, the exposure parameters exhibited a large inter-patient variability: AUC0-12h ranged from 4.77 to 83.2 hr*ug/mL, Cmax ranged from 954 to 12100 ng/mL, and Ctrough ranged from 470 to 6420 ng/mL. However, the t1/2 was comparable across patients ranging from 2.15 to 5.25. The prescribed dose of 50 mg/kg of saquinavir boosted with the prescribed dose of ritonavir BID was adequate to achieve the desired Ctrough values in 10 of 13 patients.

No CDC category B and C HIV related illnesses were reported during the trial. Assessor's comment: The chosen parameters for antiretroviral  activity  are  acceptable  and  show  that  in  general  children responded to treatment over the duration of the study. Results are comparable to an earlier study in HIV-1 infected children aged 4 to 15 years receiving dual lopinavir/saquinavir based HAART (Roche Clinical  Study  Report  -  Protocol  ML19540).  While  results  between  treatment  groups  appear  to  be similar, the Low Age Group is too small to allow a definite conclusion. In the high age group, 11 of 13 children had &lt;400 HIV-1 copies at week 48 and the relative CD4 cell count change at week 48 was approx. 3%; there was 1 virological failure in that group.

## Safety

Overall, 78% (14/18) of patients reported at least one adverse event during the study. All 5 patients in  the  Low  Age  Group  (100%)  and  9/13  patients  (69%)  in  the  High  Age  Group  reported  adverse events.

'Infections and Infestations' was the class of adverse event most frequently recorded, being reported in 56% (10/18) of patients. Three of the 5 patients in the Low Age Group and 7/18 (54%) of patients in  the  High  Age  Group  recorded  at  least  one  adverse  event  in  this  body  system  class.  Bronchitis, recorded  in  3  patients  in  the  High  Age  Group  was  the  only  individual  adverse  event  in  this  body system reported in more than one patient. Gastrointestinal disorders were the next most frequently recorded adverse events being reported by 44% (8/18) of patients. Dental caries reported in 1 patient in the Low Age Group and 2 patients in the High Age Group, diarrhea reported in in 3 patients in the High Age Group, vomiting reported in 1 patient in the Low Age Group and 2 patients in the High Age Group and constipation reported in 2 patients in the Low Age Group were the only events reported in more than 1 patient each. Four of the eighteen patients (22%) experienced at least one adverse event during the study which was considered related to trial treatment by the investigator. Vomiting which was considered related to trial treatment by the investigator was experienced by 1 patient in the Low Age Group and 2 patients in the High Age Group. Other related adverse events reported in single patients in the High Age Group were abdominal pain lower and diarrhea. No deaths were reported during the 48 week study. Three patients experienced a serious adverse event during the course of the study. One patient in the Low Age Group and 1 patient in the High Age Group experienced pneumonia; 1 patient in the High Age Group experienced bronchitis. Nine patients experienced an elevation in blood triglyceride levels during the study and 5 patients experienced an elevation in LDL-cholesterol. The elevations observed were mostly less than Grade 2 (ACTG  laboratory  grading),  requiring  no  treatment  intervention  and  were  no  worse  than  in  other studies of PI based HAART in children. Assessor's comment: Three  patients  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  during  the  treatment  period,  which  were considered unrelated to trial treatment and resolved without sequelae. All  other  reported  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  the  most  commonly reported  individual  events  were  bronchitis,  dental,  caries,  diarrhoea  and  vomiting.  Four  patients experienced five adverse events considered related to trial treatment. These events were vomiting (3 patients), abdominal pain lower (1 patient) and diarrhea (1 patient). There were no deaths during the 48 weeks study period and no HIV-related illnesses were reported. No new or unexpected adverse reactions were seen. In summary, the safety of saquinavir/RTV in children of &lt;6 years at the given dose appears to be similar to that in adults. IV.CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION MAH conclusion The  NV20911  study  was  specifically  designed  to  evaluate  pharmacokinetics  of  ritonavir  boosted saquinavir  at  exposures  similar  to  that  which  had  been  shown  to  be  safe  and  effective  in  older children and adults, and to determine the safety and tolerability in children. The study was designed as a non-comparative open label study. The NV20911 study met the stated study objectives, and demonstrated pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of ritonavir boosted Invirase in paediatric patients 2 years to &lt;6 years of age at systemic exposures  of  saquinavir  that  had  previously  been  demonstrated  to  be  safe  and  effective  in  older children and adults. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition, the study demonstrated substantial and sustained viral suppression and stability in CD4 lymphocyte counts, further validating the extrapolation of efficacy from adult studies to the pediatric population. Thus, the benefit /risk assessment for use of ritonavir boosted Invirase as part of an ARV regimen in children 2 to &lt;6 years of age is positive.

## Assessor´s conclusion:

In  this  multicentre,  open-label  trial  18  HIV-1  infected  children  of  less  than  6  years  of  age  were treated  with  ritonavir-boosted  Invirase  in  combination  with  other  HIV-medications  for  48  weeks. Invirase was given at a dose of 50 mg/kg BID up to the adult dose of 1000 mg BID. All but one child were pre-treated with different ARV regimens reflecting predominant use of Invirase as a second line treatment  in  clinical  practice.  All  children  received  concomitant  ARV  treatment  as  required  in  the Invirase SPC.

For  patients  who  could  not  swallow  the  capsules,  the  200  mg  capsule(s)  were  opened  and  the contents of the capsule administered in a vehicle. It is noted that with the applied dosing approach less  precise  dosing  is  possible  which  led  to  a  highly  variable  exposure.  Therefore  a  paediatric formulation (e.g as a liquid) would in principle be the preferred option. Data  on  children  below  2  years  (3  of  5  children  evaluable  at  week  48)  is  too  limited  to  give  any recommendation. In  the  small  sample  of  children  between  2  and  6  years  of  age  the  dosing  regimen  resulted  in adequate  pharmacokinetic  exposure.  Target  Ctrough  levels  were  reached  in  10  of  13  patients, otherwise dose adjustments were made based on day 14 PK assessment.  Eleven of 13 children had &lt;400 HIV-1 copies at week 48 and the relative CD4 cell count change at week 48 was approx. 3%; there  was  1  virological  failure  in  that  group.  The  nature  of  the  safety  profile  was  similar  to  that reported in adults. In summary the dosing range of 600-1000mg in this study was safe and effective in this age group. Findings in this small sample of children between 2 and 6 years of age are not sufficiently robust to consider granting a paediatric indication for Invirase. However inclusion of the generated information in the SmPC could be useful to inform physicians on PK, efficacy and safety with the proposed dosing regimen. Comments: We surely cannot concur with the Applicant's conclusion that 'the benefit /risk assessment for use of ritonavir boosted Invirase as part of an ARV regimen in children 2 to &lt;6 years of age is positive ' when considering that - only 13 paediatric patients from 2 to 6 years old were included in this phase I/II study; - a large inter-patients variability in saquinavir dose and exposure was observed; and given the recent safety signal on QT prolongation raised through a dedicated study. We endorse the Rapporteur's conclusion that data issued from NV20911 study are not sufficiently robust to consider granting a paediatric indication of Invirase, and we even question the relevance of reflecting these unreliable data in the SPC. As a matter of fact, if any statement is to be made as regards this paediatric use it should consists of describing the high PK variability and the limited clinical data precluding any proper benefit/risk assessment. Assessor's comment: We agree with the positions that the data are too limited to allow a proper benefit risk assessment. However, reporting the results of the study with regard to PK and safety data in the higher age group is considered meaningful. Limitations of these data should be made clear when describing the study in section 5.1. V.REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTORY INFORMATION The  MAH should submit a proposal for  an  update  of  relevant  sections  of  the  SmPC  with  the  data generated in the age group between 2 and 6 years. It  could  be  considered  to  include  PK  data  in  section  5.2  and  the  safety  profile  in  section  4.8. Consideration should be given to describe the trial results in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised
