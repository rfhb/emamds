## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Human influenza viruses, the disease, and its prevention.

Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. The infection can cause mild to  severe  illness,  and  even  can  lead  to  death.  Uncomplicated  illness  is  characterized  by  the  abrupt onset of respiratory symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, and non-productive cough. The  illness  usually  resolves  after  about  one  week  for  the  majority  of  persons.  However,  the  viral infection  can  cause  primary  influenza  viral  pneumonia,  exacerbate  underlying  medical  conditions (such  as  diabetes,  pulmonary  or  cardiac  disease),  or  lead  to  secondary  bacterial  pneumonia;  all conditions which can lead to death. Influenza  viruses  cause  disease  among  persons  in  all  age  groups,  but  the  risks  for  complications, hospitalizations, and deaths are higher among persons aged &gt;65 years, young children, and persons with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular diseases or other serious underlying condition, where the infection lead to severe complications of the condition. Influenza is a globally important health problem, and epidemics of influenza typically occur annually during the fall  or  winter  months.  Although  the  incidence  of  influenza  each  season  is  very  variable, usually range from 5 to 20% of the population. Influenza  viruses  are  members  of  the  Orthomixoviridaes  family.  This  family  is  characterized  by including  a  number  of  enveloped  viruses  whose  genome  is  made  up  of  several  segments  of  linear, negative sense, single-stranded RNA. Within the family, influenza viruses are classified in three virus types  (A,  B  and  C)  based  in  the  absence  of  serological  cross-reactivity  of  the  two  major  internal proteins (Nucleoprotein and Matrix protein). Influenza A and B viruses are the two types that cause epidemics in humans. Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes on the basis of the two major  surface  proteins  of  the  virus:  the  hemagglutinin  (H)  and  the  neuraminidase  (N).  To  date,  16 different hemagglutinin subtypes (named H1 to H16) and 9 different neuraminidase subtypes (named N1 to N9) have been identified. Influenza A viruses can be further broken down into different strains. The current subtypes of influenza A viruses circulating in humans are H1N1 and H3N2. Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but also can be further broken down into different strains. Influenza virus infection induces both humoral and cellular immune responses, and a large body of data  shows  that  both  elements  play  a  role  in  prevention  of  infection  and  in  viral  clearance  during infection. The protective role of anti-HA antibodies has been widely demonstrated. In fact, anti-HA antibodies can neutralize the virus and inhibit hemagglutination induced by the virus in vitro. It has been repeatedly shown that in general high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres correlate directly with  protection,  and  in  fact,  there  are  EMEA  criteria  based  on  this  test,  which  should  be  fulfilled yearly for inactivated vaccines whenever the strain composition of the vaccine is changed. Studies in animal models and human have also demonstrated that CD8 (CTL) (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) cells are  involved  in  protection  and  recovering  from  infection,  but  the  contribution  of  CD4  mediated immune response in protection /recovery is much less well known. Thus, different elements contribute to the protective immune response but the exact contribution of each of them and the identification of a clear-cut surrogate parameter for protection are far from clear.

Antigenic  variation is a characteristic of the virus, and  involves  primarily the two  external glycoproteins of the virus: the HA and the NA. The mechanism by which small changes (mutations) are  introduced  continually  over  time  in  these  two  genes  is  denominated  'antigenic  drift.\"  The mutations are introduced during the replication of the viral genome in the infected cell, and if a new antigenic variant (with mutations in the HA and/or NA) is generated and this variant is not recognized by  the  body's  immune  system  mounted  against  a  previous  infection,  the  variant  will  expand  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

human  population.  Thus,  every  season  the  composition  of  the  vaccine  needs  to  be  adapted  in accordance with the circulating strains.

Vaccination against influenza virus is an important public health measure and is the primary strategy for preventing influenza infections and related severe complications. However, the immune response to vaccination in elderly is comparatively lower with respect to younger adults, highlighting the need for more immunogenic and effective vaccines for this population.

About the product Intanza is an intradermal influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) propagated in fertilized hens' eggs with a Micro-Injection System for delivery the vaccine via the intradermal route. The aim of the intradermal (ID) vaccination is to allow for the presentation of the vaccine antigens to a large number of dermal or interstitial dendritic cells which are able to induce an efficient immune response. In addition, the intradermal route of administration likely presents a lower risk of local neurovascular injury due to the short size of the needle. The  manufacturing  process  used  to  develop  the  intradermal  influenza  vaccine  is  based  on  the Applicant's intramuscular seasonal influenza vaccines process with an addition of a concentration step to obtain a concentrated monovalent bulk in order to formulate a lower volume vaccine for intradermal use.  Two  vaccine  dosages  are  formulated  from  the  concentrated  monovalent  bulk  to  target  two populations, adults and the elderly. The indication is: Prophylaxis of influenza in adults from 18 to 59 years of age, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications (9 microgram strength) and prophylaxis of influenza in individuals 60 years of age and over, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications (15 microgram strength). The vaccine is a suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe with a Micro-Injection System which should  allow  easy  fast  and  reproducible  injection  by  the  intradermal  route.  The  Micro-Injection System features an integral micro-needle which protrudes 1.5 mm from the proximal end of the glass syringe, a needle penetration depth limiter to ensure correct needle placement and a needle shielding system  that  protects  the  needle  after  injection  hence  reducing  the  risk  of  inadvertent  needle-stick injury. The active substances of Intanza are the purified influenza virus antigens of type A (H1N1), type A (H3N2)  and  type  B  strains.  The  composition  of  the  influenza  strains  will  be  those  officially recommended for the season. The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  complete  and  independent  application.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised  procedure  was  based  on demonstration of significant technical innovation, relating to the use of the intradermal route and the novel intradermal delivery system. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Intanza is an intradermal influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) propagated in fertilized hens' eggs  with  a  Micro-Injection  System  for  delivery  the  vaccine  via  the  intradermal  route.  Two vaccine  dosages  are  formulated  from  the  concentrated  monovalent  bulk  (i.e.  the  drug  substance)  to target  two  populations,  adults  (9 μ g  hemagglutinin/dose) and the elderly (15 μ g  hemagglutinin/dose). The  intradermal  influenza  vaccine  contains  antigens  from  each  of  the  three  influenza  virus  strains Type  A  (H1N1),  Type  A  (H3N2)  and  Type  B  in  phosphate  buffered  saline  (PBS)  solution.  The nominal  dose  of  product  is  0.1  ml.  The  composition  of  the  influenza  strains  will  be  the  officially recommended ones by the appropriate regulatory bodies.

The vaccine is a colourless and opalescent suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with  a  Micro-Injection  System.  The  Micro-Injection  System  is  a  pre-filled,  ready-to-use  syringe.  It features an integral micro-needle which protrudes 1.5 mm from the proximal end of the glass syringe,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a needle penetration depth limiter to ensure correct needle placement and a needle shielding system that protects the needle after injection hence reducing the risk of inadvertent needle-stick injury.

## Drug Substance

The  concentrated  monovalent  bulk  is  a  concentrated  aqueous  suspension  of  inactivated,  split  viral particles  that  were  propagated  in  embryonated  eggs  and  purified  by  zonal  centrifugation.  The reference  viral  strains  used  to  prepare  the  concentrated  monovalent  bulks  are  selected  based  on  the annual recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) and are supplied by WHO Collaborative Centers. The influenza strains are derived as follows:

-Influenza type A seed strains: since the early 1970s, type A strains are prepared by genetic reassortment  using  the  field  strains  chosen  by  WHO  experts  and  an  A/PR8/34  or  PR8-like master strain to ensure a satisfactory growth in embryonated eggs. -Influenza type B seed strains: type B strains are field isolates because no master B strain has yet  been  found  that  improves  the  growth  performance  of  influenza  B  viruses  in  egg-based production systems. For  2006-2007  manufacturing  campaign  used  for  validations  and  Phase  III  clinical  studies,  the reference viral strains were provided by World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborative Centers and were as follows: -Strain A/New Caledonia/20/99 IVR-116 (H1N1): reassortant strain between A/New Caledonia/20/99 and IVR-6 (A/Texas/1/77) -Strain A/Wisconsin/67/2005 NYMC X-161 (H3N2): reassortant strain between A/Wisconsin/67/2005 and A/PR/8/34 -Strain B/Malaysia/2506/2004: non-reassortant strain · Manufacture The manufacturing process of the drug substance consists of two phases: -The manufacture of the intermediate: the unconcentrated monovalent bulk -The manufacture of the drug substance: the concentrated monovalent bulk The  manufacturing  process  used  to  develop  the  intradermal  influenza  vaccine  is  based  on  the Applicant's  intramuscular  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  (Vaxigrip)  process  with  the  addition  of  a concentration  step  to  obtain  a  lower  volume  vaccine  for  intradermal  use.

The allantoic fluid is harvested, clarified  by  centrifugation  and  filtration,  and  then  concentrated  by  ultrafiltration.  The  concentrated monovalent harvest is  then  purified  by  zonal  centrifugation.  A  filtration  is  performed.  Octoxynol-9 solution (the splitting agent) is added, the split viral suspension is clarified by centrifugation and the octoxynol-9  content  is  reduced  by  diafiltration.  A  formaldehyde  solution  is  added  to  the  viral suspension for the inactivation. The inactivated and split viral suspension is filtered and diluted in PBS resulting in the unconcentrated monovalent bulk. Manufacture of concentrated monovalent bulk One or several batches of unconcentrated monovalent bulk are concentrated by ultrafiltration and then -filtered, resulting in the concentrated monovalent bulk (drug substance). The concentrated monovalent bulk is filled into containers and stored at 5°C. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Banking system

The manufacture of the seed lot system from the inoculation of eggs to the final filling and storage, used for all three influenza strains, has been adequately described.

In  compliance  with  Ph.Eur.  monograph  0158,  the  total  number  of  passages  from  the  approved reassortant virus up to the Working Seed Lot will not exceed 15.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  tests  performed  on  seed  lots  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  0158  'Influenza  vaccine  (split virion, inactivated)' except for the determination of the infectious titer, which is an additional test. The applicable requirements of Ph. Eur. monograph 0153 'Vaccines for Human use' are also covered.

## Controls of critical steps and intermediates

The following three manufacturing steps are considered critical for the concentrated monovalent bulk quality:

- -Purification

-Splitting -Inactivation The  in-process  controls,  limits  and  tests  are  considered  adequate.  Several  in-process  controls  are performed  on  the  concentrated  monovalent  bulk  to  ensure  the  proper  control  of  the  manufacturing process as a whole. Appearance, pH and endotoxin content are carried out in compliance with Ph. Eur. monographs.  Assays  for  residual  formaldehyde  and  Ovalbumin  have  been  described  and  found acceptable. The only intermediate in the drug substance manufacturing is the unconcentrated monovalent bulk. Specifications, methods and results of batch analyses for this intermediate have been provided and are considered appropriate. The specifications are in accordance with Ph.Eur. monograph 0158 Process validation and/or evaluation Validation  data  was  provided  for  the  manufacturing  steps  considered  to  be  critical:  purification, splitting and inactivation. In addition, data on clearance of neomycin, preservation of neuraminidase activity, and elimination of impurities during the concentration step were provided. The inactivation and splitting have been adequately validated. A major objection was raised at day 120 regarding the validation of the avian leucosis viruses and avian cultivable mycoplasma inactivation by the splitting and inactivation process. Upon request, the Applicant  provided  satisfactory  data  demonstrating  that  the  process  is  capable  of  inactivating  these pathogens and therefore the major objection was considered resolved. Manufacturing process development The manufacturing process was developed starting from the manufacturing process of the influenza monovalent  bulk  used  in  the  Applicant's  seasonal  influenza  vaccine.  The  main  target  of  the manufacturing  process  development  was  to  obtain  a  sufficiently  high  hemagglutinin  content  in  a reduced volume (0.1 ml) suitable for intradermal administration. In  order  to  perform  clinical  dose  ranging  studies,  different  strengths  of  finished  product  were developed all along the process development. A concentration factor was selected and used for the manufacture of the Phase III clinical batches. The concentration step was performed by ultrafiltration which enables hemagglutinin and ovalbumin to be separated due to their different molecular weights. Characterisation The characterisation tests focus primarily on the characterization of the active moieties of the viruses, i.e. ,  the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens. In addition, several tests are performed to verify the purity of the unconcentrated and concentrated monovalent bulks. HA and NA identification as well as HA content have been tested at different steps of the production (from MSL to concentrated monolvalent Bulk) in accordance to the Ph Eur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three  impurities  are  routinely  assayed  in  the  unconcentrated  and  concentrated  monovalent  bulk: Ovalbumin,  Octoxynol-9  and  Formaldehyde.  The  limits  for  the  impurities  are  justified.  Results  of three batches of unconcentrated bulk for each strain have been presented demonstrating levels below the acceptance limit in all cases.

The  suspension  is  presented  in  a  0.5  ml  Type  I  glass  barrel  with  special  tip  for  intradermal administration. The glass barrel is fitted with a staked needle, which is covered by a needle shield. The syringe is closed by an elastomeric plunger stopper. The container closure system is assembled with a plastic pusher and a Needle Shielding System (NSS) to form a Micro-Injection System. The assembled product is packaged in a blister pack, which is then packaged in an outer cardboard box. · Pharmaceutical Development The pharmaceutical development was based on experience gained by the Applicant with its seasonal influenza  vaccine  for  intramuscular  administration.  Different  strengths  of  the  intradermal  influenza vaccine  were  tested  to  identify  the  strength  equivalent  to  15 µg hemagglutinin/strain/dose  of  the intramuscular influenza vaccine for each target population. The doses chosen were 9 µg for the adult population and 15 µg for the elderly population. The development of the intradermal influenza vaccine specifically focused on the development of the Micro-Injection System. The key targets of the development of the Micro-Injection System were to facilitate  the  correct  intradermal  injection  of  the  vaccine  without  any  user  training  and  to  provide protection  against  unintentional  puncturing  post-injection.  An  intermediate  version  of  the  MicroInjection System was used in Phase I clinical studies, however the final Micro-Injection System was used in the Phase II and Phase III clinical studies. · Adventitious Agents Biological materials used in the production of the drug substance and drug product are: -Fertilized SPF eggs (used in the production of seed lots). The fertilized SPF eggs comply with Ph. Eur. 5.2.2. SPF eggs are sourced from validated external suppliers guaranteeing appropriate standards. Embryonated eggs (used in the production of monovalent bulks). The embryonated hen eggs from healthy flocks are used for the production of the concentrated monovalent harvest. The flocks are inspected, the animals immunized and adequately controlled. Influenza strains. Quality Control tests were performed for each of the three influenza strains by the WHO Collaborative Center supplying the strain. Compliance with the Center's specifications is certified by a certificate of analysis, accompanying each virus at delivery. Medicinal product no longer authorised

During the manufacturing process of the concentrated monovalent bulk of influenza strains, the virus in  suspension  is  first  split  by  octoxynol-9,  and  then  inactivated  by  formaldehyde.  The  splittinginactivation process was proven effective for the complete inactivation of all three influenza strains. The  inactivation method  has  also been demonstrated to inactivate avian leucosis virus and mycoplasma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No material derived from animals naturally susceptible to TSE is used for the preparation of the MSL, ISL, WSL or the concentrated monovalent bulk batches.

## · Manufacture of the Product

- -The manufacture of the vaccine consists of the blending of the concentrated monovalent bulks of  the  three  influenza  strains  with  PBS solution.  The  mixture  is  homogenized  and  is  then filtered to obtain the Final Bulk Product.

The  syringe  is  equipped  with  a  needle  shielding  device  with  a  protective  sleeve  that  automatically covers the needle after injection, to protect from needle stick injuries.

-Aseptic  filling  is  performed  in  compliance  with  current  GMP  regulations  on  the  sterile manufacture of medicinal products. The  filled  syringes  are  assembled  with  the  Needle  Shielding  Systems,  the  pushers  are  fixed  to  the elastomeric  stoppers  and  the  Needle  Shielding  Systems  are  labelled.  The  assembled  products  are blistered  and  placed  in  outer  cardboard  boxes.  After  packaging,  the  Medicinal  Product  is  stored  at +5°C ± 3°C. Process Validation and/or Evaluation The manufacturing of the Finished Product has been appropriately validated. Three full-scale batches of  Final  Bulk  Product  of  each  strength  were  manufactured  under  worst-case  conditions  in  terms  of possible degradation of the product (i.e., maximal mixing speed and time). All six batches complied with the in-process control acceptance criteria and the FBP specifications. Three  batches  of  each  strength  of  the FBP  were  filled  .The  study  showed  that  the  filling  process consistently resulted in a Finished Product meeting the predefined specifications. The aseptic conditions of the filling process were evaluated. No contaminated syringes were detected. · Product Specification The specifications for the vaccine comply with Ph.Eur and are found acceptable. The specifications for the  9  and  15  µg  hemagglutinin/dose  strength  are  the  same  apart  from  the  specification  for Hemagglutinin content. Batch analysis Batch  release  data  from  three  batches  of  9 µg HA/dose  and  three  batches  of  15 µg HA/dose  were presented.  All  results  complied  with  the  acceptance  criteria.  The  HA  results  confirm  a  consistency between batches of the vaccine. Container closure The packaging materials in contact with the product are: 1.

The justification for choosing the components of the Micro-Injection System has been provided and compatibility, integrity and technical performance has been satisfactorily described.

- Stability of the Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stability testing was performed on three batches of each strength of the Finished Product in real-time / real-temperature conditions (12 months  at +5°C ± 3°C)  and  in accelerated conditions  (1 month at +25°C ± 2°C). The batches used for the process validation were also used for the stability studies, i.e. the batches have been produced using the phase III process.

The stability study has shown, that after 12-month storage in real-time conditions (+5°C ± 3°C), the physico-chemical parameters are stable and conform to the acceptance criteria.

During the initial evaluation a major objection was raised in relation to the stability results of the drug product.  The  Applicant  provided  a  satisfactory  response  ,  including  a  committment  to  perform  a further  study  to  address  this    issue  The  major  objection  is  therefore  considered  resolved  and  the proposed shelf life of 12 months (at +5°C ± 3°C) is found acceptable. 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Introduction Two non-clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in mice. ID injections were performed with the Mantoux method as the Micro-Injection System was not adapted to the mouse skin. These studies demonstrated that ID injection results in an equal or stronger antibody response and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) when compared to IM injection. Two repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in rabbits. Toxicology studies were conducted according to GLP. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics The studies carried out in mice were intended to evaluate the immunogenicity of a trivalent influenza vaccine  when  delivered  by  the  ID  route,  in  comparison  to  the  same  vaccine  administered  IM.  In addition,  the  persistence  of  antibodies  was  evaluated.  The  levels  of  antibodies  were  determined  by ELISA against antigens of the three viral strains present in the vaccine and by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against the H1N1 virus only. The immunogenicity of the ID trivalent influenza vaccine in mice is as good as the IM vaccine. The Applicant provided data from one study in mice in which antibodies to the three influenza viral strains (H1, H3 and B strains.) present in the vaccine were measured, and satisfactory immune response was raised against the three antigens. No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted. The composition of the vaccine is identical to the already approved intramuscular vaccine. No studies on safety pharmacology are required. Drug interactions have not been investigated Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  Applicant  has  not  included  information  regarding  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacokinetic  drug interactions studies. Nevertheless the guideline for non-clinical testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) states 'distribution studies should be considered … when alternative routes of administration  are  intended  to  be  used.'  Although  this  data  probably  would  not  provide  clinically relevant information, this extent is unknown.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

No single dose toxicity studies were conducted. According to the guideline 'Pre-clinical pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of  vaccines'  (CPMP/SWP/465/95)  single  dose  toxicity studies are required. Nevertheless single dose toxicity study was not considered necessary as the safety evaluation was assessed in the repeated dose toxicity studies.

· Repeat dose toxicity The Applicant conducted two repeated dose toxicity studies in rabbits. One  repeated  Dose  Toxicity  Study  by  the  ID,  IM  or  Alternate  ID  (at  6  and  9  µg  HA/Influenza Strain/Dose) and IM (at 15 µg HA/Influenza Strain/Dose) Routes. The objective of the study was to determine the local tolerance and systemic toxicity of the influenza vaccine in rabbits after IM injections at 15 μ g HA/influenza strain or ID injections at 6 (low dose) or 9 (high  dose) μ g  HA/influenza  strain  or  alternate  IM  and  ID  administrations  at  two-week  intervals. Similar high levels of serum IgG titers directed against A/H1N1 strain were observed in vaccinated animals,  irrespective  of  dose  and  administration  route.  Toxicological  findings  were  limited  to  local reactions  at  the  injection  site.  Moderate  to  severe  local  reactions  (erythema  and  oedema)  were observed  at  the  intradermal  injection  site  following  repeated  intradermal  treatment  or  alternate intramuscular  and  intradermal  administrations.  Repeated  IM  injection  induced  no  macroscopic changes but a minimal to moderate interstitial inflammation at the injection site in all animals and a minimal to moderate muscle necrosis in one male and all females. Recovery after 14 days was almost complete at the ID sites and was partial at the IM sites with a low incidence of minimal interstitial inflammation seen microscopically. Repeated Dose Toxicity Study by Alternate IM (at 15 µg HA/Influenza Strain/Dose) and ID (at 15 or 21  µg  HA/Influenza  Strain/Dose)  Routes.  The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  local tolerance  of  the  intradermal  influenza  vaccine  at  15  and  21 μ g  HA/influenza  strain  and  systemic toxicity of the 21 μ g HA/influenza strain after three administrations at two-week intervals via either the ID or IM route in rabbits. Similar high levels of serum IgG titers directed against A/H1N1 strain were observed in vaccinated animals, irrespective of dose and administration route. One IM administration (at 15 µg HA/influenza strain) followed by two ID administrations of the influenza vaccine (at the dose levels of 15 or 21 µg HA/influenza strain) to rabbits induced no systemic changes except a slight decrease in white blood cell  counts  in  females  treated  with  repeated  high  dose  (cumulative  highest  dose  of  HA,  Group  3). Local reactions at the ID injection sites  consisted of  one  to  two-week  erythema  and  edema,  with  a severity increasing with the number of injections and a dose related effect noted especially for edema after repeated ID injections. Histopathological examination revealed inflammation at the injection sites that partially recovered after fourteen days. · Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have not been addressed. This is acceptable according to the relevant guidelines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Reproduction Toxicity

A toxicity study evaluated the effects of the intradermal influenza vaccine at 9 μ g HA/influenza strain on  female  fertility,  embryo-fetal  development  (including  an  evaluation  of  teratogenicity)  and  early post natal development in rabbits. No significant fertility and developmental toxicity effects have been shown  in  the  data  provided.  The  only  adverse  effects  observed  were  the  local  reactions  already reported in the repeated dose toxicity studies.

After a single intradermal injection of the vaccine (9 μ g HA/influenza strain) to rabbits, only minor local reactions were observed. A dedicated repeat dose local tolerance study was performed where the European intradermal vaccine was evaluated with a corresponding US intradermal vaccine. Local reactions consisted of one to twoweek erythema and oedema with a severity increasing after the second injection but not after the third one. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Ecotoxicity/environmental  risk  assessment  studies  have  not  been  conducted.  This  is  acceptable according  to  the  guideline  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00). No risk to the environment is expected from the use of this vaccine. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction The  clinical  development  program  has  been  carried  out  for  two  vaccine  formulations  intended  for differentiated target populations: -The ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg, which contains 9 µg hemagglutinin (HA) per influenza strain, is  intended  for  use  in  adults  up  to  59  years.  The  Clinical  Development  Plan  (CDP)  was therefore  designed  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  the  humoral  immune  response  to  the vaccine with respect to the 15 µg IM standard of care, with a satisfactory safety profile in this population. -The ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg, which contains 15 µg HA per influenza strain, is intended for use  in  elderly  individuals  aged  60  years  and  above.  Therefore,  the  CDP  was  designed  to demonstrate superiority of the humoral immune response to the vaccine with respect to the 15 µg IM standard of care, with a satisfactory safety profile in this population. Data from eight studies are submitted in the present dossier. An overview of the studies is provided in the following Figure.

Pharmacodynamic studies were not conducted since, as is common for vaccines, the pharmacodynamic profile for the ID Influenza Vaccine is defined by its immunogenicity profile. Since the efficacy of influenza vaccines are assessed by immunological criteria all clinical studies will be discussed under section III Clinical Efficacy.

GID17 Vac = Vaccination Number All studies were controlled and randomized and used Applicant's IM seasonal Influenza Vaccine 15 μ g as a comparator. Injection system The  traditional  intradermal  injection  technique,  the  Mantoux    method  is  considered  difficult  and requires  training  to  perform  successfully.  The  ID  Micro-Injection  System  developed  by  Becton Dickinson was intended to make ID delivery as easy to perform as IM injection and more reproducible than  vaccination  using  the  Mantoux  method.  This  system  underwent  successive  modifications  at Becton  Dickinson.  During  Phase  II  (from  2002  to  2004),  an  experimental,  intermediate  MicroInjection System was available. This system, identified as the 'yellow limiter', was used in studies GID01,  GID02  and  GID07.  Improvement  in  ergonomics  led  to  the  final  Micro-Injection  System, which was used from March 2005 onwards in GID02 (Vaccination 3 only) and in GID16. Differences in  the  intermediate  and  final  Micro-Injection  Systems  had  no  effect  on  the  characteristics  of  ID administration; the changes in the System resulted in greater consistency of ID delivery and enhanced security owing to the presence of a needle shield. Results obtained using the intermediate system can therefore  be  considered  as  being  supportive  to  those  obtained  in  later  studies  with  the  final  MicroInjection System as the same trends were observed in both Phase II and Phase III trials. When using the Mantoux technique, appearance of a wheal immediately after injection is considered indicative of successful ID vaccination. Other criteria for successful ID injection are appearance of an orange  peel  aspect  and  absence  of  leakage  at  the  injection  site.  During  the  clinical  development program these criteria, one or more, were used to evaluate the ID injection using the Microinjection system. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. Pharmacokinetics No  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted.  As  explained  in  the  European  Medicines  Agency (EMEA) Note for Guidance on 'the Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines', pharmacokinetic studies are usually not required for vaccines.

## Clinical efficacy (Immunogenicity)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Evaluation  of  the  clinical  efficacy  of  the  vaccine  was  mainly  based  on  quantification  of  the Hemagglutination  Inhibition  (HI)  titers  in  vaccinated  subjects  in  relation  to  the  CHMP  criteria specified  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  'Harmonisation  of  requirements  for  influenza  vaccines (CPMP/BEW/214/96). In each study, geometric mean of antibody titers (GMTs) were calculated both pre-and post-vaccination for each study group and for each vaccine strain. Similarly, the three CHMP parameters (increase in GMT titers, seroprotection and seroconversion rates) were also calculated.

## Immunological methods

## Non-inferiority

A variety  of  serological  techniques  have  been  developed  for  assessment  of  influenza  virus  vaccine responses in clinical trials or for disease detection. Methods include the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, single radial hemolysis  (SRH),  virus neutralization test  (NT),  and  enzyme  linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The HI assay was chosen since HI antibody titers are considered a relevant surrogate marker of protection in vaccinated populations, and the assay is simple to perform and strain-specific. In  addition,  cell-mediated  immunity  (CMI)  was  evaluated  before  and  after  vaccination  in  some studies. The following parameters were measured: · Frequency of IL4-secreting CD4+  and interferon (IFN) γ -secreting  CD4+  and  CD8+ T lymphocytes  among,  respectively,  total  CD4+  and  CD8+  T lymphocytes  (in  GID02  and GID16), · Number of IL2-secreting cells per 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), specific for different influenza vaccine antigens, before and 21 days after vaccination (in GID16 only), · Secretion  of  a  panel  of  T-helper  (Th)1  and  Th2  cytokines  by  PBMCs  upon  in  vitro restimulations with different vaccine antigens (in GID16 only). The Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS), Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISPOT), and Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) assays were used to monitor the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses induced by the ID Influenza Vaccine. Analysis populations Different, pre-defined analysis sets were used for evaluation of the immune response. For the statistical assessment of non-inferiority and superiority, two analysis populations were used: Full analysis set for immunogenicity (FASI) - included all vaccinated subjects with post-vaccination blood sample taken; used to statistically evaluate superiority. Per  protocol  analysis  set  for  immunogenicity  (PPI)  -  excluded  subjects  with  pre-specified  protocol deviations  (e.g.  violation  of  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  incorrect  vaccination,  blood  samples  taken outside of acceptable window, use of medication forbidden by the protocol) and subjects without postvaccination immunogenicity data; used to evaluate non-inferiority. An Other Immunogenicity analysis set (OI) was also defined, including all vaccinated subjects with pre- and post-vaccination immunogenicity data. This set was specifically used for all non-comparative objectives  in  all  individual  studies,  which  included  the  evaluation  of  the  CPMP  immunogenicity requirements for influenza vaccines. Statistical methods Medicinal product no longer authorised

For the studies evaluating ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg in adults (GID02 [Vac1], GID15, and GID23), and  elderly  (GID16  and  17)  post-vaccination  GMTs  were  used  as  the  primary  endpoint  for  the demonstration  of  non-inferiority  of  each  of  the  groups  with  respect  to  the  IM  Influenza  Vaccine. GMTs were considered to be a well recognized endpoint and the most informative and sensitive for the evaluation of non-inferiority. The non-inferiority margin was defined as the maximum GMT ratio (GMTR)  between  groups  which  could  be  considered  to  remain  clinically  acceptable,  under  the assumption  that  similar  immune  responses  were  obtained  in  each  group.  As  a  two-fold  increase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between pre-and post-vaccination GMTs is viewed by the CPMP as a criteria of vaccine efficacy (see Note  for  Guidance  on  the  'Harmonisation  of  Requirements  for  Influenza  Vaccines'),  a  two-fold difference in GMT can justifiably be considered as clinically important. The Applicant chose to use a more  conservative  ratio  of  1.5  to  determine  non-inferiority.  Statistical  analysis  considered  the confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  differences  between  the  log 10 GMTs,  rather  than  the  GMT  ratio,  to normalize antibody distribution. If the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference was above -0.176 (1/1.5) for each of the three strains, non-inferiority was concluded.

<!-- image -->

Pre-vaccination GMTs and the proportion of seroprotected subjects were similar between the groups for each of the three strains. Among the ID groups, the highest immune response in terms of GMTs for all strains was obtained with the ID 6 μ g dose level and the ID 9 μ g dose level. Overall, this response was in the range of the response obtained with the IM Influenza Vaccine. In terms of CPMP criteria, the highest response was also observed with the ID 6 μ g and ID 9 μ g dose levels.

Superiority In the event that non-inferiority was shown, superiority was to be tested. Superiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the log10 GMTs of each group receiving the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg and the IM control vaccine was above 0 (i.e. lower limit of the 95% CI of the ratio of the GMTs between groups was above 1) for all vaccine strains (Phase II studies GID02 and GID15) or at least two of the strains in GID23. In study GID16, superiority was assessed based on comparison of GMTs between groups; if the lower limit  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  difference  between  the  log10  GMTs  of  each  group  receiving  the  ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg and the IM control vaccine was above 0 for all vaccine strains, superiority was concluded. In  study  GID17,  the  Applicant  chose  to  demonstrate  superiority  through  comparison  of  the  postvaccination seroprotection rates. · Dose response studies Dose-response studies in adults (18-59 years) Two  phase  II  randomised  controlled  studies  were  performed  with  an  intermediate  Micro-Injection System to determine the dose in the adult population (GID01, GID02). GID01 was  a  phase  II,  open  (for  the  administration  route)  and  double-blind  (for  the  three  dosages administered  by  using  the  investigational  device)  randomized  study  conducted  in  three  centers  in Lithuania  in  2002.  A  total  of  300  subjects  aged  18  to  60  years  were  randomized  to  receive  one injection of Influenza Vaccine either by the ID route with the intermediate Micro-Injection System (3, 6, or 9 μ g HA per strain), by the ID route using the Mantoux method (3 μ g HA per strain), or by the IM route (15 μ g HA per strain). The primary objective of GID01 was to check the compliance of the ID Influenza Vaccine, by the IM route  with  the  CPMP  criteria  by  evaluating  the  immunogenicity  [18-21]  days  after  the  injection,  in subjects aged between 18 and 60 years. The mean age of the study population was 32.6 years, and the groups were similar in terms of age and gender  distribution.  Thirty-five  percent  of  the  study  subjects  had  received  an  influenza  vaccine previously. Immunogenicity results Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effectiveness of the intradermal injection was also evaluated using three criteria for successful ID injection (presence of a wheal, presence of orange peel aspect, and absence of leakage on the skin). Immunogenicity results were not different in the subset of subjects with injection meeting at least two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of these criteria for ID injection, and in the subjects with injection with no leakage on the skin after ID injection.

GID02 was a randomized phase II study conducted over a period of 3 years, from 2003 to 2005, in the Czech Republic (dose 1 and dose 2), and in Lithuania and Belgium (doses 1, 2 and 3)in 3 different EU countries . The influenza strains in the vaccine varied between each injection. The double-blind design was used for the two dose levels administered by the ID route (dose 1). Overall, two dose levels were evaluated by the ID route for dose 1 (3 and 6 μ g HA per strain), and one for dose 2 and dose 3 (9 μ g HA per strain). The intermediate Micro-Injection System was used for dose 1 and 2, the final one was used  for  dose  3.  A  total  of  1 150  subjects  aged  18  to  60  years  were  randomized  to  receive  three injections of Influenza Vaccine by the ID or IM route with an interval of one year between doses. The subjects were re-randomized for each of the second and third vaccinations. The primary objective of GID02  was  to  compare  the  post-vaccination  GMTs  (Anti-HA  antibodies)  of  two  pharmaceutical presentations (3 µg and 6 µg of each HA) administered by the ID route with that of Vaxigrip (15 µg of each HA) administered by the IM route, 21 days after a single first vaccine injection in subjects aged 18 to 57 years. If the non-inferiority of one presentation administered by the ID route compared to the presentation  administered  by  the  IM  route  was  demonstrated,  the  superiority  was  to  be  tested.  At inclusion the mean age of the subjects was 39.1 years and the groups were similar in terms of age. The proportion of women was slightly higher in the two ID groups than in the IM group. Immunogenicity results Non-inferiority analysis first vaccination In the PPI population, despite similar pre-vaccination GMTs in all three groups for each of the three vaccine strains, the post-vaccination GMTs observed in the ID groups were lower than those in the IM group. The non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of both ID 3 µg and ID 6 µg vaccines in respect to that  of  the  IM  15  µg  vaccine  could  not  be  demonstrated:  the  lowest  bound  of  the  95%  CI  of  the difference of log transformed post-vaccination GMTs versus IM 15 µg was lower than -0.176 in both ID groups for all strains, i.e. the GMT ratio was &lt;1/1.5. Therefore, given the low upper bounds of these 95% CIs for all strains, the differences observed in the ID  groups  versus  the  IM  group  could  be  considered  as  clinically  meaningful.  The  results  and conclusions were similar in the FASI population. This led to the decision to use a higher dose for the second and third year vaccinations, 9µg HA per dose and strain. Additionally, a significant variability of immunogenicity results was observed across centers, with an interaction  on  group  effect:  the  differences  observed  between  groups  differed  significantly  between centers. In particular one center showed large differences between the ID and the IM routes results, whereas this  center  presented  the  lowest  percentage  of  leakage  at  injection  site  (8.9%  of  subjects). This might be due to an incorrect use of the system. The Intermediate injection system was used for the first year vaccinations. Immunogenicity, second vaccination The  second  vaccination  in  GID02  compared  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9 μ g  and  the  IM  Influenza Vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  terms  of  GMTs,  the  response  was  similar  between  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9µg  and  the  IM Influenza Vaccine. The mean differences between the ID 9µg and the IM 15µg groups in terms of log post-vaccination titers led to observed values very close to 0, with narrow 95% CIs. Indeed, the 95% CI  of  the  GMT  ratios  (ID/IM)  were  (0.809;  1.090)  for  A/H1N1,  (0.863;  1,120)  for  A/H3N2  and (0.828; 1.135) for B. The two vaccines induced a similar response in terms of CPMP criteria and high seroprotection rates for all strains.

For the second vaccination, a significant variability  of immunogenicity results was observed across centers,  with  an  interaction  on  group  effect:  the  differences  observed  between  groups  differed significantly between centers. This variability seemed to be mainly due to one center (different from the first one) results, showing large differences between results of ID vaccine and IM vaccine. This

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

time, a large percentage of leakage at injection site (28.6% of subjects) was observed at this center. However the large differences in this center between results of ID and IM routes remain on subjects who did not present any leakage at injection site. The Intermediate injection system was used for the second year vaccinations.

## Immunogenicity third vaccination

The  same  vaccines  were  evaluated  for  the  third  vaccination  in  GID02.  It  should  be  noted  that immunogenicity was evaluated in a subset of 240 subjects only after the third dose.



Before the second and the third vaccination, the subjects showed a Flu-specific CD4 Th1 response, as judged  by  a  predominant  IFNγ secretion  and  the  absence  of  IL-4  detection.  This  response  was moderately increased after the second and the third vaccination. However, no significant differences were  shown  on  CD4  responses  between  IM  and  ID  route  neither  after  the  second  nor  the  third administration. It should be noted that the third administration of the vaccine did not further increase the responses compared to the second dose.

Twenty-one  days  after  dose  3,  GMTs  increased  and  remained  similar  between  the  groups  for  the A/H1N1 and the B strains, but they were higher for the A/H3N2 strain with the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg (415 [1/dil]) than with the IM Influenza Vaccine (300 [1/dil]). In both groups, the three CPMP criteria  were  met  for  the  A/H3N2  strain,  and  one  criterion  (seroprotection  rate)  was  met  for  the A/H1N1 and B strains. The reason that the seroconversion or significant increase rate and GMT ratio criteria were not met could be due to the high pre-vaccination titres. Presence of Leakage at the injection site After the first injection, 18.0% in the ID 3µg group, and 20.1% in the ID 6µg group presented with product leakage at the ID injection site. Twenty-one days after the first vaccination, the immunogenicity results  were  higher  in  the  subset  of  subjects  without  leakage  than  in  the  subset  of subjects with leakage. A multivariate analysis, performed on subjects vaccinated with the ID vaccine to assess the dose and leakage  effects  on  the  log-post-vaccination  titers  for  the  three  strains,  concluded  to  a  significant negative effect of the presence of leakage. After  the  second  vaccination  10.2%  of  the  subjects  presented  with  leakage  at  the  injection  site. Twenty-one days after the second vaccination, the immunogenicity results were higher in groups of subjects without leakage than in the subset of subjects with leakage. Nevertheless, the post-vaccination GMTs in subjects without leakage in the ID 9µg group remained similar to those observed in the IM group. During  the  third  year  the  number  of  subjects  presenting  with  a  leakage  was  too  low  to  allow  a meaningful analysis (N=2). The  intermediate  injection  system  as  used  for  the  first  and  second  vaccinations,  while  the  third vaccination was given with the final Microinjection system. In the main/key studies only the Final Micro-Injection System was used. In these studies the applicant assessed immunogenicity. Results in subjects with leakage remained similar to those obtained on all subjects. Cell-mediated immunity Cellular responses against influenza were measured in 96 adults after the second vaccination and in 93 adults after the third vaccination with the 9 µg ID influenza vaccine or Vaxigrip (all subjects enrolled in a single site in Belgium). Antigenic stimulation was performed on whole blood samples before and 21 days after the second and the third immunization. Cells were in vitro stimulated with killed split vaccine strains  or  with  MHC  class  I  or  class  II  restricted  Flu  specific  peptides.  The  CD4  and  CD8 responses were measured by intracellular IFNγ and IL-4 staining (IL-4 evaluated only after the third vaccination) by flow cytometry. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A weak and heterogeneous CD8 response was measured before the second and the third vaccination. This response was poorly increased by the vaccination. Only 10% of the subjects from either IM or ID group presented a positive CD8 response after the second injection. No significant differences could be demonstrated between IM and ID routes on CD8 T cell activation neither after the second nor the third administration of the vaccine.

In  conclusion,  this  study  showed  that  the  9 µg  ID  influenza  vaccine  induced  a  cellular  immune response comparable to that induced by Vaxigrip.

The majority of subjects (88.5%, 81.7% and 79.7% in the ID 3, 6 and 9 µg groups respectively) did not present any product leakage of the vaccine after the ID injection. But in terms of evaluation of the effectiveness  of  the  ID  injection,  no  improvement  of  the  immune  response  of  ID  injections  was observed when the immunogenicity results were computed on subjects with no leakage at the injection site.

Dose response studies in elderly ( ≥ 60 years) Two  phase  II  randomised  controlled  studies  were  performed,  one  using  the  intermediate  MicroInjection System and one using the Mantoux method to determine the dose in the elderly population (GID07, GID09). GID07 was a randomized study conducted in France in 2003. A total of 240 subjects aged ≥ 60 years were  randomized  to  receive  one  injection  on  D0  of  Influenza  Vaccine  by  the  ID  route  with  the intermediate Micro-Injection System (3, 6, or 9 μ g HA per strain) or by the IM route (15 μ g HA per strain).  The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  influenza  vaccine  either administered by ID route (three different dosages were assessed) or by IM route (one dosage), 21 days after vaccination in subjects aged over 60 years. For each vaccine strain, the objective was to satisfy at least one of the three CPMP criteria. At inclusion the mean age was 72.3 years. All four groups were similar in terms of age and gender distribution, except for the 6 µg ID group who had a slightly higher number of females than in the other groups. A total of 226 subjects (94.2%) had received an influenza vaccine in previous years. Immunogenicity results Pre-vaccination GMTs were similar between the groups for each of the three strains. For the A/H3N2 strain, antibody titers were already high. Twenty-one days after vaccination, the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains  met  at  least  one  of  the  CPMP  criteria  in  all  groups  except  the  ID 3 μ g  group,  none  of  these criteria was met for the B strain (including by the IM route). The response was the lowest with the ID Influenza Vaccine 3 μ g,  regardless of the strain, and appeared to be slightly higher with the ID 9 µg dose level than with the ID 6 μ g and IM Influenza Vaccine. Due  to  the  observed  low  antibody  response  to  the  B  Shandong  strain  and  in  order  to  validate  the generated  data,  decision  was  made  to  conduct  an  additional  investigation  and  testing  with  the homologous  B/Hong  Kong  strains  (both  native  and  split  antigens),  given  WHO  mandated  the introduction of  the  B  Hong  Kong  antigen  in  the  Flu  vaccine  composition.  Two  additional  series  of results were obtained. With the native B/Hong Kong antigen, results were similar to those obtained with  the  B/Shandong  native  antigen  but  different  from  those  obtained  with  the  split  B/Hong  Kong antigen (pre- and post-titers were higher and pre- and postseroprotection rates were 80.5% and 93.0%, i.e. also higher). The sensitivity of the HI test was improved with the split antigen both for the pre- and post-vaccination samples, leading to a decrease of the specificity without any positive impact on the compliance with the EMEA criteria. As a result, the results generated with the B Hong Kong antigens were considered as supportive data. Leakage at the injection site Medicinal product no longer authorised

GID09 was  a  randomized  study  conducted  in  elderly  subjects  in  Australia  in  200  in  the  Southern Hemisphere 5. A total of 226 subjects aged 60 to 84 years were randomized to receive one injection of Influenza Vaccine by the ID route with the Mantoux method (9, 15, or 21 μ g HA per strain) or by the IM route (15 μ g HA per strain). All subjects received the annual formulation of Influenza Vaccine by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  IM  route  3 months  after  the  first  vaccination  to  offer  the  subjects  protection  against  the  WHO influenza strains recommended for the 2005 Southern Hemisphere. Randomization was stratified by age group, i.e. 60 to 69 years and 70 to 85 years, within each center. The primary objective was to describe the immunogenicity of three dosages of the ID Influenza Vaccine given by Mantoux injection technique using the criteria defined in the CPMP note for guidance.

The mean age at inclusion was 69.2 years. All four groups were similar in terms of age. Regarding gender  distribution,  there  were  more  males  than  females  in  the  ID  9  µg,  ID  15  µg,  and  ID  21  µg groups, while there were more females than males in the IM 15 µg group.

In study GID15 and GID23 the inclusion criteria included Age 18 to 57 years on the day of inclusion (GID15)  and  Age  18  to  60  years  on  the  day  of  inclusion  (GID23).  For  a  woman  of  childbearing potential use of an effective method of contraception

Previous influenza vaccination was reported in 92.9% of the subjects. Immunogenicity results Twenty-one days after vaccination, an immune response was observed in all groups. Overall, on the CPMP  criteria  point  estimates  observed  in  the  ID  groups,  there  was  a  trend  towards  a  superior immunogenicity with higher ID dose levels. The three CPMP criteria were met for all strains in the ID 15 μ g and ID 21 μ g groups. In the ID 9 μ g group, these criteria were met for two of the three strains. In the IM 15 μ g group, the seroconversion or significant increase rate was met for the B strain only. In  this  study  the  Mantoux  technique,  and  not  the  Beckton  Dickinson  device  was  used  for  all vaccinations. The conclusion that the 15 and 21 µg ID doses induced higher immune responses than the 9µg ID dose and the 15 µg IM dose is supported by the data. The conclusion of these studies allowed the selection of 15µg HA per strain intradermal formulation for evaluation in pivotal clinical trials with the final Micro-Injection System. · Main studies The pivotal studies are described together below. The parts about adults (18-59 years) include the results of a Phase II study (GID15, first vaccination) and the  data  obtained  in  a  Phase  III  lot-to-lot  consistency  study  (GID23).  No  immunogenicity  data were obtained after dose 2 and 3 in GID15. The two studies were considered as key studies because they  aimed  at  demonstrating  non-inferiority  of  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9µg  with  the  final  MicroInjection  System  to  the  IM  Influenza  Vaccine.  Data  from  the  two  key  studies  (GID15  dose  1  and GID23) are presented and compared in this section. The  parts  about  elderly  ( ≥ 60  years)  include  the  results  obtained  within  21  days  after  the  second vaccination in the Phase III study GID17 (data after the third vaccination were not available at the time  of  approval)  and  results  of  an  integrated  analysis  combining  the  data  of  GID16  and  GID17 (Vac1).  The  two  studies  were  considered  as  key  studies  because  they  both  aimed  at  demonstrating superiority of the ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg over the IM Influenza Vaccine, and they evaluated the final HA dose level and the final Micro-Injection System.

The  exclusion  criteria  are  similar  between  the  studies  within  each  age  category,  with  minor differences.  The  recruitment  was  not  specifically  targeting  a  population  that  is  at  higher  risk  of suffering complications from influenza, other than the elderly studies.

The exclusion criteria in all clinical studies (both Adults and Elderly) included:

- Self-reported allergy to any of the constituents of the vaccine
- Acute febrile disease within the 72 previous hours

· Vaccination against influenza within the 6 months preceding Visit 1 · Any vaccination within the 28 days preceding Visit 1 or scheduled between Visit 1 and Visit 2 · Immunosuppressive therapy or cancer therapy within the month preceding Visit 1 · Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, · Immunoglobulin injection within the 3 months preceding Visit 1 · Blood or blood derived products received in the past three months · Current abuse of alcohol or drug addiction Treatments In all studies described in this section (GID15, GID23, GID16 and GID17) the final Microinjection system  and  the  final  formulation  of  vaccine  was  used.  Applicant's  IM  seasonal  Influenza  Vaccine 15 μ g was given as intramuscular comparator in all studies. Objectives GID15 The primary objective of GID15 was to demonstrate that the vaccine administered by the ID route with  the  final  ID  system  (prefilled  ID  system  allowing  a  better  ergonomic  use)  is  at  least  as immunogenic as the administration of the vaccine by the IM route after the first vaccination. The secondary objectives  of  GID15  included  to  describe  the  safety  profile  after  each  vaccine administration, to describe the anti-HA antibody persistence after the first injection and to describe the compliance of the immunogenicity with the EMEA criteria. Observational  objectives  included  the  assessment  of  the  pain  at  the  injection  site,  the  leakage appearing at the injection site and the comfort of the vaccination assessment GID23 The primary objective  of  GID23  was  to  demonstrate  that  three  different  industrial  lots  of  the  ID investigational vaccine induce an equivalent immune response. The secondary objectives  of  GID23  included  the  demonstration  that  the  ID  investigational  vaccine induces an immune response at least as good as the one induced by the IM control vaccine, in terms of antibody titers, to assess the immunogenicity of the ID investigational vaccine using the parameters defined by CHMP, to assess safety and the comfort of vaccination (pain). GID 16: The primary objective of GID16 was to demonstrate that at least one of the two dosages (15 µg and 21 µg of each HA per strain) of the ID Influenza Vaccine was at least as immunogenic as the IM Influenza Vaccine.

The secondary objectives of GID16 included to describe the safety profile, to describe the anti-HA antibody persistence and to describe the compliance of the immunogenicity with the EMEA criteria.

## GID17

The primary objective  of  GID17  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  ID  investigational  vaccine  induces  a superior immune response than the IM control vaccine in terms of seroprotection rate after the first vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary objectives included, the immunogenicity of the ID investigational vaccine after each vaccination  using  the  CHMP  criteria,  the  description  of  the  antibody  persistence  induced  by  both vaccines at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after the first vaccination in a subset of subjects and the comfort of vaccination (pain) and the assessment of safety.

## Endpoints

Immunogenicity The following immunogenicity parameters and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated · Geometric mean of anti-HA antibody titers (GMTs) pre- and post-vaccination, · Geometric mean of the individual titer ratios (GMTR) post-vaccination over pre-vaccination, · Seroprotection rate defined as the proportion of subjects with a post-vaccination titer ≥ 40 [1/dil], · Seroconversion rate defined as the proportion of subjects with pre-vaccination titers &lt;10 [1/dil] rising to ≥ 40 [1/dil] post-vaccination · Significant  increase  in  titers  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  pre-vaccination  titers ≥ 10 [1/dil] reaching at least a 4-fold increase in pre-vaccination titers after vaccination, · Proportion of subjects with seroconversion or with significant increase in titers. Pain at injection site First vaccination GID15 and GID16: The intensity of pain at the time of injection was evaluated just after vaccination using a visual analogue scale (VAS): one value (ranging between 0 mm and 100 mm) was obtained for each subject. Additionally, the answers to the acceptability questionnaire at D0 and 21 days after each vaccination were described. GID23,  GID17  and  Second  and  third  vaccinations  GID15:  The  rating  of  immediate  pain  at  the injection site obtained just after the injection (via the ID and IM routes) using a verbal rating scale (VRS). Comfort of the vaccination assessed by the subjects 21 days after the vaccination, using the score(s) obtained to the vaccination comfort questionnaire (VCQ), a 44 items self-administered questionnaire. Leakage at the injection site (GID15, GID23, GID16, GID17) The presence or absence of product leakage on the skin at the injection site was considered after ID injection. Presence of Wheal at the injection site (GID23, GID17) For  injections  performed  by  the  ID  route,  presence  or  absence  of  a  wheal  on  the  skin  at  the  ID injection site was recorded. When using the Mantoux technique, appearance of a wheal immediately after  injection  is  considered  indicative  of  successful  ID  vaccination.  Using  the  ID  system,  a  wheal does  not  appear  systematically  after  injection  and  one  exploratory  objective  of  this  study  was  to confirm that presence or absence of a wheal was not related to success of the ID vaccination in terms of immune response. Sample size GID  15: The  ID  9µg  group  is  tested  at  a  2.5%  alpha  level  (one-sided  hypothesis).  A  maximum acceptable ratio of 1.5 in terms of post-vaccination GMT and a global power of 91% were chosen to calculate the sample size. A total of 1,000 subjects were to be enrolled in the trial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

GID 23 : A total of 2 250 subjects were to be enrolled. A total of 600 subjects per lot (450 subjects per lot  for  immunogenicity) in the ID investigational vaccine group and 450 subjects in the IM control vaccine group gave the calculated powers for the different tests of equivalence between the three lots in terms of immunogenicity, non-inferiority of the pooled ID investigational vaccine groups versus IM control vaccine group in terms of immunogenicity and non-superiority of the pooled ID investigational vaccine groups versus IM control vaccine group in terms of safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GID16: The ID 15µg and 21µg groups were tested at a 2.5% alpha level (one-sided hypothesis for noninferiority). A maximum acceptable ratio of 1.5 in terms of post-vaccination GMT and a global power  of  91%  were  chosen  to  calculate  the  sample  size.  Assuming  for  each  A  strain  a  maximal standard deviation of 0.6, and 0.5 for the B strain (from GID09 (18) trial results), 322 subjects per group were necessary to test the null hypothesis. Under the assumption that about 10% of subjects would not be evaluable, 360 subjects were needed to be included in each group. Therefore a total of 1,080 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the trial

Post-vaccination  GMTs  were  used  as  the  primary  endpoint  for  non-inferiority  of  the  ID  Influenza Vaccine 15µg with respect to the IM Influenza Vaccine for the studies GID16 and GID17. A ratio of 1.5 was used. Statistical analysis considered the CI of the differences between the log10 GMTs, rather than  the  GMT  ratio,  to  normalize  antibody  distribution.  If  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  of  the difference was above -0.176 (-1/1.5) for each of the three strains, non-inferiority was concluded.

GID17: A total of 2 580 subjects in the ID investigational vaccine group and 1 075 subjects in the IM control  vaccine  group  gave  the  necessary  powers  for  the  different  tests  of  superiority  of  the  ID investigational vaccine group versus the IM control vaccine group in terms of seroprotection and nonsuperiority of the ID investigational vaccine group versus the IM reference vaccine group in terms of safety. Randomisation In all the 4 studies (GID15, GID23, GID16 and GID17) subjects were randomised at the time of the first  vaccination. Vaccine groups were allocated using permuted block method with stratification on investigational center. For the subsequent vaccinations in GID15, a similar process has been followed to randomize the subjects to ID or IM group. For the subsequent vaccinations in GID17, only subjects having received the IM control vaccine at the previous vaccination were randomized into one of the two vaccine groups in a balanced manner; subjects having received the ID investigational vaccine at the previous vaccination were not randomized and received the ID investigational vaccine. Blinding (masking) All  studies  were  double-blind  for  dose  level  and  different  lots  of  ID  vaccine,  but  open  for administration  route.  Study  GID15  which  was  open,  including  only  one  dose  level  (9µg)  of  the ID vaccine. Statistical methods In all studies superiority was evaluated only once non-inferiority had been demonstrated. For  the  studies  (GID02  [Vac1],  GID15,  and  GID23),  post-vaccination  GMTs  were  used  for  the demonstration of non-inferiority. The non-inferiority margin was defined as the maximum GMT ratio (GMTR) between groups. A two-fold difference in GMT can justifiably be considered as clinically important. The Applicant chose to use a more conservative ratio of 1.5 to determine non-inferiority. Statistical analysis considered the confidence interval (CI) of the differences between the log10 GMTs, rather than the GMT ratio, to normalize antibody distribution. If the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference was above -0.176 (-1/1.5) for each of the three strains, non-inferiority was concluded. Superiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the log10 GMTs of  each  group  receiving  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9µg  and  the  IM  control  vaccine  was  above  0 (i.e. lower limit of the 95% CI of the ratio of the GMTs between groups was above 1) for all vaccine strains (Phase II studies GID02 and GID15) or at least two of the strains in GID23.

In study GID16, superiority was assessed based on comparison of GMTs between groups; if the lower limit  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  difference  between  the  log10  GMTs  of  each  group  receiving  the  ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg and the IM control vaccine was above 0 for all vaccine strains, superiority was concluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  study  GID17,  the  Applicant  chose  to  demonstrate  superiority  through  comparison  of  the  postvaccination seroprotection rates. Superiority was concluded if the two-sided 95% CI of the difference in seroprotection rates was above 0 for at least two of the vaccine strains.

A supplementary analysis to evaluate superiority in GID16 using seroprotection rates was performed by the Applicant.

Subjects  were  re-randomized  for  the  second  vaccination  so  that  the  following  schedules  were evaluated: ID\\ID (N=2 454), IM\\ID (N=511), and IM\\IM (N=511).

Baseline data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GID15: At inclusion, in the PPI population, subjects were aged between 18.1 and 58.0 years old and the mean age was 40.2 years (SD: 11.1 years). The male/female gender ratio was 0.6, the number of females was higher than the number of males in both groups. Both groups were similar in terms of age and gender distribution. The baseline characteristics (in terms of age, gender and previous influenza vaccination) were similar in the FASI and in the SafAS populations.

Among the 760 subjects included in the PPI population, 292 subjects (38.4%) had been vaccinated with an influenza vaccine in majority in 2004. Out of these 292 subjects, 33 (11.3%) had experienced an adverse reaction after vaccination with almost the same proportions in both groups. These reactions were  nearly  the  same  as  the  solicited  reactions  pre-listed  in  the  subject's  DC.  Similar  results  were obtained in the FASI population.

GID23: At inclusion, in the PPI population, subjects were aged from 18.1 to 60.0 years and the mean age was 42.8 years (SD: 12.4 years). The male/female gender ratio was 0.7, the number of females being higher than the number of males in all groups. Among the 1 676 subjects included in the PPI population, 781 (46.6%) had been previously vaccinated with an influenza vaccine. Most of them had been vaccinated in 2005. Out of these 781 subjects, 56 (7.2%) had experienced an adverse reaction after  vaccination  (between  10  and  16  subjects  per  group).  A  total  of  717  subjects  (42.8%)  were considered  as  at  health  risk.  The  most  important  risks  were  lung  disease  (15.2%),  heart  disease (13.7%)  and  neurological  disease  (13.6%).  The  majority  of  subjects  had  skin  phototypes  Type  III (32.8%) or Type II (25.8%). Baseline characteristics (in terms of age, gender, BMI, previous allergy, risk status, skin phototypes and previous influenza vaccination) were similar in the four groups, in the PPI, in the FASI, and in the SafAS populations. GID16 At inclusion, in the PPI population, subjects were aged from 60.0 to 85.8 years and the mean age varied from 70.4 to 71.0 years (SD of 6.76 and 6.55 years, respectively). The male/female gender ratios varied from 0.8 to 1, the number of females being higher than the number of males in all three groups. All three groups were similar in terms of age and gender distribution. Among the 1,076 subjects included in the PPI population, 978 had been previously vaccinated with an influenza vaccine. GID17: At inclusion, the mean age of subjects in the FASI population was 70.8 years (SD: 6.8 years, range 60.6; 94.6). The male/female sex ratio was 0.8. Both groups were similar in terms of age and gender  distribution.  Distribution  of  BMI  was  similar  amongst  groups.  Most  of  the  subjects  were overweight (44.2%) or obese (23.2%). Among the 3 685 subjects included in the FASI population, a total of 2 924 subjects (79.3%) had been vaccinated with an influenza vaccine and 259 subjects (7.0%) with a pneumoccocal vaccine. Out of these subjects, 57 (1.9%) and none (0%) reported experiencing an adverse reaction after vaccination with influenza and pneumoccocal vaccines respectively. With respect to the health risk status (65.6% in ID 15µg group and 63.6% in IM 15µg group) of the subjects  included  in  the  FASI  population,  heart  disease  was  the  most  frequently  medical  condition reported (1892 subjects [51.3%]). Lung disease and diabetes were recorded for 428 subjects (11.6%) and 417 subjects (11.3%), respectively. Neurological disease was reported by 329 subjects (8.9%), and renal  disease  was  reported  by  186  subjects  (5.0%).  Other  diseases,  including  hepatitis,  cancer  and leukemia were reported by 139 subjects (3.8%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The baseline characteristics were equivalently distributed between groups, and were similar in the PPI and in the SafAS populations.

## GID15

Pre-vaccination GMTs for each strain were similar in both groups. In the PPI, non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg to the IM Influenza Vaccine was demonstrated for each of the three strains in terms of post-vaccination GMTs, with the lower bound of difference of GMTs between groups ranging from -0.003 for the B strain to 0.087 for the A/H3N2 strain (Table 1). As  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated,  superiority  of  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9µg  over  the  IM Influenza Vaccine was assessed. Superiority was shown for the A/H1N1 and the A/H3N2 strains but not for the B strain.

In  the  FASI,  superiority  of  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine 9µg  over  the  IM  Influenza  Vaccine  was demonstrated  for  the  A/H1N1  and  the  A/H3N2  strains,  with  lower  bounds  of  difference  of  GMTs between groups of 0.006 and 0.087, respectively, but not for the B strain, for which the lower bound was of -0.004. However, post-vaccination GMTs for the B strain were still slightly higher in the ID 9µg group than in the IM group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  proportions  of  seroprotected  subjects  at  baseline  were  similar  between  groups,  ranging  from 16.8% for the B strain to 43.9% for the A/H3N2 strain, and from 16.6% for the B strain to 40.9% for the A/H3N2 strain, in the ID 9µg and IM groups.

Twenty-one days after vaccination, an immune response was observed in both groups, with GMTs of 247 (1/dil), 825 (1/dil) and 144 (1/dil), for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B strains, respectively in the ID 9µg group.

The three CPMP criteria were fulfilled with the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg for the three strains, 95% CIs inclusive, with higher results in the ID 9µg group than in the IM group. As there were only 34 subjects  receiving  ID  injection  and  presenting  with  vaccine  leakage  at  the  injection  site,  the assessment of immunogenicity in these subjects was not performed. Exploratory  analyses  were  performed  to  assess,  on  the  immune  response  obtained  after  the  first vaccination in both groups the influence of the baseline seroprotection, the centre and the vaccinator. The  centre  and  vaccinator  effect  were  generally  not  significant.  On  the  other  side,  the  baseline seroprotection  was  always  significant  and  influence  the  immune  response  in  each  vaccine  group. Nevertheless,  the  vaccine  effect  (ID  vaccine  effect  compared  to  IM  vaccine  effect)  is  independent from this covariate. Antibody persistence For  the  three  strains,  the  antibody  persistence  for  one  year  after  vaccination  presented  a  similar decrease  over  time  of  GMTs  in  the  ID  9µg  group  to  the  IM  15µg  group,  despite  a  constant  slight higher level of antibodies in the ID group versus IM group. The decrease of GMTs between D21 and M12 were comparable between the ID and IM groups for the three strains at each time point (M3, M6 and M12). Similar observations can be performed in terms of seroprotection  rates  ( ≥ 40  1/dil)  (Table  2).  It  seems  to  be  that  for  the  B  strain  the  seroprotection decrease is slightly higher in ID 9µg group than in IM 15µg group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg was at least as immunogenic as the IM Influenza Vaccine in terms of post-vaccination GMTs. The immune response induced by the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg was superior in terms of GMTs to the one induced by the IM Influenza Vaccine for the two A strains. For each of the three strains, the three CPMP criteria were met with the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg. The antibody persistence pattern did not differ appreciably between the ID and IM groups.

## GID23

## Lot-to-lot consistency

Equivalence of the immune response of the three industrial lots was demonstrated for each of the three strains, the two-sided 90% CIs of the difference between lots were between -0.176 and 0.176 for each pair  of  lots  and  for  each  strain.  The  same  conclusion  can  be  drawn  with  a  more  stringent  95%  CI (Table 3). The same conclusions could be drawn when analysing the FASI population. Comparison to the IM administration As lot-to-lot consistency had been established, the three ID 9µg groups (one for each lot) were pooled. Immunogenicity  results  of  the  ID  9  µg  investigational  vaccine  were  compared  to  those  of  the  IM control  group  on  each  strain  (A/H3N2,  A/H1N1,  and  B)  in  terms  of  GM  of  post-vaccination  titers observed at D21. In the PPI population, GMs of pre-vaccination titers were similar in both groups and for the three strains (although those corresponding to the A/H3N2 strain were higher than those of the other strains in both groups). Non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg (pool of the three ID groups) to the IM Influenza Vaccine was demonstrated for each of the three strains in the PPI: the lower bound of  the  difference  of  log10  transformed  post-vaccination  GMTs  ID  9µg  group  versus  IM  group  was higher than -0.176 for all strains (ranging from -0.084 for the A/H1N1 strain to -0.059 for the A/H3N2 strain) (Table 4). These results were confirmed in the FASI population. As  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated,  superiority  of  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9µg  over  the  IM Influenza Vaccine was assessed in the FASI and PPI populations. Superiority of the immunogenicity of the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg over the IM Influenza Vaccine was not reached for any of the three strains. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table  5  presents  the  assessment  of  CPMP  criteria  and  GMTs.  Baseline  seroprotection  rates  were similar between groups for each strain, and were slightly higher for the A/H3N2 strain than for the A/H1N1 and B strains.

After  vaccination,  an  immune  response  was  observed  in  the  ID  and  IM  groups,  with  GMTs  of 181 (1/dil), 277 (1/dil) and 67.7 (1/dil), for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B strains, respectively in the ID 9µg group. These GMTs were similar to those observed in the IM group. The three CPMP criteria were fulfilled with the ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg for each of the three strains, 95% CIs inclusive.

Effect of presence of wheal after injection In the SafAS population, 46.7% of the subjects receiving the ID 9 µg vaccine presented a wheal at injection  site.  Geometric  mean  of  titers  ratios  (GMTRs)  and  seroconversion  or  significant  increase rates results were very similar in subjects presenting a wheal with respect to those without a wheal at injection site, for each of the three strains, as well as post-vaccination GMTs and seroprotection rates for the A/H3N2 and B strains. For the A/H1N1 strain, post-vaccination GMTs and seroprotection rates were slightly higher in subjects presenting a wheal at injection site. All three CPMP criteria were met in both groups and for each of the three strains. Effect of presence of leakage at the injection site In  the  FASI  population,  only  80  subjects  (4.5%)  vaccinated  by  ID  route  presented  a  leakage  at  the injection site. In the OI population, 59 subjects were assessed for the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains, and 58 subjects for the B strain. Subjects presenting a leakage obtained slightly lower immunogenicity results than those without leakage. However for these subjects, the three EMEA criteria were fulfilled for each strain, except seroprotection rate for the B strain: 57.9% [41.2; 81.5]. Influence of co-variates on post-vaccination titers The  influence  of  several  covariates  was  explored  separately  on  log10-transformed  post-vaccination titers in the FASI population. Seroprotection status at baseline (categorized as &lt;40 and ≥ 40 [1/dil]), previous  influenza  vaccination  status,  age  (&lt;40  years  or  &gt;40  years),  country,  BMI  and  risk  status (defined as any lung, heart, renal, neurological diseases, any diabetes, or any other significant history (such  as  HIV,  cancers,  Hepatitis  [A,  B,  C],  epilepsy,  auto-immune  diseases,  blood  disorders)  were found  to  have  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  log10-transformed  post-vaccination  titers  in  each group.  However,  whatever  the  studied  covariate,  the  differences  between  vaccine  groups  were  not significantly  different  across  the  covariate  categories  and  the  same  trends  were  observed  in  both vaccine groups. Influence of risk status on immune responses The immune responses in subjects at risk were consistently lower than in subjects not at risk, however, there are no consistent differences between the ID and IM administration routes in this study. Elderly GID16 Non-inferiority of the ID 15 µg vaccine versus the IM15 µg vaccine Results of this primary analysis are summarized in Table 6 for the PPI population. The immunogenicity results observed in the ID 15µg group were first compared to those in the IM 15µg group using a non-inferiority testing approach on each strain. For each strain, the primary parameter for non-inferiority was the difference of the log10 transformation of post-vaccination GMTs between the  compared  vaccine  groups:  log10(GMTID)-  log10(GMTIM).  The  non-inferiority  criteria  was  that log10(GMTID)- log10(GMTIM)&gt;-0.176, (equivalent to GMTIM/GMTID&lt;1.5). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the PPI population, the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of the ID 15 µg vaccine versus that of the IM 15 µg vaccine was demonstrated for each of the three strains: the lower bound of the difference of  log10-transformed  post-vaccination  GMTs  was  higher  than  -0.176  for  all  strains.  The  following ratios of GMTs (95%CI) versus the IM 15µg group were observed: 1.52 (1.29; 1.79) for the A/H1N1 strain, 1.70 (1.42; 2.05) for the A/H3N2 strain and 1.49 (1.28; 1.74) for the B strain. As non-inferiority was demonstrated, superiority of the ID 15 µg vaccine over the IM 15 µg vaccine was assessed.

The superiority of the immunogenicity of the ID 15 µg vaccine versus that of the IM 15 µg vaccine was demonstrated in the FASI population for the three strains as the lower bound of the difference of log10-transformed post-vaccination GMTs was greater than 0 (lower bounds of 0.102 for the B strain, 0.112 for the A/H1N1 strain, and 0.153 for the A/H3N2 strain, with adjusted p values &lt;0.0001). The observed  GMTs  were  significantly  higher  in  the  ID  15µg  group  than  in  the  IM  15µg  group.  The following ratios of GMTs (95%CI) versus the IM 15µg group were observed: 1.52 (1.29; 1.79) for the A/H1N1 strain, 1.70 (1.42; 2.04) for the A/H3N2 strain and 1.48 (1.26; 1.73) for the B strain. Results  obtained  in  the  FASI  and  in  the  PPI  populations  led  to  the  same  conclusions,  i.e.  noninferiority and superiority of the ID 15 µg vaccine for the three strains. Comparison between each of the two ID vaccines and the IM vaccine The comparison between the immune responses of the ID 15 µg and ID 21 µg vaccines versus that of the IM 15 µg vaccine, demonstrated a significant superiority of the two ID dose levels over the IM 15 μ g dose level on at least two strains for each CPMP criterion. The comparison between the two ID dose levels both in terms of CPMP criteria and GMTs did not show the superiority of the ID Influenza Vaccine 21 μ g over the ID Influenza Vaccine 15 μ g. Leakage at the injection site Twenty-four  subjects  (6.5%)  presented  a  leakage  in  the  ID  15µg  group  and  21  subjects  (5.7%) presented a leakage in the ID 21µg group. Theoretically, leakage of vaccine from the injection site may  result  in  lower  dose  of  vaccine  being  delivered  and  subsequently  a  lower  immunogenicity response  could  be  seen  in  individuals  with  leakage.  As  leakage  was  observed  in  less  than  15%  of subjects,  the  potential  effect  of  the  presence  of  leakage  at  the  injection  site  on  the  immunogenicity results  was  not  statistically  assessed.  However,  the  immunogenicity  of  the  two  ID  groups  was compared again to the IM 15µg group, in subjects with no leakage on the skin after ID injection, and the results remain similar to those obtained on all subjects. Cell-mediated immunity The cellular responses against influenza were measured in 90 elderly subjects after one injection of ID influenza vaccine (either 15 or 21 µg HA/strain per 0.1 ml dose) or the Vaxigrip Flu IM vaccine (15 µg HA/strain per 0.5 ml dose). Antigenic in  vitro re-stimulations were performed on purified frozen PBMC before and 21 days after vaccination with either killed split of live homologous or heterologous influenza  viruses.  Both  CD4  and  CD8  responses  were  monitored  by  3  different  techniques;  1) intracellular IFNγ and IL-4 staining by flow cytometry, 2) IL-2 release by ELISPOT and 3) Th1/Th2 cytokine profile /IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFNγ , TNFα , IL-2) by Cytometric Bead Array.

Before vaccination, an influenza-specific CD4 Th1 response was observed in all subjects, as judged by a  predominant  IFNγ and  IL-2  secretion  and  the  absence  of  IL-4,  IL-5  and  IL-10  detection.  This response  detected  before  vaccination  was  only  moderately  increased  by  the  vaccination  and  no significant difference was demonstrated between IM and ID routes on DC4 T-cell activation. A CD4 response  against  heterologous  strains  probably  due  to  recognition  of  conserved  CD4  epitope  was observed pre and post vaccination, but once again, no significant difference was observed between ID and IM immunization routes.

A  weak  and  heterogenous  CD8  response  was  measured  by  ICS  before  and  after  vaccination.  This response  was  not  increased  by  the  vaccination  whatever  the  virus  strain  used  for  the  in  vitro  restimulation. No significant differences could be demonstrated between IM and ID routes on CD8 T cell activation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, this study showed that, in elderly population, 21 days after vaccination, the ID influenza vaccine,  with  a  dosage  equivalent  or  superior  to  that  of  Vaxigrip,  induced  a  cellular  response  of comparable profile and intensity that the Vaxigrip administered by the IM route.

First vaccination

Superiority analysis Pre-vaccination  GMTs  and  seroprotection  rates  for  each  strain  were  similar  between  groups.  The primary objective was to demonstrate that the ID investigational vaccine induces a better immunogenicity than the IM control vaccine in terms of seroprotection rate after the first vaccination. A  two-step  approach  was  adopted.  First,  the  non-inferiority  of  the  ID  investigational  vaccine  was assessed based on the analysis performed on the PPI population. As a second step, superiority of the ID investigational vaccine was assessed, using the FASI population. These analyses are summarised in Table 7. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As non-inferiority was demonstrated, superiority of the ID 15 µg vaccine over the IM 15 µg vaccine was assessed in the FASI population. The superiority of the immunogenicity of the ID 15 µg vaccine versus that of the IM 15 µg vaccine was demonstrated in the FASI population for the three strains as the lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference of the seroprotection rates (ID - IM) was above zero (lower bound of 2.67 for the A/H1N1 strain, 3.40 for the A/H3N2 strain and 3.05 for the B strain). The point estimates for the differences of seroprotection rates between the two groups (ID 15 µg . IM 15 µg) were 5.78 for the A/H1N1 strain, 5.49 for the A/H3N2 strain and 6.60 for the B strain.

Results  obtained  in  the  FASI  and  in  the  PPI  populations  led  to  the  same  conclusions;  respectively, non-inferiority of the ID 15 µg vaccine versus the IM 15 µg vaccine in terms of GMTs for the three strains, and superiority of the ID 15 µg vaccine over the IM 15 µg vaccine in terms of seroprotection rates for the three strains. CPMP criteria Overall, seroprotection rates obtained met the CPMP requirements, in both groups, for the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains, values obtained for these two strains being &gt;60%, 95% CIs inclusive. In terms of GMTRs, this CPMP criteria is met for all strains in both groups, 95% CIs inclusive. Seroconversion rates  or  significant  increase  in  titers  obtained  meet  the  CPMP  requirements  for  all  strains  in  the  ID 15µg group (95% Cis inclusive), and for the A/H3N2 and B strains in the IM 15µg group.

## Second vaccination

Immunogenicity results after Vac2 are presented (Table 9) in the Other Immunogenicity Analysis Set population.  Prevaccination  GMTs  for  each  strain  were  similar  between  groups.  The  proportions  of seroprotected subjects at baseline were similar between the ID 15 μ g and IM groups.

Data are not yet available for Vac3. The interim iCSR including results obtained up to 21 days after Vac3 will be available in May 2009.

## Baseline seroprotection status

Based  on  the  results  after  Vac2,  it  is  expected  that  the  same  trend  will  be  obtained  after  Vac3, confirming acceptable repeatability of ID vaccination. Antibody persistence In  GID17,  12  months  after  Vac1,  the  seroprotection  rates  decreased  over  time  with  a  similar  trend observed for the ID Influenza Vaccine 15 μ g and the IM Influenza Vaccine for the three strains. At D180 and D365, seroprotection rates remained slightly higher to similar in the ID 15 μ g and IM 15 μ g groups  for  the  A/H1N1  and  the  A/H3N2  strains.  For  the  B  strain,  at  D180  and  D365,  the seroprotection rates were slightly lower to similar in the ID 15 μ g and IM 15 μ g groups (30.5% at D180 and D365 in the ID 15 μ g group versus 34.0% and 38.3% at D180 and D365, respectively, in the IM 15 μ g group). In both groups, antibody titers remained higher than pre-vaccination titers 12 months after Vac1. At D90 and D180, the seroprotection rate remained ≥ 60% in the ID 15 μ g and IM 15 μ g group for the A strains, except for the A/H1N1 strain in the IM 15 μ g group at D180. At D365, the seroprotection rate remained ≥ 60% in both groups for the A/H3N2 strain, but not for the A/H1N1 and the B strains. As regards GMTs, they remained slightly higher in the ID 15 μ g group than in the IM 15 μ g group for the A/H3N2 strain until D365. For the A/H1N1 strain, anti-HA antibodies remained higher in the ID 15 μ g group than in the IM 15 μ g group until D90, and were similar at D180 and D365. For the B strain, the antibody persistence curve was similar to the A strains although titers were lower. There  were  no  major  differences  between  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  15 μ g  and  the  IM  Influenza Vaccine regarding the drop in GMTs, i.e. ratios of GMTs V03/V02, V04/V02, and V05/V02 for any strain. Effect of presence of wheal or after injection or presence of leakage at the injection site Among the subjects vaccinated with the ID 15 µg vaccine, 1 149 (44.1%) presented a wheal at the injection  site.  In  the  OI  analysis  set,  no  difference  was  observed  in  the  immune  response  between subjects presenting a wheal or not at injection. The immune response in these subsets of subjects was similar to the one observed in the whole population Analysis on immunogenicity parameters (post-vaccination GMTs and CPMP criteria) was conducted on subgroups of subjects of the ID 15µg group (OI population) presenting (or not) a leakage of the vaccine product after injection. Among the subjects vaccinated with the ID 15 µg vaccine, 65 (2.5%) presented a leakage, and 2 539 (97.4%) had no leakage. All parameters presented showed no relevant differences between subjects presenting a leakage and those without leakage Medicinal product no longer authorised

The post-vaccination GMTs and GMTRs were described in the FASI population in the subjects who were  not  seroprotected  at  baseline  (titer  &lt;40  [1/dil]).  A  large  number  of  subjects  were  not seroprotected before vaccination: 1 749 (66.3%) and 711 subjects (57.0%), (A/H1N1 strain), in the ID 15µg and IM 15µg groups, respectively, 1 325 (87.0%) and 570 (77.4%) (A/H3N2 strain), and 2 280 (49.9%) and 942 (42.6%) (B strain).

Among these subjects, post-vaccination seroprotection rates were higher for subjects vaccinated with the ID 15 µg vaccine than for those vaccinated with the IM 15 µg vaccine. Indeed, the differences in seroprotection rates (ID-IM) and 95% CI were of 9.36% (5.12; 13.6) for the A/H1N1 strain, 9.65% (5.88;  13.6)  for  the  A/H3N2  strain  and  7.34%  (3.56;  11.1)  for  the  B  strain.  The  responses  were consistently lower in subjects with a baseline titer&lt;40 [1/dil], than in subjects who were seroprotected at baseline.

## Influence of potentially important covariates on seroprotection rates at D21

Additionally,  the  influence  of  several  covariates  (previous  influenza  vaccination  status,  gender,  age group, country, BMI and risk status) on seroprotection rates observed in the ID 15µg and IM 15µg groups  were  explored  separately  in  the  FASI  population.  Whatever  the  studied  covariate,  the  odds ratio  between vaccine groups was not significantly different across the covariate categories and the same trends were observed in both vaccine groups. · Clinical studies in special populations No studies in special populations were performed. · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) An integrated analysis of study GID15 and GID23 was performed. The analysis provides a descriptive comparison between the ID 9µg and IM 15 µg vaccines. The results of the analysis did not change the conclusions from each individual study. An  integrated  analysis  of  studies  GID16  and  GID17  was  performed.  The  analysis  provides  a descriptive comparison of between the ID 15µg and IM 15 µg vaccines. The results of the analysis did not change the conclusions from each individual study. Clinical safety · Patient exposure The overall safety analysis set across all the studies of the clinical development program, regardless of the  delivery  system  used,  included  3 934  vaccinations  for  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  9 μ g  and  3 031 vaccinations for the ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg. Pooled data from the four key trials represent a total of 2384 adult subjects administered ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg and 2974 elderly subjects administered ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg. Comparison is made with 843 and 1458 subjects, respectively, having received IM Influenza Vaccine as a comparator. The demographic characteristics at baseline were homogeneous between the key studies and between the groups of each individual study. In the adult indication fewer males than females were included in these  studies:  40.9%  versus  59.1%  in  the  ID  9 μ g  group  and  39.1%  versus  60.9%  in  the  IM  15 μ g group. Baseline parameters such as skin type, body mass index (BMI), and risk status were measured in GID23 and were homogeneous between the ID 9 μ g and IM 15 μ g groups. Fewer males than females were included in the key elderly studies: 45.3% versus 54.7% in the ID 15 μ g group and 46.3% versus 53.7% in the IM 15 μ g group. Baseline parameters such as skin type, BMI,  and  risk  status  were  measured  in  GID17  and  were  homogeneous  between  the  ID 15 μ g  and IM 15 μ g groups.

- Adverse events

Table 10 presents an overall summary of solicited and unsolicited reactions and events and SAEs 21 days post-vaccination in the key studies in adults and in the elderly. As shown in this overview table, the frequency of injection site reactions was expectedly higher in subjects vaccinated by the ID route than by the IM route. Moreover, no difference emerged between the ID and the IM group in terms of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

solicited systemic AEs and unsolicited AEs. In terms of age group, AEs and reactions tended to be more frequent in adults than in the elderly overall.

## Notes:

For solicited reactions, the denominator for percentages is the number of vaccinated subjects with at least one safety record available for solicited reactions. For unsolicited events, the denominator for percentages is the number of vaccinated subjects with at least one safety record available. For Serious Adverse Events, the denominator is the number of vaccinated subjects.

n: number of subjects

By convention for the integrated analysis, solicited AEs (at injection site or systemic) were considered as related to the vaccination and are called solicited injection site reactions or solicited systemic reactions.

Results on key studies correspond only to the data of GID23 in adults and GID17 in the elderly.

## Immediate reactions

In the key studies, few immediate reactions were reported overall and most were reported in adults. These reactions tended to occur in a similar proportion in the ID and IM group.

In the ID group, 11 adult subjects out of 1796 (0.6%) had 16 immediate reactions and three elderly subjects out of 2612 (0.1%) had four immediate reactions. In the IM group, two adult subjects out of 453 (0.4%) had two immediate reactions; none occurred in the elderly. None of the subjects with at least one immediate reaction had a SAE. In the adult and in the elderly population, immediate reactions in the ID group occurred mostly in the System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  of  Nervous  System  Disorders  (five  reactions  in  five  subjects),  GastroIntestinal Disorders (three reactions in three subjects), Infections and Infestations (two reactions in two subjects),  General  Disorders  (two  reactions  in  one  subject),  and  Musculo-Skeletal  Disorders  (two reactions in two subjects). All  immediate  reactions  in  the  elderly  were  mild.  In  adults,  most  were  mild.  Four  adult  subjects experienced eight moderate or severe immediate reactions. In the overall adult and elderly populations combined, 17 subjects out of 6557 vaccinations (0.3%) had 23 immediate reactions in the ID group and two subjects out of 3001 vaccinations (0.1%) had two immediate reactions in the IM group. Solicited Reactions By convention for the integrated analysis, solicited AEs, at injection site or systemic, were considered as  related  to  the  vaccination  and  are  called  solicited  injection  site  reactions  or  solicited  systemic reactions Injection site reactions In both the adult and elderly population, injection site reactions following ID vaccination with respect to IM injection were more frequent, as seen in the key trials. This was expected, and confirmed results obtained in the earlier trials. In the pool of all studies, the frequency of solicited injection site reactions was similar to what was observed in the key studies. All solicited injection site reactions, with the exception of echymosis, were observed with incidences ≥ 10%  in  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  groups  (both  adult  and  elderly  population).  The  injection  site reactions erythema, swelling, induration were more frequent and more extensive in subjects vaccinated with  the  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  with  respect  to  the  IM  Influenza  Vaccine.  Pruritus  was  also  more frequently  reported  following  ID  vaccination.  The  majority  of  the  injection  site  reactions  initially occurred  the  day  following  vaccination.  Importantly,  the  majority  lasted  only  3  days  and  resolved spontaneously. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In terms of severity, a marked difference was observed for erythema, swelling and induration in favour of the IM group, especially for erythema, and tended to occur longer than in the subjects vaccinated by de  IM  route.  In  both  the  adult  and  the  elderly  population,  solicited  injection  site  reactions  in  the subjects vaccinated by the ID route were more frequent (especially erythema, induration, swelling and pruritus)

In both adults and elderly injection site pain, as well as injection site ecchymosis, whether severe or not, occurred in similar proportions in the IM and ID group

Solicited systemic reactions were not found either to be more severe or to occur longer in the ID group than in the subjects vaccinated by the IM route. Except for three reactions that were not solicited in the key  studies,  i.e. asthenia,  arthralgia ,  and sweating ,  no  difference  emerged  from  the  analysis  of solicited systemic reactions in the pool of all studies compared to the key studies. There was no safety signal  as  regards  the  solicited  systemic  reactions  that  occurred  within  7 days  after  vaccination, whatever the dose level of ID Influenza Vaccine and the delivery route

Injection site reactions (evaluated from Day 0 to Day 7 after vaccination) Systemic reactions (evaluated from Day 0 to Day 21 after vaccination) Systemic reactions In  adults  and  in  the  elderly, headache,  malaise ,  and myalgia were  the  most  commonly  reported solicited reactions.In both the adult and the elderly population, solicited systemic reactions were found to occur with the same frequency in the subjects vaccinated by the ID route or by the IM route. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall the systemic solicited reactions were more frequent in the adult than in the elderly population. Data from the key studies confirm that the incidences of systemic reactions were similar following ID administration with respect to IM administration in both the adults and the elderly population (Table 11).

In  terms  of  severity,  the  highest  proportion  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  moderate  or  severe AEs occurred,  in  both  the  ID  and  the  IM  group,  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations  (3.1%  of  ID subjects).

In both the adults and the elderly population, EMEA-defined reactions occurred at similar frequencies following ID or IM administration in the key studies. The most frequently reported reactions in both groups were malaise, shivering, and injection site ecchymosis. Unsolicited adverse events Unsolicited  events  reported  for  approximately  21  days  after  vaccination  were  analyzed  across  key studies, first by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC), then by primary Preferred Term (PT). Unsolicited AEs occurring at injection site are considered as reactions. Approximately 75% of the events reported were considered as unrelated to vaccination by the study investigators. The frequencies of all reactions by SOC were &lt;3% for adults administered ID Influenza Vaccine  9µg  and  &lt;  1%  for  elderly  subjects  administered  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  15µg.  Analysis  of SOCs corresponding to reported reactions showed no clinically relevant differences between the ID Influenza  Vaccine  and  the  IM  vaccine  in  both  adults  and  elderly.  Each  individual  reaction  was reported at a frequency below 1%. Adult Studies In the key studies , the most common unsolicited AEs and reactions occurred in the same SOCs in the ID and the IM group, although not in the same order of frequency. Overall frequencies were similar between the ID and the IM group, for each SOC and in terms of severity and relation to vaccination. In the ID group, the SOCs with the highest frequencies of events and reactions were Infections and Infestations (9.3% - mostly nasopharyngitis and rhinitis), Nervous System Disorders (5.2% - mostly headache and migraine), General Disorders (4.2% - mostly fatigue, influenza-like illness, asthenia, and injection site warmth), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (4.2% -mostly pharyngolaryngeal  pain),  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (3.6%  -  mostly  diarrhea  and  nausea),  and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (3.6% - mostly back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, pain in extremity). Similar results were found in the overall IM group. The AEs categorized as common (i.e. with a frequency &gt;1%) in the ID group were: · Nasopharyngitis (3.9%) · Headache (3.4%) · Pharyngolaryngeal pain (2.6%) · Rhinitis (1.4%) · Back pain (1.3%) Cough (1.1%) Dysmenorrhea (1.1%) Medicinal product no longer authorised

No unsolicited  adverse reaction was  found  to  be  common  at  the  PT  level  in  the  key  adult  studies. Some  systemic  reactions  appeared  to  be  common  at  the  SOC  level  (General  Disorders  and Administration  Site  Conditions,  and  Infections  and  Infestations).  Those  were  never  moderate  or severe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  both  the  ID  and  the  IM  group,  the  highest  proportion  of  subjects  with  moderate  or  severe unsolicited reactions was found in the SOC of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, with  0.5%  to  0.6%  (and  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations  in  the  IM  group  with  0.5%), including five cases of severe influenza-like illness (0.2%), three cases of severe asthenia (0.1%), and three cases of severe fatigue (0.1%). As for severe injection site reactions, they included one severe injection site discoloration, one severe injection site reaction, and one severe injection site warmth.

In  the  pool  of all  studies ,  the  most  frequent  unsolicited  events and  reactions  occurred  in  the  same SOCs as in the key studies. Overall frequencies were similar between the ID and the IM group, for each SOC and in terms of relation to vaccination. Elderly Studies In the key studies, the most common unsolicited events and reactions occurred in the same SOCs in the  ID  and  the  IM  group,  although  not  in  the  same  order  of  frequency.  Overall  frequencies  were similar  between  the  ID  and  the  IM  group,  for  each  SOC  and  in  terms  of  severity  and  relation  to vaccination. In GID16, however, a higher proportion of subjects had unsolicited systemic AEs in the ID group (20.6%) than in the IM group (14.4%) overall, although similar frequencies were found at the level of each SOC individually. In the ID group, the SOCs with the highest frequencies of events and reactions were Infections and Infestations (4.2%, mostly nasopharyngitis), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (2.4%, mostly  back  pain),  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (1.4%,  mostly  fatigue, pyrexia, and asthenia), Gastrointestinal Disorders (1.2%, mostly diarrhea), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (1.2%, mostly pharyngolaryngeal pain and cough), Nervous System Disorders (0.9%, mostly headache and dizziness). Similar results were found in the overall IM group. Nasopharyngitis was the only AE considered as common at the PT level (1.0% in the IM group, and 1.2% in the ID group). The SOCs with an overall ID frequency &gt;1% were similar in the IM group. In the ID group, no moderate or severe systemic AE appeared to be common at the level of the PT, only at the level of the SOC: Infections and Infestations (1.6%) and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders  (1.1%).  No  systemic  or  injection  site  reaction  was  found  to  be  common  at  the  PT  level. Similar results were found in the overall IM group. In  terms  of  severity,  the  highest  proportion  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  moderate  or  severe AEs occurred, in the ID and the IM group, in the SOC of Infections and Infestations (1.6% of ID subjects). In the ID group, the most frequent events in this SOC included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and rhinitis (those had a frequency &gt;0.1%). No unsolicited adverse reaction was found to be common either at the PT or at the SOC level in the key elderly studies. The highest proportion of subjects with moderate or severe unsolicited reactions occurred in the SOC of Infections and Infestations in the ID group (0.4%) and the IM group (0.3%). In this SOC, in the ID group, severe reactions included three severe cases of influenza (0.1%), three severe cases of rhinitis (0.1%), two severe cases of bronchitis (0.1%), one severe case of herpes simplex, and one severe case of laryngitis, one severe pharyngitis, one severe respiratory tract infection, and one severe pneumonia. There was no severe injection site reaction. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  the  pool  of all  studies ,  the  most  frequent  unsolicited  events and  reactions  occurred  in  the  same SOCs as in the pool of key studies. Overall frequencies were similar between the ID and the IM group, for each SOC and in terms of relation to vaccination.

In addition to the AEs categorized as common in the pool of key studies, two AEs had a frequency &gt;1%  in  the  ID  group  when  all  studies  are  taken  into  account:  headache  (1.0%)  and  injection  site pruritus,  with  a  frequency  of  1.4%  in  the  ID  group,  being  the  only  adverse reaction categorized  as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

common in the pool of all studies in the elderly population. No SOC had a markedly higher frequency in all elderly studies altogether compared to the key studies only.

During the procedure the Applicant has provided new safety data for the 3 rd ID vaccination in adults (study GID15) (494 subjects, including 71 for the first time), and for the 2 nd vaccination in elderly in GID17 (2 974, including 511 for the first time). Overall the adult safety database has been increased to 3 825 doses of ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg (with the final Micro-Injection System) in 3 049 adults. The elderly database provides safety data after administration of 5 939 doses of ID Influenza Vaccine 15µg in 3 485 elderly subjects.

Overall, in the 6-month period after the first vaccination, 138 subjects (5.3%) in the ID 15µg group and 53 subjects (4.9%) in the IM 15µg group had at least one serious adverse event (SAE). There were no related SAEs in the IM group.

Results of GID15 (adults) for the third vaccination provided no indication in either the adult or the elderly populations that there is an increase in frequency or severity of adverse reactions following repeated  vaccinations,  and  the  ID  and  IM  vaccinations  appear  to  be  interchangeable  from  a  safety perspective. Additional  data  of  a  6-month  follow  up  after  a  2 nd vaccination  in  adults  and  elderly  show  that  the frequency of SAEs and Deaths, including AESI.s, did not increase after revaccination with the ID or the IM route. The Applicant commits to provide remaining data from 2 nd and 3 rd vaccination in elderly (GID17). · Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events GID15 After the second vaccination, 25 subjects (4.7%) in the ID 9µg group had 25 SAEs and 14 subjects (4.0%)  had  16  SAEs  in  the  IM  15µg  group.  In  each  group,  SAEs  occurred  mostly  in  the  SOC  of Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications (mainly fractures) with 6 subjects (1.1%) in the ID group and 5 subjects (1.4%) in the IM group. The next most frequent SOCs in the ID group were Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified Neoplasms (1.1%) and Psychiatric Disorders (0.8%). In the IM group, the next most frequent SOCs were Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders in the IM group (0.9%), Nervous System Disorders (0.6%), and Psychiatric Disorders (0.6%). No deaths occurred. GID23 Over the whole study a total of 47 subjects experienced 49 SAEsa including three deaths, 39 subjects (2.2%)  in  the  ID  9µg  group  experienced  41  SAEs  and  8  subjects  (1.8%)  in  the  IM  15µg  group experienced 8 SAEs. All  SAEs  were  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  the  vaccine  or  experiment  according  to  both  the Investigator and the Sponsor. The time to onset and heterogeneous distribution of these cases across SOCs did not raise any specific area of concern regarding the safety profile of the vaccine. Three deaths were reported during the 6-month follow-up period, two in the ID 9µg group and one in the  IM  15µg.  None  of  these  deaths  were  assessed  as  related  to  vaccination  according  to  both  the Investigator and the Sponsor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

One subject in the ID group had a serious episode of myopericarditis. According to the Investigator, the event could have been related to the study vaccine as it is known that the influenza virus can cause myopericarditis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The outcome was fatal for 19 subjects (0.7%) in the ID group and 4 (0.4%) in the IM group, lifethreatening for 8 subjects (0.3%) in the ID group and 5 subjects (0.5%) in the IM group.

## VAC2

Overall,  more  than  21  days  after  the  second  vaccination,  29  subjects  (1.2%)  in  the  ID\\ID  group,  6 subjects (1.2%) in the IM\\ID group, and 6 subjects (1.2%) in the IM\\IM group had at least one SAE. No SAEs were considered by the Investigator to be related to the vaccine.

In the ID\\ID group, 5 subjects died, 17 recovered, 5 recovered with sequelae, and for 3 subjects the SAE was still ongoing at the end of the follow-up period. In the IM\\ID group, 1 subject died and 5 recovered.  In  the  IM\\IM  group,  1  subject  died,  1  recovered,  1  recovered  with  sequelae,  and  for  3 subjects the SAE was still ongoing at the end of the follow-up period. · Laboratory findings As the ID Influenza Vaccine is manufactured according to a process derived from the Applicant's IM Influenza  Vaccine,  no  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  have  been  performed  during  this  clinical development program. · Safety in special populations Analysis  of  the  influence  of  gender  or  risk  status  on  the  safety  of  the  Influenza  Vaccine  revealed similar trends between the ID and the IM group. Overall, there were more vaccinations followed by reactions  and  events  in  female  than  male  subjects,  and  more  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  male population. In Phase III studies, especially in the elderly, the subjects with a risk status had more SAEs in the ID and in the IM groups. No  clinical  data  on  exposed  pregnancies  are  available.  A  follow-up  of  pregnancies  conducted  in GID02, GID15, and GID23 did not reveal any safety signal in the outcome of pregnancies. · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions No drug interaction studies have been performed for the investigational product, although in all studies subjects were not included if vaccination had been performed in the 4 weeks prior to vaccination with the investigational product - or was planned in the 4 weeks following vaccination. This was in order to minimize possible vaccine-vaccine interactions. · Discontinuation due to adverse events In  the  key  studies,  in  both  the  adult  and  elderly  populations,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who discontinued due to an AE or SAE was similar between the ID and IM groups within each individual study. · Post marketing experience There is no safety data from post-marketing experience with the ID Influenza Vaccine. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considers  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the requirements and provides adequate evidence that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

The ID vaccine is very commonly associated with a range of local and systemic adverse reactions. These adverse events are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use in adults 18 to 59 years and elderly aged &gt; 60 years.

During the evaluation, two major objections and a number of other concerns related to quality were identified.  These  have  been  appropriately  addressed  by  the  Applicant  and  are  considered  resolved. Two minor unresolved quality issues, having no impact on the Risk-benefit balance of the product, will be resolved as post-approval commitments Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The safety of the intradermal vaccine was studied in two repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits. There was no evidence for systemic toxicity. ID vaccination caused inflammatory reactions at the injection sites  at  all  doses  tested,  characterized  by  reversible  erythema and edema. Similar observations have been  made  in  the  clinic,  and  the  importance  of  local  reactions  for  the  benefit-risk  of  this  product should be based on clinical data. A  developmental  toxicity  study  was  conducted  in  rabbit,  addressing  female  fertility,  embryo-fetal development (including an evaluation of teratogenicity) and early postnatal development. There were no adverse effects on any of these parameters. Antibodies to the vaccine were observed in both the dams and the foetuses. Efficacy The Applicant has provided evidence that the ID route of immunization is at least as immunogenic as the IM route. The immune responses as determined by HI after ID vaccination with 9 µg in the adult population  (18-59  years)  are  non-inferior  to  the  responses  to  the  Applicant's  licensed  IM  influenza vaccine (15 µg/dose) (Vaxigrip). Likewise, the immune  responses after ID vaccination with 15 µg/dose  in  an  elderly  population  (&gt;60  years)  were  shown  to  be  non-inferior.  In  addition  the immune response in elderly was also shown to be statistically superior to that after IM vaccination with 15 µg/dose. Although the difference between the ID and IM administration routes in elderly was statistically significant, the clinical relevance of the difference is questionable. Safety Overall the adult safety database includes 3 825 doses of ID Influenza Vaccine 9µg (with the final Micro-Injection System) administered in 3 049 adults. The elderly database provides safety data after administration  of  5  939  doses  of  ID  Influenza  Vaccine  15µg  in  3  485  elderly  subjects.  This  is considered  to  be  sufficient  to  describe  adverse  reactions  that  occur  uncommonly  and  to  give  an indication of any rare events. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although injection site reactions were as expected higher in subjects vaccinated by the ID route than by the IM route, no other data indicate that the safety of this vaccine is different from other authorised IM influenza vaccines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- User consultation

Based on the justification stated by the MAH regarding the testing of one version only of the PIL, it is acceptable that only the 15 µg strength has been tested. The legibility test report provided by the applicant is considered acceptable. Risk-benefit assessment Context The active substances present in the vaccine are known and are produced in a manner that is identical to  that  of  the  Applicant's  IM  seasonal  Influenza  Vaccine,  with  all  excipients  present  in  the  ID Influenza Vaccine being also present in the Applicant's IM seasonal Influenza Vaccine. Thus, from the composition point of view it is not anticipated any specific new risk associated with this vaccine. Benefits Intanza induces an adequate immune response in adults between 18 to 60 years and in the older than 60 years of age that was general comparable to that induced by a comparator IM vaccine containing 15 µg of antigen. The vaccine uses a system that delivers the antigens into the dermis. The final Micro-injection system features a pre-filled, ready-to-use syringe with an integral micro-needle that protrudes 1.5 mm from the proximal end of the glass syringe. A benefit of this system compared to the classical intra dermal injection (Mantoux method) is that it overcomes the difficulties associated with the Mantoux method. The short length of the needle minimizes the risk of mechanical damage to nerves and blood vessels during ID administration. Risk Intanza  is  very  commonly  associated  with  a  range  of  local  and  systemic  adverse  reactions.  These adverse events are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use in adults 18 to 59 years and elderly aged &gt; 60 years. The  current  safety  database  is  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  describe  adverse  reactions  that  occur uncommonly and to give an indication of any rare events. All adverse events of special interest will be continuously followed- up and be cumulatively presented in the PSURs as well as be addressed in the RMP. A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Balance

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Intanza in the following indication:

## 9 microgram strength:

Prophylaxis of influenza in adults up to 59 years of age, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications.

The use of Intanza should be based on official recommendations. 15 microgram strength: Prophylaxis of influenza in individuals 60 years of age and over, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications. The use of Intanza should be based on official recommendations. was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation. Medicinal product no longer authorised
