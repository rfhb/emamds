## 1. Introduction

Velcade (bortezomib) is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsinlike  activity  of  the  26S  proteasome  in  mammalian  cells.  The  26S  proteasome  is  a  large  protein complex that  degrades  ubiquitinated  proteins.  The  ubiquitin-proteasome  pathway  plays  an  essential role in orchestrating the turnover of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition  of  the  26S  proteasome  prevents  this  targeted  proteolysis  and  affects  multiple  signalling cascades within the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death.

On 26 April 2004, Velcade was authorised under exceptional circumstances in the European Union where it is currently indicated in mono-therapy for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation.

In  the  present  application,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  of  Velcade  applied  for  an extension of indication for the treatment of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma with subsequent changes in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. The Package Leaflet is proposed to be updated accordingly.

The following indication in section 4.1 has been agreed:

'Velcade in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant.'

## 2. Clinical aspects

Velcade  for  injection  is  currently  approved  in  85  countries  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed  multiple myeloma in patients who have progressed after receiving at least 1 previous line of treatment. It was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union in 2004 initially as therapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 2 prior lines of treatment. Subsequently, the indication was  extended  to treat patients with multiple myeloma  earlier in the course of the disease (EMEA/H/C/539/II/05, Commission Decision on 20 April 2005).

Multiple  myeloma  (also  known  as  myeloma  or  plasma  cell  myeloma,  MM)  is  a  progressive hematologic disease. It is characterized by excessive numbers of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of intact monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE) or BenceJones protein (free  monoclonal κ and λ light  chains).  The  estimated  incidence  of  MM  in  Europe  is 23,000 per year. MM is still considered to be an incurable disease and the 5-year relative survival rate is around 33%. Median age at diagnosis is 65 to 70 years, with the incidence of myeloma increasing with age. Multiple myeloma usually manifests as 1 or more lytic bone lesions, monoclonal protein in the  blood  or  urine,  and  disease  in  the  bone  marrow.  Disease  progression  is  often  associated  with worsening  of  symptoms  and  organ  dysfunction  characteristic  of  myeloma,  such  as  anemia,  bone lesion-related symptoms, renal function impairment, and susceptibility to infections. Current treatment options, therefore, aim not only to improve survival but also to induce tumour response, inhibit tumour progression, and delay disease-related complications.

The  current  recommendation  is  to  incorporate  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  stem  cell  transplant (HDT/SCT) into initial therapy programs for patients 65 years of age or younger. In patients older than 65 years of age, the value of HDT/SCT is controversial and has not been formally established even in prospective  randomized  studies.  Given  that  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  of  multiple  myeloma  is between  65  and  70  years,  the  majority  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  is  treated  only  with  standard chemotherapy,  with  no  consideration  for  HDT/SCT  because  of  poor  physical  condition,  comorbidities, and increased toxicity.

Standard chemotherapy regimens include melphalan-prednisone (MP), VAD (vincristine-doxorubicindexamethasone), thalidomide-dexamethasone, and alkylating-agent combinations. Combination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chemotherapy with MP has been the standard-of-care in front-line non-transplant multiple myeloma therapy since the 1960s, and remains the most widely accepted treatment option for patients ineligible for HDT/SCT.

The present application is supported by Study MMY-3002, designed to determine whether the addition of  Velcade  to  standard  MP  therapy  (Vc-MP)  would  improve  the  outcome  of  previously  untreated patients with multiple myeloma.

## 2.1 Clinical pharmacology

As a sub-study  of  the  Phase  3  Study  MMY-3002,  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  Velcade  with  and without co-administration of MP was examined during the first 2 cycles of treatment with Velcade. Twenty-seven (27) subjects were enrolled into this study in 6 countries but only 20 of them completed the sub-study.

The PK parameters of Velcade administered alone or in combination with melphalan and prednisone are presented in the tables below.

Overall, the pharmacokinetic profile of Velcade in this study was similar to that previously reported. All  pharmacokinetic  parameter  values  were  comparable  between  the  two  groups,  although  interindividual variability was high when Velcade was given alone or in combination with MP. The large apparent volume of distribution of Velcade suggested extensive peripheral tissue distribution, which was similar for all study days and treatments. Due to the high degree of inter-subject variability, the 90% confidence intervals of mean plasma peak concentration and exposure measures extended beyond the regulatory guideline range of 80% to 125%. However, a closer interpretation of individual profiles and graphical data analysis indicated that there was no apparent drug-drug interaction when MP was co-administered with Velcade. This interpretation is supported by the clinical data in Study MMY3002,  indicating  a  similar  dose  intensity  of  melphalan  in  the  Velcade  +  MP  (Vc-MP)  and  MP treatment groups, and a dose intensity of Velcade in the Vc-MP treatment group is consistent with prior single-agent Velcade studies. Therefore, a statement is included in section 4.5 to reflect that the 17% increase in mean bortezomib AUC observed was not considered as clinically relevant.

## 2.2 Clinical efficacy

## · Methods

## Study design

Study MMY-3002 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety of Velcade plus standard MP therapy versus MP therapy in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma who were not considered candidates for HDT/SCT.

The  study  consisted  of  3  Phases:  a  pre-randomization  (screening)  phase,  an  open-label  treatment phase,  and  a  post-treatment  follow-up  phase.  In  the  post-treatment  follow-up  phase,  subjects  were followed until death or a maximum of 4.5 years after the last subject was randomized in the study.

## Study population

The  study  population  included  men  and  women  with  previously  untreated  symptomatic  multiple myeloma  or  asymptomatic  multiple  myeloma  with  related  organ  or  tissue  damage  who  were  not candidates  for  HDT/SCT  due  to  age  (65  years  or  older)  or,  in  subjects  less  than  65,  presence  of important  comorbid  condition(s)  likely  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  tolerability  of  HDT/SCT. Presence of measurable disease was  required for both secretory multiple  myeloma  and  for oligosecretory or nonsecretory multiple myeloma.

In  order  to  ensure  that  the  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  and  unbiased,  randomization,  with  a 1:1 allocation  ratio,  was  stratified  by  baseline  beta2-microglobulin  and  baseline  albumin  (both independent prognostic factors in untreated multiple myeloma), as well as by region (North America, Europe, other).

## Dose and Schedule

A 6-week treatment cycle for Vc-MP and MP was selected to align the Velcade treatment regimen with the MP treatment regimen used in many studies in past, and to provide consistency and to ensure continued symmetry in efficacy and safety assessments across treatment.

Treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is often continued for a fixed time period of 6 to 12 months or until a response plateau is reached. A 12-month (54-week) duration of therapy (the same for  both  treatment  arms)  was  chosen  on  the  basis  of  historical  data  on  the  average  duration  of  MP therapy and the lack of benefit of maintenance therapy with MP, as well as the prescribing information for melphalan. A fixed duration of therapy was chosen for Study MMY-3002 to minimize the potential impact of heterogeneity in geographic treatment patterns on the time-dependent primary endpoint.

In Study MMY-3002, melphalan was dosed at 9 mg/m 2 (approximately equivalent to the 0.25 mg/kg dose originally used), together with the most frequently used steroid regimen of prednisone, 60 mg/m 2 per day on Days 1 to 4 of each 6-week cycle.

In the Vc-MP treatment group, Velcade was added to MP for the entire 54-week duration of treatment at a dose of 1.3 mg/m 2 . During the first 24 weeks, Velcade was given twice weekly for 2 consecutive weeks, followed by a week off. In order to match the 6-week MP cycle, 2 of these 3-week treatment periods were considered 1 cycle of Velcade. This dose and twice-weekly cycle is the same as currently approved for patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. After 24 weeks, a less dose-intense, i.e., weekly regimen, of Velcade was administered.

## Endpoints

The primary endpoint was Time to Progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints included Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), Overall Response (OR) rate, Complete Response (CR) rate, time to first response, duration of response, and patient-reported outcomes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy  assessments  included  the  following:  myeloma  protein  (M-protein)  measurements  in  serum and  24-hour  urine  including  immunofixation  testing,  bone  marrow  examination,  skeletal  survey, documentation of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and serum calcium level adjusted for albumin.

To assess other potential indications of clinical benefit, additional analyses included the effects of VcMP  and  MP  on: time to subsequent therapy; myeloma-related complications (incidence of hypercalcemia,  incidence  of  renal  function  impairment,  incidence  of  anemia,  incidence  of  skeletal events); Grade 3 or 4 infection rates; and immune reconstitution of normal immunoglobulins.

## · Results

## Study population

At the time of the clinical cut-off date of 15 June 2007 for the third interim analysis, 682 subjects from 151 centers in 22 countries were enrolled into Study MMY-3002, with 344 subjects randomized to the Vc-MP  treatment group and 338 subjects randomized to the MP  treatment group. Of the 682 randomized subjects (intent-to-treat [ITT] population), 677 were treated (safety population), with 668 of these subjects further included in the response-evaluable population. On 15 June 2007, 45% of Vc-MP subjects and 41% of MP subjects had completed all 9 cycles of study treatment, while 14% and 10%, respectively, were still undergoing treatment. Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and extent of disease at baseline were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Treatment groups were distributed similarly by region, with the majority (79%) of subjects enrolled at sites in the Europe/Australia Region. The patient population was mainly (80%) Caucasian.

Table 3 provides a summary of selected baseline and disease characteristics for the Vc-MP and MP treatment groups in Study MMY-3002.

Vc-MP=VELCADE-melphalan-prednisone; MP=melphalan-prednisone

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Time to Progression

There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  TTP,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  in  favour  of subjects treated with Vc-MP. The median TTP was 20.7 months (631 days) in the Vc-MP treatment group  compared  with  15.0  months  (456  days)  in  the  MP  treatment  group  (hazard  ratio=0.540; p=0.000002), demonstrating a 46% decrease in the risk of progression/relapse for subjects in the VcMP group (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Several sensitivity analyses, including TTP as determined by the investigator and TTP (as determined by algorithm) without censoring for subsequent therapies, were performed and were consistent with the conclusions from the primary analysis.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression-Free Survival

The difference in PFS in favour of Vc-MP-treated subjects was statistically significant and consistent with the results of the TTP analysis. Median PFS was 18.3 months (556 days) in the Vc-MP treatment group and 14 months (425 days) in the MP treatment group (hazard ratio=0.609; p=0.00001) (Figure 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall Survival

A  significant  survival  benefit  favouring  the  Vc-MP  treatment  group  was  demonstrated  (hazard ratio=0.607;  p=0.00782).  At  the  time  of  the  clinical  cut-off,  representing  a  median  follow-up  of 16.3 months, 121 subjects had died (45 subjects [13%] in the Vc-MP treatment group and 76 subjects [23%] in the MP treatment group) (Figure 3). While median OS was not reached in either treatment group,  the  1-year  survival  rate  in  the  Vc-MP  and  MP  treatment  groups  was  89.1%  and  81.8%, respectively. The 2-year survival rate in the Vc-MP and MP treatment groups was 82.6% and 69.5%, respectively.

Sixty-eight subjects (20%) in the Vc-MP treatment group and 121 subjects (36%) in the MP treatment group received subsequent therapy by the time of the clinical cut-off for the third interim analysis. In the  Vc-MP treatment group, 8 of the 68 subjects (12%) received subsequent therapy with Velcade, while  54  of  the  121  subjects  (45%)  in  the  MP  treatment  group  received  subsequent  therapy  with Velcade.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Best Response to Treatment

The improvement in TTP observed in the study was supported by statistically significant differences in favour of subjects in the Vc-MP treatment group in OR and CR rates. The OR rate (CR+PR) was 71% in  the  Vc-MP treatment group and 35% in the MP treatment group (odds ratio=4.5; p&lt;10-10). One hundred  and  two  subjects  (30%)  in  the  Vc-MP  treatment  group  and  12  subjects  (4%)  in  the  MP treatment group had a CR (odds ratio=11.2;p&lt;10-10). Partial response was reported in 136 subjects (40%) in the Vc-MP treatment group and 103 subjects (31%) in the MP treatment group. Five subjects in the Vc-MP treatment group had an immunofixation-positive CR (IF+ CR).

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Time to First Response

For those subjects who responded to treatment, median time to first response was 1.4 months (43 days) in the Vc-MP treatment group and 4.2 months (128 days) in the MP treatment group. The median time to  best  response  and  median  time  to  CR  was  2.3  months  (69  days)  and  4.2  months  (127  days), respectively, in the Vc-MP treatment group and 4.9 months (148 days) and 5.3 months (161 days) in the MP treatment group, respectively.

For all subjects, based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, time to first response (hazard ratio=3.874; p&lt;1010), time to best response (hazard ratio=3.155; p&lt;10-10), and time to CR (hazard ratio=9.152; p&lt;1010) were significantly earlier in Vc-MP-treated subjects compared with MP-treated subjects.

Although most responses occurred early, there were, however, some late de novo responses in the VcMP treatment  group  which,  according  to  the  applicant,  justified  the  use  of  54  weeks  schedule.  In particular,  9  PRs  (9/228  subjects  [4%])  occurred  after  the  initial  24  weeks  and  during  the  weekly treatment Cycles 5 to 9. Moreover, response for subjects receiving Vc-MP continued to improve with continuing therapy. Twenty-nine of 102 CRs (28%) in the Vc-MP treatment group obtained a CR as their  best  response  after  the  first  24  weeks  of  treatment  (converted  from  PR  on  the  twice-weekly treatment cycles [Cycles 1 to 4] to CR on the weekly treatment [Cycles 5 to 9]). This can be seen as a justification to continue the therapy for the protocol-defined treatment period (i.e., 54 weeks). Since CR is reported to be associated with prolonged TTP and survival, these data suggest that continued therapy results in clinical benefit. The number of patients gaining benefit from the longer treatment are, however, not very high.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Duration of Response

Tumour responses obtained on the Vc-MP regimen were durable. The median duration of response, by the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  was  19.9  months  (606  days)  in  the  Vc-MP  treatment  group  and 13.1 months (400 days) in the MP treatment group.

An analysis of the duration of response by best response category (CR or PR) also was performed. The median duration of response for subjects whose best response was a CR was 24 months (729 days) in the  Vc-MP  treatment  group  and  12.8  months  (389  days)  in  the  MP  treatment  group.  For  subjects whose  best  response  was  a  PR,  the  median  duration  of  response  was  15.2  months  (464  days)  and 13.1 months (400 days), respectively.

To  understand  the  effect  of  duration  of  Vc-MP  treatment  on  the  duration  of  CR,  an  analysis  was performed  of  the  duration  of  CR  by  the  number  of  additional  cycles  received  beyond  the  first documentation  of  CR.  The  median  duration  of  CR  was  16.9  months  (513  days)  for  subjects  who received ≤ 2  additional  cycles  after  CR  and  20.3  months  (617  days)  for  subjects  with  CR  who completed  9  cycles  of  treatment.  This  analysis  indicates  that  continuation  of  treatment  results  in prolonged duration of CR.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: M-Protein Response

M-protein is accepted as a valid measure of tumour burden and consequently of tumour response and progression. Change in M-protein values is the most important component of response and progression assessments in multiple myeloma. To facilitate comparisons between data from Study MMY-3002 and historical data using best M-protein response as the basis for response assessment, an analysis of best M-protein response was performed. Thirty-seven percent of subjects in the Vc-MP treatment group and 7% of subjects in the MP treatment group had 100% reduction of M-protein in the serum or urine at  some  point  during  the  study.  Forty-five  percent  and  10%  of  subjects  in  the  Vc-MP  and  MP treatment groups, respectively, had a ≥ 90% reduction (consistent with VGPR in historical studies) and 82% and 50% of subjects in the Vc-MP and MP treatment groups, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in M-protein.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Time to Subsequent Myeloma Therapy

Time to subsequent myeloma therapy was significantly longer for subjects in the Vc-MP treatment group compared with the MP treatment group. Of the 682 randomized subjects, 73 subjects (21%) and 127 subjects (38%) in the Vc-MP and MP treatment groups, respectively, received subsequent therapy as  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date  of  15  June  2007.  The  median  time  to  subsequent  myeloma  therapy, measured from randomization, was 20.8 months (632 days) in the MP treatment group and had not been reached in the Vc-MP group (hazard ratio=0.522; p=0.000009). Five of 8 subjects in the Vc-MP treatment group who were retreated with Velcade had an investigator-reported response assessment; of these 5 subjects; 1 obtained a CR and 2 obtained a PR. Thirty-six of 54 subjects in the MP treatment group who were subsequently treated with Velcade had an investigator-reported response assessment; of these 36 subjects, 5 obtained CR and 16 obtained PR.

## Subgroup analyses

The following subgroup analyses were performed relative to the primary efficacy endpoint, TTP, as well as several secondary efficacy parameters (PFS, OS, OR):

- Baseline stratification factors: beta2-microglobulin, albumin, and region.
- Demographic data: gender, race, and age.
- Baseline disease characteristics: ISS staging and cytogenetic risk.

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable across both treatment groups. A substantial proportion of subjects in both groups entered the study with adverse prognostic features including  age ≥ 75  years  (30%);  KPS  score ≤ 70  (34%),  beta2-microglobulin  &gt;5.5  mg/L  (33%); albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL (60%); and ISS Stage III disease (34%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A treatment effect was demonstrated in the Vc-MP treatment group, compared with the MP treatment group  for  the  primary  and  all  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  across  all  subgroups  evaluated  (hazard ratios  &lt;1  or  odds  ratio  &gt;1).  The  OR  rates  and  CR  rates  on  Vc-MP  were  similar  across  subgroups, including subgroups with these indicators of poor prognosis. In particular, high CR rates and OR rates were  observed  within  the  Vc-MP  treatment  group  in  the  beta2-microglobulin  &gt;5.5  mg/L  subgroup (49%  and  71%,  respectively),  Stage  III  subgroup  (37%  and  72%,  respectively),  and  high-risk cytogenetic subgroup (29% and 68%, respectively), demonstrating consistent activity of Velcade in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma with the worst prognostic factors.

## Additional analyses

Based on Study MMY-3002, the proposed duration of treatment in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma is 54 weeks (nine 6-week cycles). The normal duration of MP-treatment is either 6 or 12 months. The currently approved duration of treatment with Velcade is however of 24 weeks. At the request from the CHMP, the MAH provided additional analyses of the results after both 24  and 54 weeks, in order to justify a longer treatment duration.

Twenty-nine (29) patients out of 102 (28%) obtained a CR or a first response only after 24 weeks. Nine  additional  subjects  obtained  their  first  response  (partial  response  [PR])  also  after  the  first 24 weeks. Obtaining a CR is indicative of a prolonged duration of response (median 24 months for CR as  compared with 15.2 months for PR) and is associated with a prolonged time to progression and overall survival.

To further substantiate the long-term benefit obtained by these late responders, the MAH provided an analysis of TTP and survival in the 29 Vc-MP subjects who obtained CR after 24 weeks of treatment as compared with subjects who obtained CR within 24 weeks. The subjects who obtained these later CRs had a numerically better time to progression (median not reached vs. 21.7 months) and better 2year  survival  (96.6%  vs.  90.6%)  compared  with  subjects  who  obtained  CRs  earlier.  Similarly,  the 9 subjects who obtained a PR after 24 weeks of treatment had a numerically better time to progression (median 23.1 vs. 17.1 months) and better 2-year survival (100% vs. 83.6%) compared with subjects who obtained PRs earlier.

The MAH also provided an analysis of time-to-event outcomes of subjects in the Vc-MP treatment group whose duration of Velcade treatment was ≤ 4 cycles (24 weeks) as compared to those with a duration of Velcade treatment &gt;4 cycles. Median TTP was 18.3 months and 20.7 months, respectively; median PFS was 12.1 months and 20.7 months, respectively; 2-year survival was 73% and 88.7%, respectively.  OS  was  not  reached  in  either  treatment  group.  However,  the  study  was  not  optimally randomized to perform a comparison of efficacy results at ≤ 4 cycles and &gt;4 cycles. This may lead to a distortion  of  the  results  as  those  who  failed  already  in  the  beginning  impair  the  results  in  the  first group.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

In  Study  MMY-3002,  statistically  significant  improvement  of  TTP  was  observed  with  Vc-MP treatment  compared  to  MP  only  treatment  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  multiple  myeloma. Consistent statistically significant results were observed on the secondary endpoints including PFS and OS. Treatment effect was maintained across all subgroups tested. Additionally, responding subjects in the Vc-MP group experienced substantially longer duration of response relative to the MP subjects. In addition,  the  time  to  subsequent  therapy  was  extended  and  there  was  also  an  improvement  in myeloma-related  complications.  These  results  are  supportive  of  the  clinical  superiority  of  Vc-MP treatment compared to MP treatment and can be reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC.

The CHMP Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (CPMP/EWP/205/95/Rev. 3/Corr. 2) indicates that acceptable endpoints for confirmatory trial include OS and PFS/DFS. If PFS/DFS is the selected primary endpoint, OS should be reported as a secondary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  vice  versa.  Alternative  primary  endpoints,  such  as  TTP,  TTF  or  EFS  might  uncommonly  be appropriate.

At  the  request  from  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  provided  further  justifications  on  the  use  of  TTP  as  a primary endpoint in Study MMY-3002. The MAH considered that TTP and PFS are both considered measures  of  clinical  benefit  in  multiple  myeloma,  since  these  endpoints  mark  progression  and worsening of disease that is inevitably fatal. TTP directly measures tumour growth over time in all patients.  However,  PFS  includes  deaths  due  to  toxicity  as  well  as  other  causes,  which  makes  the interpretation  of  treatment  effect  more  complex.  Particularly  in  this  elderly  patient  population  with many co-morbidities, it was expected that there would be a substantial number of deaths due to causes unrelated to cancer, which would confound the treatment effect on PFS. Since a change in therapy is often triggered by progression, TTP is not confounded by subsequent therapies or cross-over unlike OS. Although TTP was chosen as the primary endpoint, PFS analysis was considered to be a very important endpoint and was included as a secondary endpoint in the study objectives. PFS analysis was  considered  to  be  a  critical  sensitivity  analysis  for  TTP.  A  compelling  outcome  based  on  TTP would  enable  a  much  needed  advance  for  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  patients  to  become available years and months before a conclusive result would be available based on survival data. The CHMP considered the justification provided by MAH on the choice of TTP as primary endpoint to be acceptable.

As some patients did receive the response only after 24 weeks and as the adverse events during those last 30 weeks do not seem to increase, 54 weeks of treatment can be considered as giving an additional benefit to 24 weeks treatment. Therefore, the CHMP considered the proposed duration of 54 weeks of treatment to be acceptable for inclusion in section 4.2 Posology and Method of Administration of the SPC.

## 2.3 Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

Of the 682 subjects randomized into Study MMY-3002, 677 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication and are included in the safety population (340 treated with Vc-MP combination therapy and 337 treated with MP therapy). In addition, the safety data from the Vc-MP treatment group in Study MMY-3002 were compared with integrated safety data from 5 previous studies of single-agent Velcade,  used  at  the  approved  dose  of  1.3  mg/m 2 ,  in  subjects  with  previously  treated  multiple myeloma.  The  5  studies  included  Studies  M34100-024  (26  subjects),  M34100-025  (202  subjects), M34101-039  (331  subjects),  M34101-040  (449  subjects),  and  JPN-MM-101  (25  subjects).  A combined  total  of  1,033  subjects  with  multiple  myeloma  received  single-agent  Velcade  in  these studies.

## · Adverse events

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events is summarized in Table 4 for the Vc-MP and MP treatment groups in Study MMY-3002, as well as for single-agent Velcade used in prior studies. As exposure was longer in Study MMY-3002 than in prior studies in relapsed subjects, the incidence of adverse events was adjusted for length of exposure.

Vc-MP=VELCADE-melphalan-prednisone; MP=melpbalan-predisone; TEAE=treatment emergent adverse event; AE=adverse

Exposure-adjusted incidence rate equals the mumber of subjects with events divided by the suum of time to first event (in patient-months).

For Study MMY-3002, it includes all adverse events that were related to 1 of the 3 study drugs: VELCADE, melphalan, or prednisone.

For Study MMY-3002, it includes those subjects indicated as having discontinued treatment due to an adverse event dIn the VELCADE group, Grade 5 is only available in the JPN-MM-101 study (total N for JPN-MM-101 is 25).

In  Study  MMY-3002,  nearly  all  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  were  reported  to  have  at  least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. The incidence rate was higher in the Vc-MP treatment group than the MP treatment group for Grade 3 adverse events (53% vs. 44%) and serious adverse events (46% vs.  36%).  However, the incidences were similar for  Grade 4 adverse events (28% vs. 27%), Grade 5 adverse events (8% for both), and adverse events leading to treatment termination (15% vs. 14%).

Comparison of the Vc-MP and single-agent Velcade groups revealed a similar incidence of Velcaderelated events (97% for both) and serious adverse events (46% vs. 52%) (Table 4). However, when analyzed by length of exposure, the incidence rates (per patient-months) appeared to be lower for VcMP than for single-agent Velcade for these 2 types of events. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for the  Vc-MP  and  single-agent  Velcade  treatment  groups  were  1.1354  vs.  2.2450  events  per  patientmonth for Velcade related adverse events, and 0.0655 and 0.1307 events per patient-month for serious adverse events.

The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 adverse events was 89% for Vc-MP and 81% for single-agent Velcade. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of Grade ≥ 3 events appeared to be lower for Vc-MP than for single-agent Velcade (0.2268 vs. 0.2677 events per patient-month). The incidence of termination of all study treatment because of adverse events was 15% for the Vc-MP treatment group and 34% for the single-agent Velcade treatment group, corresponding to exposure-adjusted incidence rates of 0.0076 and 0.0650 events per patient-month, respectively. The incidence of adverse events leading to Velcade discontinuation was similar with Vc-MP treatment (32%) and single-agent Velcade (34%). The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  again  appeared  to  be  lower  for  Vc-MP  than  for  single-agent Velcade (0.0379 vs. 0.0650 events per patient-month, respectively).

In conclusion, for all adverse event groups summarized in Table 4, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates were similar (and for several groups even lower) for the Vc-MP treatment group as compared with the single-agent Velcade treatment group.

The  incidences  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were  also  examined  by  cycle  for  the  Vc-MP group  versus  the  MP  group  (Table  5).  In  the  Vc-MP  group,  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent adverse events was higher with twice-weekly Velcade dosing during Cycles 1 to 4 (99%) compared

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with weekly Velcade dosing during Cycles 5 to 9 (90%). A similar trend was seen in the MP treatment group (95% during Cycles 1-4 and 88% during Cycles 5-9). Additionally, within the first 4 cycles, the incidence of adverse events was higher during Cycles 1 to 2 compared with Cycles 3 to 4 in both the Vc-MP treatment group (98% and 93%, respectively) and the MP treatment group (90% and 84%).

The  Vc-MP  treatment  group  also  had  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade ≥ 3  (85%)  and  serious  (40%) treatment-emergent adverse events during the first 4 cycles (twice-weekly regimen) compared with the MP treatment group (66% and 29%, respectively). However, a decreased incidence of Grade ≥ 3 (57%) and  serious  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (12%)  was  seen  over  time  in  the  Vc-MP  treatment group during Cycles 5 to 9 (weekly regimen) compared with Cycles 1 to 4 (twice-weekly regimen). This incidence of Grade ≥ 3 and serious adverse events in the Vc-MP treatment group (57% and 12%, respectively) was similar to that seen in the MP treatment group (61% and 15%, respectively) for the weekly Cycles 5 to 9. Also, the incidence of new all-grade adverse events was similar (88% and 90%, respectively) in  the  Vc-MP  and  MP  treatment  groups  during  weekly  Cycles  5  to 9,  suggesting  that there is no cumulative toxicity with the addition of Velcade to MP.

## Deaths

Table 7 summarizes the all-cause mortality rates within 30 days after the last dose of study medication for the Vc-MP, MP, and single-agent Velcade treatment groups. Five percent of subjects treated with Vc-MP died within 30 days after their  last  dose  (during  treatment),  compared  with  4%  of  subjects treated with MP and 10% of subjects treated with single-agent Velcade. As the length of exposure was greater in Study MMY-3002 than in the prior studies, the incidence of death within 30 days of last dose was adjusted for length of exposure; the incidence rates for both Vc-MP and MP appeared to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lower than for single-agent Velcade (0.006 vs. 0.005 vs. 0.019 events per patient-month, respectively). The  incidence  of  treatment-related  deaths  was  low  for  the  Vc-MP,  MP,  and  single-agent  Velcade treatment groups (1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of treatmentrelated  deaths  was  similar  for  all  3  treatment  groups  (0.002  vs.  0.002  vs.  0.003  events  per  patientmonth, respectively).

## Serious Adverse Events

The most frequent ( ≥ 2%) treatment-emergent serious adverse events are summarized in Table 8 for the Vc-MP and MP treatment groups in Study MMY-3002, as well as for single-agent Velcade use in prior  studies.  Serious  adverse  events  were  reported  for  46%  of  subjects  who  received  Vc-MP, compared  with  36%  of  subjects  who  received  MP  and  52%  of  subjects  who  received  single-agent Velcade. The Vc-MP and single-agent Velcade treatment groups were similar with respect to serious adverse events of anemia, thrombocytopenia, herpes zoster, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Incidences of neutropenia (1% in both), leukopenia (&lt;1% in both), and neuralgia (1% in the Vc-MP group and &lt;1% in the single-agent Velcade group) also were similar between the 2 treatment groups.

The incidence of Velcade-related serious adverse events was similar with Vc-MP treatment (26%) and single-agent Velcade treatment (28%).

## · Safety in special populations

Subgroup analyses were performed with respect to adverse events to evaluate the safety of Vc-MP in different special populations. These analyses showed a similar safety profile across age and gender. For  the  Vc-MP  regimen,  the  adverse  event  profile  for  subjects  with  moderate  renal  function impairment (30 to 60 mL/min creatinine clearance) was similar to the profile for subjects without renal function impairment (&gt;60 mL/min creatinine clearance).

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of Velcade in combination with MP in Study MMY-3002 was consistent with the known safety profiles of both Velcade and MP. No new safety concerns emerged for Vc-MP relative to what has been observed for each of its components. The safety profile of MP was as expected in this patient population: major side effects of MP were consistent with those described in previous studies. The safety profile was comparable between Vc-MP and single-agent Velcade used in prior studies, despite the older patient population in the Vc-MP treatment group as compared with the single-agent VELCADE treatment group (median age, 71 and 60 years, respectively).

The most frequently reported adverse events for the Vc-MP treatment group were as expected based on  the  known  toxicity  profile  of  each  of  the  3  individual  agents.  Although  peripheral  neuropathy events were more common with Vc-MP treatment than with single-agent Velcade treatment (47% vs. 37%,  respectively),  the  incidence  of  Grade ≥ 3  peripheral  neuropathy  events  was  similar  (13%  and 11%) and serious  events  were  uncommon  for  both  groups  (1%  each).  Exposure-adjusted  incidence rates,  as  well  as  relationship  to  cumulative  dose  and  time  to  onset  of  peripheral  neuropathy  events, were  similar between  treatment groups. The  reversibility of peripheral neuropathy  has  been documented in the majority of cases for subjects receiving Vc-MP (74% improvement or recovery). The addition of MP to VELCADE treatment did not appear to affect the cumulative dose at onset or the time to onset of peripheral neuropathy events.

Overall, the number of serious adverse events was 10% higher in the VC-MP group than in the MP group in this study as well as the number of deaths and adverse events Grade&gt;3. Particularly, in the beginning of the treatment (Cycles 1-4) there were more adverse events in the Vc-MP group than in the  control  group.  However,  during  the  next  cycles  (5-9)  the  tolerability  of  Vc-MP  treatment  was similar  to  that  of  MP  treatment  group.  Therefore,  no  new  safety  concerns  arise  with  the  longer duration of treatment of 54 weeks. The safety results of this study have been included in section 4.8 of the SPC.

## 4. Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

According  to  Article  3  of  the  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000,  for  the  purposes  of  the implementation  of  Article  8,  'Similar  active  substance'  means  an  identical  active  substance,  or  an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features (active moiety) and which acts via  the  same  mechanism.  Thus  the  similarity  assessment  takes  into  account  molecular  structural features, mechanism of action and therapeutic indication.

The  Applicant  has  provided  a  report  discussing  the  issue  of  similarity  with  the  orphan  medicinal products  Revlimid  (lenalidomide)  and  Thalidomide  Pharmion  (thalidomide)  authorised  for  the treatment of multiple myeloma.

Having  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the  MAH  of  Velcade,  the  CHMP  concluded  that bortezomib  does  not  share  the  same  principal  molecular  structural  features  as  lenalidomide  and thalidomide and the differences in molecular structure are not only minor. The mechanism of action of bortezomib is also different than those of thalidomide and lenalidomide.

Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that Velcade is not similar to any authorised orphan medicinal products within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## 5. Benefit-Risk Assessment

Velcade is currently indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for  bone  marrow  transplantation.  The  applicant  has  now  performed  one  clinical  study  to  show  the efficacy  of  Velcade  in  combination  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  previously  untreated  multiple myeloma, i.e. in a first-line indication.

Study MMY-3002 was designed to determine whether the addition of Velcade to standard MP therapy would improve the outcome of previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma. The efficacy of Velcade  and  of  MP  was  well  established  and  both  therapies  were  widely  used  to  treat  multiple myeloma.  The  MAH  has  also  discussed  thoroughly  the  benefits  and  risks  of  all  the  standard chemotherapies and the choice of MP as a comparator is well justified. The choice of endpoints was considered adequately justified.

The results of all the endpoints consistently showed that Vc-MP was superior to the MP treatment. VcMP-treated subjects showed significant improvements over MP-treated subjects in TTP, PFS, OS, OR rate,  CR  rate,  time  to  response,  and  time  to  subsequent  myeloma  therapy.  Treatment  effect  was maintained  across  all  subgroups  tested.  Additionally,  responding  subjects  in  the  Vc-MP  group experienced substantially longer duration of response relative to the MP treated subjects. In addition, the  time  to  subsequent  therapy  was  extended,  allowing  patients  to  experience  more  time  without multiple  myeloma  treatment.  There  was  also  an  improvement  in  myeloma-related  complications. These results are supportive of the clinical superiority of Vc-MP treatment compared to MP treatment.

The safety profile of Velcade in combination with MP in Study MMY-3002 was consistent with the known safety profiles of both Velcade and MP. No new safety concerns emerged for Vc-MP relative to what has been observed with the three individual components.

Overall, the benefit-risk of Velcade in combination with melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma  who  are  not  eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant is considered positive. Section 4.1 of the SPC is updated to include this new indication.
