## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for telbivudine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Based  on  a  cumulative  review  submitted  by  the  MAH  with  this  PSUR,  a  total  of  96  cases  of  lactic acidosis was reported with telbivudine, including 54 cases as a secondary event of a serious underlying conditions,  such  as  rhabdomyolysis  or  myopathy  and  26  cases  with  no  evident  primary  causes, although CPK elevation were often associated. Moreover, one literature case report of severe refractory lactic  acidosis was reported during the review period in a patient receiving telbivudine monotherapy and for whom no underlying serious conditions was reported. In cumulative, seven fatal cases of lactic acidosis  were  recorded  including  six  cases  where  lactic  acidosis  was  reported  as  a  symptom  or secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Overall, it is acknowledged that it remains difficult to clearly conclude whether lactic acidosis causes muscle events or lactic acidosis follows muscular damage. Based  on  the  available  evidence,  the  PRAC  considered  that  that  the  telbivudine  SmPC  should  be updated  to  reinforce  the  current  warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  on  lactic  acidosis,  notably  by highlighting  the potential fatal outcome  of  telbivudine-induced  lactic  acidosis  in a context  of rhabdomyolysis and to delete the current information in section 4.8 of the SmPC that lactic acidosis has been reported with telbivudine exclusively as a secondary event (since it is not always the case). Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing telbivudine were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for telbivudine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product containing telbivudine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
