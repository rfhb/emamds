## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 7 January 2015 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zurampic, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 January 2014.

The applicant applied for the following indication. Zurampic is indicated for the chronic treatment of hyperuricaemia in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat in gout patients when additional therapy is warranted (i.e. not at target serum uric acid levels or with presence of tophus).  Zurampic is indicated in adults. The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that lesinurad was considered to be a new active substance. The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, nonclinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0153/2014 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity Similarity Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. Applicant's request for consideration New active Substance status The applicant requested the active substance lesinurad contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a product previously authorised within the Union. Scientific Advice Medicinal product no longer authorised

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 29/11/2010, 1/04/2011, 17/11/2011 and 13/06/2014. The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Gout is a chronic uric acid crystal deposition disease. It results from hyperuricemia, a metabolic disorder, which is mainly thought to be due to insufficient renal uric acid excretion, and to lesser extent a purine rich diet. Gout may be secondary to the intake of thiazide diuretics. Some families have a genetic predisposition, related to expression of uric acid transporter enzymes.

Hyperuricemia is defined typically as serum Uric Acid levels (sUA) &gt; 6.8 mg/dL (&gt; 400 μmol/L) based on the solubility limit of uric acid. When sUA exceeds the solubility limit, this can lead to deposition of urate crystals in body tissues. These crystals can accumulate in and around joints, which may cause painful and recurrent attacks of inflammatory arthritis. Eventually, subdermal deposits called tophi can occur. Tophi may be small and symptomless, or large and bothersome, causing chronic arthritis, malfunction of joints and rupture of the overlying skin ('leaking tophi'). Tophus forming in the kidney may lead to lithiasis and inflammation, and if uncontrolled, to renal failure. Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis (Doherty 2012). The prevalence of gout is estimated as 1-2 % in Europe. Gout is primarily diagnosed in middle-aged and elderly males. Patients with a genetic predisposition of hyperuricaemia, however, may develop severe gout and chronic topaceous arthritis at a young age. Women who develop gout are in general elderly using diuretics. Common co-morbidities in gout are chronic kidney disorders and diabetes type 2, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disorders and alcohol dependence. Gout and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia is associated with an increased risk of CV death (Ioachimescu 2008, Kim 2008). Whether there is a causal relationship between hyperuricaemia and CV disease outcomes and hypertension is a matter of debate and not confirmed by interventional studies (Vinik, 2014). Standard care of gout consist of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). In addition, acute gouty arthritis flares are treated symptomatically with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. The therapeutic goal in the management of gout is to lower sUA levels with ULT below a target sUA of &lt; 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) at minimum, to durably improve the signs and symptoms of gout. According to several international guidelines, including those from the British Society for Rheumatology and the American College of Rheumatology, lower target SUA levels &lt; 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) are indicated for patients with tophi, as a larger gradient is required to obtain an adequate reduction in crystal deposition within a reasonable timeframe (Khanna, Fitzgerald, 2012, Richette 2014). The target of 5 mg/dL is based on the median sUA value of the general UK male population (Jordan et al, 2007). Several ULTs are available for the prophylaxis of recurrent gouty attacks and reduction of tophi, which include: (a) oral xanthine-oxidase inhibitors (XOI), allopurinol and febuxostat, which decrease the de novo synthesis of urate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

(b) oral uricosuric agents probenecid, benzbromarone, and sulphinpyrazone. Uricosuric agents increase excretion of uric acid into the urine, by inhibition of transporters mediating reabsorption of uric acid by the kidney. Lesinurad also belongs to the oral uricosuric agents.

(c) intravenous pegloticase, a pegylated recombinant uricase. Uricase is an enzyme which converts uric acid to more soluble allantoin for renal excretion.

Initiation of ULT could actually induce an arthritis gout attack, as instability of crystals deposits due to a sudden drop of sUA, may trigger an inflammatory reaction. According to clinical treatment guidelines,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine or a NSAID is recommended in the first 3-6 months after starting ULT.

Approximately 40% to 80% of patients do not achieve recommended sUA goals with current first line XOI, and warrant additional treatment to control their disease (Schumacher 2008, Becker 2005, Becker 2010, Edwards 2009). Urocosic agents have their limitations regarding safety, and are not overall available in the EMA member states. E.g. benzbromarone is associated with hepatotoxicity. Probenecid causes multiple drug-drug interactions and has to be frequently dosed over the day, whereas sulphinpyrazone has been associated with rash and gastric bleeding. Pegloticase is highly effective, however, its use is limited to last line because of the risk of serious infusion reactions.

In conclusion, though several ULT options are available, there is a need for other effective oral ULTs with a favourable safety profile. About the product Zurampic is a solid tablet containing 200 mg of lesinurad. Lesinurad is an uricosuric Urate Lowering Therapy  (ULT)  that  inhibits  specifically  Uric  Acid  Transporter 1  (URAT1).  URAT1  is  thought  to  be responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular lumen. By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers sUA. In addition, lesinurad is an inhibitor of OAT4 (organic anion transporter), which is considered to be involved in hyperuricemia secondary to the use thiazide diuretics. The  initially  proposed  indication  was  'chronic  treatment  of  hyperuricaemia  in  combination  with allopurinol or febuxostat in gout patients when additional therapy is warranted (i.e. not at target serum uric acid levels or with presence of a tophus' in adults. The recommend indication is 'Zurampic, in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated in adults for the adjunctive treatment of hyperuricaemia in gout patients (with or without tophi) who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor'. According to the SmPC of Zurampic, the treatment target sUA level is less than 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L). In patients with tophi or persistent symptoms, the target is less than 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L). Testing for the target sUA level may be performed as early as 4 weeks after initiating Zurampic treatment. The recommended dose of Zurampic is 200 mg once daily in the morning, to be taken with food and water. No dose adjustments are proposed for elderly, patients with mild-moderate renal impairment, and  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  A  statement  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  that  Zurampic should not be initiated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min). Several precautionary measures are recommended in the SmPC to prevent hyperuricosuria when using lesinurad, such as sufficient hydration (2 litres of liquid per day), and morning intake. Zurampic must be taken at the same time as the xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) of choice (allopurinol or febuxostat), since  it  has  been  show  that  XOI  reduce  the  urinary  uric  acid  load  and  the  risk  of  renal  events  of lesinurad. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Gout flare prophylaxis with either colchicine or NSAIDs is recommended for at least 5 months when starting lesinurad therapy, in order to reduce the risk of ULT-induced gouty arthritis flares.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product is presented as film-coated tablet containing 200 mg of lesinurad as active substance.

Other ingredients are hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, crospovidone and magnesium stearate for the tablet core and hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, indigo carmine and brilliant blue FCF in the tablet coat.

<!-- image -->

In accordance with article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, New Active Substance status was claimed.  The information provided in the dossier shows that lesinurad is not an isomer, mixture of isomers, a complex or derivative or salt of a chemical substance previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union. Lesinurad is also not a chemical entity already used in a medicinal product. Therefore lesinurad is considered a new active substance from a quality perspective.

The product is available in a clear (PCTFE/PVC/Aluminium) blister. 2.2.2. Active Substance General information The structure of lesinurad is depicted below: Lesinurad is a white to off-white powder and is not hygroscopic. Sufficient information on the solublility in aqueous and organic solvents has been provided. Regarding aqueous solvents, solubility increases with increasing pH (0.0041 mg/mL at pH 1.1 in 0.1 N HCl to 117 mg/mL at pH 6.0 in 0.3N NaOH). Lesinurad does not contain any chiral centres but is provided as racemic mixture of 2 atropisomers (ratio of 50:50) on which sufficient information has been provided. There are 2 known non-solvated crystal forms (free acid polymorphs) of lesinurad: form 1 (metastable) and form 2 (thermodynamically stable). Form 2 is the desired thermodynamically stable form which is consistently manufactured and does not change upon storage. The structure has been elucidated using elemental analysis, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 1 H and  13 C), Mass Spectrometry, UV/Vis Spectroscopy, Infrared Spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography (Form 2). Additional supporting evidence for the structure of lesinurad comes from the route of synthesis, process controls during manufacturing, and from the use of well characterized starting materials. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

The active substance is manufactured at three locations.

Lesinurad is synthesized in 3 synthetic steps.  The commercial manufacturing process for the synthesis of the active substance was sufficiently detailed including quantities and operating conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Starting materials have been adequately described and justified on the basis of the Reflection Paper on requirements for selection and justification of starting materials for the manufacture of chemical active substances (EMEA/H448443/2014). Sufficient information on raw materials, synthesis and specifications of lesinurad have been provided. Reprocessing consists of repetition of the regular process.

The process comprises 2 isolated intermediates and their specifications are acceptable based on the provided control strategy which is in line with ICH Q11. Critical quality attributes have been discussed, although the application is not a Quality by Design application. The critical steps have been adequately justified and critical parameters have been determined and described sufficiently.

The development of the control strategy for the manufacture of lesinurad followed a science and riskbased approach. Analytical procedures which are considered critical for the quality of the active substance and intermediate control have been adequately validated. Thorough discussion of impurities (that have been divided into organic, inorganic / heavy metals, solvents and genotoxic) comprising several spike and purge studies show absence or control of impurities in lesinurad. The residual solvents are all class 2 and 3 solvents. Genotoxic / mutagenic impurities have been studied according to ICH M7 and their purge and control is acceptable. The active substance is stored in double low density polyethylene (LPDE) bags individually closed with plastic tie wraps. This primary packaging complies with 21CFR 177.1520 and EC directive 10/2011 as amended and the specification contains tests for description (colourless translucent bag) and identification by IR (spectrum of reference standard provided). Specification The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (by FTIR and HPLC), assay (by HPLC), sulfated ash (according to Ph. Eur.), water content (according to Ph. Eur.), organic impurities (amino impurity, hydroxy impurity, des-bromo impurity, chloro impurity, individual, unspecified impurity, total impurities) by HPLC and residual solvents (ethyl acetate, n-heptane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran) by GC headspace. The justification for tests and limits of description, identification, inorganic impurities and residual solvents has been provided. Impurities present higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were toxicologically qualified. The specification limit follows the ICH Q3D (Draft, July 2013) Class 2B oral permitted daily exposures limits (option 1) for elemental impurities. The analytical procedures have been described in sufficient detail and the in-house analytical procedures have been adequately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The reference standard for the active substance (manufactured with the commercial process) and impurity standards have been characterised and are suitable for their intended use. Batch analyses data of eight batches manufactured at commercial site using the commercial process were provided and demonstrate compliance with the proposed specification.

## Stability

Stability data on 3 commercial batches of lesinurad active substance stored in double LPDE bags (intended package) for 24 months under long term conditions at 25 °C / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In addition, data of two pilot scaled batches with a previously used manufacturing process have been provided, stored at 25 °C / 60% RH (36 months) and 40 °C / 75% RH (6 months). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

material was packed in double LDPE bags, closed with tie wraps as those proposed for commercial packaging.

Stability data for all batches of lesinurad active substance met the proposed commercial specification criteria at all storage conditions studied.

The overall data is sufficient to grant the proposed re-test period of 36 months, when stored below 30°C, although the storage restriction does not have to be applied.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  The  critical steps are defined and suitable controls are applied. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

Description of the product and pharmaceutical development The finished product corresponds to a film-coated tablet intended for immediate release. Market authorisation is sought for a strength of 200 mg of the active substance lesinurad. The finished product is presented as film-coated tablet containing 200 mg of lesinurad as the active substance.  Other ingredients are hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, crospovidone and magnesium stearate for the tablet core and hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, indigo carmine and brilliant blue FCF in the tablet coat. The product is available in a clear (PCTFE/PVC/Aluminium) blister. The proposed commercial packaging is push-through blister packs formed from a clear laminated plastic film made of PVC and PCTFE and sealed to aluminium foil with heat seal lacquer. All excipients meet Ph. Eur. compendial specifications and in-house specifications (where applicable). An acceptable in-house specification is provided for the coating material. Non-compendial colouring excipients in the tablet coating (FD&amp;C Blue #1 Indigo Carmine Aluminium Lake and FD&amp;C Blue #2/Brilliant Blue FCF Aluminium Lake) are in compliance with Commission Regulation No 231/2012. Excipients and packaging are usual for this type of dosage form. Various pharmaceutical forms and polymorphic forms of the active substance were explored during pharmaceutical development. The proposed commercial formulation is identical to that used in Phase 3, i.e., an immediate release tablet containing 200 mg of crystalline lesinurad free acid. Bioequivalence studies were carried out to compare the various forms. Development of the routine QC dissolution testing method was adequately described and was shown to discriminate between batches of acceptable bioavailability and batches with a slower rate and extent of absorption. Manufacture of the product and process controls The manufacturing process is a standard manufacturing process involving high shear granulation including dry mixing and wet granulation, wet milling, fluidized bed drying, milling, blending including lubrication, compression, and film-coating. The manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. Medicinal product no longer authorised

An acceptable process validation protocol for three consecutive batches has been provided, which will be completed prior to sales of drug product.

## Product specification

The product release and shelf life specification includes tests for description (visual inspection), identification of lesinurad (HPLC spectrum and retention time/UV spectrum), assay (HPLC),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units by mass variation (Ph. Eur.), and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).

Analytical methods are adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Additional validation data have been provided for the dissolution (cross-validation of the HPLC and UV methods) and microbiological quality methods (demonstration of the absence of growth inhibition by the drug product). Satisfactory information on the reference standards has been presented.

Batch analytical data of the intended commercial manufacturing site are presented for one commercial scale and four pilot scale batches of the 200 mg strength, demonstrating compliance with the release specification.

Stability of the product Stability data on the product have been provided for three pilot scale batches of the 200 mg strength stored at 25 °C / 60% RH (36 months), 30 °C / 75% RH (36 months) and 40 °C / 75% RH (six months). The conditions and products used in the stability studies are according to the ICH stability guideline. The batches were manufactured at the development site. Stability studies of batches manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing site have been initiated. The batches are stored in PVC/PCTFE blister packs, representative of the commercial container closure system. Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbial limit tests (at least annually at release). In addition hardness and water content were tested. The analytical procedures were sufficiently described and shown to be stability indicating. No significant changes were observed at any storage condition. Increasing trends in the levels of a specified degradation product and water content have been observed. Updated stability data have been provided and results were within specification. Photostability of unpacked tablets was demonstrated according to ICH Q1B and indicate that the finished product is not light sensitive. Stability of the finished product in bulk packs (4-layer aluminium foil bag) has been shown for three months at 25°C/60% RH, 30°C/75% RH, and 40°C/75% RH. Therefore the proposed shelf-life of 36 months in Aclar blisters with no specific storage restrictions seems justified. Adventitious agents Magnesium stearate is sourced from vegetable origin. Lactose monohydrate is manufactured from milk that has been sourced from healthy cows in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption. This pharmaceutical grade lactose complies with the requirements for Europe per Directive 75/318/EEC and EMEA/410/01. A statement of compliance from the supplier of lactose monohydrate has been provided. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Not applicable.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

2.3.1. Introduction Lesinurad is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) that inhibits the uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1).  URAT1 is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular lumen.  By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers serum uric acid.  Lesinurad also inhibits Organic Anion Transporter 4 (OAT4), a uric acid transporter involved in diuretic induced hyperuricemia. The nonclinical safety profile of lesinurad was characterised in a testing programme that included assessment of primary and secondary pharmacodynamics (PD), safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) including drug-drug interaction (DDI) with major liver enzymes and liver/kidney transporters, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and a complete toxicology package to support the chronic administration of lesinurad in adult patients. Scientific advice was received from the CHMP on 29 November 2010 and 1 April 2011. The non-clinical advice concerned the adequacy of the embryofetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits. 2.3.2. Pharmacology Primary pharmacodynamic studies The inhibitory effects of lesinurad on human URAT1-mediated transport of uric acid were studied in two independent experiments in Xenopus laevis oocytes. An IC50 of 52.5 µM and 41 µM was calculated. In human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the human URAT1 transporter, lesinurad suppressed uptake of [ 14 C] uric acid with an IC50 value of 7.3 μM. Both cis -inhibition (due to high luminal lesinurad concentrations in the proximal tubuli) as well as trans -inhibition (due to basolateral transport by OAT1 and OAT3) may contribute to the inhibition of uric acid transport by URAT1. When rat and mice URAT1 transfected cells were used, it appeared that lesinurad did not inhibit these rodent orthologs at relevant concentrations (up to 100 µM). Besides, hURAT1, lesinurad also inhibits hOAT4 with an average EC50 value for lesinurad of 3.7 µM. Human OAT4 (hOAT4) is a recently characterized urate transporter involved in human urate transport in the kidney. Human SLC2A9v1 and SLC2A9v2 (the GLUT9 transporter) located at the basolateral membrane of renal tubular cells, however, are not affected by lesinurad. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Lesinurad and its metabolites M1, M2, M3 and M6 were tested for potential inhibition of xanthine oxidase using either xanthine or hypoxanthine as a substrate. No inhibition of xanthine oxidase conversion of xanthine or hypoxanthine to uric acid was observed at relevant concentration.

Similarly, no inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Considering the lower concentrations of the metabolites and the higher IC50 values for URAT1 and OAT4 of the metabolites M2, M3, M4 and M6, it is not expected that these metabolites contribute to the pharmacological activity of lesinurad.

The primary pharmacological activity of lesinurad was studied in the New World monkey Cebus apella (Brown capuchin). Urinary excretion of uric acid increased from baseline, suggesting that lesinurad likely shares the same mechanism of action as benzbromarone, although the presence of URAT1 transporter in Cebus monkeys has not been established. Serum uric acid levels did not change in animals treated with lesinurad or benzbromarone. At baseline, significant amounts of allantoin were detected in both plasma (mean concentration of 0.432 mg/dL) and urine (mean concentration of 37.6 mg/dL), suggesting the existence of uricase in Cebus monkeys, which significantly reduces the value of the Cebus monkey as an in vivo model.

The potential for cytotoxicity of lesinurad was evaluated by determining the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in HeLa-JC53 cells and the human HepG2 cell line. The CC50 value in HeLa-JC53 was &gt; 40 μM, whereas the CC50 in HepG2 was above 100 μM. Furthermore, while benzbromarone and menadione (a positive control) were extremely potent at inducing mitochondrial toxicity, lesinurad was inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. Yet, it should also be considered that HeLa and HepG2 cells have only limited metabolic activity and therefore insufficiently cover any potential role of metabolites (see also discussion on DILI in toxicology section).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies Secondary pharmacological targets of lesinurad were assessed by measuring its ability (at 100 μM) to inhibit binding of radiolabeled ligands to 169 pharmacological targets that comprise transporters, receptors, and enzymes. Ligand binding of 10 targets was inhibited more than 50% and subsequently tested to obtain an IC50. The only ligands that were inhibited with an IC50 below 30 μM were the human prostanoid thromboxane A2 (TP) receptor and DP1 receptor. However, additional in vitro pharmacology data, ex vivo models, cardiovascular safety pharmacology and toxicological studies indicate that lesinurad is not a functional antagonist of the arachidonic acid biosynthetic pathway or of the major prostaglandin receptors in vivo. The evidence of weak in vitro activities, a lack of tissuebased activity, and the absence of relevant toxicity findings at supratherapeutic dosing in chronic nonclinical studies indicates that there are no clinically relevant PD interactions with these pathways. Other targets investigated included neuropeptide Y (NPY)4 and NPY5, which showed no clinically relevant inhibition from either lesinurad or the M6 metabolite of lesinurad. A battery of nuclear receptors was also tested, and at the 100 μM concentration of lesinurad only 2 fold activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and weak inhibition (20%) of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) α was seen, and no significant activity was seen at ≤ 25 µM. As lesinurad is a metabolite of RDEA806, which is an HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) compound, anti-HIV activity was investigated. Lesinurad did not exhibit any clinically significant antiviral activity against HIV. Lesinurad was also tested for activity against the human DNA polymerases α, β, and γ. The IC50 against human DNA polymerase α was 98.4 μM, while the IC50 against human DNA polymerases β and γ was &gt; 100 μM, suggesting little potential for toxicity by this mechanism.

A study on muscle cell toxicity did not reveal muscle toxicity potential of lesinurad in Rat L6 cells in vitro at a concentration of 10 µM.

In 2 monosodium urate (MSU) dependent rodent acute gout flare models, lesinurad was efficacious in reducing inflammation from injected MSU crystals. The mechanism for this result in animals is not understood.

## Safety pharmacology programme

No important safety pharmacology effects on parameters of the CNS, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and renal/urinary system were observed.

Effects of a single dose 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg lesinurad on a functional observation battery were tested in rats. No test article related effects were observed up to 300 mg/kd, corresponding to a Cmax and AUC 165x and 101x times higher than at the human MRHD, respectively.

The effect of 10, 30, 100 and 200 µM lesinurad on hERG channel current expressed in HEK293 cells was tested. The IC50 was determined to be 198 µM, while the human Cmax at MRHD was 12 µg/mL. Considering the 98% protein binding of lesinurad in human plasma, the IC50 would be estimated at 9.9mM, whereas human total plasma concentration is 17µM at MRHD.

Male Cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to lesinurad (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) and cardiovascular parameters were determined using telemetry. QTcR values (QT corrected for heart rate) were similar to control values. The NOAEL for cardiovascular effects was 300 mg/kg, which corresponded with 21x Cmax and 38x AUC of the human MRHD. No effects on respiratory parameters induced by lesinurad (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) were observed in male Cynomolgus monkeys 2 and 24 hours after dosing. The NOAEL for respiratory effects was 300 mg/kg, which corresponded with 21x Cmax and 38x AUC at the human MRHD. Rats were exposed to 30, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg lesinurad. At 1000 mg/kg gastrointestinal motility was statistically significant decreased and an increase of watery feces was observed. At the NOAEL of 300 mg/kg, Cmax and AUC were 165 and 101 fold higher than at the MRHD. Rats were exposed to lesinurad up to a dose of 1000 mg/kg. Mildly increased urinary creatinine and urinary excretion of uric acid and minimal increases in serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were observed at 1000 mg/kg. At the NOAEL of 300 mg/kg, Cmax was 24-fold and AUC 101-fold compared to the MRHD. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were submitted in support of this application. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of lesinurad after single and repeated administration were investigated in rats, dogs, and monkeys. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to investigate plasma protein binding, blood cell/plasma partitioning, potential drug-drug interactions, drug metabolism and transporter characteristics. The pharmacokinetics of the main metabolite M4 and the metabolite M6 (in monkeys) were also investigated. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Permeability Evaluation in Caco-2 Monolayer Assay (8ARDEP3R1, SR09-066)

In-vitro permeability of lesinurad was evaluated in bidirectional experiments using Caco-2 monolayers and [ 14C ]-lesinurad. In these studies, lesinurad showed higher basolateral to apical (B-A, approximately 12-16 10 -6 cm/s) permeability than apical to basolateral (A-B, approximately 4-5 10 -6 cm/s) with efflux ratios greater than 2 at 1, 10, and 100 μM, indicating that lesinurad was actively transported across Caco-2 monolayers. However, verapamil or PSC833, known P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, had either no effect or only partially inhibited the basolateral to apical transport of lesinurad.

## In vivo

## Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Studies

The single-dose PK studies were conducted by oral or IV dosing of lesinurad in mice (oral only), rats, dogs, and monkeys. Lesinurad was rapidly absorbed in all species following oral dosing. Bioavailability ranged from highest in dogs (100%) to lowest in monkeys (41.1%). Mean plasma lesinurad-to-totalradioactivity ratios were &gt;than 50% in rats and monkeys, suggesting that the majority of systemic exposure to [14C] lesinurad was in the form of the parent compound lesinurad. The PK parameters determined from these studies are summarised in Table 1 .

Dose proportionality was evaluated following a single oral dose of lesinurad at 20, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg to male rats. The rate of absorption, as measured by Tmax, increased from 2.33 to 16.5 hours as the dose increased from 20 to 1000 mg/kg. Between 20 and 300 mg/kg, exposure (as measured by AUC0-24) increased in a more than dose-proportional manner. At the 1000 mg/kg dose, absorption was delayed and exposure increased in less than a dose-proportional manner within 24 hours post-dose. Distribution In vitro Protein Binding In vitro binding of lesinurad to plasma proteins was evaluated using radio-labelled lesinurad at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 μM in all species, and at higher concentrations in rats and monkeys using equilibrium dialysis ( Table 2) .

Abbreviations: NM, not measured; SD, standard deviation Quantitative Tissue Distribution of Lesinurad-Derived Radioactivity in Rats (SR08-046) The distribution and concentrations of total radioactivity in male albino rats and male pigmented rats were similar following oral administration, and the general patterns of distribution of radioactivity in albino rats were similar following oral and IV administration. Following oral administration, high concentrations of radioactivity were observed in the contents of the GI tract. Urinary concentrations were also high, with a maximum level recorded at 2 hours post-dose. There was no preferential uptake of lesinurad-derived radioactivity into the brain. Elimination of radioactivity from tissues following oral administration was generally rapid in albino and pigmented rats. Decreased tissue radioactivity levels were observed in all of the measured tissues at 24 hours post-dose, and elimination was completed by 168 hours in the pigmented rat. Tissues associated with metabolism and elimination (e.g., liver and kidney) were the only tissues to have maximum concentrations of radioactivity greater than in cardiac blood, suggesting limited uptake of radioactivity into tissues. In vivo Partition Between Plasma and Red Blood Cells (SR08-028, SR08-017) In general, following oral or IV administration of [14C] lesinurad to rats, the blood-to-plasma ratios of [14C] lesinurad-derived radioactivity were between 0.5 to 0.9 over the first 12 hours of the study and between 0.5 to 0.9 in monkeys over the first 48 hours of the study. Metabolism In Vitro Metabolic Profiles in Liver Microsomes and Cryopreserved Hepatocytes (SR08-038, SR08-056, SR11-031) Lesinurad was the predominant component following incubation of [14C] lesinurad with liver microsomes and cryopreserved hepatocytes. The majority of the radioactivity (&gt; 92%) was attributed to unchanged parent compound. Two oxidative metabolites, M3 and M4, were detected after incubation with both monkey and human hepatocytes. Following incubation in cryopreserved rat and dog hepatocytes, no metabolite was detected. In human and monkey hepatocytes, the M3 and M4 metabolites were present at low levels, with 92.1% and 98.1% of parent drug remaining, respectively, following 4-hour incubation.

S -dealkylation of lesinurad to form metabolite M6 appeared to be catalyzed by CYP3A. Metabolite M4 was detected following incubation with human liver microsomes but not with CYP2C9 recombinant enzyme. Conversely, metabolite M3c (an epoxide) was detected following incubation in CYP2C9 recombinant enzyme but not in human liver microsomes. In separate experiments, mEH was identified as the enzyme responsible for conversion of the epoxide to M4 metabolite. Similar results were seen in animals, where CYP3A was responsible for S -dealkylation and CYP2C was responsible for oxidation. Glucuronidation of lesinurad in human liver appeared to be catalyzed by UGT1A1, UGT2B7, and to a lesser extent by UGT1A3. The glutathione conjugate of lesinurad was detected in monkey and human liver microsomal incubations in the presence of glutathione.

With a 400 mg daily dose, lesinurad was identified as a mild to moderate CYP3A inducer and caused weak to no induction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 ( Table 4 ).

Abbreviations: F, female; IV, intravenous; M, male; NA, data not available since animals were not sacrificed for radioactivity counting; PO, oral a Cage wash and cage wipe Enterohepatic circulation in rat (SR09-056) Following a single 20 mg/kg oral dose of [14C] lesinurad to BDC male rats, recovery of total radioactivity in bile and urine suggested that approximately 50% of radioactivity was absorbed through enterohepatic circulation. Excretion to rat milk (SR11-068) In lactating rats in a perinatal and postnatal rat reproduction toxicology study, at 4 hours post-dose of lesinurad at 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg on Lactation Day 10, lesinurad was detected in the milk and had similar concentrations to that detected in plasma. Enzyme inhibition (SR08-048, SR12-043, SR10-001) Lesinurad inhibited CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 with IC50 values of 16.2 and 40.7 μM, respectively in human liver microsomes. The IC50 values for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 were all &gt;100 μM. No mechanism-based inhibition by lesinurad (10 µM) was observed for any P450 isozymes tested with a 30-minute pre-incubation. Lesinurad also inhibited metabolism of β-estradiol (at 50 μM) and AZT (at 1000 μM) with IC50 values of 148 and 384 μM for UGT1A1 and 2B7, respectively. Enzyme induction (SR08-026, SR10-063) The induction effects of lesinurad have been evaluated in in vitro studies using cultured human hepatocytes for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5.

Assessment of lesinurad pharmacokinetics in the presence of OAT inhibitors in rats (SR11059) Urinary excretion of lesinurad in female Sprague Dawley rats was evaluated following a single IV dose of lesinurad at 20 mg/kg with vehicle (control) or inhibitors of OAT, cimetidine (40 mg/kg), or probenecid (50 mg/kg). Probenecid is known to inhibit OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, and OAT4. Cimetidine is also known to inhibit OAT3 in addition to the OCTs. Renal secretion of lesinurad was slightly inhibited (nearly half of the excretion compared to vehicle) by probenecid while minimal inhibition was observed by cimetidine. In vivo assessment of potential interactions with allopurinol in monkeys (SR09-065) Because oxypurinol, the active moiety of allopurinol, is a substrate of URAT1, potential DDI effects on PK were investigated in monkeys ( Table 5 ).

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

No single dose toxicity study was submitted with lesinurad.  Assessment of acute toxicity was evaluated in repeat dose toxicity studies.

## Repeat dose toxicity

Lesinurad was tested in repeated dose toxicity studies in rats up to 6 months and monkeys up to 12 months. Kidney was the main target organ in rats, where severe kidney toxicity was the cause of early deaths in the high dose group in the 14 day study. In every dose group animals suffered from tubular degeneration in the kidney. It appears that kidney toxicity is transient in nature, as no tubular degeneration was seen after longer duration of treatment at similar doses. After 4 weeks of treatment kidney effects were limited to increased kidney weight (still evident after 2 weeks recovery) and after 6 months to tubular dilation. Other target organs in the rat were the liver and the thyroid with hepatocellular hypertrophy occurring at 100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study, and hypertrophy of the follicular epithelium in the thyroid. The liver effect was not completely recovered in females after a month recovery period. The mammary gland adenocarcinomas seen in the high dose group after 6 months of dosing were likely a chance finding, as no increase in tumour incidence was seen in the carcinogenicity study. No effects were observed in the lowest dose tested, which provides a safety margin for males of 1.3 after 4 week and 4 after 6 months, and for females 5 after 4 weeks and 3 after 6 months. Limited toxicity was seen in monkeys, with some effects on the gastro-intestinal tract in the form of inflammation. Bilirubin was consistently reduced, and after 12 months of dosing bile duct hyperplasia occurred as well as increased kidney weight. The bile duct hyperplasia might be the result of accumulation of metabolite M6 which is excreted via bile, which does not occur in humans. Another hypothesis to explain the development of bile duct hyperplasia is the presence of an epoxide intermediate M3c, which is converted into M9 present in monkey bile. In humans, the same epoxide intermediate is formed and subsequently converted into M4, present mainly in urine Genotoxicity The genotoxic potential of lesinurad was assessed in vitro in a bacterial mutation assay and a mammalian cell cytogenetic test, both in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system (S9), and in vivo in a rat bone marrow micronucleus study. Lesinurad has no genotoxic potential. Carcinogenicity The carcinogenic potential of lesinurad was assessed in a 6-month transgenic (TgrasH2) mouse study and in a 2-year Sprague Dawley rat study ( Table 6 ). Table 6.

Exploratory plasma metabolic profiling in rats following dosing for up to 52 weeks at 200 mg/kg/day showed metabolite M2, and to a lesser extent metabolite M3, at greater than 1% of the parent compound on Day 1. At Weeks 26 and 52, metabolites M6, M8, M13, and M20 were detected in addition to M2 and M3. However, metabolite M4, which is formed via hydrolysis of an epoxide intermediate (M3c) and a major human metabolite in human urine, was not detected in rat plasma. There was no test article-related increase in mortality as compared to control animals in either males or females. Microscopic evaluation indicated that there were no lesinurad-related neoplasms in males and females at any dose. Treatment-related non-neoplastic findings were present in the kidney, liver, and GI tract. In the kidney, papillary necrosis (minimal to marked severity) at 200 mg/kg/day was considered to be an adverse effect of lesinurad. In the liver, there was an increase in the incidence of BDH, a common background observation in aged rats across all the doses. The incidence of BDH was higher in males than females, although females had higher lesinurad exposures at the highest dose. Therefore, the relationship of lesinurad or its metabolites to BDH in rats is uncertain.

Metabolism of lesinurad in humans was mediated mainly by CYP2C9 with minimal contributions from CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. CYP2C9 was responsible for the formation of the oxidative M3 metabolite from lesinurad. Additionally, CYP2C9 metabolized lesinurad to form an epoxide intermediate M3c, which was rapidly hydrolyzed to the dihydrodiol M4 metabolite by mEH. Therefore, M3c was only detected when in vitro incubation was conducted using CYP2C9 recombinant enzyme, which lacks the expression of mEH, or in microsomes with the presence of mEH inhibitors. In microsomes or hepatocytes where mEH was present, and in the absence of mEH inhibitors, only M4 was detected.

Metabolite Assessment

The applicant stated that there was no detectable epoxide intermediate in human plasma, urine, or faeces samples. In humans, M3 and M4 were detected in urine at a proportion &gt;10% of dose. In rats, M3 is the primary metabolite in urine (approximately 50% in male rats and 18% in female rats; thus M3 is qualified in the repeated-dose and carcinogenicity studies. In rats and monkeys, M4 is present at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

much lower levels in urine (&lt; 0.5% of dose), thus M4 is considered to be a disproportionate metabolite in humans. M3 and M4 have no structural alerts beyond those observed with lesinurad for genotoxicity (lesinurad was negative for genotoxicity) and are not pharmacologically active.

In contrast to humans, monkeys have only small amounts of M4 detected in urine and bile. This is because in monkeys the epoxide hydrolase pathway was a minor route of detoxification of M3c, which reacts mainly with cysteine to form a cysteine adduct metabolite M9, presumably via a nucleophilic attack ( Figure 4 ). The presence of a significant amount of M9 in monkey bile along with the detection of M4 in rat and mouse supports the hypothesis that metabolism involving epoxide formation occurs in all toxicology species investigated.

b Values were calculated based on the data from a [14C]lesinurad single oral dose rat study (SR12-032);

Figure 4. In vivo elimination of epoxide intermediate M3c Abbreviations: CYP2C9, cytochrome P450 2C9; mEH, microsomal epoxide hydrolase Although not measurable or quantifiable, the amount of the M3c epoxide intermediate can be calculated based on the M4 and M9 levels detected in each species. Since M4 or M9 were not measured in the pivotal toxicity studies, data generated from single or repeated-dose oral radio-labelled lesinurad studies in mice, rats, or monkeys were used to calculate the amount of epoxide intermediate. Interspecies comparison of calculated epoxide amount is presented in Table 8 . Table 8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Calculated total epoxide amount estimated from M4 levels in human urine and faeces (Study 112 CSR) was 129.3 mg, or 1.5 mg/kg (per body weight), or 0.06 mg/g (per liver weight) following a single oral 600 mg [14C ]lesinurad dosing in liquid formulation, which resulted in disproportionally higher systemic exposure (AUC=123 μg·hr/mL) of lesinurad compared to AUC=28.0 μg·hr/mL at 200 mg in Study 105 CSR, where the lesinurad IR capsules were used. The epoxide in humans at the dose of 200 mg was adjusted using a correction factor of 4.39 (123/28) and calculated to be 29.5 mg for the IR capsule form.

The mean calculated amount of M3c per body weight at the NOEL (200 mg/kg/day) in rats for carcinogenicity was 0.79 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. A value for M3c could not be calculated for mice, as only trace M4 was detected in TgrasH2 mice. The calculated amount of M3c at the NOAEL (300 mg/kg/day) in monkeys (12 -month study) was 74 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. Thus, M3c has been evaluated for potential general toxicity in both rats and monkeys along with carcinogenicity in rats. The negative results for carcinogenicity in the rat including the liver, where M3c conversion to M4 occurs, support the conclusion that there are no safety concerns associated with the levels of M3c that occur following a lifetime exposure to lesinurad at the MTD. In human plasma, M4 was not detected at a proportion &gt;10% of parent, but it was detected in human urine at a proportion &gt;10% of dose. The mean calculated amount of M4 per body weight at the NOEL (200 mg/kg/day) in rats for carcinogenicity was 0.78 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. A value for M4 could not be calculated for mice, as only trace M4 was detected in TgrasH2 mice. The calculated amount of M4 per body weight at the NOAEL (300 mg/kg/day) in monkeys (12month study) was 3.1 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. Therefore, M4 has been adequately assessed for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Since the rat carcinogenicity was negative, there is no need to evaluate M4 in a genotoxicity battery. Furthermore, at a high dose of 1000 mg/kg in the rat micronucleus test, no increase in micronucleus was observed. Evaluation for reproductive toxicity would not be required given that M4 was only a disproportionate metabolite in urine. Further, the reproductive toxicity studies in rats tested at a top dose of 300 mg/kg/day of lesinurad, which conceivably would have resulted in higher M4 exposures than the high dose of 200 mg/kg/day used in the carcinogenicity study, thus contribute to the overall reproductive toxicity testing of M4. Studies on impurities Key intermediates and potential impurities in the synthetic pathway for lesinurad that require qualification according to ICH guidelines were adequately qualified using repeated-dose studies. As part of the genotoxic impurity control strategy, in silico evaluation and Ames testing of the impurities were carried out. Intermediates or starting material impurities and reagent formylhydrazine which were identified as genotoxic impurities were under the threshold of toxicological concern of (TTC) 1.5 μg/day, or a concentration of 7.5 ppm in the 200 mg tablet (once daily) of lesinurad.

## Phototoxicity

Lesinurad is able to absorb UVB light. However, due to insufficient distribution to skin and eyes, lesinurad is unlikely to have phototoxic potential.

Lesinurad is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB.

Considering the above data and the environmental risk assessment, lesinurad is not expected to pose a risk to the surface water compartment, groundwater compartment, the sewage treatment plant, and the sediment compartment.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Pivotal non-clinical studies were claimed to be performed in accordance with GLP. However, the repeated dose toxicology studies were performed in laboratories that were not part of a GLP monitoring program of a Country that is an adherent to the OECD MAD (Mutual acceptance of Data; in this case China). Therefore the CHMP requested a GLP inspection to verify the GLP compliance of those sites.  Inspections were conducted in July and September 2015 (INS/GLP/2015/001) and did not reveal any critical findings. The CHMP therefore concluded that the data from the non-clinical studies inspected could be used for the evaluation of the concerned application. Lesinurad is a urate-lowering therapy being developed for the chronic treatment of gout. It is a SURI that inhibits uric acid transporters in the renal proximal tubules. URAT1 inhibitors such as lesinurad lower sUA by reducing reabsorption of uric acid. Although no animal models are available to test its uric acid lowering efficacy in vivo , lesinurad demonstrated inhibition of URAT1 in in vitro transporter assays at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition to URAT1, lesinurad inhibits OAT4, another transporter located in the apical membrane of the renal proximal tubules. Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP as there are no appropriate animal pharmacodynamic models to evaluate the intended effect in humans, due to the fact that animals unlike humans possess the uricase enzyme which converts uric acid to allantoin. No local tolerance studies were submitted as lesinurad is administered orally and thus local tolerance in the GI tract was evaluated in the repeated-dose toxicity studies. Data on other targets did not show significant activity at clinically relevant concentrations. A study on muscle cell toxicity did not reveal muscle toxicity potential of lesinurad in Rat L6 cells in vitro at a concentration of 10 µM. Lesinurad did not exhibit any clinically significant antiviral activity against HIV, but in 2 MSU dependent rodent acute gout flare models, lesinurad was efficacious in reducing inflammation from injected MSU crystals. No important safety pharmacology effects on parameters of the CNS, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and renal/urinary system were observed.

The PK properties of lesinurad were studied in vitro using animal and human tissues and expressed proteins, and in vivo in the species and strains used in the safety evaluation. Exposures to lesinurad were generally at least dose-proportional in rats and monkeys, and generated large multiples of the human exposure at the MRHD. Following repeated dosing of lesinurad, toxicokinetics revealed evidence of slight auto-induction in rats at ≥ 100 mg/kg and moderate auto-induction in monkeys at ≥ 30 mg/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lesinurad was highly protein bound. The free fraction of lesinurad in plasma is low with a fu of 2.3 % in rat, 5% in mouse and 1.7% in human, dog and monkey. Distribution to other tissues except for liver and kidney is limited. In all species, including humans, the major circulating component was unchanged lesinurad, except for monkeys where towards the end of the chronic study the dealkylated M6 metabolite was predominant.

Metabolism is a mixture of oxidation, debromination and glucuronidation, but in monkeys Sdealkylation (M6) and cysteine conjugation (M9) are important as well. All metabolites in humans were identified in the nonclinical toxicology species, with only M4 considered to be a human disproportionate urinary metabolite. M4 is formed via an epoxide intermediate (M3c) that was not detected in animals or humans. The Applicant suggested that in vivo M3c is rapidly hydrolyzed by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) into M4 (major metabolite in human urine) or M9 (major metabolite in monkey bile) and the documentation provided to support this hypothesis was considered sufficient by the CHMP.

A mechanism of action for the kidney toxicity observed in humans has been proposed, related to the pathological condition of the patient, and more specifically the increased uric acid levels. It appears likely that due to this increased plasma and urine uric acid levels, crystallization occurs, leading to kidney damage. This is further substantiated by the fact that patients receiving concomitant allopurinol to reduce uric acid levels, showed decreased renal toxicity. A similar mechanism of action is not mimicked in animals since uric acid levels are much lower in animals.

The CYP P450 system and mEH are both known to be located in the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum. Further, Nishimura et al (2003) showed that CYP2A9 mRNA is highly expressed in human liver, whereas Enayetallah et al (2004) showed by blot analyses that CYP2C9 is expressed in human bile duct and kidney and Lakehal (1999) using immunohistochemistry showed that mEH is expressed in human bile duct and kidney. The colocalization of mEH and CYP2C9 in liver and kidney enables the M3c formed by CYP2C9 to be readily hydrolyzed, which will limit exposure to M3c. On the other hand, literature data indicate that certain well-characterized genetic polymorphisms in human mEH exist (Fretland et al., 2000; Pinarbasi et al., 2010). This mEH polymorphism implies that there may be patient populations with an increased risk of adverse effect in liver and kidney as a result of a higher M3c exposure. The CHMP therefore considered that use of lesinurad in patients with epoxide hydrolase polymorphism should be included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as missing information with close surveillance of post-marketing reports for any evidence of hepatotoxicity. In addition, the CHMP recommended that the Applicant should provide the results of a study on metabolite profiling, including metabolite M4 formed by epoxide hydrolase, over 24 hours and this study is also included in the RMP. Kidney was the main target organ in rats, where severe kidney toxicity was the cause of early deaths in the high dose group in the 14 day study. It appears that toxicity is only evident after short term treatment of up to 3 weeks, after which the effects are resolved. This was evidenced by kidney toxicity (tubular degeneration) at all doses in the 14-day study, at the high dose only after 14 days in the 28day study, with marginal non- significant increases in sCr levels, and tubular injury resulting in death after 3 weeks dosing in the 6-month study. Despite these findings the CHMP considered that lesinurad is not a classic nephrotoxicant, and possibly the observed effects were species specific, as similar lesions were not observed in monkeys, and there was no classic dose response.

Other target organs in the rat were the liver and the thyroid with hepatocellular hypertrophy occurring at 100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study, and hypertrophy of the follicular epithelium in the thyroid.Limited toxicity was seen in monkeys, with some effects on the gastro-intestinal tract in the form of inflammation. Bilirubin was consistently reduced, and after 12 months of dosing bile duct hyperplasia occurred as well as increased kidney weight. The bile duct hyperplasia might be the result

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of accumulation of metabolite M6 which is excreted via bile, which does not occur in humans. Due to the bile duct hyperplasia, the NOAEL in the 12-month study is 100 mg/kg/day, which is around 3-fold the human exposure. In clinical trials, hepatobiliary disorders including acute cholecystitis was observed at a somewhat greater incidence in the lesinurad arm as compared to placebo. However, in the long-term extension study, no trend of cholestasis in humans was observed after 24 months of follow-up. No relevant cytotoxicity was shown in HeLa-JC53 and human HepG2 cells and in contrast to benzbromarone, no mitochondrial toxicity in HepG2 cells was observed. Yet, it should also be considered that HeLa and HepG2 cells have only limited metabolic activity and therefore insufficiently cover any potential role of metabolites. Only mitochondrial toxicity was considered by the Applicant as a potential cause for DILI.

Dose-related GI toxicity was observed in all tested species and resulted in mortality at high doses in rats and monkeys. In addition, decreased intestinal motility (17%) after an acute dose was seen in rats in the GI safety pharmacology study. However, in the secondary pharmacology screen, lesinurad did not have an effect on the cholinergic pharmacology at 100 μM. Thus, the mechanism underlying the GI toxicity in animals is not known. The applicant proposed that it could be a local direct toxic effect or an off-target toxicity at the supra-physiological concentrations in the GI tract, since most of the GI toxicity occurred at a dose exceeding the MTD. The safety margins, based on systemic exposures, at the NOAEL in rats and monkeys are 4 and 12 times the human exposure at MHD. Clinical data do not point to evidence of significant GI tract safety issues. and Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is included as an adverse effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Based on the available data, the CHMP concluded that GI tract toxicity in association with lesinurad use does not appear to be a significant clinical concern . Lesinurad was shown not to have a genotoxic potential. Lesinurad was not carcinogenic in the 2-year rat study, with exposures over 50-fold the human exposure or in the 6 month study in the TgrasH2 mouse model, with exposures of over 30 (females) and 60 (males) the human exposure. The results of the 13-week rat combination study are sufficient to support the treatment of gout patients with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol. The combination toxicology studies with lesinurad and allopurinol or febuxostat showed no additive, synergistic, overlapping, or new toxicity when the agents were coadministered, supporting combination dosing of lesinurad with either XO inhibitor. There was no effect on male or female fertility due to treatment with lesinurad. There were no effects on the offspring of rats treated with up to 300 mg/kg/day lesinurad, resulting in 46-fold the human exposure. In rabbits, treatment with lesinurad caused severe maternal toxicity resulting in a reduction in viable foetuses due to increased resorptions. Even though maternal toxicity is still evident at the low dose, no effects on foetuses were observed at this dose, providing a safety margin of 4. No increase in malformations of variations was seen in any of the groups. As noted by the applicant, the number of litters available for analysis was reduced in the mid dose group, and no litters were available in the high dose group due to maternal toxicity. The applicant referred to a scientific advice provided by the CHMP, which stated that no further studies were necessary. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the pre- and postnatal study in rats, lesinurad was maternally toxic at all doses, resulting in reduced body weight gain at the low dose from GD17 and severe toxicity and death in the mid and high dose groups. Reduced viable foetuses, reduced pup body weight and mortalities were observed in groups treated with 200 mg/kg/day or higher. No such effects were seen at the low dose of 100 mg/kg/day, resulting in and exposure 14-fold the human exposure. Surviving pups did not show any effects on behaviour or reproduction performance at any dose group, up to 40-fold the human exposure.

The absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of lesinurad was determined in 10 healthy adult male subjects in study 131. The subjects received a non-radiolabeled oral dose of 400 mg lesinurad tablet under fasted conditions and a 15-minute IV infusion of 100 μg [ 14 C]lesinurad microtracer dose commencing at 1.75 hours post oral dose to coincide with the expected mean oral Tmax. By comparing dose-normalized AUC0-∞ of lesinurad from oral and IV dosing, the absolute oral bioavailability for lesinurad was determined to be 101% (90% CI: 95.4% to 106%).

2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetic properties of lesinurad were evaluated with a number of different formulations including, solutions, immediate-release (IR) capsules and tablets. Lesinurad was present as sodium salt or free acid in the different formulations. Absorption of lesinurad in healthy subjects after a single dose of lesinurad (5 to 600 mg) using different formulations under fasted conditions was rapid and the Cmax occurred after ≤3 hours. Tmax was ~2.0 hours for the immediate release tablet of the free acid. Bioavailability Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Comparison of trial formulations with finished product

In studies 129 and 132, the effect of 2 different manufacturing sites on the bioavailability of commercial lesinurad 400 mg FA tablets was investigated in healthy, adult male subjects under fasted

and fed conditions. One batch (ELAD) was manufactured at the proposed commercial site (AstraZeneca AB) and compared to batch (12A015) manufactured at the Phase III manufacturing site (Metrics, Inc.). In study 129, 72 subjects were divided over 4 cohorts (2 sequences with 9 subjects per sequence). In study 132, 54 subjects were divided over 2 groups (n=27 per group) who received either lesinurad manufactured at the commercial site or manufactured at the Phase III production site under fasting conditions with a 3 day wash out period. Subjects were separated into 2 dosing subgroups due to limited capacity at the clinical research unit. In both studies, the batch produced at the proposed commercial site was bioequivalent to the batch manufactured at the Phase III site ( Table 10 ).

## Distribution

## Plasma protein binding

The in vitro binding of lesinurad to human plasma proteins was evaluated using radiolabeled lesinurad at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 µM in all species using equilibrium dialysis (study SR08-045). Mean plasma protein binding of lesinurad was equal to or greater than 97% over the investigated concentration range (98.5 ± 0.06% at 1 µM; 98.4 ± 0.02% at 10 µM and 97.9 ± 0.17% at 50 µM). The binding was primarily due to interaction with albumin with minimal contribution from α-1-acid glycoprotein.

Plasma protein binding of lesinurad was unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (99.0% bound) and moderate hepatic impairment (98.8% bound) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function (99.0% bound) (study 118). Plasma protein binding of lesinurad ranged from 98.7% to 99.0% across the different renal function categories (study 120). Plasma protein binding decreased slightly in subjects with moderate (98.7% ± 0.207%) and severe renal impairment (98.7% ± 0.174%) compared with subjects with normal renal function (99.0% ± 0.142%). Blood-to-plasma ratio The blood-to-plasma ratio was determined in vivo (study 112). Following a single oral dose of 600 mg [ 14 C]-lesinurad to healthy male volunteers, the mean whole blood to plasma ratios of AUC and Cmax ranged between 0.54 and 0.55. Volume of distribution Following a single IV dose of 100 μg [ 14 C]-lesinurad, the volume of distribution at steady state was 20.3 L (study 131). Elimination The elimination half-life ranged from 2.7 to 17.5 hours. The half-life for the immediate release capsule of the free acid ranged from 3.1 to 5.7 hours. Excretion The mass balance was evaluated in 6 healthy male volunteers receiving a single 600 mg dose of [ 14 C]-lesinurad (sodium salt) oral solution  (Absorption, metabolism and excretion Study 112). Renal clearance is 25.6 mL/min (CV=56%). In total, 63% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 32% in feces after a period of 0 to 144 hours ( Figure 5 ). The majority of the administered dose was excreted within the first 24 hours (~60% via urine). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Metabolism From in vitro studies (presented in Section 2.3 of this report), the metabolism of lesinurad in humans was found to be mediated mainly by CYP2C9 with minimal contributions from CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. CYP2C9 is considered to play a major role in the formation of oxidative metabolites (M3, M3b, M4, M5, M5b). CYP2C9 metabolizes lesinurad to form an epoxide intermediate M3c, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to the M4 metabolite by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH). Formation of M5 is mediated through the combination of CYP2C9 and gastrointestinal microflora. The formation of M6 is catalysed by CYP3A4, but the elimination of lesinurad through this pathway is negligible in humans in vivo. Based on the data from study 112 (AME study), the applicant proposed the following metabolic pathway of lesinurad: Figure 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lesinurad is a racemic mixture (50:50) of 2 atropisomers. Quality tests have shown that the atropisomers do not readily interconvert even under extreme conditions. Lesinurad atropisomers were investigated individually to assess potential metabolism differences in human and monkey liver microsomes and recombinant CYPs.  The formation of lesinurad metabolite M3c was primarily from atropisomer 1, the M3 and M4 metabolites were formed from both atropisomers with higher levels by atropisomer 1. M6 was also formed from both atropisomers with greater preference from atropisomer 2.

The ratios of atropisomer 1 and atropisomer 2 were determined in study 126 Cohort 2 and were 43:57 at Cmax,ss and 20:80 at Cmin,ss. The half-live is 3.8 h for atropisomer 1 and 6.2 h for atropisomer 2. The urinary atropisomer 1/atropisomer 2 ratio was 0.648 for the amount excreted unchanged from 0 to 24 hours (Ae0-24) and 0.836 for renal clearance from 0 to 24 hours (CLR0-24). No atropisomer ratios are warranted for faeces since the majority of the radioactivity is excreted via urine and not faeces. Atropisomer 1 is in vitro extensively metabolised by CYP2C9 to M3 and M3c. M3c is further metabolised to M4 by microsomal epoxide hydrolase. Atropisomer 2 is metabolised to M6 by CYP3A4, but to a more limited extent. The in vitro metabolism studies are consistent with the observed in vivo plasma concentrations of atropisomer 1 and 2 and the shorter t½ observed for atropisomer 1 compared to atropisomer 2. All metabolites observed in vivo in humans were identified in the non-clinical toxicology species, although the relative contributions to the metabolic profile were different between species. Major metabolites detected in animals were M3 and M5 (rat) and M6 (monkey), and the predominant metabolites detected in humans were M3 and M4. Median Tmax of the lesinurad metabolite M4 was observed at 2.25 hours post-dose in plasma, compared to 0.5 hours for lesinurad. The mean half-life of M4 was 5.73 hours. The mean M4-toradioactivity and M4-to-lesinurad ratios of Cmax and AUCinf were less than 4%. A mean total of 27.7% of the lesinurad dose was excreted unchanged in urine, which is around 44% of the total radioactivity recovered in the urine.  The renal clearance of lesinurad was 25 mL/min (1.5 L/hr). Based on metabolic profiling using pooled 0-24 hour urine, 24.8% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was attributable to the M4 metabolite, and 18.9% to M3, equivalent to 15.7% and 12.0% of the dose respectively. The clearance of M4 ranged from 280 mL/min to 370 mL/min. In urine, lesinurad was the major excreted component. The 2 most abundant metabolites, M3 and M4, both oxidative metabolites, accounted for a further 27.7% of the dose. In faeces, the majority of the radioactivity was attributed to metabolites. Transporters From in vitro studies lesinurad was found to be a substrate of OATP1B1, OCT1, OAT1 and OAT3. Further, limited increased uptake could be detected in vitro in BCRP and OATP1B3 expressing cells (&lt;30% increase). Lesinurad was not a substrate of P-glycoprotein, MRP2, MRP4 and OCT2.

## Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism

The applicant submitted a cross-study analysis of the effect of CYP2C9 polymorphism on lesinurad pharmacokinetics in humans. This was based on data from studies 109 (relative BA study), 110 (DDI study of allopurinol and colchicine), 111 (DDI study of febuxostat and colchicine), 202 and 203 (dose finding).  CYP2C9 genotype information was collected in 8 healthy subjects and 110 gout patients.

The effect of CYP2C9 polymorphism on lesinurad PK was evaluated by calculating differences in PK parameters between *1/*1 subjects and other CYP2C9 polymorphisms ( Table 12 ).

Table 13. Percent Differences (%) in Geometric Mean Lesinurad Pharmacokinetic Parameters at Various Lesinurad Dose Levels Dose proportionality and time dependencies The dose proportionality of lesinurad under the fasted (5 to 600 mg) and fed (100 to 1600 mg) conditions under fasted conditions was assessed separately in pooled PK parameters from healthy volunteers receiving lesinurad alone. Proportionality analysis was performed using the power model (Peng 2004). Data were pooled from studies involving lesinurad solutions, sodium salt and free acid capsules and tablets for the dose-proportionality assessment. Results from the pooled PK parameters confirmed that both Cmax and AUC values for lesinurad increased proportionally between 5 mg to 600 mg under fasted conditions ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7.

Time dependency Multiple-dose PK of lesinurad was studied in: · healthy  male  volunteers  following  once  daily  dosing  of  lesinurad  immediate-release  (IR) capsules for 10 days under fasted and fed conditions (study 102); · following once daily dosing of lesinurad IR capsule for 7 days under fed conditions (study 106); · following once daily dosing of lesinurad FA IR tablets for 7 days under fed conditions (study Days 6 to 12) in healthy Japanese male volunteers (study 125). The pharmacokinetics were predictable and no unexpected accumulation of lesinurad following once daily sing with 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg was observed, both under fasted and fed conditions. Pharmacokinetics in target population Lesinurad PK was assessed in subjects with gout by means of rich PK sampling after multiple dosing in study 110 (allopurinol DDI study) and study 203 (dose finding study). The PK substudy of study 203 included 54 subjects. On day 13 of dosing, plasma PK samples were collected at predose and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 24.0 hours postdose. PK parameters at steady state were compared with those from healthy adult subjects derived from Study 105 (febuxostat DDI study). Table 14 .

In Study 202 (dose-finding study), 3 patients on 600 mg qd were enrolled in a PK sub-study and provided additional serial post-dose blood samples (1, 2, 4 and 8 hours). Concentrations of plasma lesinurad and its metabolites (M4 and M6) were measured. Molar ratios of metabolites (M4 and M6) to lesinurad in blood were low, with median molar ratios for Cmax and AUC less than 4% for M4 and less than 0.3% for M6. Population PK analysis A population PK analysis was conducted using lesinurad plasma concentrations from studies 118 (hepatic impairment), 120 (moderate and severe renal impairment), 121 (food effect study), 122, 126 and 127 (DDI study), 301 302, 303 and 304 (Phase 3). The selected Phase 1 studies used the Phase 3 formulation (lesinurad free acid tablet). A total of 9936 plasma concentrations of lesinurad from 1109 individuals (11% of the subjects were in Phase 1 and 89% in Phase 3) was included in the population PK analysis. Concentration data comprised rich single-dose profiles (3949 samples) from 120 individuals without gout (healthy subjects and subjects with renal or hepatic impairment) from six Phase 1 studies, as well as sparsely collected 5987 plasma samples from 989 out of 1128 (approximately 88%) subjects with gout who received lesinurad in four Phase 3 studies. Individuals in the population PK data set had a mean age of 51 years (range: 18 to 81 years; 88% was &lt;65 years of age), mean body weight of 104 kg (range: 47 to 239 kg), a mean BMI of 33.1 (range: 14-84), and mean creatinine Clearance of 88 mL/min (range: 17 to 191 mL/min). The majority of individuals were male (95.4%). The population PK model of lesinurad consisted of a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption rate and lag time for absorption. Based on an exploratory analysis, age, sex, weight, creatinine clearance, markers of liver function (AST and ALT) and baseline sUA were selected for the formal covariate analysis.

Two studies were conducted in otherwise healthy subjects with renal-impaired (studies 104 and 120). In addition, one study was performed in renal-impaired gout patients (studies 203 main).

Typical CL/F value in Phase 3 subjects was approximately 18% lower than that observed in subjects without gout, assuming the same CrCl levels. Based on the model, the typical CL/F of lesinurad in subjects in Phase 3 studies with normal renal function (CrCl=105 mL/min), as well as mild (CrCl=75 mL/min), moderate (CrCl=45 mL/min) and severe renal impairment (CrCl= 22 mL/min) would be 6.09, 5.46, 4.64, and 3.68 L/h, respectively. Based on these decreases in CL/F, the estimated increases in lesinurad exposure would be approximately 12%, 31% and 65% in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with patients with normal renal function. The most important covariate describing the variability was the effect of weight on Vc/F of lesinurad. This would range from 19.6 to 45.1 L based on the body weight range in Phase 3 (46.7 to 239 kg). Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not found to be statistically significant covariates affecting PK parameters of lesinurad.

In study 104, the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad were evaluated following a single oral dose of 200 mg (2 x 100 mg capsule) in adult volunteers with normal, mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. In study 120, the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad were evaluated following a single oral dose of 400 mg (one FA tablet) in adult volunteers with normal, mild, moderate or severe renal impairment.

In both studies, lesinurad exposure was found to increase with the level of renal impairment ( Table 16 ).

Effect of lesinurad on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs Based on in-vitro results, the predicted induction potential of lesinurad follows the rank order of CYP3A &gt; CYP2C8 &gt; CYP2C9 &gt; CYP2C19 &gt; CYP2B6. The applicant investigated the in vivo induction potential using probes for activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. In vitro , lesinurad exhibited inhibitory potential on CYP enzymes (CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) and OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OAT3 transporters. Although mEH is involved in the biotransformation of lesinurad, lesinurad exerted no inhibitory effect on mEH activity in vitro . Potential interactions with drugs frequently used in the gout population were also investigated. The effect of lesinurad on the PK of CYP and transporter substrates is summarised in Table 21 .

## Mechanism of action

2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic action of lesinurad was evaluated by measuring the change of sUA levels from baseline, in healthy volunteers, gout patients and renally impaired patients in gout and non-gout patients. PD interaction-studies with XO-inhibitors were also submitted: Furthermore, a QT study was performed in healthy volunteers using super-therapeutic doses (Study 117).

Lesinurad was tested in multiple human transporter assays involved in uric acid regulation including URAT1, OATs, and other transporters and enzymes. Lesinurad showed inhibitory activity on both URAT1 and OAT4 (IC50 = 7.3 μM and 3.7 μM, respectively).

URAT1 is considered to be responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular lumen.  By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers sUA.  Lesinurad also inhibits OAT4, a uric acid transporter which is thought to be involved in diuretic-

induced hyperuricemia. The schematic proposed mechanism of action of lesinurad is depicted in Figure 12.

The observed effects were considerable higher under fed conditions. With the 100 mg dose, the sUA effect after a single dose in the morning was attenuated within 12 hrs, whereas a more sustained effect was shown for the 200-400 mg doses.  After cessation of the study drugs on Day 10, mean sUA for all lesinurad-treated groups gradually returned to baseline in about 48 hrs. There was no rebound effect.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology Heathy volunteers: reduction of serum uric acid from baseline In Study 102, multiple doses of lesinurad 100/200/400 mg or matched placebo were given for 7-10 days to 32 normal healthy volunteers, with a baseline sUA values &gt; 5 mg/dL. Steady-state of the PD effect was achieved at Day 6. The mean reduction from baseline serum Uric Acid (sUA) was ~30-40% for the 200-400 mg dose ( Table 23 ) decreases in sUA concentrations were similar in male and female subjects. Table 23.

## Exploratory PD study in gout patients

The proof of concept of lesinurad was explored in gout patients in Study 201, a 2-weeks study in gout patients, with a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled design. In Cohort 1, 21 subjects were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to lesinurad 400 mg qd, matching placebo or allopurinol 300 mg qd (open-label). In a second cohort, 7 patients were randomised to combination therapy of lesinurad + allopurinol and allopurinol + placebo (5:1 ratio). All patients received colchicine to protect them against ULT-induced flares. Only gout patients were eligible with obvious hyperuricaemia (sUA &gt; 8 mg/dL), who did not received any ULT in the 3 months before the study.

The effects of lesinurad on uric acid serum levels are presented in Table 24.

QTc study

A blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled thorough QT study in healthy volunteers, with moxifloxacin as positive control, demonstrated no relevant effect following single doses of lesinurad 400 mg or a supra-therapeutic dose of 1600 mg on QTc intervals or other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in 89 healthy volunteers (Study 117). There was no relevant effect on heart rate, atrioventricular conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by PR and QRS interval durations (data not shown).

Age, gender and race did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad, but weight had an effect on the volume of distribution of lesinurad, but not on the exposure. The pharmacokinetics of lesinurad are similar in gout patients compared to healthy subjects at the clinical dose of 200 mg. Lesinurad is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (greater than 98%), mainly to albumin. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The mean steady state volume of distribution of lesinurad was approximately 20 L following intravenous dosing. Mean plasma-to-blood ratios of lesinurad AUC and Cmax were approximately 1.8, indicating that radioactivity was largely contained in the plasma space and did not penetrate or partition extensively into red blood cells. Excretion is for ~60% via urine as lesinurad (half of the radioactivity in urine) and metabolites. Around 40% is excreted via faeces and almost completely as metabolite. The metabolite

Discussion on clinical pharmacology Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lesinurad are relatively simple, as absorption occurs in a dose proportional manner and there is no accumulation after repeated dosing. The absolute bioavailability of lesinurad is approximately 100%. Lesinurad is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Following administration of a single oral dose of lesinurad in either the fed or fasted state, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were attained within 1 to 4 hours. Cmax and AUC exposures of lesinurad increased proportionally with single doses of lesinurad from 5 to 1,200 mg. In the fed state, after a single dose of lesinurad 200 mg, geometric mean lesinurad Cmax and AUC were 6 μg/mL and 29 μg/hr/mL, respectively. There was no apparent influence of the fat content in the meal on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad. In clinical trials, lesinurad was administered with food, because the serum uric acid lowering was improved under fed conditions. Lesinurad is a racemic mixture and pharmacokinetic studies of the two atropisomers revealed that atropisomer 1 has a slightly lower plasma exposure than atropisomer 2 due to extensive metabolism of the former by CYP2C9 whereas atropisomer 2 is slightly metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

profile of lesinurad in plasma was determined 3 hours after dose administration which is ~1 hour after Cmax. Lesinurad is highly protein bound and renal clearance is high (as compared to typical human glomerular filtration rate), indicating that active secretion plays an important role in the renal excretion of lesinurad. Within 7 days following single dosing of radiolabeled lesinurad, 63% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 32% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in faeces. Most of the radioactivity recovered in urine (&gt;60% of dose) occurred in the first 24 hours. Unchanged lesinurad in urine accounted for approximately 30% of the dose. The elimination half-life (t½) of lesinurad was approximately 5 hours following a single dose. Lesinurad does not accumulate following multiple doses. Lesinurad undergoes oxidative metabolism mainly via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 to intermediate metabolite M3c (not detected in vivo) and is subsequently metabolised by mEH to metabolite M4; there is minimal contribution from CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A to the metabolism of lesinurad. Metabolites are not known to contribute to the uric acid lowering effects of lesinurad. Lesinurad is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and mEH, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYP2C19 and CYP3A. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but not of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and mEH. In addition, lesinurad is an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A via CAR/PXR. In vivo, lesinurad is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP2C9 and 2C8, but a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A. CYP2B6 has not been studied in vivo. Lesinurad is a substrate of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, OAT4 and OCT1 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. However, the in vivo activity of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1 was not affected by lesinurad Only one strength (200 mg) was developed which limits the possibility of dose adjustments in special populations. Lesinurad exposure is significantly increased in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, but not in subjects with mild renal impairment. As will be discussed later in the Clinical Efficacy and Safety sections, efficacy and renal safety in subjects with mild-moderate renal impairment at baseline was not different from subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dosing adjustment is required in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, a contraindication has been made for patients with severe renal impairment, as lesinurad may be less effective in this group, as it has to be excreted in the urine to establish a PD effect on the URAT-1 receptors. No studies were performed in subject with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose recommendation could be made for this special population. However, use of lesinurad in patients with severe hepatic impairment is included in the RMP as missing information in order to collect further data in this sub-population of patients through signal detection and review of this topic in aggregate safety reports. intermediate CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*3,) and in poor CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *3/*3), range observed in the extensive metaboliser subjects. Therefore the CHMP recommended that patients Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of CYP2C9 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad was studied in 8 healthy subjects and 59 patients with gout following daily dosing of lesinurad ranging from 200 mg to 600 mg in the absence or presence of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. At the 400 mg dose, when compared with extensive CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*1) increased lesinurad exposures were observed in accompanied with higher lesinurad renal excretion. However, individual values were well within the who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers based on previous history or experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should use lesinurad with caution.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical data in gout patients treated for up to 12 months estimated increases in lesinurad exposure of approximately 12%, 31% and 65% in patients with mild,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with patients with normal renal function.

Following administration of a single dose of Zurampic to individuals with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function lesinurad Cmax and AUC, respectively, were 36% and 30% higher (200 mg) in patients with mild renal impairment (eCrCL 60 to 89 mL/min), 20% and 73% higher (200 mg) and 3% and 50% higher (400 mg) in patients with moderate renal impairment (eCrCL 30 to 59 mL/min), and 13% higher and 113% higher (400 mg) in patients with severe renal impairment (eCrCL &lt;30 mL/min).

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions demonstrated that lesinurad is an in vitro inducer of CYP3A4. The clinical data also indicate that it is a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A. Lesinurad is also an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6, but no relevant in vivo DDI studies were performed. Therefore, it is recommended in the SmPC that patients are monitored for reduced efficacy of CYP2B6 substrates (such as bupropion, efavirenz) when co-administered with lesinurad. In addition, no in vitro studies were performed to exclude that lesinurad acts as an inhibitor of the transporter BSEP (inhibition can be involved in clinically relevant in vivo drug interactions excreted via BSEP). The CHMP therefore requested that the Applicant further investigates the potential of lesinurad to inhibit BSEP and this missing information and details of the corresponding study is included in the RMP. Pharmacodynamics The proof of concept of lesinurad has been adequately demonstrated. Lesinurad doses of 400-600 mg qd showed a similar rate of sUA reduction from baseline as allopurinol 300 mg or a low dose of febuxostat 40 mg, in gout patients. The data indicate that the combination with allopurinol or febuxostat at therapeutic doses, significantly reduced systemic and urinary uric acid load. This dual mechanism may thus improve clinical response and safety of lesinurad. No data are available of lower doses of allopurinol background treatment than 300 mg. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that patients are treated with a minimum allopurinol dose of 300 mg as stipulated in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. Although the plasma levels of lesinurad increase significantly at renal impairment, because lesinurad is cleared by the renal pathway, the overall capacity to excrete UA and the effect of lesinurad was reduced in patients with moderate-severe renal impairment. The impact of mild-moderate renal impairment at chronic use has been further studied in the clinical trial program of lesinurad and described in detail in Section 2.5 of this report. 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology The pharmacokinetics of lesinurad were thoroughly investigated. However, as detailed in the nonclinical section, additional information regarding metabolite profiling but also on the potential inhibitory effect of lesinurad on the transporter BSEP will be further investigated with two studies which are included in the RMP.

The pharmacodynamic effect of lesinurad in lowering serum uric acid has been convincingly demonstrated. The combination with a XOI is considered as a useful addition to the currently available treatment options in this area. The effect of renal impairment on PK-PD was explored in single dose studies. From these studies it is difficult to tell what would be the net clinical effect at multiple doses. However, based on the main clinical trial data (presented and discussed in Section 2.5 of this report) in subjects with a mild-moderate renal impairment at baseline but also the PK-PD modelling results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

submitted, the CHMP concluded that no dose adjustments of the standard 200 mg dose are required for mild-moderate renal impaired patients.

For patients with severe renal impairment, it is anticipated that lesinurad will be poorly excreted in the renal tubule where it should act, and the aimed PD effects of stimulated UA excretion will be low. The CHMP therefore considered that a contra-indication is required for this vulnerable group and this has been included in the SmPC.

in Study 306. In Study 307, subjects were included from Study 304, the febuxostat combination study. These studies are still ongoing, and interim safety data are included in the dossier. Study 305, the open-label extension study of the Phase III monotherapy Study 303, was terminated prematurely because of an increased incidence of acute renal complications like nephrolithiasis and serum creatinine elevations. However, use of lesinurad as monotherapy was not claimed by the Applicant but only in combination use with either allopurinol or febuxostat. Data form this study and the other monotherapy studies were submitted only as supportive evidence for the claimed indication.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the % reduction from baseline in sUA following 4 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant decreases in sUA were achieved favoring lesinurad versus placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint, which was the percent reduction from Baseline in sUA following 4 weeks of treatment. At Day 27 in the ITT population, as assessed by absolute values, change from Baseline, and percent change from Baseline, there were statistically significant reductions in all lesinurad treatment groups compared to the placebo group (p &lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons, Figure 13 ).

Dose response study Lesinurad 200/400/600mg doses were explored in Study 203, a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, as add on therapy to allopurinol in gout patients. This Study consisted of two phases: a 4-weeks core study with sequential cohorts of the 200/400/600 mg lesinurad dosing groups, followed by an extended blinded placebo-controlled phase up to 44 weeks. To enter the extension phase, subjects were re-randomised to either lesinurad 200 mg or placebo -disregarding their dose in the prior study phase-. The lesinurad dose and the placebo equivalent could be individually up-titrated to maximal 600 mg, guided by treatment target sUA level and safety. Once the maximal dose of 600 mg was achieved and the treatment sUA target level was still not achieved, the background allopurinol dose could be up-titrated as rescue medication. Subjects received colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis through Week 20 of the Extension Period. The primary objective of the study was to assess the % reduction from baseline in sUA levels following 4 weeks of continuous treatment with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol compared to allopurinol alone in gout patients with documented inadequate hypouricaemic response to standard doses of allopurinol.

At day 27, the mean % reduction from baseline sUA was 16.1%, 22.1% and 30.4% for the 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg groups respectively. There was an increase of 2.6% for pooled placebo. The reduction compared to placebo was statistically significant in all cohorts (p&lt;0.0001). At day 27, sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL was achieved by 72.5%, 77.5%, 92.7% and 27.3% for 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and placebo groups respectively (ITT analysis). The respective reductions were 63.0%, 73.8%, and 79.2% for the non-responder imputation analysis. The percent increase in urine urate excretion from baseline to Day 28 was 22.3%, 33.5%, and 38.3% in the 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to 6.7% in the placebo group. A similar pattern was apparent for urate clearance and fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA). During the double-blind treatment and follow-up periods, gout flare was reported by 21.7%, 31.0%, and 31.3% of subjects in the 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg groups, respectively, and 20.8% of subjects in the placebo group. 2.5.2.

A total of 181 study sites screened subjects in the US.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomised 1:1:1 and assigned to the following treatments:

Group A: placebo + allopurinol (PBO + ALLO group);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Group B: lesinurad 200 mg + allopurinol (LESU 200 mg + ALLO group);

Group C: lesinurad 400 mg + allopurinol (LESU 400 mg + ALLO group).

All doses of lesinurad/placebo and allopurinol were taken in the morning with food and 240 mL of water. Subjects were instructed to drink 2 L of water per day. If the dose of allopurinol was interrupted, the subject was not to take their dose of lesinurad/placebo until allopurinol was resumed

## Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of lesinurad by Month 6 when used in combination with allopurinol compared to allopurinol monotherapy.

The following secondary endpoints were included:

Secondary objectives included: · To determine the efficacy of lesinurad by Month 12 when used in combination with allopurinol compared to allopurinol monotherapy; · To determine the safety of lesinurad over 6 months and 12 months when used in combination with allopurinol; · To determine the effect of lesinurad when used in combination with allopurinol on Health Related Quality of Life and physical function Outcomes/endpoints Primary endpoint: · The proportion of subjects with a sUA level that is &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at the Month 6 visit. Subjects with missing values at Month 6 for any reason were considered non-responders. Key secondary endpoints: · Mean rate of gout flares requiring treatment for the 6-month period from the end of Month 6 to the end of Month 12. · Proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 target tophus at Baseline who experience complete resolution (CR) of at least 1 target tophus by Month 12 (i.e. last on-study visit). Secondary endpoints related to sUA were also included: · Proportion of subjects whose sUA level is &lt; 6.0 mg/dL, &lt; 5.0 mg/dL and &lt; 4.0 mg/dL at each visit. · Absolute and percent change from Baseline in sUA levels at each visit. Other tophus related secondary endpoints included: · Mean percent change from Baseline in the sum of the areas for all target tophi at each visit. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Proportion of subjects with an improvement from Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) of at least 0.25 at Month 12.
- Mean change from Baseline to Month 12 in the physical component scale of the Short Form-36.
- Total Treatment Satisfaction Question for Medication Score.
- Mean change from Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Mean change from Baseline in Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity.

PRO assessment was conducted at baseline, and at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12.

## Sample size

Rather than on the primary endpoint, the sample size of 600 subjects (200 per study arm) was based on the key secondary endpoint of mean rate of gout flares. Based on a clinically meaningful 50% reduction in the rate of flares, and a coefficient of variation of 2.0 or less, a sample size of 200 subjects per treatment group provides greater than 80% power to detect this difference in gout flare rates using a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test at alpha = 0.025 (two-sided).

The primary method for imputing missing data was non-responder imputation (NRI); subjects who were missing their Month 6 sUA result were analysed as non-responders. In addition, the Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was also used to impute missing data.  Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the primary efficacy results. First, an LOCF analysis was performed for response rates at each sUA target for each visit by treatment group. To be included in the LOCF analysis, a subject had to have at least 1 post-Baseline sUA result, as only post-Baseline sUA results can be carried forward. Secondly, an observed cases analysis was conducted for response rates at each level for each visit by treatment group. Third, the proportion of subjects with an sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at all 3 of Months 4, 5, and 6 was computed. Any subject missing any 1 of the Months 4, 5, or 6 sUA levels was considered a non-responder for this analysis.

A Phase 2b study showed response rates of 70% for lesinurad in combination with allopurinol versus 30% for the allopurinol alone group. This sample size of 600 subjects provides greater than 90% power to detect a difference in response rates if the lesinurad plus allopurinol treatment groups have response rates as low as 48% versus 30% response rate and using Fisher's exact test adjusting for multiplicity with alpha = 0.025 (two-sided) for each test. Randomisation Randomisation took place across all study sites using a centralized interactive voice response system / interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Randomisation was stratified by the following factors: · Renal function at Day -7: eCrCl &gt; 60 mL/min vs. &lt; 60 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula, ideal body weight) · Tophus status: presence of &gt; 1 tophus vs. absence Blinding (masking) This was a double-blind study. Statistical methods All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of randomized study medication were included in the ITT Population. This population was used as the primary population for all efficacy analyses. The PP (per protocol) population was used for sensitivity analyses. Primary analysis: The difference in sUA response rates between the placebo and each lesinurad treatment group was tested using Cochran-Mantel Haenszel methodology, using the randomisation stratification factors. Results were summarised by treatment group and expressed as proportions, corresponding adjusted 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference between response rates, and p-values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analysis of gout flares

Only disease flares that required the use of colchicine, analgesics, and/or anti-inflammatory medication, were included in the analyses of the key secondary outcome.

The rate of gout flares requiring treatment in each of the 2 lesinurad treatment groups were compared with the placebo group using a negative binomial model.  The model included the randomisation stratification factors and the logarithm of the subject's corresponding time on-study in the interval was used as an offset variable in the model to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during which the events occurred.

Analysis of tophi Tophus measurements for subjects with ≥ 1 target tophus at Baseline were categorized based upon the best response among all measured target tophi at each visit as follows: · Complete resolution (CR; disappearance of ≥ 1 target tophus); · Partial resolution (PR; ≥ 50% decrease in the area of ≥ 1 target tophus); · Stable disease (neither ≥ 50% decrease nor ≥ 25% increase in the area of a target tophus); · Progressive disease (≥25% increase in the area of a target tophus). If any single measured target tophus showed progression at a visit, the best tophus response for that subject at that visit was progressive disease, regardless of the response of any other target tophi at that visit. Subjects with ≥ 1 target tophus at Baseline with a best response of CR of≥ 1 target tophus by Month 12 (analysed using last on-study visit), at their Month 12 Visit, and at each visit were summarized by treatment group. The primary analysis of this endpoint was based on the best response of CR of≥ 1 target tophus by Month 12. Subjects who had progressive disease at their last on-study visit and those who did not achieve a CR at their last on-study visit were considered non-responders. The difference in tophus resolution rates on the subset of subjects with measurable tophi at Baseline between placebo and each lesinurad group was tested using the CMH test statistic, stratifying by Day -7 renal function (randomized values).

The second amendment expanded guidance on subject hydration and guidance for investigators in case of raised sCr or kidney stone, and added an independent Renal Events Adjudication Committee (REAC).

Recruitment Study initiation date: 08 February 2012 (first subject first visit) Study completion date: 20 November 2014 (last subject last visit) Conduct of the study There were 3 substantial protocol amendments during the study but before breaking the blind. The first amendment reduced the sUA threshold for eligibility at day -7 (final baseline value) from ≥ 6.5 mg/dL to ≥ 6.0 mg/dL, following feedback from the FDA. The gout flare secondary endpoint was also modified, including an increase in the period of observation, which resulted in a reduced sample size. 177 randomised subjects were screened prior to this amendment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The last substantial amendment was triggered by the results of the lesinurad monotherapy study 303 in which SAEs of acute renal failure were reported in subjects receiving lesinurad. The amendment included a requirement to take allopurinol at the same time as lesinurad, to withdraw any subject developing a kidney stone, to increase monitoring of renal function and to tighten withdrawal criteria based on renal function.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common protocol violation and deviation (PDV) was randomised study medication noncompliance, affecting 7.5%, 7.5% and 4.0% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg,  and placebo groups, respectively. The next most common PDV was allopurinol dose &lt; 300 mg qd (&lt; 200 mg qd if moderate renal impairment at time of randomisation), affecting 0%, 3.0% and 2.0% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg,  and placebo groups, respectively. In addition, 2 subjects received the wrong randomised study kit at one study visit.

The study population was predominantly male and white, with a median age of 52 years. Less than 2% were over 75 years of age. Mean body mass index was 34.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration since gout diagnosis was around 12 years. At least one target tophi was present at baseline for 9% of subjects, of which the majority had only one. The mean number of gout flares reported in the past 12 months was 4.8. Moderate renal impairment (eCrCl &lt; 60 mL/min) was present at baseline for 20.9%. Those with more severe renal impairment are slightly over-represented in the placebo arm. Mean sUA at baseline was 6.9 mg/dL.

Table 31. Primary Endpoint: Proportion of Subjects with an sUA Level &lt; 6.0 mg/dL by Month 6 - NonResponder Imputation (ITT Population, Study 301) Sensitivity analyses Using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method, the proportion of subjects who achieved the target of sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6 was 61.7% and 67.5% versus 32.3% for lesinurad 200 mg qd, lesinurad 400 mg qd, and placebo arms respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). The proportion of subjects with sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at 3 consecutive study visits (Months 4, 5, and 6) using NRI for lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo were 35.3%, 49.3% and 10.4% (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). The results in the per protocol (PP) population confirmed those of the primary analysis. In the PP population, significantly more subjects in the lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg groups achieved the target goal of sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6 compared with the placebo group: 57.9% versus 28.5% (p &lt; 0.0001) and 62.9% versus 28.5% (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively. sUA secondary endpoint analyses The mean absolute and mean percentage changes for both doses of lesinurad + allopurinol were significantly greater than those for placebo + allopurinol at all time-points (p &lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons, Figure 15 ).

Analyses of subject diary entries for gout flares requiring treatment demonstrated no clear patterns of differences for duration of gout flare, pain scores, associated gout flare symptoms and gout flare treatment.

Other secondary efficacy endpoint analyses Gout flares The rates of gout flares per subject that required treatment over the 6-month period from end of Month 6 to end of Month 12 were 0.57, 0.51 and 0.58 for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. The rates for the lesinurad groups were not significantly different from the placebo group. The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare between the end of Month 6 and the end of Month 12 was 28.8%, 20.4% and 27.9% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively.

## Tophus resolution

The proportions of subjects with &gt; 1 target tophus at baseline who achieved a complete response by Month 12 were 0/18 (0%) and 4/19 (21.1%) versus 5/17 (29.4%) for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively.

## Conduct of the study

In addition to the protocol amendments described for Study 301, on 20 December 2013, the BfArM required restriction of recruitment of subjects in Germany to those who had failed to respond to all other established alternative therapies as given in national and international treatment guidelines. The Sponsor discontinued all subjects in Germany, and all German sites were closed. This affected 7 randomised subjects, who are included in the participant flow diagram (above) as discontinued (sponsor terminated study). The most common PDV was randomised study medication non-compliance, affecting 5.9%, 5.5% and 2.4% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The next most common PDV was allopurinol dose &lt; 300 mg qd (&lt; 200 mg qd if moderate renal impairment at time of randomisation), affecting 2.5% to 2.9% across the treatment groups. Baseline data The study population was predominantly male and white, with a median age of 52 years. Less than 2% were over 75 years of age. Mean body mass index was 34.1 kg/m 2 . Demographic characteristics were balanced between the groups. Demographic characteristics, baseline disease are summarised in Table 32. Table 32.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint analysis

The proportion of subjects who achieved the target of sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6 was 55.4% and 66.5% versus 23.3% for lesinurad 200 mg qd, lesinurad 400 mg qd, and placebo arms respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). Patients with missing data at month 6 were included as nonresponders.

Sensitivity analyses Using the LOCF imputation method, the proportion of subjects who achieved the target of sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6 was 62.8% and 71.1% versus 25.5% for lesinurad 200 mg qd, lesinurad 400 mg qd, and placebo arms respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). The proportion of subjects with sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at 3 consecutive study visits (Months 4, 5, and 6) using nonresponder imputation for lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo were 41.2% and 48.5% vs. 13.1% (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). The results in the Per Protocol Population confirmed those of the primary analysis. In the Per Protocol Population, significantly more subjects in the lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg groups achieved the target goal of sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6 compared with the placebo group: 57.7% and 69.6% vs. 24.2% respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). sUA secondary endpoint analyses The mean absolute and mean percentage changes for both doses of lesinurad in combination with allopurinol were significantly greater than those for placebo +allopurinol at all time-points (p &lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons, Figure 16 ).

Other secondary efficacy endpoint analyses Gout flares The rates of gout flares per subject that required treatment over the 6-month period from end of Month 6 to end of Month 12 were 0.73, 0.77 and 0.83 for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. The rates for the lesinurad groups were not significantly different from the placebo group. The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare between the end of Month 6 and the end of Month 12 was 31.3%, 30.5% and 32.2% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. Analyses of subject diary entries for gout flares requiring treatment demonstrated no clear patterns of differences for duration of gout flare, pain scores, associated gout flare symptoms and gout flare treatment. The proportions of subjects with &gt; 1 target tophus at baseline who achieved a complete response by Month 12 were 11/35 (31.4%) and 8/29 (27.6%) versus 11/33 (33.3%) for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively Medicinal product no longer authorised

There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the mean % change from baseline in the sum of the areas for all target tophi at Month 12.

- Subject with known hypersensitivity or allergy to febuxostat;
- Subject who is taking any other approved urate-lowering medication that is indicated for the treatment of gout other than allopurinol (eg, uricosuric agent) within 8 weeks of the Screening Visit;

Primary objective:

A secondary objective was to determine efficacy and safety by Month 12.

## Outcomes/endpoints

· Subject who previously received pegloticase; · Subject who previously participated in a clinical study involving lesinurad (RDEA594) or RDEA806 and received active treatment or placebo; · Subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding; · Subject with an estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula using ideal body weight. Subjects were randomised at 102 sites in 3 regions: North America (80.6%), Europe (10.3%), and Australia/New Zealand (9.1%). Treatments At the start of a 21 day run-in period (day -21), subjects discontinued their ULT (if applicable) and began taking 80 mg qd of sponsor-supplied febuxostat. At day 1, subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to: · Lesinurad 200 mg qd + febuxostat 80 mg qd · Lesinurad 400 mg qd + febuxostat 80 mg qd · Placebo + febuxostat 80 mg All subjects were to receive randomised study medication, in addition to febuxostat, for 12 months. All doses of lesinurad/placebo were taken in the morning with food and 240 mL water. Subjects were instructed to drink 2L of liquid per day. Febuxostat was taken at the same time as lesinurad/placebo. If febuxostat was interrupted, lesinurad/placebo was also stopped until febuxostat was resumed. Objectives To determine the efficacy of lesinurad by Month 6 when used in combination with febuxostat compared to febuxostat monotherapy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Primary endpoint:

- The proportion of subjects with a sUA level that is &lt; 5.0 mg/dL by Month 6.

Key secondary endpoints:

- Proportion of subjects who experience complete resolution of at least 1 target tophus by Month 12;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Proportion of subjects with a best tophus response on at least 1 target tophus of complete or partial resolution by Month 12;
- Proportion of subjects with an improvement from Baseline in HAQ-DI of at least 0.25 at Month 12.

Other sUA related secondary endpoints:

- Proportion of subjects whose sUA level is &lt; 6.0 mg/dL, &lt; 5.0 mg/dL and &lt; 4.0 mg/dL at each visit;
- Absolute and percent change from Baseline in sUA levels at each visit

Subjects were randomised after the Investigator verified that they were eligible for the study. Randomisation took place across all study sites using a centralized interactive voice response system / interactive web response system.

Other tophus related secondary endpoints: · Mean percent change from Baseline in the sum of the areas of all target tophi at each visit; · Proportion of subjects whose sUA level is &lt; 6.0 mg/dL, &lt; 5.0 mg/dL and &lt; 4.0 mg/dL at each visit. Other gout flares related secondary endpoints: · Mean rate of gout flares requiring treatment for the 6 month period from the end of Month 6 to the end of Month 12; · Proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare at monthly intervals between Month 6 and Month 12. Sample size Approximately 315 subjects were to be randomized in this study, of which approximately 105 subjects were to be randomized to each treatment group. Based on previous studies of lesinurad and febuxostat, it was conservatively assumed that the proportion of subjects with sUA &lt; 5.0 mg/dL after 6 months of treatment would be 40% or less in the placebo plus febuxostat group and 65% or higher in the lesinurad plus febuxostat groups. Detecting a significant treatment effect under these assumptions with approximately 90% power and α = 0.025 (two-sided) required 105 subjects per treatment group using Fishers exact test. Randomisation Subjects were randomised to the 3 treatment groups in the ratio 1:1:1. Randomisation was stratified by: · Renal function at day -7: eCrCl &gt; 60 mL/min vs. &lt; 60 mL/min (calculated by the CockcroftGault formula using IBW) · SuA at Day -7: ≥ 6.0 mg/dL versus &lt; 6.0 mg/dL Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study.

## Statistical methods

These were similar to those used in Studies 301 and 302.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Diverse sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the primary endpoints.

Subgroup analyses were performed in subjects that did not already achieve the target sUA &lt; 5mg/dL after the 3 weeks open-label lead-in of febuxostat monotherapy.  Additional sensitivity analyses were either different approaches of missing data (LOCF, Per-Protocol population, Observed Cases), different cut-off points of sUA (&lt;3,4,6 mg/dL at Month 6), or endpoints reflecting a more sustained effect on sUA levels ((a) sUA &lt; 5 mg/dL at Month 4,5,6 consecutively or on at Month 12, subjects with a median sUA level &lt;5 mg/dL throughout the study), or the immediate effect (&lt; 5 mg/dL at Month 1).

## Conduct of the study

There were 4 substantial protocol amendments during the study but before breaking the blind. The first clarified that a dose reduction of febuxostat to 40 mg qd following interruption due to potential toxicity was not permitted. No subjects were randomised prior to this amendment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With the second , the sUA inclusion criterion was lowered from &gt; 10 mg/dL to &gt; 8 mg/dL for subjects not taking an approved ULT at screening. The gout flare secondary endpoint was also modified, including an increase in the period of observation. 80 patients were randomised prior to this amendment.

The other two were the same as the ones applied to Studies 301 and 302 regarding expanded guidance on hydration and the tightening of renal function monitoring triggered by the results in Study 303.

The most common PDV was randomised study medication non-compliance, affecting 2.8%, 7.3% and 0.9% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg,  and placebo groups, respectively.  5.5% of subjects were excluded from the per protocol population. Baseline data The study population was predominantly male and white, with a median age of 54 years. Around 3% were over 75 years of age. Mean body mass index was 32.0 kg/m 2 . Demographic characteristics were balanced between the groups and summarised in Table 35 . Table 35. Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population, Study 304) Medicinal product no longer authorised

The mean duration since gout diagnosis was around 15 years. The mean number of target tophi at baseline was 1.8. The mean number of gout flares reported in the past 12 months was 6.7. Moderate renal impairment (eCrCl &lt; 60 mL/min) was present at baseline for 23.1. Baseline sUA was &lt;5.0 mg/dL for more than 50% of all subjects: 44.3%, 53.2% and 53.2% in the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo  groups respectively.

## Primary efficacy endpoint analysis

The results of the primary efficacy endpoint are presented in Table 37 . Patients with missing data at month 6 were included as non-responders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The difference between the lesinurad 400 mg qd and placebo groups was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001).  However for lesinurad 200 mg qd vs. placebo, the difference was not statistically significant.

Sensitivity analyses Using the LOCF imputation method, the proportion of subjects who achieved the target of sUA &lt; 5.0 mg/dL at Month 6 was 64.1% for lesinurad 200 mg vs. 50.9% for placebo (p=0.0377). For the lesinurad 400 mg group the proportion was 83.0% (p&lt;0.0001 vs. placebo). The proportion of subjects with an sUA &lt; 5.0 mg/dL at 3 consecutive study visits (Months 4, 5, and 6) using nonresponder imputation was higher in the lesinurad 200 mg group compared with the placebo group (51.9% versus 33.0%, respectively; p = 0.0034), and in the lesinurad 400 mg group compared with placebo (64.2% versus 33.0%; p &lt; 0.0001). The results in the Per Protocol Population confirmed those of the primary analysis. In the Per Protocol Population, significantly more subjects in the lesinurad 400 mg group achieved the target goal of sUA &lt; 5.0 mg/dL at Month 6 compared with the placebo group: 80.0% vs. 58.8% (p &lt; 0.0001). The respective proportions for the comparison of lesinurad 200 mg with placebo was 58.8% vs. 48.1% (p = 0.1001). sUA secondary endpoint analyses At all time-points other than Month 6 (primary endpoint), the increase in sUA lowering in the lesinurad 200 mg group, compared to placebo, was statistically significant, Figure 18 .

In accordance with the hierarchical testing schedule, the key secondary endpoints were not formally tested for the 200 mg dose, as the primary endpoint failed. For the 400 mg dose, the formal testing stopped right after the first key secondary tested, as this one failed to meet statistical significance

In the lesinurad 200 mg group, 23/59 (39%), achieved this target compared to and 27/51 (52.9%) and 6/51 (11.8%) of the subjects treated with lesinurad 400mg and placebo respectively. The differences in the proportions were 0.27 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.42), p = 0.0013 for lesinurad 200 + febuxostat and 0.41 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.57), p &lt; 0.0001 for lesinurad 400mg + febuxostat compared to placebo + febuxostat.

## Other secondary efficacy endpoint analyses

## Tophus resolution

The proportions of subjects who achieved a complete response for at least one target tophus by Month 12 were 25.5% and 30.3% versus 21.1% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. Results were similar for proportions achieving a complete or partial response (56.6% and 58.7% versus 50.5%, respectively).

By Month 12, reductions in the sum of the areas of all target tophi were observed in all groups. The mean % change from baseline at 12 months was 55.8% and 57.9% vs. 31.3% for lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively (observed cases). The differences between both lesinurad groups and placebo were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).

## Gout flares

The rates of gout flares per subject that required treatment over the 6-month period from end of Month 6 to end of Month 12 were 1.4, 0.7 and 1.2 for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. The rate for the lesinurad 400 mg group was statistically significantly lower than placebo (p&lt;0.05). The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare between the end of Month 6 and the end of Month 12 was 42.0%, 31.2% and 38.9% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. Analyses of subject diary entries for gout flares requiring treatment demonstrated no clear patterns of differences for duration of gout flare, pain scores, associated gout flare symptoms and gout flare treatment.

This was the first secondary endpoint in a hierarchical procedure. As the result was negative, no further secondary endpoints can formally be tested. authorised |                                                                                                      |                               |

Clinical studies in special populations The submitted clinical studies in gout patients included low numbers of elderly (aged 75-84); over 85 year olds were excluded. The proportion of women was also low. No studies have been conducted in children; a paediatric waiver has been granted on the grounds of safety. Subjects with renal impairment and hepatic impairment were studied during Phase 1. Subjects with moderate renal impairment were also included in adequate numbers in Phase 3. Supportive studies Long-term extension studies Study 306 (add-on to allopurinol) Of the 1213 subjects enrolled and randomized in Study 301 or Study 302, 718 were enrolled in Study 306, representing 59.2%. A total of 244 subjects who had received placebo were re-randomized to lesinurad 200 mg (n = 122) or 400 mg (n = 122). For the interim analyses, 281 subjects in the LESU 200 mg + ALLO group and 275 subjects in the LESU 400 mg + ALLO group completed the full 12 months in the extension study, which was 45.8% of all subjects originally randomized in Studies 301 and 302. Adding lesinurad to previous placebo nearly doubled the proportion of subjects that achieved the sUA target at all time-points in Study 306 (from 27.3% to 38.8% in placebo period to 61.3% to 75.9% when lesinurad was initiated. The response to prior lesinurad treatment was maintained in in the maintenance phase ( Figure 21 ). Figure 21.

Study 307 Of the 324 subjects enrolled and randomized in Study 304, 235 (72.5%) subjects completed 12 months of treatment with randomized study medication , and 196 subjects (60.5%) were enrolled in Study 307. A total of 67 subjects who had received placebo and febuxostat in Study 304 were randomized to receive either lesinurad 200 mg (n = 33) or 400 mg (n = 34). For the interim analyses, 72 subjects and 80 subjects after lesinurad 200 or 400 mg dose completed the full 1 year in the extension study, representing 46.9% of all subjects originally randomized in the pivotal Study 304. The percentage of patients with complete resolution increased from Month 12 to 24 from 26.6 to 53.1% for the 200 mg dose, and from 35.4% to 58.5% for the 400 mg dose (ITT population). The flare rate also continued to decrease to a low level as illustrated in Figure 22. Figure 22.

## Monotherapy Studies

## Exploratory monotherapy Study 202

Monotherapy was explored in gout patients in Study 202, a 4 weeks randomised controlled multicentre study, with 4 study arms (lesinurad 200/400/600 mg and placebo). In total 127 subjects were randomised (1:1:1:1 ratio) The proportions of subjects achieving sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL at Day 27 were 7.4%, 27.6%, and 44.8% in the LESU 200, 400, and 600 mg groups, respectively, and 0% in the PBO

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group (p &lt; 0.01 for the LESU 400 and 600 mg groups when compared with PBO, but the difference for LESU 200 mg was not statistically significant). The incidence of elevated creatinine levels (&gt; 1.5 times x baseline) was approximately two-fold higher in the LESU groups compared with PBO, but remained under 10%. Elevations were usually mild and resolved after discontinuation. No SAEs were reported.

## Monotherapy Study 303

Study 303 was a confirmatory randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of lesinurad monotherapy in gout patients, who were intolerant of or had a contraindication to an XO-inhibitor. A total of 214 subjects were randomized to lesinurad (107 in each study arm), of which 162 (72 on lesinurad and 90 on placebo) completed the 6-month treatment period. Non-responder imputation was applied for missing data.

The Applicant responded that in clinical practice, despite prescribing information allowing for allopurinol daily doses of up to 900 mg for more than 5 decades in Europe, evidence from multiple studies shows that few patients (&lt; 4%) are prescribed allopurinol doses higher than 300 mg daily. Retrospective analyses showed that 2.1% of 7,443 patients in the United Kingdom (UK), and 3.4% of 4006 patients in Germany received &gt; 300 mg/day of allopurinol (Sarawate 2006, Annemans 2008). An electronic medical record-based pharmaco-epidemiologic study of gout patients, known as International Comorbidity and Resource Utilization Study of Gout (ICARUS), was conducted by the Applicant to assess disease control and comorbid conditions, health resource use, and healthcare costs in the US and Europe. The ICARUS study reported that only 3.7% of 19,886 patients with gout in the UK had

By Month 6, significantly more subjects in the lesinurad 400 mg group achieved the target goal of sUA &lt; 6.0 mg/dL compared with the Placebo group: 29.9% versus 1.9%, respectively (difference 28%, 95% CI 19-37, p &lt; 0.0001). In comparison to placebo, the lesinurad group had a higher proportion of subjects with kidneyassociated TEAEs (23.4% versus 3.7%), kidney- associated TEAEs leading to discontinuation of randomized study medication (11.2% versus 0.9%), and kidney-associated SAEs (5.6% versus 0%). 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies The clinical efficacy was supported by 3 Phase 3 pivotal studies (301, 302 and 304) investigating lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase) inhibitor for the treatment of gout. The Phase 3 program included both the 200 mg qd and 400 mg qd doses, both as monotherapy, and in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. However the applicant is not seeking approval for the 400 mg qd dose level, or for a monotherapy indication, due to renal safety considerations (see also Section 2.6, Clinical Safety of this Report). The primary efficacy endpoint for the pivotal studies is considered a surrogate endpoint. During a CHMP scientific advice procedure, it was agreed that sUA lowering could be an acceptable primary endpoint for the pivotal lesinurad studies. Lesinurad is intended for gout patients with hyperuricaemia despite adequate urate lowering monotherapy. In studies 301 and 302, subjects were required to take allopurinol at a medicallyappropriate dose for at least 8 weeks prior to screening. In study 304, subjects were eligible irrespective of the sUA response to 3 weeks of febuxostat 80 mg daily. The CHMP noted that in these, only 7% of subjects were taking more than 300 mg daily of allopurinol at baseline and no patients received febuxostat 120 mg daily at baseline. The Applicant was therefore requested to provide further justifications that the patient populations in the clinical trials were representative of the target population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recorded doses of allopurinol &gt; 300 mg, with even lower percentages with recorded daily allopurinol doses &gt; 300 mg in both France (0.3% of 6,293 patients) and Germany (0.5% of 34,963 patients (Ardea Biosciences, data on file, 2015). These studies indicate that across Europe and the US, allopurinol 300 mg is the highest dose used by approximately 95% of patients, and doses of allopurinol &gt; 300 mg are seldom used. In Studies 301 and 302 pooled, 7.1% (86 of 1,213) of subjects were on doses of allopurinol &gt; 300 mg, which is greater than that observed in the studies using electronic medical records.

In Studies 301 and 302, a minimal allopurinol dose of 200 mg was permitted if patients had moderate renal impairment, as dose adjustments are recommended in this group based on potential side effects (Stamp 2012). Across both studies, 7.1% of subjects were receiving &gt; 300 mg of allopurinol, which is nearly twice the proportion of patients in clinical practice receiving allopurinol doses &gt; 300 mg (Sarawate 2006, Jennings 2014). Conservative allopurinol dosing in renal-impaired patients has been recommended, with previous studies showing that approximately 75% of renal-impaired patients take doses &lt; 300 mg/day (Jeyaruban 2015). Across Studies 301 and 302, greater than 60% (147 of 224) of subjects with moderate renal impairment were taking allopurinol 300 mg daily. The plasma exposure levels of allopurinol 300 mg in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency is comparable to 600 mg allopurinol plasma exposures levels observed in patients with normal renal function (Hande 1984). Thus, in effect, 232 patients (19.1%) of subjects across Studies 301 and 302 could be considered as receiving doses &gt; 300 mg allopurinol because they were taking actual doses &gt; 300 mg or had plasma exposures significantly &gt; 300 mg allopurinol due to comorbid moderate renal impairment. Evidence shows that few patients are prescribed febuxostat in Europe, and when febuxostat is prescribed, it is predominantly at the recommended 80 mg daily dose with limited prescribing of the 120 mg dose. Data from the IMS Midas database, a well-established and widely used data source from IMS Health for global pharmaceutical and prescribing data, show that &lt; 5% of urate lowering therapy prescriptions are for febuxostat. Across Europe in 2014, of those receiving febuxostat, 92% of standard unit sales were for 80 mg tablets versus 8% for 120 mg tablets (IMS Health, MIDAS, MAT 4Q 2014). These results were corroborated by data from the ICARUS pharmaco-epidemiologic study, which shows that few patients in Europe receive febuxostat at any dose (2.2% of all XO inhibitor use) and in these patients on febuxostat, &lt; 10% were prescribed a dose of 120 mg (82 of 893 [9%] in France, 26 of 382 [7%] in Germany, and 1 of 90 [1%] in the UK). Thus, &lt; 1% of all prescriptions for XO inhibitors was for febuxostat 120 mg daily.  The CHMP considering this information considered that the patient populations in the lesinurad clinical trials were representative of the target population. In study 301 and 302, subjects were eligible if sUA was &gt; 6.5 mg/dL at screening (sUA &gt; 6.0 mg/dL at day -7). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study 304, subjects were eligible irrespective of the sUA response to 3 weeks of febuxostat 80 mg daily. However, a pre-defined subgroup of sUA &gt; 5.0 mg/dL could be considered non-responders to febuxostat, although the febuxostat dose was inadequate. In fact around 50% of subjects in study 304 had sUA &gt; 5.0 mg/dL at baseline. The applicant however provided additional analyses for the subgroup with sUA &gt; 6.0 mg/dL at baseline, in order to allow comparison with the outcomes of studies 301 and 302.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## Lesinurad in combination with allopurinol

Clinically relevant, as well as statistically significant, sUA lowering was demonstrated for lesinurad 200 mg qd or 400 mg qd in combination with allopurinol, compared to allopurinol alone. The effect was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consistent across sub-groups, including subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects receiving more than 300 mg allopurinol daily. The sUA lowering effect of lesinurad, in addition to allopurinol, is maximal by 1 month, and sustained throughout the 12 month study period.

## Lesinurad in combination with febuxostat

Although the primary endpoint was not met for the 200 mg qd dose, Month 6 was the only timepoint at which the proportion meeting the sUA target was not significantly different from placebo. The proportions achieving sUA &lt; 5.0 mg/dL were more strongly in favour of lesinurad at Month 12, and at Months 4, 5 and 6 combined. Furthermore, the sub-group of subjects with &gt; 5.0 mg/dL at baseline despite 3 weeks of febuxostat monotherapy would be expected to benefit the most from combination therapy. For this sub-group, the proportions with sUA &lt; 5.0 mg/dL at Month 6 were 44.1% vs. 23.5% (p&lt;0.05) for the lesinurad 200 mg group vs placebo respectively.

In allopurinol non-responders, the additional treatment of lesinurad provided a significant and sustained reduction of sUA levels below the treatment target of &lt; 6.0 mg/dL or lower. The CHMP acknowledged that as this was a surrogate endpoint, the clinical relevance of this effect was not clear as the improvement of flares and tophi reduction compared to placebo after 12 months was not statistically significant. However, the long-term efficacy data after 24 months of treatment, provided sufficient evidence of a clinical effect with continuous decline of the tophi load and flares.

Therefore, in subjects not responding to monotherapy with febuxostat 80 mg qd, there is evidence that lesinurad 200 mg qd as add-on provides additional sUA lowering that is clinically relevant. Due to modest baseline sUA levels across all the trials, it was unclear whether lesinurad is sufficiently effective in more resistant patients (e.g. sUA levels &gt;7-8mg/dl). However, the Applicant provided additional analyses to demonstrate that the combination of lesinurad with an XO inhibitor is efficacious in more resistant subjects, including those with higher Baseline sUA levels. More than twice the proportion of subjects achieved target sUA goals with the addition of lesinurad 200 mg even in the more resistant subjects with higher Baseline sUA. It should be noted that Baseline sUA levels in the pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy studies reflect the effect of treatment with an XO inhibitor. In Studies 301 and 302, Baseline sUA reflects at least 8 weeks of physician determined, medically appropriate dose allopurinol ( ≥ 300 mg to 800 mg to 900 mg; ≥ 200 mg for moderate renal impairment). In Study 304, the Baseline sUA reflects 3 weeks of Sponsor-supplied febuxostat 80 mg daily. The CHMP concluded that the efficacy of lesinurad in these patients had been adequately demonstrated. Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that the initially proposed indication by the Applicant for the chronic treatment of hyperuricaemia in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat in gout patients when additional therapy is warranted, did not adequately reflect the intended second line treatment option for lesinurad. To more clearly reflect this the CHMP recommended that lesinurad should be indicated in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, for the adjunctive treatment of hyperuricaemia in gout patients (with or without tophi) who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone. 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

The additional effect of lesinurad 200 mg on top of febuxostat 80 mg was modest. However a relevant effect was shown in a subgroup of non-responders to febuxostat which reflects the intended use of lesinurad as an add-on therapy in patients not achieving target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The clinical safety was supported by clinical studies of lesinurad monotherapy as well as combination therapy, and including doses greater than or equal to 200 mg qd. The Phase 3 core combination studies (301, 302 and 304) were placebo-controlled and provide the pivotal safety data. An updated Safety Report was also submitted to provide updated safety data from Studies 301, 302 and 304 with a data cut-off of 4   November 2014.

Renal safety was a particular focus due to the mechanism of action of lesinurad. Cardiovascular safety was also a particular concern for the gout patient population.

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was appointed to monitor potential safety signals during the Phase 3 clinical trial program. In addition, two independent and blinded Adjudication Committees were established,, one for review and adjudication of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CEAC), and one other for the adjudication of Renal Events (REAC).  The Adjudication Committees classified the seriousness of renal and CV events, and the likelihood whether the case were drug-related. Patient exposure The global lesinurad clinical development program included 3010 subjects (healthy volunteers and patients), 2586 of whom received at least 1 dose of lesinurad across all studies. In the Phase 2/3 clinical development program, 1799 patients with gout were exposed to lesinurad at 1 or more doses (948 subjects exposed to 200 mg qd, 1070 subjects exposed to 400 mg qd, and 132 subjects exposed to 600 mg qd). A total of 1224 subjects were exposed (any dose) for approximately 6 months (at least 24 weeks), and 919 were exposed for approximately 1 year (at least 48 weeks). Maximal exposure to lesinurad was approximately 3 years. The total exposure to lesinurad + XOI combination was 1093.8 patient-years. The primary safety evaluation is based on data from the three pivotal randomised placebo-controlled trials (Studies 301 and 302 and Study 304) evaluating the efficacy and safety of lesinurad 200 mg and 400 mg qd in combination with an XO inhibitor for 12 months. Additional safety data from the ongoing Phase 3 extension studies (Studies 306 and 307) of these 3 main studies were submitted. Supportive safety data from the Phase 3 monotherapy program (Studies 303 and its OLE 305) and the Phase 2 studies (Studies 202 and 203) were also submitted. Demographic characteristics in the primary safety evaluation dataset are summarised in Table 47. Table 47.

## Adverse events

Adverse events were more common for the combination of lesinurad + a XO-inhibitor, than placebo + XO-inhibitor ( Table 48 ). The overall incidence of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was similar between the 200mg dose and placebo but higher for the 400 mg dose.

For monotherapy with the 400 mg dose, the overall rate of AEs was similar as reported for the combination, although these occurred in a shorter time frame: 77.6% within 6 months for monotherapy versus 79.8% in 12 months for the combination. The incidence of AEs was lower for placebo in the monotherapy study (65.4%), possibly as no background therapy with a XOI was provided. Of note, the rate of withdrawal of the study drugs due to AEs was considerable higher for monotherapy (18.7% versus 5.6% placebo), than the same dose in the XOI-combination studies (9.4% vs 5.4% placebo). Monotherapy with the 200mg dose was not evaluated. The AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) of the main confirmatory 12-months add-on trials are summarised in Table 49 . Table 49.

Adverse Drug Reactions were identified from the core, placebo controlled periods of Studies 301, 302 and 304, based on the comparative incidence of TEAEs. More specifically ADRs were considered those which were observed at incidences &gt;2% for subjects in the lesinurad 200 mg + XOI group and &gt;1% higher compared to the PBO + XOI group ( Table 51 ). Table 51. Adverse Events Occurring in ≥ 2% of Lesinurad 200 mg Treated Patients and at Least 1% Greater Than Seen in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies in Combination With an XO Inhibitor In addition, the Applicant considered Renal Failure, Renal Impairment and Nephrolithiasis as potential adverse events, because of the mode of action of lesinurad, which could cause local renal toxicity and uric acid crystals due to hyper-saturation of uric acid in the nephron. Analysis of these events is described in detail in under the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Adverse events in Phase 3 monotherapy studies

For the Phase 3 monotherapy study (303), the incidence of any TEAE was 77.6% and 65.4% in the lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. For any Grade 3 or 4 TEAE, the respective rates were 16.8% and 3.7%. For 'at least possibly related TEAEs', the respective rates were 29.9% and 10.3%.

In contrast to the pooled combination data, there were increased rates of TEAEs for lesinurad 400 mg compared to placebo in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC overall (77.5% vs 35.2%), mainly driven by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

diarrhoea, nausea and constipation. There were increased rates of TEAEs for lesinurad 400 mg compared to placebo in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC overall, and particularly for renal impairment and renal failure. This was also reflected in the Investigations SOC (see Section 4.5).

When the Phase 3 monotherapy extension data is considered (study 305), the pattern of TEAEs is in line with that observed in the core phase. Regarding the SOC Renal and urinary disorders , there were 5 new reports of renal impairment, 4 new reports of renal failure and 6 new reports of PTs related to renal calculus.

When considering Grade 3 or 4 toxicities reported for the Phase 3 monotherapy study (303), the exposure-adjusted incidences were 41.2 events per 100 PY vs. 8.8 events per 100 PY in the placebo group. This difference was explained mainly by increased rates of renal failure, renal failure acute and blood creatinine raised. A similar pattern was observed when extension data (study 305) was included. System Organ Classes (SOCs) of special interest are discussed below in detail. SOC Renal and Urinary Disorders REAC-adjudicated events The Renal Events Adjudication Committee (REAC) reviewed pre-defined renal events (AEs in the SMQ for acute renal failure that were serious or led to discontinuation of randomised study medication) as well as all increases in sCr &gt; 1.5 x baseline. Review and adjudication were blinded to treatment allocation. For the Phase 3 core combination studies, the proportion of subjects with any adjudicated event was 6.5%, 14.9% and 3.3% in the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. Of the events adjudicated, the proportion with at least one confounding factor with a moderate of high level of contribution were 36.1%, 33.3% and 44.4% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups. Resolution of a sCr elevation was defined as a value ≤ 1.2 x Baseline following an elevation. This was based on the intra-subject variability of baseline sCr values of approximately 22%. Estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula, using baseline age and ideal body weight. Other routine measurements were serum electrolytes. Urine was routinely monitored for glucose, ketones, occult blood, and protein. Protein-creatinine ratios were provided for subjects with sCR elevations. Renal events The rate of renal events increased with the dose, and was considerably higher in lesinurad monotherapy, versus XOI-combination therapy. Most frequently reported adverse event was Blood Creatinine Increased, followed by renal impairment ( Table 52 ). Table 52.

The incidence of renal events was generally higher in elderly subjects, in those with lower Baseline renal function (eCrCl &lt; 60), and in those with tophi at Screening.

In the pivotal XOI-combination trials, two-fold sCR elevations were reported in nine (1.8%), and 34 subjects (6.7%) in lesinurad 200 and 400 mg treatment groups, respectively, versus 0 in the Placebo arm. At lesinurad 200 mg dose, 88.9% (8/9) elevations were reported to be resolved, 66.7% (6/9) without interruption of lesinurad. The 400 mg dose, 80.0% (32/40) of these elevations were reported to be resolved, and 57.5% (23/40) without interruption of lesinurad. In the 200 mg dose arm, about 50% of the two-fold sCr elevation was resolved within 14 days, however, time to recovery was significantly longer for the 400 mg dose ( Table 53 ).

Creatinine clearance In the pivotal XOI-combination trials, the 400 mg dose was associated with a decline of eCrCl of -2.4% in Month 1 that remained stable to Month 12. No declining trend was observed for the 200 mg dose or placebo. There were 2 subjects who had shifts in Protein-Creatinine ratio exceeding &gt;1.0 mg/mg together with sCr elevations, indicating tubular dysfunction (incomplete tubular reabsorption of proteins). Both cases occurred at the 400 mg dose. No trends of abnormalities were observed for electrolytes or urinary parameters like proteinuria. Table 53.

## Long-term renal safety (24 months follow-up)

Lesinurad was more frequently associated with renal events than placebo by baseline renal function, in a dose dependent manner ( Table 54 ). Lesinurad was also associated with an increased incidence of serum creatinine elevations 1.5 times baseline, most of which gradually resolved after treatment withdrawal.  The incidence rate of renal events slightly increased at longer-term follow-up for the 200 mg dose (see Table 55 below). However, this was not the case for the 400 mg dose.

Mean CrCL remained stable over 24months follow-up from baseline for the 200 mg dose. However, the mean CrCL slightly decreased with -2.77 ml/min from baseline for the 400 mg dose.

## SOC Cardiac Disorders

Case reports of CV adverts were sent to the Cardiovascular Endpoints Adjudication Committee (CEAC), to adjudicate their CV origin. Deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke were classified as MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events). Non-MACE categories were pre-defined as Unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization, Urgent cerebral revascularization (nonelective), Congestive heart failure with hospitalization, Arrhythmia not associated with ischemia,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Venous and peripheral arterial thromboembolic event, Transient ischemic attack, and remainder category 'Other CV events'.

Baseline CV risk factors in the study population

According to the protocols, patients with hypertension and a history of cardiac disorder were eligible, provided that the disease and symptoms were adequately controlled, and the patient was in a reasonable physical condition (NYHA criteria I-II).  Over 75% of the subjects had ≥ 1 CV comorbidity or CV risk factor at Baseline ( Table 56 ).

In addition the majority of subjects had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2  (67.4% and 71.0% in the placebo and total lesinurad groups, respectively). About 17% of the total study population had a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2, with similar distribution over the treatment arms. Overall, the rates of subjects with adverse cardiac events were reported to be similar for Placebo and lesinurad (3.3% (n=17) and 4.3% (n=22) for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, versus 3.9% (n=20) Placebo). However, about 60 % of these cases were reported to be severe for lesinurad (12/17 and 14/22 for the 200 mg and 400 mg dose, respectively), versus 10% in placebo (2/20). Table 56.

Additional univariate analyses revealed pre-existing cardiovascular disease, moderate renal impairment, and age ≥65 years to be highly significant predictors of MACE irrespective of treatment ( Table 59 ).

Fifteen (1.0%) subjects from the pivotal trials were identified as MACE cases ( Table 58 ), including three (0.6%) subjects with 4 events (3 nonfatal strokes, 1 nonfatal MI) in the placebo group, four (0.8%) subjects with 4 events (2 nonfatal MIs, 2 CV deaths) in the lesinurad 200 mg group, and eight (1.6%) subjects with 9 events (7 nonfatal MIs, 2 CV deaths) in the lesinurad 400 mg group.

Combined analysis were scheduled of parameters that had both a p &lt; 0.1 difference in distribution in the 3 treatment groups (e.g. placebo, lesinurad 200 mg or lesinurad 400 mg) and a p &lt; 0.3 association with MACE events. However, a combined analysis was not performed because there were no baseline parameters that met these pre-specified p-value criteria. Exploratory univariate analyses per treatment allocation indicated that patients with a history of CV disorders, the risk of MACE was higher in lesinurad groups (7.0-7.6%) than in the placebo group (1.9%, Table 60 ).

Furthermore, the observed cardiovascular mortality rate in lesinurad-treated subjects (0.48/100 PYE;) in the pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy studies was in the expected range based on data obtained in an analysis of gout patients in the UK (matched for age, gender, and other key entry criteria), which was performed by an independent epidemiologist. Results of this analysis indicated a predicted total mortality and ischemic heart disease event rates of 1.17/100 PYE and 1.2/100 PYE, respectively.

## SOC Hepatobiliary disorders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hepatobiliary safety was considered of special interest, as DILI (drug induced hepatotoxicity) has been reported for benzbromarone, another uricosuric drug with the same mode of action as lesinurad.

At routine monitoring, there were no notable differences in liver enzymes increments in the lesinurad treatment arms versus placebo. In addition, no cases of DILI (meeting Hy's law) were observed for lesinurad in the total safety database.

AEs of the Hepatobiliary disorders domain were slightly more frequently reported for lesinurad (2.3% for the 200mg dose, 1.5% for the 400mg dose and  1.2% for Placebo), with hepatic steatosis and biliary events (including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis , bile duct stone, cholecystitis) as the most common reported events in this category. Moreover, three hepatobiliary events including acute cholecystitis and bile duct stone were classified as Serious Adverse Events for lesinurad, but none for placebo. However, at long-term follow-up for 24 months, no increasing trend of hepatobiliary disorders or signals of bile duct hyperplasia-was observed.

SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders The overall incidence of this SOC was 8.8% for 200 mg dose, 9.8% for 400 mg dose, and 7% for placebo. This difference was mainly attributed to a higher incidence of the PT Type 2 Diabetes (10 subjects (2.0%) &amp; 8 subjects (1.8%) for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, versus 3 subjects (0.6%) for placebo), and the PT Diabetes Mellitus (7 subjects (1.4 %) &amp; 3 subjects (0.6%) for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, versus 2 subjects (0.4%) for placebo). Notably, dehydration was also reported more frequently for active treatment (4 cases (0.8%) and 5 cases (1.0%) versus 2 cases (0.4%) for placebo). Moreover, two dehydration cases for active treatment were considered serious, versus none for Placebo. SOC Gastrointestinal disorders : GI disorders were commonly reported (18% 200 mg dose, 20.2% high 400 mg dose, and 17.2% for placebo). Gastro-intestinal intolerability was common in the preclinical studies at high doses. Except for Gastro-oesophagal Reflux (2.7%, 1.4% versus 0.8%) and Abdominal Discomfort (2.7%, 1.4% versus 0.8%), no obvious trends of GI intolerability were observed in the Phase III studies (diarrhoea 4.5%, 5.3% versus 4.5%; nausea 4.5%, 5.3% versus 4.5%; Constipation 2.2%, 2.0% versus 1.7%, for Low Dose (200 mg), High Dose (400 mg) versus Placebo). SOC Investigations: Overall, the rate of positive investigations was higher for the 400 mg dose (23.3%), versus the lower lesinurad 200 mg dose (16.6%) and placebo (17.8%). This was mainly caused by over-reporting of blood creatinine increments for the High lesinurad dose (7.8%), versus 4.3% for the low dose, and 2.3% for placebo. Serious adverse events and deaths The overall incidence of SAEs was lower for the 200 mg group than for the placebo group in the pivotal randomised trials, but increased in the 400 mg group ( Table 61 ).

## Laboratory findings Haematology screening

The incidence of renal SAE was twice as high at 400 mg dose as compared to placebo (1.6% versus 0.8%), whereas none occurred at the recommended 200 g dose. The renal SAEs included renal failure and nephrolithiasis. The causes of SAE were quite heterogeneous in the placebo arm. However, for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, the far most common SAE was a cardiac disorder, in contrast to placebo (2.0% (10 subjects) and 2.7% (14 subjects), versus 0.4% (2 subjects) for placebo. Myocardial infarction, coronary disorders and congestive heart failure were the most common reported SAE's for lesinurad. Deaths In total, 13 deaths were reported. Eleven deaths were adjudicated by the independent assignment committee CEAC as a MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event). The remaining 2 deaths were due to non-cardiovascular causes (suicide and gastric cancer). All the deaths occurred in male subjects, with the youngest being 37 years old (pulmonary thromboembolism) and the oldest being 78 years old (pulseless electrical activity). None of the deaths were considered to be treatment-related by the CEAC. Notably, all fatal MACE cases occurred on active treatment with lesinurad, and none on placebo. Six fatal MACE cases (five on combination therapy, one on monotherapy) occurred in the 6-12 months placebo-controlled period in the randomised studies, versus 0 in the corresponding placebo arms (pooled Study 203, 301, 302, 303, 304). Another three fatal MACE cases occurred shortly (7-48 days) after the patients switched from prior 12 months of placebo to active treatment. The two remaining fatal CV cases occurred on continued use of lesinurad in the open-label extension period after the 12 months blind-phase. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The following haematology parameters were routinely monitored: Haematocrit, Haemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, erythrocyte count, and White Blood Cell count (differential). Overall, the post-Baseline shifts to abnormal values was low and similar between treatment arms (&lt;2%), and the mean levels of these parameters remained stable over the observed treatment period.

## Clinical chemistry screening

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Routine screening was performed of ALT, AST, bilirubin, direct bilirubin, sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, CK, and lipids (cholesterol, and triglycerides). No notably difference was observed.

Enhanced creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels were reported frequently, but were equally distributed over treatment arms (4.5, 5.9 and 4.8% for the 200/400 mg lesinurad and placebo groups respectively).

## Vital signs

| no   |
|------|

The incidence of cardiac disorders was 8.6% in the placebo group, 9.8% in the lesinurad 200 mg group, and 9.8% in the lesinurad 400mg group.

No  notable  differences  were  reported  for  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  at  routine  monitoring.  The changes from baseline were reported at a similar rate among  lesinurad and placebo (data not shown). No other meaningful signals of abnormal investigations were observed. E.g. liver enzyme increments were rarely reported, at an equal rate for active treatment or placebo. Safety in special populations Renal patients For the subgroup of subjects with moderate renal impairment at baseline (CrCl &lt; 60 mL/min), a higher rate of TEAEs compared to the rates observed in the overall population was observed, not in favour of lesinurad ( Table 62 ). Table 62. Incidence of TEAEs in renal impaired subjects (Study 301, 302 and 304) No trend of increased renal risk was observed for lesinurad in patients with moderate renal impairment (10.5% in the placebo group versus 7.8% in the lesinurad 200 mg and 7.6% in the 400 mg lesinurad group) in the 12 months placebo-controlled phase of the studies. This was also confirmed by longerterm follow up data till 24 months. At prolonged treatment till 24 months in the extension phase, there were mean increases of CrCL from baseline at the lesinurad 200 mg dose level. Three case reports of renal failure requiring dialysis emerged in the open-label extension phase for the 200 mg dose. These were not considered treatment-related, and occurred long-term after discontinuation of lesinurad. One case was described as a complication of acute cardiac failure.

## Elderly

In the pivotal XOI-combination studies, 14.1% and 13.1% of subjects in the placebo and total lesinurad groups were ≥ 65 years of age, and 1.7% and 2.0% were ≥ 75 years of age, respectively. Subjects ≥ 65 years of age had a higher incidence of Cardiac Disorders compared to subjects &lt; 65 years of age across all treatment groups including placebo (8.8%-11.7% (lesinurad 200-400 mg) vs 12.3% placebo in elderly, and 2.6-3.0% versus 2.5% in placebo group, in subjects &lt; 65 year). There

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were no signals of enhanced risk of renal events with increasing age. The subgroup ≥ 75 years of age was too small to draw final conclusions.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Lesinurad has been shown to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 based on in vitro data and clinical DDI studies. To investigate implications for safety, the applicant submitted a pre-planned analysis of the impact of lesinurad on concomitant CYP3A4 substrates during Phase 3, specifically anticholesterol ( Table 63 ) and anti-hypertensive medications ( Table 64 ).

Discontinuation due to adverse events Core phase 3 combination studies (301, 302 and 304) During the core Phase 3 combination studies, the rates of randomised study medication discontinuation due to an AE were 6.3%, 9.4% and 5.4% in the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively.

Phase 3 combination extension studies (306 and 307)

Overall, there was no change in the pattern of exposure-adjusted rates of discontinuation compared to the core studies. For the Renal and urinary disorders SOC there were additional TEAEs leading to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuations during the extension phase: 5 in the lesinurad 200 mg group and 4 in the lesinurad 400 mg group.

## Monotherapy studies

The exposure-adjusted rates of discontinuation of randomised study medication were significantly higher for the lesinurad 400 mg group compared to placebo during the core monotherapy study (303): 48.5 per 100 PY vs. 13.2 per 100 PY. This was predominantly due to a higher rate of discontinuations for lesinurad in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, including PTs for renal failure, renal impairment and calculus. During the extension study (305), there were a further 7 TEAEs in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, in addition to the 9 reported in the lesinurad 400 mg group during the core study. There were also an additional 5 reports of Blood creatinine increased which led to discontinuation in the extension phase, in addition to the 2 reports in the lesinurad 400 mg group of the core study. During the extension study, there was a new TEAE of hypersensitivity leading to discontinuation of lesinurad. During the Phase 2 monotherapy study (202), there were 2 AEs leading to discontinuation, including a report of Blood creatinine increased in the lesinurad 400 mg group. During the extension phase of study 202, a further 6 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported, including 4 reports of Blood creatinine increased.

In three 12-month placebo-controlled trials of lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor versus placebo, serum creatinine elevations between 1.5-fold and 2-fold over baseline occurred in 3.9% of patients on lesinurad 200 mg, 10.0% of patients on lesinurad 400 mg and 2.3% on placebo; serum creatinine elevations 2-fold or greater over baseline occurred in 1.8% of patients on lesinurad 200 mg, 6.7% of patients on lesinurad 400 mg and 0% on placebo. These serum creatinine elevations generally resolved, most without treatment interruption. Renal-related adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with lesinurad 200 mg (5.7%) and lesinurad 400 mg (11.8%) compared to placebo (4.5%), resulting in discontinuation of treatment in 1.2%, 3.3% and 1%, respectively. The most frequent renal-related adverse reaction was blood creatinine increased (4.3% with lesinurad 200 mg and 7.8% with lesinurad 400 mg compared to 2.3% with placebo).

2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety Patient exposure The safety population was sufficiently large to draw conclusions regarding the presence of common adverse events. The CHMP noted that the over 75s were relatively under-represented in the clinical safety database and this is reflected in the SmPC which states that therapeutic experience in patients 75 years and older is limited. Caution should be used when treating these patients. Renal safety Because of lesinurad's mode of action which causes an increase in renal uric acid excretion, and may lead to transient increases in serum creatinine, renal-related adverse reactions and kidney stones renal function and signals of renal damage were routinely monitored throughout the study program. In general, the incidence of renal AEs in the main XOI-combination studies increased with the dose (i.e. 5.7% at the 200 mg dose and 11.8% for 400 mg dose, versus 4.5% at placebo), and further increased in lesinurad monotherapy (17.8% for the 400 mg dose). Furthermore, the renal adverse events were more severe in the 400 mg dose group and in monotherapy, with higher frequencies of renal SAE (14.7%, respectively), when compared to the 200 mg dose. No renal SAE were reported for the 200 mg dosing regimen, and the renal cases consist primarily of laboratory abnormalities without clinical evident symptoms, which resolved without treatment discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP therefore recommended that the dose is limited to 200 mg, and that lesinurad must be coadministered at the same time as the morning dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, i.e. allopurinol or febuxostat, as a precautionary measure to prevent urinary uric acid overload. Lesinurad dosing must be interrupted if treatment with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor is interrupted.

To further minimise the potential for renal adverse events the CHMP recommended that renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of lesinurad and monitored periodically thereafter, e.g. 4 times per year, based on clinical considerations, such as baseline renal function, volume depletion, concurrent illness or concomitant medications. Patients with serum creatinine elevations to greater than 1.5 times the baseline value should be closely monitored. Lesinurad treatment should be interrupted if serum creatinine is elevated to greater than 2 times the pre-treatment value or in case of an absolute serum creatinine value greater than 4.0 mg/dL. Treatment should also be interrupted in patients who report symptoms that may indicate acute uric acid nephropathy including flank pain, nausea or vomiting, and measure serum creatinine promptly. Finally, lesinurad should not be restarted if another explanation for the serum creatinine abnormalities cannot be deducted. The CHMP recommendations are reflected in the SmPC.

In addition, the CHMP requested that the safety and efficacy of lesinurad in patients with moderate renal impairment with CrCl 30-45 mL/min should be further investigated and the Applicant has included a study in the RMP in order to address this request.

Renal safety of lesinurad use in patients with a history of moderate or severe renal impairment In patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was similar across all treatment groups: lesinurad 200 mg (12.7%), lesinurad 400 mg (16.3%) and placebo (13.3%). Serious renal-related adverse reactions, e.g. acute renal failure and renal impairment, were reported in patients treated with lesinurad 400 mg (1%) and placebo (0.4%) but not in patients on lesinurad 200 mg. Including the combination long-term extension studies, the incidences of serious renal-related adverse reactions (including acute renal failure) per 100 patient-years of exposure were 0.4 and 1.4 for lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, respectively. Data from the long-term open-label Phase 3 extension studies revealed a renal safety profile consistent with that observed in the pivotal placebo-controlled studies. The totality of the long-term safety dataset does not suggest that treatment with the low dose of lesinurad would induce severe renal damage at the long term. Although there was a slight increment of the incidence rates of the 200 mg dose at longer term follow-up till 2-3 years, this was not observed for the 400 mg dose. Most AEs consisted of mild and temporary increments of serum creatinine. Neither a signal of deterioration of the mean creatinine clearance, nor a signal of proteinuria was observed in the 200 mg dose group after 2 years' of follow-up. More importantly, no significant deterioration of renal function was noted in patients with mild-moderate renal impairment at baseline. However, given that experience with lesinurad in patients with an estimated CrCL less than 45 mL/min is limited, the CHMP recommended that lesinurad should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min), end stage renal disease, kidney transplant recipients or patients on dialysis and used with caution in patients with a CrCL from 30 mL/min to less than 45 mL/min.

## Cardiovascular safety

Cardiovascular co-morbidities are common in gout patients, and this was also reflected by the study population, which had a high prevalence of hypertension, obesity and diabetes.

The overall cardiac events reporting rates were similar among placebo and the lesinurad treatment arms. However, cardiac events were 5-7 times more frequently reported as a SAE for the lesinurad

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment, in comparison with placebo. Not only the severity, but also the nature of the cardiac events was different, with more cases of myocardial infarction and cardiac fatalities for lesinurad, and primarily arrhythmia cases in the placebo arm. In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled combination therapy clinical studies, the incidences of patients with adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) per 100 patientyears of exposure were: 0.71 (95% CI 0.23, 2.21) for placebo, 0.96 (95% CI 0.36, 2.57) for lesinurad 200 mg, and 1.94 (95% CI 0.97, 3.87) for lesinurad 400 mg, when used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. However, the CHMP considered that a causal relationship with lesinurad and these events was not established, especially as all patients with a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event treated with lesinurad 200 mg had a history of heart failure, stroke or myocardial infarction.

The following TEAEs were reported with an incidence &gt; 1%, and more commonly for lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg compared to placebo: influenza, headache, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux and  blood creatinine increased. The incidence of serious infections requiring hospitalisation was similar between lesinurad and placebo. No viral infections like herpes zoster were reported, indicating that the immune system was not compromised. Overall, the CHMP considered that these safety issues were sufficiently addressed by listing influenza, headache, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux and blood creatinine increased in the ADR table of section 4.8, and that no additional warnings were required in this respect.

Furthermore, the observed cardiovascular mortality rate in lesinurad-treated subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy studies was in the expected range based on data obtained in an analysis of gout patients in the UK (matched for age, gender, and other key entry criteria), which was performed by an independent epidemiologist. Results of this analysis indicated a predicted total mortality and ischemic heart disease event rates of 1.17/100 PYE and 1.2/100 PYE, respectively in these patients. These rates are similar to the observed rates in lesinurad-treated subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy studies. Nevertheless, CHMP noted that lesinurad has not been studied in patients with unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or with a recent event of myocardial infarction, stroke, or deep venous thrombosis within the last 12 months and therefore considered that lesinurad treatment is not recommended in these patients. For cardiovascular patients in a stable condition, the benefit/risk balance should be assessed for each individual patient on an ongoing basis, taking into account the benefits of lowering urate levels versus a potential increase in cardiac risk. In addition, to further characterise the cardiovascular risks associated with lesinurad use, especially in patients at high risk, such as those with a history of cardiovascular events, the CHMP recommended that the Applicant should conduct an observational study post-authorisation and that this study should be a condition of the marketing authorisation. Hypertension was the most frequently cardiovascular reported adverse event in the lesinurad cores studies, with a higher incidence in the 200 mg and 400 mg groups compared to the placebo group (6.1% and 6.9% versus 4.8%, respectively). However the CHMP noted that in the more informative 'Hypertension Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ)', which includes terms such as blood pressure increased and blood pressure systolic increased the difference in the incidence of these events was greatly reduced with very small differences between the recommend 200mg dose and the placebo groups (6.5% and 6.2%, respectively). The CHMP therefore recommended that hypertension should not be considered an ADR and therefore is not included in the product's SmPC. Other Adverse Events Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other potential adverse events that the CHMP noted was dehydration, which was reported as serious AEs for lesinurad only, and three cases of chronic pyelo-nephritis in the 400 mg dose arm. Considering the mode of action of lesinurad, causality could not be excluded for this adverse event and the CHMP recommended that dehydration should be listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the SmPC states that patients should be instructed to stay well hydrated (e.g. 2 litres of liquid per day) whilst on lesinurad treatment.

In preclinical models, drug-induced bile duct hyperplasia was observed. A small number of cases of hepatobiliary events were reported for lesinurad. However, there was no increasing trend of hepatobilary after 24 months follow-up.

Available data also point towards an increased risk of severe cardiac events including myocardial infarction and fatalities in patients with a prior history of CV events.  Since cardiovascular co-morbidity is common in the intended target population, the CHMP considered that that any potential increase in cardiovascular risk could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk balance of lesinurad. The CHMP therefore recommended that the risk of CV events in association with lesinurad use should be further evaluated through a post-authorisation safety study which should be a condition of the authorisation.

Enhanced creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels were reported frequently, but were equally distributed over treatment arms (4.5, 5.9 and 4.8% for the 200/400 mg lesinurad and placebo groups respectively). The CHMP considered that this could be explained by the co-medication colchicine, which was administered to about 85% of the study population to prevent ULT-induced flares, and which is known to induce CK. Patients with severe hepatic impairment As there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment, the CHMP noted that no dose recommendations can be made for these patients. However, the CHMP also considered that there is currently no urgent need for additional PK studies in this population, as severe hepatic impairment is rare in gout patients, and the PK studies in moderate hepatic impairment did not indicate a significant effect. Drug-drug Interactions Based on available in vitro and clinical data the CHMP concluded that mild induction of CYP3A by lesinurad may reduce plasma exposures of co-administered medicines that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A. In the pivotal clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients using lipid lowering or antihypertensive medications that were CYP3A substrates required concomitant medication change when treated with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, compared with patients treated with placebo in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (35% versus 28%, respectively). In Section 4.5 of the SmPC stipulates that the possibility of reduced efficacy of concomitant medications that are CYP3A substrates should be considered and their efficacy (e.g. blood pressure and cholesterol levels) should be monitored. 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety The use of lesinurad is associated with the risk of hyper-saturation of uric acid in the urine, which may be damaging to the renal tissue. However, it has been shown that this risk can be largely attenuated by precautionary measures, such as a limitation of the lesinurad dose to 200 mg, and the concurrent use of XO-inhibitors. In addition, routine monitoring of the renal function is proposed in the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Meanwhile, adequate warnings have been included in the SmPC to use lesinurad with caution in stable CV compromised patients -and not to use lesinurad in patients with unstable and recent CV disorders, as there is no experience in this group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other adverse drug drugs associated with lesinurad used were headache, influenza, increased blood creatinine and gastric reflux. These events were in general mild and did not lead to treatment withdrawal and are considered manageable with routine risk minimisation measures, and are reflected in the SmPC.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

In order to investigate the cardiovascular risk in association with lesinurad exposure, mainly in patients with a history of cardiovascular disorders, the Applicant shall conduct and submit the results of an observational prospective study according to an agreed protocol.

## Beneficial effects

Lesinurad as an add-on therapy to allopurinol or febuxostat, has shown a robust an sustainable sUA lowering effect in patients with insufficient response to allopurinol or febuxostat alone, at the aimed lesinurad 200 mg daily dose.

In two identically designed randomised trials in patients who did not receive their sUA treatment target level after 10 weeks of allopurinol 300 mg or more, 54.8% in the lesinurad 200 mg group and 25.6%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint of sUA &lt; 6 mg/dL in Month 6 (difference versus placebo: 29% (95% CI: 23-36), pooled data Study 301+302). The sUA lowering effect below the target of 6 mg/dL was sustainable, as shown by higher percentage of subjects that achieved a sUA level &lt; 6 mg/dL in Month 4,5,6 -the primary endpoint for other ULT product approved by the CHMPand in Month 12, in favour of lesinurad (see benefits-risks table below). In those subjects who continued treatment for 24 months (about 45% of the randomised population), the percentage of subjects experiencing flare rates decreased to approximately 0-5% at Month 12, without the help of colchicine prophylaxis.

Furthermore, in a randomised trial in gout patients with visible tophi at baseline (Study 304), the addition of lesinurad 200 mg to febuxostat 80 mg lead to a significant increment of responder rates of sUA &lt; 5 mg/dL in month 6, in a subgroup of patients who did not already achieve this sUA target level after 3 weeks lead-in treatment of febuxostat 80 mg monotherapy (44.1% versus 23.5%, difference 21% (95% CI 3, 38). In long-term extension Study 307, the total tophi area continued to decline from baseline till 24 months by -70%. The percentage of patients with complete resolution of tophi steadily increased from 26.6% at Month 12, to 53.1% at Month 24 for lesinurad 200 mg + febuxostat. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects Although the primary endpoint of lowering sUA below the target level was met for lesinurad , the clinical relevance of this surrogate outcome was not supported by some secondary endpoints regarding gout flares, tophi resolution, which were not statistically different from placebo at Month 12. Only the 200 mg dose is proposed in the labelling, because of renal safety reasons. A higher response was noted for the 400 mg dose regarding the primary endpoints, i.e. the proportion of patients achieving the target sUA level at Month 6. However, the long-term efficacy data after 24 months of treatment, provided sufficient evidence of a clinical effect with continuous decline of the tophi load and flares. The additional effect of lesinurad 200 mg on top of febuxostat 80 mg was modest. However a relevant effect was shown in a subgroup of non-responders to febuxostat which reflects the granted indication of lesinurad as an add-on therapy in patients not achieving target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone. Risks Unfavourable effects Renal Due to the uricosuric mechanism of action of lesinurad, there is a potential risk of hyper-saturation of uric acid in the urine (i.e. hyperuricosuria) associated with its use, which could lead to renal toxicity events. The trials submitted in support of this application, demonstrated that limiting the lesinurad dose to 200 mg and administering in combination with a XOI the risk of renal events can be greatly reduced. Most renal related adverse events consisted of sCr elevations, which often resolved without treatment interruption. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Serious events like e.g. acute renal failure and nephrolithiasis rarely occurred (lesinurad 200 mg + XOI 0% versus 0.4% XOI + Placebo); nephrolithiasis (0.6% vs 1.7%). Furthermore, the long-term followup database of 24 months indicate that renal function (mean CrCL) remained stable from baseline for the 200 mg dose treatment group, whereas a small decline was noted for the 400 mg dose arm. Only 1.2% left the study prematurely, because of renal adverse events in the low dose group. Moreover, recovery was delayed at the higher dose. At lesinurad 200 mg dose, 50% of the sCr elevations were reported to be resolved within two weeks, often without treatment interruption of lesinurad. In contrast, about 60% of the sCr increment cases did not recover within a month for the 400 mg dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Renal adverse events could occur at any time during lesinurad treatment. In the SmPC, it is recommended that renal function will be monitored 4 times a year, based on clinical considerations, such as prior renal function of the patient, volume depletion, concurrent illness or concomitant medications. Patients with serum creatinine elevations to greater than 1.5 times the pre-treatment value should be closely monitored.

## Cardiovascular

Although the overall rates of cardiac AEs were similar between study treatment arms, an imbalance was noted regarding cardiac Serious AEs in a dose dependent way (lesinurad 200 mg 2.0%, lesinurad 400 mg 2.7%, Placebo 0.4%). The incidence of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) increased with the dose: (0.71 (95% CI 0.23, 2.21) per 100 patient- years for placebo, 0.96 (95% CI 0.36, 2.57) for lesinurad 200 mg, and 1.94 (95% CI 0.97, 3.87) for lesinurad 400 mg, when used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

The clinical data from patients in the low range of moderate renal impairment (i.e. CrCl 30-45 ml/min) were sparse (26 were randomised to lesinurad 200 mg, and 29 to the 400 mg dose). Clinical data in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 ml/min) are lacking. A contra-indication regarding the use of lesinurad in patients with severe renal impairment has been included in the SmPC. In addition, the safety and efficacy of lesinurad in these patients will be further evaluated in a phase 4-randomised double-blind, placebo controlled study as described in the RMP.

Special populations Renal impaired patients Renal impairment is common in gout. About 20% of the study population had moderate renal impairment (&lt; 60 ml/min) at baseline. Notably, no trend of increased renal risk was observed for lesinurad as compared to placebo in patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (10.5% in the PBO + XOI group versus 7.8% in the LESU 200 mg + XOI group and 7.6% in the LESU 400 mg + XOI group). Long-term safety has been established as well, considering that a small trend of improvement of CrCl (+1.99 ml/min, SD 8.9) was observed in the subgroup with moderate renal impairment at baseline, after two year continued treatment with lesinurad 200 mg. Cardiovascular patients Post-hoc analyses in a subgroup of 162 cardiovascular compromised patients at baseline, showed that the incidence of MACE was 7.6% (4/53) for lesinurad 200 mg compared to 1.9% (1/52) for placebo. A warning has been included in the SmPC, that lesinurad should be used with caution in stable cardiovascular compromised patients, and should not be used at unstable CV conditions. Elderly In the pivotal XOI-combination studies, about 14% of the subjects were ≥ 65 years of age. Elderly had a higher incidence of cardiac disorders compared to subjects &lt; 65 years of age across all treatment groups including placebo (8.8%-11.7% (lesinurad 200-400 mg) vs 12.3% placebo in elderly, and 2.63.0% versus 2.5% in placebo group, in subjects &lt; 65 year). There were no signals of enhanced renal risks in elderly. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Special populations Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is also no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. This has been adequately addressed in the RMP where further information in these patients will be collected post-marketing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with unstable or severe CV patients (e.g. NYHA class III-IV), were excluded from the trials and therefore there is no experience about the magnitude of risks in these patients. Therefore, a strict warning has been included in the SmPC that lesinurad treatment is not recommended in these patients. Moreover, a post-authorisation study will be performed to further evaluate CV risks. Due to the high rates of CV co-morbidities in this population any increase in the CV risk could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk balance of Zurampic and therefore the CHMP considered that this study should be a condition of the authorisation.

There was limited experience in very elderly. Only 34 subjects were older than 74 years of age. This is included as missing information in the RMP and appropriate warnings in the SmPC about the limited experience with lesinurad treatment in this population.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Lesinurad in combination with a XOI, promptly and robustly reduced the sUA below the treatment target level in (tophaceous) gout patients, who were insufficient responders to allopurinol or febuxostat. Efficacy of lesinurad has been confirmed in patients with a limited uricosuric capacity at baseline, secondary to moderate renal impairment or the use of thiazide diuretics.

The size of the tophi and the flare rates continued to decrease at treatment prolongation till 24 months. In those subjects who continued treatment for 24 months, the percentage of patients with flares decreased to nearly zero, without the help of colchicine prophylaxis.

Due to its mode of action, lesinurad may cause hyper-saturation of uric acid in the urinary tract, and as a consequence renal damage. A small signal of serious cardiovascular complications was noted for lesinurad in a dose-related way. Post-hoc subgroup analyses in cardiovascular compromised patients at baseline showed that the incidence of MACE was numerically higher for lesinurad than placebo. Benefit-risk balance Discussion on the benefit-risk balance Benefits Lesinurad 200 mg in combination with a XOI effectively reduced the sUA levels in gout patients who did not achieve their sUA treatment targets with allopurinol or febuxostat alone. The sUA lowering effect of lesinurad was prompt and robust. The responder rates of patients achieving their target sUA level (&lt;5-6 mg/dL) were double those compared to placebo. No apparent tolerance to its pharmacodynamic effects on the URAT-1 receptor occurred, since efficacy was maintained throughout the 12 months placebo-controlled period and thereafter. Clinical relevance of the treatment effect Although lesinurad significantly reduce sUA levels, no clear clinical benefits were shown regarding the reduction of flares and tophi at Month 6 and 12. This may be due to the fact that the introduction of urate lowering therapies like lesinurad, initially increase the flare rates. It is thought that a sudden reduction of the sUA levels causes dissolution of the uric acid crystals, which may trigger an inflammatory host response. Another reason may be carry-over effect of colchicine, an antiinflammatory drug, which was given as a flare prophylaxis for 5 months in the trials. This may have limited the difference between lesinurad and placebo at the 12-months endpoint. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with complete resolution of tophi steadily increased from 26.6% at Month 12, to 53.1% at Month 24. A lower tophus burden is expected to lead to a reduced number of flares. The mean percentage of patients who experienced a flare decreased to nearly zero, at longer term treatment till 24 months, without the help of colchicine prophylaxis. This could be considered as a clinically relevant reduction. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risks

## Renal safety

Because of its mode of action to promote the urinary excretion of UA, hyperuricosuria may occur. High level of UA in the urinary system may cause local damage and nephrotoxicity. It was noted in the Phase III program that lesinurad monotherapy and at the high 400 mg dose, were more commonly associated with an increased risk of renal related events, than at the use of the low 200 mg dose in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination with a XOI. Concurrent use of XOIs, which act by reducing the endogenous production of UA, diminish the urinary UA load and consecutively the occurrence of high peak UA levels and renal toxic events. Based on these findings, the lesinurad dose was limited to 200 mg, and lesinurad have to be taken together with a XOI. In addition, routine monitoring of the renal function should be applied throughout treatment.

## The use of lesinurad in renal impaired patients

Thus far, there is limited experience in patients with moderate renal impairment CKD Stage 3b (eCrCl 30 to 45 mL/min)). A warning regarding the limited experience in patients with a CrCl 30-45 ml/min is reflected in the SmPC which states that lesinurad should be used with caution in this group. However, considering the complicated PK-PD relationship of lesinurad in renal impairment and the observed heterogenicity in PK-PD, safety and efficacy will be further established in this special group in the postmarketing setting.

Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL &lt; 30/min) were excluded from the trials, and the use of lesinurad in this special population is contra-indicated in the SmPC. Cardiac safety A signal of increased CV events like myocardial infarction in a dose dependent fashion was observed in association with lesinurad use. It is noted that gout patients are a population at risk of CV events, and more than 60% of the study population had one or more risk factors like obesity, or were treated for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or diabetes at baseline.  However, the background risk could not fully explain the occurrence of MACE in the lesinurad trials, since known risk-factors like a prior history of CV events, renal impairment and high age, were equally distributed over the study arms. Moreover, post-hoc analyses showed that the risk of MACE was higher for lesinurad than placebo in patients with a prior history of CV events at baseline. Overall, the number of MACE cases in the trials was considered low to draw definitive conclusions regarding the exact magnitude of CV risk with lesinurad, and another study in a larger population will be performed in post-authorisation setting to address this concern. In addition, the potential cardiovascular risks have been adequately addressed by limiting the maximum recommend dose to 200 mg and warnings in the SmPC against the use of lesinurad in CV compromised patients. 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Zurmapic in adults for the adjunctive treatment of hyperuricaemia in gout patients (with or without tophi) who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Medicinal product no longer authorised
