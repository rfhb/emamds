## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that lowers blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of the once-daily dosing in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension results in a significant reduction of sitting, supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, usually with a small or no orthostatic change. The usual starting dose of telmisartan is 40 mg once-daily. This dosage reduces the  SBP/DBP  by  an  average  of  11.3/7.3  mmHg,  with  80  mg  this  average  is  13.7/8.1  mmHg.  The antihypertensive activity occurs within two hours after single-dose administration and is maintained for the full 24-hour dosing interval.

The  proposed  type  II  variation  was  submitted  in  compliance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  EC  No 1901/2006 and proposed updates for sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC to include information on paediatric use of the products. To support the proposed amendments to the SmPC with regard to use in  children  and  adolescents,  the  MAH  conducted  a  prospective,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled, four weeks of treatment trial (study 502.403) in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telmisartan in children and adolescents (6 to &lt;18 years of age) with hypertension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  further  aimed  to  characterise  the  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  telmisartan  in paediatric patients treated over four weeks with single, daily doses of telmisartan in order to detect possible  differences  in  its  pharmacokinetics  between  children/adolescents  and  adults,  as  well  as between children (6 to &lt;12) and adolescents (12 to &lt;18).

The proposed amendments of the Product Information are identical for all three telmisartan containing medicinal products (Micardis, Pritor, Kinzalmono) and therefore are submitted through a worksharing procedure:

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been established.

Currently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not been established. No data are available.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

….

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been established.

The blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in hypertensive patients aged 6 to &lt; 18 years (n = 76) after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 30 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week treatment period. After adjustment for age group effects and baseline SBP values an average placebo-corrected SBP change from baseline (primary objective) of 8.5 mm Hg was observed in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg group, and a -3.6 mm Hg SBP change was found in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg group. The adjusted and placebo-corrected DBP changes from baseline were 4.5 mm Hg and -4.8 mm Hg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg groups, respectively. The change was dose dependent. The safety profile appeared generally comparable to that observed in adults.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

…

## Special Populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in hypertensive patients (n = 57) aged 6 to &lt; 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steadystate of telmisartan in children and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the study was too small for a meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of age, the results are generally consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the nonlinearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax.

## 2.2. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 2.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The  pharmacokinetics  of  two  doses  of  telmisartan  was  assessed  as  a  secondary  objective  in  a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study 502.403 in hypertensive patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aged 6 to &lt;18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment period. The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  characterise  the  steady-state  PK  of  telmisartan  in  paediatric  patients treated over 4 weeks with single, daily doses of telmisartan to detect possible differences in the PK of telmisartan  between  children/adolescents  and  adults,  as  well  as  between  children  (6  to  &lt;12)  and adolescents (12 to &lt;18). The PK set comprised a total of 60 patients; in 57 of these PK parameters could  be  derived.  The  following  table  describe  the  distribution  of  these  patients  within  each  dose group:

| 7          | 20          | 7          | 23          |

## Pharmacokinetic parameters:

- Cmax,ss (maximum concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval);
- Cmin,ss (minimum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval);
- Cpre,ss (predose concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state immediately before administration of the next dose);
- Cavg (Average concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state);
- tmax,ss (time from dosing to maximum concentration at steady state);
- AUCtau,ss (area under the concentration time curve of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval);
- t1/2,ss (terminal half-life of the analyte in plasma at steady state);
- MRTpo,ss (mean residence time of the analyte in the body at steady state);
- CL/F,ss (apparent clearance of the analyte in the plasma after extravascular administration at steady state);
- Vz/F,ss (apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase λ z following an extravascular dose at steady state);
- PTF (peak trough fluctuation).

High inter-individual variability and considerable overlap between the 1 and 2 mg/kg dose groups were seen  i  hypertensive  children  and  adolescents  for  the  two  main  exposure  parameters  AUCτ,ss  and Cmax,ss. The median time to reach peak concentrations was short for both dose strengths. Steady state t1/2 was on average 28.1 h for 1 mg/kg and 27.2 h for 2 mg/kg. There was a trend to nonlinearity with the increase in dose resulting in higher then dose proportional Cmax and AUC and at the same time a decrease in CL/F,ss from 745 to 608 mL/min. Comparison of PK parameters of telmisartan after  multiple  oral  administration  of  1  mg/kg  or  2  mg/kg  telmisartan  for  4  weeks  among  the  two different groups of patients with hypertension (children (6 to &lt;12 years) and adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years))  was  also  performed.  Children  (6  to  &lt;12  years)  could  not  be  distinguished  from  adolescent patients (&gt;12 to &lt;18 years) regarding dose normalised AUCτ,ss,norm and Cmax,ss,norm at the low dose of 1 mg/kg. At the dose of 2 mg/kg, children had a higher AUCτ,ss,norm and Cmax,ss,norm than adolescent patients. At the 2 mg/kg dose CL/F,ss and Vz/F,ss was lower in hypertensive children but there  was  no  difference  found  within  the  age  groups.  However,  in  general,  none  of  these  younger patients (age 6 - &lt;12) had AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss levels exceeding those of the adolescent group.

The  non-linearity  in  PK  seemed  more  pronounced  for  the  younger  aged  group  (6  to  &lt;12  years), especially for Cmax,ss, while for the adolescent hypertensive patients group, Cmax,ss increased nearly in  a  dose  proportional  manner.  There  is  a  trend  to  non-linearity  for  AUCt,ss  when  the  dose  was doubled from 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg, for both groups, but is more evident for adolescents. The CL/F,ss seemed  to  be  less  affected  by  the  increase  in  dose  in  the  adolescent  patient  group.  However,  in previous reports dosages in adults were not weight adjusted. Looking at the absolute dosages, four paediatric patients at the high dose strength of 2 mg/kg had a body weight of ≥90 kg. Since the 2 mg/kg dose was limited to an absolute dose of 120 and 160 mg for younger aged patients and patients aged between 12 and &lt;18 years, respectively, patients, with a body weight of ≥90 kg did in some case not receive the full 2 mg/kg  dose. The non-linearity might have been, therefore, slightly underestimated. This could also explain the fact that for adolescent patients the non-linearity almost diminished for the dose normalized AUCτ,ss (AUCτ,ss, norm).  No significant correlation between age and the PK parameters AUCτ,ss or Cmax,ss was found. The conducted study 502.403 confirmed the non-linearity  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  telmisartan,  especially  for  Cmax,ss.  This  observation  is consistent with findings in adults where the non-linearity in telmisartan PK was mainly related to Cmax and thus absorption/first-pass processes. The difference in the telmisartan PK between the two age groups in this pediatric patient population was modest, mostly limited to Cmax,ss (referred to dose normalized Cmax,ss,norm) and the high dose of 2 mg/kg.

Comparison with historical data in the adult population: Results obtained from the study 502.403 were compared with historical adult PK data from trials 502.202 and 502.203. In trial 502.202, PK analysis was conducted in 114 male and female adult hypertensive patients who were treated with doses of 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, or 120 mg/day over 28 days. A dose of 160 mg/day was administered to adult hypertensive patients in trial 502.203 and plasma concentrations (pre-dose (Cpre,ss) and one hour after drug administration (C1h,ss) were assessed after several treatment intervals. The C1h,ss and Cpre,ss at Day  28  of  continuous  dosing  from  the  actual  trial  in  adolescents  receiving  2  mg/kg  were,  thus, comparable to the historical data in adults. The comparison of PK parameters among the two different dose  groups  (1mg/kg  or  2  mg/kg)  in  paediatric  patients  and  adults  is  summarised  in  the  following tables:

On the basis  of  the  results  shown  above,  the  MAH  stated  that,  taken  into  account  the  known  high inter-individual  variability  in  PK  parameters,  the  exposure  in  the  paediatric  hypertensive  patient population  in  this  study  was  comparable  to  exposure  in  an  adult  patient  population.  The  MAH  also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stated that, although the study was small for a meaningful assessment of the PK of children under 12 years  of  age,  the  results  are  generally  consistent  with  the  findings  in  adults  and  confirm  the  nonlinearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax.

## 2.2.3. Discussion

Although the MAH concluded that considering the high inter-individual variability in PK parameters, the exposure  in  the  paediatric  hypertensive  patient  population  was  comparable  with  that  in  adults,  the number of patients in the younger age group (6 to &lt;12 years) is smaller than that in the adolescent group, making the comparison between the two age group not completely reliable. In addition, due to this difference in group size, the pooling of data in the 6 to &lt;12 group for the comparison with the adult  population  is  not  considered  adequate  for  a  correct  evaluation  of  the  differences  between  the paediatric  and  adult  populations.  Study  population  is  largely  overweight/obese.  The  influence  of overweight/obesity on PK parameters has not been investigated. Thus, conclusion on the transferability  of  PK  data  obtained  in  this  patient  population  to  the  general  European  hypertensive paediatric patient population in the normal weight range is not considered possible.

## 2.3. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The primary objective of study 502.403 was to assess the blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) over a four-week treatment period, to assess the safety and tolerability of the two doses of telmisartan and to determine potentially effective doses for paediatric patients for future studies. The secondary objectives included determination of the steady state PK of telmisartan  in  children  aged  6  to  &lt;18  years;  comparison  of  plasma  PK  parameters  for  telmisartan among children in two age groups (6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to &lt;18 years); and determine if age-related differences.  The  main  inclusion  criteria  were:  Male  or  female,  ages  6  to  &lt;18  years;  hypertensive patients: systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 95th  percentile  for  age,  height,  and  gender  based  on  the Fourth  Report  on  the  Diagnosis,  Evaluation,  and  Treatment  of  High  Blood  Pressure  in  Children  and Adolescents; weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg.

The study consisted of a two-week washout period followed by a four-week double-blind phase. Dosing was determined by body weight, after the patient was stratified by age and randomised to a specific dose level (1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg) or to receive placebo. The maximum dose in the telmisartan 'low dose' group was 60 mg for children (6 to &lt;12 years old) and 120 mg for adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years old). In the telmisartan high dose group the maximum dose was 120 mg in children and 160 mg in adolescents.

The CHMP noted that study investigated two dosages of telmisartan (TEL) per kg of body weight: 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, defined as low and high, respectively. Considering that mean weight was above 70 kg in all arms, both dosages were substantially higher than the usual dosage in adults (40 mg/day). Thus, the reasons underlying the choice of these dosages in the paediatric age are not clear. The MAH should justify the dose in the paediatric patients. Given that even the low dosage was actually high, the conclusions of the study could be reliable for the safety (AEs incidence should be lower with lower doses) but are of limited value for efficacy. This view shared by the MAH who concluded that data are not sufficient to recommend the treatment of hypertension with TEL in individuals with age &lt;18 years and do not represent a reliable basis for dosage regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) at the end of four  weeks  of  treatment.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  change  from  baseline  in  seated diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  at  the  end  of  four  weeks  of  treatment  and  blood  pressure  response defined as &lt; 95th percentile at the patient's final visit based on age, height, and gender. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), ECG, changes from baseline in pulse rate, changes in laboratory  parameters.  However,  the  study  did  not  include  the  list  of  laboratory  parameters  which were  monitored.  This  is  an  important  point;  the  lack  of  information  preclude  a  complete  safety evaluation. The CHMP believes the calculation of power and sample size was adequate.  Furthermore, the applied statistical analysis appears acceptable because the report includes non-adjusted result. A total of 77 patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups (Placebo, telmisartan 1 mg/kg, or telmisartan 2 mg/kg). There were two protocol amendments.

The CHMP noted that the rate of discontinuation was slightly higher in the Telm 2mg/kg group (22.6% of patients), compared to patients in the placebo group (12.5%). The study was conducted in Brazil, Mexico and US. A large majority of the study population consists of overweight/obese patients enrolled in Brazil, Mexico and US. It is questionable if these patients represent the current European population of  hypertensive  children  and  adolescent.  No  information  is  given  about  the  selection  criteria  with regard  to  possible  causes  of  high  blood  pressure  and  possible  co-morbidities.  The  lack  of  this information precludes the possibility to assess if efficacy and safety differed by and/or were dependent on the clinical characteristics of the patients.

## 2.3.2. Results

The primary finding from this trial is the effectiveness of telmisartan 'high dose' (i.e. telmisartan 2 mg/kg)  on  lowering  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  at  the  end  of  four  week  treatment  period.  After adjusting the age group effect and baseline SBP values in the ANCOVA model, the average change of SBP  from  baseline  in  the  telmisartan  'high  dose'  group  was  -14  mmHg.  In  comparison  with  the placebo group, the difference was -8.5 mmHg with the confidence interval of (-14, -3) mmHg. It is statistically significant at alpha=0.05 with p-value of 0.0027. The average change of SBP from baseline in the telmisartan 'low dose' group was -9.7 mmHg. The difference between telmisartan 'low dose' group  and  placebo  group  was  -3.6  mmHg,  which  is  statistically  insignificant  with  the  confidence interval  of  (-9.2,  1.9)  mmHg  and  p-value  of  0.193,  but  clinically  significant.  With  the  hierarchical testing procedure, statistical significance was achieved for the telmisartan 'high dose' group only for SBP.

Adjustment for age group and baseline SBP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both age by treatment and gender by treatment interaction effects were insignificant in the analyses of covariance models. However, relatively significant reduction in SBP among the age 12 to 18 years old patients was observed in the telmisartan 'high dose' group. In this age group, the average difference of the change from baseline in SBP between telmisartan 'high dose' group and placebo group was 10.28 mmHg in contrast to the younger age group of -1.99 mmHg.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included: change from baseline in seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the end of week 4, and blood pressure response defined as both SBP and DBP &lt;95th percentile at the patient's final visit based on age, height and gender. There was no statistical significance in either the telmisartan 'high dose' or 'low dose' groups at the alpha level of 0.05 (p value= 0.0511, 0.0725) for the change from baseline in DBP at the end of Week 4.

The reduction in the telmisartan 'high dose' group was -8.4 mmHg and -8.1 mmHg in the 'low dose' group  (p-values  less  than  0.1),  after  adjusting  the  age  group  effect  and  the  baseline  DBP  value. However, for both the 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg doses, both effects were clinically highly significant. This tendency was confirmed by the longitudinal analyses using all available DBP data. It is of note that contrary  to  SBP,  there  was  no  dose  related  difference  in  DBP  effect  which  can  be  explained  by  the pathophysiology of hypertension in children.

Adjustment forage group andbaselineDBp

## 2.3.3. Discussion

The 4-week treatment with TEL induced a blood pressure reduction of 9-13 mmHg in msSBP and of 88  mmHg  in  msDBP  (1  and  2  mg/kg,  respectively).  A  statistical  significant  and  clinically  relevant decrease in msSBP (- 14 mmHG) in the Telm2 mg/kg dose group at 4w was observed vs placebo; whereas no statistical  significant  difference  was  observed  for  the  1mg/kg  dose,  albeit  there  was  an average  reduction  of  9.7  mmHg  vs  placebo.  No  statistical  significant  effects  were  recorded  for longitudinal analyses and clinical secondary endpoints. No treatment interaction effect for age, gender or weight resulted from analyses of covariance models. However, relatively significant reduction in SBP among the age 12 to 18 years old patients was observed in the telmisartan 'high dose' group: -10.28 mmHg compared to placebo vs -1.99 mmHg compared to placebo in the younger age group.

Overall, the effect of both dosages on blood pressure levels is substantially similar. These results are weakly significant due to limited sample size and large variability of blood pressure in paediatric age. The lack of a dose-response curve in blood pressure reduction precludes any reliable conclusion about

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the appropriate dosage of TEL in the paediatric age. In summary, no definite findings on efficacy and posology in the studied population are available.

## 2.4. Clinical Safety aspects

## 2.4.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

All randomised patients who took at least one dose of randomised trial medication were included in the safety  analysis  evaluating  primarily  adverse  events,  vital  signs  and  laboratory  tests.  Overall  61 patients were randomized to active treatment; 16 to placebo. The mean duration of overall treatment exposure  was  comparable  for  all  three  groups  (20.6  days  for  telmisartan  1  mg/kg;  20.9  days  for telmisartan 2 mg/kg; and 18.4 days for placebo). The overall treatment exposure ranged from one to 25 days.

## 2.4.2. Results

The mean duration of treatment was comparable across treatment groups (18.4, 20.6 and 20.9 days for placebo, telmisartan 1 mg/kg and telmisartan 2 mg/kg, respectively).

According to the MAH, the overall occurrence of AEs during the four-week treatment phase was similar for the two active treatment groups and consistent with the prescribing information for telmisartan in adults. Adverse events were reported in 37 (48.7%) of the 76 patients who received at least one dose of  study  medication;  25  (41.7%)  patients  during  telmisartan  1  mg/kg  treatment  (initial  and  target doses), 13 (41.9%) patients during telmisartan 2 mg/kg treatment (target dose), and five (31.3%) patients during placebo treatment (initial and target doses). The below table shows the frequency of adverse events by treatment, primary system organ class and preferred terms.

Percentages are calculated using total number of subjects per treatment as the denominator. MedDRA version used for reporting: 1o.1

Adverse events (AEs) experienced during the trial were primarily mild or moderate across all treatment groups. There were a total of five (8.3%) patients who experienced AEs of severe intensity, all during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the telmisartan 1 mg/kg treatment. The AE pattern was similar between both active treatment groups. Events  of  headache  and  dizziness  were  reported  at  a  frequency  greater  than  5%  in  both  the telmisartan 1 mg/kg and telmisartan 2 mg/kg treatment groups. Events of cough were seen only in greater then 5% of patients while on telmisartan 1mg/kg and only odynophagia was seen in greater than 5% of patients while in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg group. Drug related events were similar between the two active treatments, with events of headache and dizziness reported as related in both active treatments, and asthenia, increased blood creatinine and increased blood urea reported only in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg treatment.

With respect to serious adverse events and deaths, primarily, the AEs in each treatment group were of mild or moderate intensity. No fatal AEs were reported during study 502.403. Discontinuation due to AEs was noted only in two (6.5%) patients; both in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg treatment group, but the subjects recovered from all events. Possible clinically significant abnormalities were infrequent. Four (16.7%) patients in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg treatment experienced an increase in eosinophils in the differential.  One  (6.3%)  patient  experienced  a  decrease  in  glucose  while  on  telmisartan  1  mg/kg treatment and one (4.5%) patient experienced an increase while on telmisartan 2 mg/kg in glucose values. One (4.5%) patient experienced an increase in blood urea nitrogen.

A physical exam and ECG were performed at screening and at conclusion of patient participation. Any vital signs, physical or ECG findings constituting a worsening from baseline were reported as adverse events. No significant changes in pulse rate were observed over the course of the trial. However, the study  does  not  include  the  list  of  laboratory  parameters  which  were  monitored.  The  lack  of  this information precludes a complete safety evaluation and the CHMP requested this to be provided.

## 2.4.3. Discussion

High  percentage  of  patients  treated  with  telmisartan  experience  AEs.  The  small  number  of  patients (n=57) and the short period of follow-up (4 weeks) preclude any sound evaluation on the safety of telmisartan in the paediatric population. Overall, the proportions of patients complaining of at least one AE  were  high:  31.3%,  41.7%  and  41.9%  in  the  placebo,  telmisartan  1  mg/kg  and  telmisartan    2 mg/kg, groups, respectively. Due to the relatively small sample size, particularly in the placebo group, any event experienced in at least one patient in placebo, three patients in telmisartan 1 mg/kg and two patients in telmisartan 2 mg/kg resulted in a frequency greater than or equal to 5%.

Of  particular  concern  is  the  observation  that  the  already  high  frequency  of  the  AEs  of  the  Nervous system disorders SOC in the 1 mg/kg dose telmisartan group rised exponentially. The most common adverse  events  observed  in  the  telmisartan  groups  were  headache  and  dizziness.  The  lack  of information on important characteristics of the patients included in the study (primary hypertension, secondary hypertension) affects the evaluation of the safety profile.

## 2.5. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the changes to the Product Information (PI), as described in section below.

During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI and the following changes to the Product Information of Micardis, Kinzalmono and Pritor have been agreed:

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Currently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not been established. No data are available.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been established.

The  blood  pressure  lowering  effects  of  two  doses  of  telmisartan  were  assessed  in  76  hypertensive, largely overweight patients aged 6 to &lt; 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), after  taking  telmisartan  1 mg/kg  (n = 29  treated)  or  2 mg/kg  (n = 31  treated)  over  a  four-week treatment period. By inclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some of the investigated patients the doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of hypertension in the adult population, reaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in adults. After adjustment for age group effects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) were  -14.5 (1.7)  mm Hg  in  the  telmisartan  2 mg/kg  group,  -9.7 (1.7) mm Hg  in  the  telmisartan 1 mg/kg  group,  and  -6.0 (2.4)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  adjusted  DBP  changes  from  baseline were -8.4 (1.5) mm Hg, -4.5 (1.6) mm Hg and -3.5 (2.1) mm Hg respectively. The change was dose dependent. The safety data from this study in patients aged 6 to &lt; 18 years appeared generally similar to that observed in adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan in children and adolescents was not evaluated.

An increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its clinical significance and relevance is unknown. These clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in hypertensive paediatric population.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Paediatric population

The  pharmacokinetics  of  two  doses  of  telmisartan  were  assessed  as  a  secondary  objective  in hypertensive patients (n = 57) aged 6 to &lt; 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steadystate of telmisartan in children and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the  study  was  too  small  for  a  meaningful  assessment  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  children  under 12 years of age, the results are generally consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the nonlinearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The proposed type II variation was submitted to comply with Article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006 and  to  provide  text  updates  for  sections  4.2,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  to  include  information  on paediatric use of the products. To support the proposed amendments to the SmPC with regards to the use of the medicinal product in children and adolescents, the MAH conducted the study 502.403, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a total duration of up to 6 weeks (4 weeks of active treatment) in male and female hypertensive patients aged 6 to &lt;18 years of age. The study investigated two dosages of telmisartan (TEL) per kg of body weight: 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, defined  as  low  and  high,  respectively.  The  reasons  underlying  the  choice  of  these  dosages  in  the paediatric age are not clear and need to be justified. Furthermore, the CHMP noted that no information was  given  about  the  selection  criteria  with  regard  to  possible  causes  of  high  blood  pressure  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

possible co-morbidities. Thus, based on the initially submitted data it was difficult to assess if efficacy and safety differed by the clinical characteristics of the patients.

The 4-week treatment with telmisartan induced a blood pressure reduction of 9-13 mmHg in msSBP and of 8-8 mmHg in msDBP (1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively), however, a statistically significant decrease in msSBP (- 14 mmHG) was observed only in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg dose group vs placebo; whereas no statistical significant difference was observed for the 1mg/kg dose, albeit an average reduction of 9.7 mmHg vs placebo. No statistical significant effects were recorded for clinical secondary endpoints.

Furthermore, no statistically significant difference from placebo was observed in either the telmisartan 'high dose' or 'low dose' groups for the secondary endpoint. Similar gains over placebo were achieved by both TEL doses. No relevant differences in the effects of the two doses on blood pressure levels were  observed.  This  observation  further  supports  the  CHMP's  concerns  that  too  high  dosages  were used  in  this  study.  The  lack  of  a  dose-response  curve  in  blood  pressure  reduction  precludes  any reliable  conclusion  about  the  appropriate  dosage  of  telmisartan  in  the  paediatric  population.  In summary,  the  information  on  the  blood  pressure  lowering  effect  of  doses  of  telmisartan  highly exceeding both the recommended and the highest dose of the drug in adult patients is not considered relevant to be included in the SmPC section 5.1 as proposed by the MAH.

The exposure in the paediatric hypertensive patient population was comparable to the exposure in an adult patient population receiving approximately the same per kilogram doses, 80 and 160 mg/day. It is  noted  that  the  recommended  dose  of  telmisartan  in  the  adult  population  is  40  mg/kg  and  that further increases up to 80 mg/kg are possible. Thus, the doses administered to the paediatric study population largely exceed both the recommended as well as the maximal dose in the adult patient.

The  number  of  children  included  in  the  group  6-&lt;18  years  is  smaller  than  that  included  in  the adolescent group and the CHMP concluded that the two age groups cannot be directly compared. The study population is also largely obese. The influence of overweight/obesity on PK parameters has not been investigated. Thus, a conclusion on the transferability of PK data obtained in this population to the  European  hypertensive  paediatric  population  in  the  normal  weight  range  cannot  be  made.  The study  also  confirmed  that  the  non-linearity  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  telmisartan  observed  in  the adult population occurs in the paediatric population. The non-linearity for Cmax is more evident for the younger group (6 to &lt;12 years) while, the non-linearity for AUCtau,ss, seems to be more moderate. A significant decrease in the CL/F ratio is observed with dose escalation in the 6-&lt;12 years old age group (727  ml/min  vs  338  ml/min),  whereas  no  limited  and  clinically  insignificant  decreases  in  CL/F  are observed in the 12 to &lt;18 years old age group, confirming that non-linearity PK profile is particularly evident in the younger age group.

The safety profile of telmisartan in the paediatric population cannot be completely elucidated by the CHMP on the basis of  the submitted data, due to the small number of patients (n=57) and to the short period of follow-up (4 weeks). From the data submitted it appears that the frequency of most of the AEs  in  the  both  telmisartan  treatment  groups  is  higher  than  placebo.  Of  particular  concern  is  the observation of the high frequency of AEs of Nervous system disorders.

Thus, the proposed changes of the SmPC (sections 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2) based on the initial submission were not acceptable and requests for supplementary information were agreed by the CHMP. The MAH was requested to address the choice of dosage in study 502.403, transferability of the data from study population  to  general  European  paediatric  patients  with  normal  weight,  lack  of  information  on important  characteristics  of  the  patients  included  in  the  study.  Appropriate  proposal  for  amended wording of the Product Information was also needed.

In their response, the MAH provided responses to all CHMP objections especially with respect to the description  of  the  results  from  the  clinical  study  502.403.  The  CHMP  noted  that  no  scientific

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

justification for the use of high doses in diabetic nephropathy has been submitted and discussed by the MAH.  The  high  doses  were  intended  for  a  different  indication  from  that  currently  approved  for telmisartan  and  the  reported  effect  on  BP  values  is  limited  to  the  high  doses  used  and  has  limited relevance  for  the  treatment  of  hypertension  in  the  general  paediatric  population.  There  is  also  a limitation  on  the  choice  of  patients  with  certain  body  weight.  The  question  of  long-term  effects  of telmisartan  on  children  is  unresolved.  On  the  basis  of  these  considerations  the  relevance  of  the findings of Study 502.403 for the treatment of paediatric patients with hypertension is questionable, and the CHMP requested that this should be evident in the wording included in the SmPC section 5.1 where the indication of the use of supra-therapeutic doses (1 mg and 2mg/kg BW) not recommended in the treatment of hypertension in the adult population should be included. In addition, the wording should include the information that the safety of supra-therapeutic doses of telmisartan (1 mg and 2 mg/kg BW) during long-term treatment has not been evaluated. The mean weight of the patients who are overweight should be included and the placebo-uncorrected BP reductions should be mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The MAH complied with this request and proposed an updated wording that is considered acceptable by the CHMP (see section 2.5).
