## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/105/2011 on the granting of a class waiver for all medicinal products for the treatment of breast carcinoma.

## Scientific Advice

The MAH did not seek scientific advice for the proposed new indication at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy in women, accounting globally for 23% of all cancers in women and 14% of cancer deaths 1 . Of the estimated 12.7 million new cancer cases worldwide in 2008, 1.38 million were estimated to be new cases of breast cancer 1,2 . In Europe, the estimated incidence of breast cancer in 2008 was 424,800 while the estimated deaths related to breast cancer were 128,700.

A number of breast carcinomas are dependent for their proliferation on 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), which can be synthesized from androstenedione ( Δ 4A) through the action of aromatase, an enzyme of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. In premenopausal women, the expression of aromatase is found in the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles while in post-menopausal women, the expression of aromatase is in general derived from non-glandular tissue, such as subcutaneous fat 3 . The concentration of oestradiol decreases to levels of about 7pg/ml from a baseline of 110 pg/ml at menopause. In breast carcinoma tissue of post-menopausal women, the concentration of oestradiol is approximately 10 fold the concentration found in plasma 4 . Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs; letrozole and anastrozole) are generally the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor (ER+) positive breast cancer 5,6,7,8 . Some patients do not respond to first-line endocrine therapy and patients who initially respond to treatment will eventually relapse. Following recurrence or progression on letrozole or anastrozole, the most commonly subsequent treatment includes exemestane and fulvestrant. In clinical practice, the use of chemotherapy is usually reserved for patients with high tumour burden or for patients that demonstrate an aggressive disease progression or symptomatic visceral disease.

K cell survival. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in a broad range of cancers, including breast cancers. The p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), a substrate of mTORC1, (S6K1), directly phosphorylates the activation domain AF-1 of the ER, which leads to ligand-independent receptor activation 9,10 .  The activation of the mTOR pathway is thought to be a driving factor for endocrine resistance in breast cancer. The evidence for this proposed mechanism of resistance is based on the finding that PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant and long-term oestrogen deprived breast cancer cells 11,12,13 . Coadministration of everolimus and AI in breast cancer cells was found to reverse resistance in cells that had become AI-resistant 14 . Afinitor (everolimus), a derivative of rapamycin, acts as an inhibitor of mTOR which regulates multiple downstream pathways from PI3 such as protein synthesis, proliferation (including angiogenesis) and

Afinitor was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) in 2009 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) whose disease has progressed on or after treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. In August 2011 Afinitor was granted an extension of indication for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well- or moderatelydifferentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of pancreatic origin in adults with progressive disease.

In this application, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for the following extension of indication for Afinitor:

'Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, in postmenopausal women previously treated with endocrine therapy.'

The final indication approved by the CHMP is as follows:

\"Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor\"

Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 and of the PL. Additional minor editorial changes to the SmPC were also proposed.

## 2.2. Quality  aspects

No new data related to the pharmaceutical quality were submitted with this variation application, which is considered acceptable.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH provided a non-clinical overview containing bibliographical references based on published literature and non-clinical studies investigating the effect of everolimus on breast cancer models. The non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies submitted were not performed in accordance with GLP. The environmental toxicity studies were performed in accordance with GLP.

The MAH provided 14 new primary pharmacodynamic studies and an updated ERA to support the application of the new indication.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies - everolimus in breast cancer models

## In vitro models

Everolimus was shown to inhibit a panel of cell lines, including breast cancer cell lines (Report RD2002-03223, Report RD-2006-02213). Sensitive cell lines to everolimus inhibitor activity had IC50 values &lt;1µM. The results of the anti-proliferative in vitro studies are shown in Table 1.

## In vivo models

Everolimus was investigated in human breast cancer cell lines in vivo . The anti-tumour efficacy of everolimus was compared to other suppressors of cytokine signalling (cyclophosphamide, docorubicin, docetaxel, capecitabine) in a panel of 6 breast cancer xenograft models established after direct transplantation of patients' tumours into nude mice (Report RD-2011-50492). The tumour growth inhibition of the oestrogen-dependent breast cancer model HBCx-3 (XTS-181) had a mean tumour volume regression of -13.5% (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The anti-proliferative effect of everolimus was evaluated in vitro using a panel of molecularly characterized cell lines for different gene mutations or amplifications. The cell lines were divided into three groups based on results of a growth inhibition by everolimus: sensitive (inhibition 80% or greater at 1 µM and an IC50 &gt; 50 nM), intermediate, and resistant cell lines. The most sensitive cell lines were enriched for the ER+ and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified subtypes. The effect of tumour growth inhibition of everolimus in oestrogen-dependent breast cancer models was further verified in four additional cell lines that were oestrogen receptor positive, namely ZR75-1 (ER+, PTENmut; intermediate), UACC812 (ER+, HER+; resistant), MDA361 (ER+, HER2+; resistant), KPL-1 (ER+, PTENwt; resistant) in a xenograft cancer model (Report RD-2011-50447). The results are shown in Figure 2.

The tumour growth inhibition of everolimus was further tested in the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma nude mouse xenograft model (Study RD-2011-50270). Mice were treated orally with everolimus and compared to a pan-PI3K inhibitor, an inhibitor for PI3K/mTOR, and an inhibitor that specifically inhibits the PIK3CA gene product, the p110alpha isoform of the PI3K catalytic subunit. All tested drugs exhibited dose-dependent activities.

## Primary pharmacodynamics studies - everolimus in combination with aromatase inhibitors

## In vitro studies

The effect of everolimus/letrozole combinations have been studied in several experiments, e.g. on the proliferation of aromatase-expressing MCF7/Aro cells (Report RD-2003-02908). The results of a proliferation assay are shown in Table 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MCF7/Aro cells were SD for 3 days. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and were SD for 2 additional days. Cells were stimulated with 10 nM △4A and treated with RAD001 and letrozole (Let) alone or in combination, every other day for 6 days. Cells were counted using a cell counter (A) or relative proliferation was assessed using the YOPRO DNA-binding fluorescent dye assay (B). Mean values (triplicates) +/- standard deviations (shown by error bars) are presented. ***: p&lt;0.001; two-way ANOVA.

The effect of everolimus in combination with exemestane was studied in vitro in a breast carcinoma cell line that was oestrogen-dependent (Study RD-2011-50532). The data are shown in Figure 3.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH submitted an ERA report. A summary of the main results is shown in Table 3. The calculated log Kow was 4.0. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) based on a daily dose of 10 mg was 0.05 μ g/L, which exceeds the trigger value of 0.01 μ g/L. A base-data set was submitted for Phase II studies with the exception for the transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308) which was listed as on-going. Everolimus showed high chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms with growth of Daphnia magna being the most sensitive end-point. Everolimus showed low adsorption to sewage treatment plant sludge, and transfer to terrestrial compartments via spreading of sewage sludge was not expected. All other Phase II Tier A PEC/PNEC quotients were below the trigger for Phase II Tier B assessment.

## Discussion on non-clinical aspects

r t pplication were considered acceptable to support the proposed new indication in breast cancer. The pharmacology of everolimus was investigated in in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Everolimus was shown to exhibit anti-proliferative activity and anti-tumour activity in breast cance models.  In  oestrogen-dependent (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)amplified breast cancer cell lines, administration of everolimus alone displayed anti-proliferative activity. Administration of everolimus as a single agent also showed an anti-tumour effect in breas cancer xenograft models. In an in vitro oestrogen-dependent breast cancer model, everolimus in combination with exemestane showed an additive/synergistic inhibition of androstenedione ( Δ 4A) driven MCF7/Aro cell proliferation compared to everolimus as single agent. The non-clinical data provided in the a y l data for these studies for everolimus and exemestane are well known in the oncology setting. The lack of studies on safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicit and reproduction toxicity was considered acceptable as the non-clinica

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

To support the indication of Afinitor for the oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer, clinical pharmacology data from a pivotal clinical research study (Study Y2301) and an updated report of the Phase II study C2222 (Study C2222 update) were included in the submission.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations - Metastatic Breast Cancer patients

The CSR for Study C2222 was included in the original submission for the RCC indication. This was a phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in postmenopausal women patients with ER+ early breast cancer. Patients were randomised to receive daily administration of either everolimus 10 mg + letrozole 2.5 mg or placebo + letrozole 2.5 mg for 4 months prior to undergoing breast conserving surgery or mastectomy. The original report included a total of 270 patients. The updated report was based on 251 patients and summarized the results of the end of Stage I analysis, excluding the data for 19 patients enrolled at site 066 due to GCP-related findings at this specific center. These patients were excluded because the site was not able to provide adequate documentation showing that the patients recruited had met the study entry criteria.

## Trough blood levels

Pre-dose (Cmin) and 2-hour post-dose (C2h) blood samples for concentration determination of everolimus in blood and exemestane in plasma were collected in up to 88 patients at steady states at Visit 4 in study Y2301. Blood samples for concentration determination of oestradiol were also collected in these patients at baseline and at Visit 4 to evaluate the indirect effect of coadministration of everolimus on the oestradiol level.

Everolimus is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a median time to peak blood levels (Tmax) of 1-2 hours post dose. Tmax of exemestane in women with breast cancer was 1.2 hours compared to 2.9 hours in healthy women.

The mean everolimus Cmin at steady-state was 16.0 ± 9.4 ng/mL (Table 4). The mean C2h of 46.5 ± 18.0 ng/mL observed in this study was within the range of Cmax means observed in previous everolimus studies with the everolimus 10-mg daily dose [59.7 ± 16.9 ng/mL (amended Study C2102 CP report), 76.7 ± 39.3 ng/mL (Study C2240), 56.3 ± 11.8 ng/mL (Study C2324), and 74.8 ± 33.6 ng/mL (Study C2325)].

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Everolimus is mainly metabolised by the cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and exemestane is metabolised by CYP3A4 and aldoketoreductases. Thus, the effect of everolimus on the metabolism of examestane was investigated in Study Y2301. Average exemestane Cmin and C2h were 45% and 71% higher, respectively, when co-administered with everolimus (Table 8).

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

No studies were submitted addressing the mechanism of action in breast cancer.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Exposure-efficacy relationship

According to the applicant, in the absence of sufficient concentration data to perform exposureresponse analyses, the effect of everolimus exposure on tumour regression could not be directly ascertained in study Y2301.  An analysis was performed to assess the potential impact of dose reductions and interruptions of everolimus by exploring the antitumour activity of patients who received time-averaged doses of &lt;7.5 mg and those who received  7.5 mg.

These two time-averaged dose groups were selected to represent and compare the efficacy response in patients with a longer duration of dose reduction versus those with an occasional dose reduction/interruption. Patients in the everolimus plus exemestane arm with time-averaged dose to event of ≥ 7.5 mg had a 24.9% best percentage reduction in target lesion in comparison to a 17.4% reduction for patients with a time-averaged dose &lt; 7.5 mg. Results of the Cox proportional hazard model showed that, in comparison to the placebo plus exemestane arm, patients in the everolimus plus exemestane arm with a time-averaged everolimus dose of &lt; 7.5 mg/day had a PFS HR of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.51) and patients with a time-averaged everolimus dose ≥ 7.5 mg/day had a PFS HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.58).

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Investigation of the effect of exemestane on everolimus plasma concentrations appeared to show no significant effects on the exposure of everolimus as the mean everolimus Cmin or C2h observed in Study Y2301 were consistent with corresponding values observed in previous trials with everolimus 10mg daily dose. Everolimus, on the other hand, was shown to increase plasma concentrations of exemestane by 45-71%. It is considered that the increase in exemestane plasma concentrations will not have an impact on the safety and efficacy. A new paragraph reflecting the findings was introduced in section 4.5 of the SmPC.

The observed differences in tumour regression data in patients who received time-averaged doses of &lt; 7.5 mg and those who received ≥ 7.5 mg were small and were not considered to be of clinical significance. Thus, the effective dose modification guideline implemented in the study protocol to manage adverse reactions did not compromise the efficacy data.

There was no statistical difference between everolimus Cmin and the change in baseline oestradiol concentration from baseline to week 4. In addition, no major reducing effect of exemestane on estradiol levels was observed. These findings may reflect the fact that estradiol levels had already been suppressed by the last prior therapy which was a NSAI in 74% of study patients and 64% of patients with PK sampling and no further decrease in estradiaol could be measured.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology data from studies Y2301 and updated report for study C2222 submitted by the applicant were adequate for the assessment of everolimus plus examestane pharmacology in the proposed indication. No major effect of exemestane on everolimus exposure is expected.  Everolimus was shown to increase plasma concentrations of exemestane by 45-71%. Thus the section 4.5 of the SmPC has been updated as follows:

'Co-administration of everolimus and exemestane increased exemestane Cmin and C2h by 45% and 64%, respectively. However, the corresponding oestradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the two treatment arms. No increase in adverse events related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The increase in exemestane levels is unlikely to have an impact on efficacy or safety.'

The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:

- -The MAH should commit to further investigate exposure-response relationships for PFS and OS in future studies, with a due date of March 31 st  2015.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

No dose response study was submitted.

The selection of the 10-mg continuous daily dose for everolimus was based on a pharmacodynamic model 15 which was supported by results from a clinical pharmacodynamic study in patients with solid tumours 16 and an investigator-initiated, randomised Phase-II study 17 where results showed that the 10-mg daily dose was more efficacious and produced a more sustained suppression of mTOR activity than weekly dosing.

Additionally, the 10-mg daily dose was favoured over a 5-mg dose in a Phase-I study combining everolimus with letrozole in patients with advanced breast cancer 18 . Further supportive evidence was obtained from a 270-patient, randomised Phase-II trial comparing combination therapy with letrozole and everolimus 10 mg daily versus letrozole and placebo as neoadjuvant treatment of 16 weeks duration in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer (Study C2222). Results demonstrated that the response rate by clinical palpation for patients receiving letrozole plus everolimus was higher than that for letrozole plus placebo (68.1% versus 59.1%, respectively) 19 .

## Treatments

Patients in the everolimus and exemestane treatment arm were administered in accordance with a 10-mg oral daily dosing regimen (two 5-mg tablets) in conjunction with exemestane 25 mg orally daily. The placebo group received matching placebo in conjunction with exemestane 25 mg orally daily.

Duration of both treatments was not limited. Treatment should continue until objective tumour progression was determined by the local radiologist (using RECIST), unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study for any other reason.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the combination treatment of everolimus and exemestane to exemestane alone with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) in postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer that is refractory to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs).

The main secondary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) between the two treatment arms. Other secondary objectives were:

- to evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to
- -overall response rate (ORR),
- -time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Group performance status (ECOG PS),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -safety,
- -change in quality-of-life (QoL) scores over time,
- -clinical benefit rate (CBR)
- to summarise time to response and duration of response in the two treatment arms;
- to characterise in a subgroup of patients the pharmacokinetics (PK) of everolimus (Cmin, C2h) when administered in combination with exemestane;
- to compare the two treatment arms with respect to pre-dose concentration (Cmin) and concentration at 2 hours post-dose (C2h) of exemestane and to compare in a subgroup of patients the two treatment arms with respect to oestradiol (E2) changes from baseline.

The trial included a biomarker component as an exploratory objective, which included:

- Bone turnover: BSAP, P1NP, and CTX (reported in this submission)
- Angiogenesis: vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor
- Immunohistochemistry: phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), Cyclin D1, Ki-67, and p53

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 based on local (investigator) radiology review. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS was to be censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment.

## Secondary Endpoints

The main secondary endpoint was overall survival. OS was defined as the time from date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died, survival was to be censored at the last date of contact.

Other secondary endpoints were clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall response rate (ORR), time to overall response, and duration of overall response, time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Group performance status (ECOG PS) and Quality of life (QoL).  Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response was either complete response (CR), a partial response (PR) or stable disease lasting for at least 24 weeks. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR or PR according to RECIST. Time to overall response (CR or PR) was the time between date of randomisation and first documented response (CR or PR) according to RECIST. Duration of overall response (DoR) applies only to patients whose best overall response was CR or PR. The start date is the date of first documented response (CR or PR) and the end date is the date of event defined as first documented progression of disease or death due to underlying cancer.

ECOG PS categories were defined according to the Table 11.

Safety was to be assessed by the CTCAE, version 3.0.

Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, changes from baseline in vital signs and laboratory results were to be reported.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, along with breast cancer patients' specific module (BR23) was used to collect QoL data. The EORTC scoring manual was be used to transform the raw scores into the domain scores (global heath, functional scales, symptom scales/items).

## Sample size

For the sample size it was estimated that the median duration of PFS in the control group (placebo plus exemestane) would be 3.7 months 20  and combination treatment with everolimus and exemestane would result in a 26% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to a 35% increase in the median PFS to 5 months). A total of 528 PFS events were required to detect a HR of 0.74 with 90% power using a log-rank test and a 2-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with an O'Brien-Fleming type boundary at a one-sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance. Assuming recruitment over an 18month period and that 10% of the patients would be lost to follow-up or would withdraw consent, and a 2:1 randomisation ratio in favour of the combination arm, a total of 705 patients were to be randomised.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with either everolimus plus exemestane or placebo plus exemestane.

Based on the expectation that patients previously sensitive to hormonal therapy will respond better to exemestane treatment, while patients with visceral disease will progress more rapidly, randomisation was stratified by:

-  Documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes versus no)
-  Presence of visceral metastasis (yes versus no)

Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either:

-  Documented clinical benefit (CR, PR, SD ≥ 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting, or
-  ≥ 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

The study was a double blind study. Patients were assigned to each treatment arm by centralised allocation (i.e., interactive web response system [IWRS]/interactive voice response system [IVRS].

## Statistical methods

An interim analysis was to be performed after observing 317 (60%) of the total PFS events as per local assessment. The PFS survival distribution for each treatment group was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the survival distributions of two treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test at an overall one-sided 0.025 level of significance (strata information obtained through IXRS used for randomisation). The hazard ratio (HR) for the risk reduction in PFS, along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), was estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model that accounted for the stratification scheme used at the time of randomisation.

OS was to be statistically evaluated and interpreted only if PFS was significantly different between treatment groups. A hierarchical testing strategy was to be used to control the overall type-I error rate. Up to three OS analyses were planned: these were to be at the time of the interim analysis for PFS, after observing 173 deaths, and after 392 deaths. The type-I error rate was maintained by using an α -spending function described by Lan and DeMets (1983) which approximates O'Brien and Fleming (1979)-type stopping boundaries. Results of the OS interim analyses were not to be disclosed by the IDMC unless found to be statistically significant.

The distribution function of OS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The two treatment groups were to be compared using a stratified log-rank test at an overall one-sided 2.5% level of significance. A stratified Cox regression was to be used to estimate the OS hazard ratio and the associated 95% CI.

Sensitivity analyses conducted included repeating the primary PFS analysis using different censoring rules and using an unstratified log-rank test to compare the two treatment groups.

Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of either CR or PR, and clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD ≥ 24 weeks, were summarised along with the exact 95% CIs calculated using the method described in Clopper and Pearson (1934) 21 . A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test was used to compare the two treatment groups with respect to ORR and CBR at the onesided 2.5% level of significance using the same stratification information that was used for randomisation. Response was based on RECIST 1.0. These two endpoints were assessed both as per investigator and independent central review.

QoL scores were analyzed over time using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and breast cancer-specific BR23 questionnaires. Changes from baseline in the sub-scale scores at the time of each assessment were summarised.

°Verbatim reasons for treatment discontinuation included potential adverse effects in 10 patients

## Recruitment

The first patient visit was 3 rd June 2009, and the study was still ongoing as of the 24 th  June 2012. Patients were recruited in 196 centres in 24 countries worldwide (Australia, Austria, Belgium, brazil, Canada, Czech republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, japan, Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, turkey, United Kingdom, USA.

## Conduct of the study

Amendment 1 to Clinical Trial Protocol CRAD001Y2301 as of 17 February 2010 clarified that all primary (and secondary) endpoints based on radiological (and photographical when applicable) assessments of tumour burden will be derived using the local (treating centre's) radiologist's/investigator's assessment. The original protocol as of 3 March 2009 stated at this place that efficacy will be assessed via a blinded, independent central review process. PFS as by central review remained an endpoint 'for secondary supportive efficacy analyses' following amendment 1.

The study design incorporated a pre-planned interim analysis after observing 60% of this number (corresponding to approximately 317 events). As of the cut-off date for the interim analysis, 359 events (68% of the required number) had occurred as per investigator (at which time 217 central PFS events were recorded as per central review).

As the independent central review of local radiology data formed the basis for the secondary supportive analysis of PFS, the IDMC charter was amended on 11 May 2011 to enable the study to be declared positive for PFS at the time of the interim analysis, if and only if, both local and central PFS analyses were statistically significant in favour of everolimus plus exemestane, using a Lan-DeMets α -

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

spending function with O'Brien-Fleming type stopping boundaries that were driven by the number of local and central PFS events observed:

-  The nominal p-value for the PFS analysis as per investigator was p&lt;0.0065
-  The nominal p-value for the PFS analysis as per central review was p&lt;0.0005

Analyses presented in the study report of the submission are based on data collected up to 11 February 2011 (cut-off date for the interim analysis that was performed on 29 June 2011).

Patients in the placebo plus exemestane arm were not allowed to cross over to everolimus at the time of progression. Following progression or after study treatment discontinuation, patients continued to be followed for survival every 3 months until a total of 392 deaths were recorded.

Major protocol deviations are shown in Table 13:

&lt; 21 days, then this regimen did not count as a prior line of chemotherapy

## Numbers analysed

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population consisted of all randomised patients. Four patients (0.6%) were excluded from the Safety Set; all four of these patients (three in the everolimus plus exemestane arm and one in the placebo plus exemestane group) were randomised but subsequently did not receive study treatment (Table 19).

The Safety Set population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and who had at least one valid post-baseline safety assessment. Patients were analysed according to the treatment actually received. For a patient taking at least one dose of the randomised treatment, treatment actually received was considered to be the randomised treatment.

## Outcomes and estimation

Primary endpoint: PFS

The results of the primary endpoint PFS in patients treated with the combination of everolimus and exemestane compared to placebo and exemestane treated group are reported in Table 20, 21, 22 and Figure 4. There were three data cut-off updates for PFS. Results from the final PFS analysis for Study Y2301 based on a 15 December 2011 cut-off, corresponded to a median follow-up of 17.7 months.

## Secondary endpoints

## Overall Survival

Using the expected number of OS events at the planned conclusion of surveillance for all-cause mortality (i.e., 392 deaths), 170 observed deaths (46% of expected deaths; p-value =0.0010) were required for a second interim analysis of OS. The database at the time of analysis of OS had 182 observed deaths.

The results of the 2 nd interim analysis are shown in Table 25 and Figure 5.

## Time to and duration of response

Time to response varied between 5.1 and 37.1 weeks for the exemestane plus everolimus arm and was 7.4 weeks for the single patient with a response in the placebo plus exemestane arm.

Duration of OR varied between 6.0+ and 66.1+ weeks for the everolimus plus exemestane arm and was 12.1+ weeks for the single patient in the placebo plus exemestane arm.

## Patient reported outcome

The median times to deterioration ( ≥ 5%) of global health status/QoL domain score of QLQ-C30 are shown in Figure 6. A mixed effect longitudinal model was fit on the change from baseline in the global health status of QLQ-C30.

## Biomarkers

Results for biomarkers were not submitted with the application. The following biomarkers were being evaluated in archival tumour samples collected from approximately 65% of the Full Analysis Set: protein expression of PTEN, pS6, and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry; somatic mutations in PI3KCA, PTEN, and p53 by sequencing; and PI3K amplification.

However, exploratory analyses on bone related biomarkers (bone turnover biomarkers) were submitted. The results are presented in Table 28.

## Last treatment prior to enrolling in Study Y2301

The CHMP requested to analyse the results of PFS according to patients having received NSAI as the last therapy before enrolling in the study Y2301. There were 361 patients (74.4%) in the everolimus+exemestane and 178 patients (74.4%) in the placebo+exemestane arms whose last therapy prior to enrolling in Study Y2301 was a NSAI.  Subgroup PFS analyses for patients having received a NSAI (yes) or other therapy (no) as last treatment before treatment with everolimus/placebo in combination with exemestane are presented in Table 31 for the 11-February2011 and 08-July-2011 (updated) data cut-offs.

## Supportive study

Study title: A phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicenter study assessing the value of adding RAD001 to letrozole (Femara) as preoperative therapy of primary breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study was designed as a double-blind Phase II study to assess clinical response in patients randomised for 16 weeks to treatment with 10 mg everolimus + 2.5 mg letrozole or placebo + 2.5 mg letrozole following surgery. Surgery had to have occured maximum of 1 week after last dose.

There was an open-label extension (depending on risk/benefit assessment) powered for final analysis of predictive biomarkers.

The first patient was enrolled in the study on 22 May 2005 and the last patient completed the study on 4 April 2007.

The results of the study are shown in Table 34, 35 and 36.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The study Y2301 was a phase III pivotal randomised, placebo controlled, blinded, multicentre study. The choice of PFS as a primary endpoint as per investigator (local) assessment and of OS and ORR as secondary endpoints was considered acceptable. The CHMP noted that patients were not allowed to cross-over to everolimus plus exemestane treatment after recurrence or progression of the disease. This avoided any confounding effect from subsequent treatment on both arms.

The choice of the comparator arm of placebo plus exemestane was not considered as the appropriate comparator arm for the study population being treated with everolimus plus exemestane. The CHMP highlighted that everolimus alone would have been a better choice considering that the heavily pretreated patient population was refractory to aromatase inhibitors. Because of the low response observed in the exemestane treated arm of 0.4% for ORR compared to the expected ORR of 15%, there was the possibility that patients received suboptimal treatment with exemestane.  Thus, the CHMP requested the submission of the results of the study BOLERO-6, which compares everolimus treated patients to everolimus plus exemestane treated patients to chemotherapy treatment, as a condition of the marketing authorisation. The CHMP was of the opinion that the study results on the efficacy of everolimus treatment alone may impact the benefit risk of the proposed indication. Thus, the requirement to submit results of this study was included as a condition in Annex II.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The study reached its primary objective and the final PFS analysis (15 December 2011) showed a statistically significantly higher PFS for everolimus plus exemestane of 7.82 months compared to 3.19 months for placebo plus exemestane (HR:0.45; CI 0.38-0.54; p&lt;0.0001) in the analysis of the primary endpoint. Assessment by central radiology review supported the primary analysis of PFS (11.01 vs 4.14 months, respectively, HR 0.38; CI 0.31-0.48; p&lt;0.0001). Although the OS data did not reach the stopping boundary and were considered still immature, the secondary endpoints OS and ORR and the sensitivity analyses further supported the results of the primary analysis.  The subgroup analyses showed that a benefit in favour of the exemestane plus everolimus could be observed in all subgroups analysed, including for the subgroups stratified according to hormonal sensitivity and the presence or absence of visceral metastases. The low ORR and the lack of suppression of oestrogen was of concern since there was the possibility that exemestane treatment may have been suboptimal and ineffective in both treatment arms. However, because the PFS results were consistent and stable for the three different efficacy analyses, the effect of everolimus plus exemestane was confirmed.

The proportion of patients with non-measurable disease was balanced between the two treatment arms. There were no patients in the non-measurable group with an ORR in either treatment arm and no patients experienced a complete response.  The treatment effect in terms of CBR was comparable for patients with and without measurable disease for both the everolimus plus exemestane and placebo plus exemestane arms. The median PFS for patients with measurable disease was slightly shorter than that for patients with non-measurable disease. This is an expected result for patients with visceral involvement who typically have a worse prognosis than patients with bone or soft tissue involvement. There was no difference in PFS between patients either treated or not with NSAI as last treatment prior to enrolment in the study. The observations appear to be consistent with expected treatment-effect results for both treatment groups.

Bone turnover biomarkers such as bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), aminoterminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP), and collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX) showed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

minor decreases from baseline compared to increases with exemestane; however, CVs are wide in all cases. The results appear to indicate that there were no negative effect on bone turnover from the combination treatment.

The results for Quality of Life and Clinical Performance Status did not show a significant difference between the two treatment arms.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The pivotal trial Y2301 provided satisfactory evidence that the combination of everolimus plus examestane leads to prolongation of PFS in hormone-receptor positive, Her2/neu negative, postmenopausal advanced breast cancer women compared to exemestane alone. The clinical benefit was considered relevant in spite of the low ORR and the immature OS data. There was no comparative data of everolimus plus exemestane with chemotherapy, which is the treatment of choice for patients with more aggressive course of disease characterised by symptomatic visceral disease. Thus, the CHMP considered that the indication should be restricted to patients without symptomatic visceral disease in order to avoid the possibility of undertreatment.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy. These measures are included in the RMP:

-  CRAD001J2301: A randomised, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel as first-line therapy in women with HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
-  CRAD001W2301: A randomised, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of daily everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine, in pretreated women with HER2/neu over-expressing locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
- -CRAD001Y2301: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of everolimus in combination with exemestane in the treatment of postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are refractory to letrozole or anastrozole (submission of final OS data)
- -Submission of CSR of BOLERO-6, in order to clarify the combined effect of everolimus plus exemestane vs everolimus alone due date 3Q 2017.

The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy. This measure is included as a condition in the Annex II:

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The overall safety database in the proposed indication consisted of data from 720 postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, with similar demographic and disease characteristics for the two treatment arms in the pivotal study Y2301: 482 were exposed to everolimus at the recommended 10-mg dose and exemestane, using the proposed recommended 25 mg daily dose regimen, and 238 to examestane alone. In addition, safety data from other ongoing studies with everolimus in the treatment of breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell cancer, tuberous sclerosis, lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer were reviewed for safety signals.

## Patient exposure

As of the data cut-off (11 February 2011), median follow-up was 7.6 months. The median duration of exposure to everolimus was 14.6 weeks (range: 1 to 79); the median duration of exposure to exemestane in the same arm was slightly longer (17.4 weeks, range: 1 to 79). Placebo and exemestane were both administered for a median 12.0 weeks in the control arm (range: 1 to 69). Duration of exposure (Table 37), cumulative dose, dose intensity and relative dose intensity (Table 38) are shown below.

## Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events were reported in 22.8% of patients in the everolimus plus exemestance treated group compared to 12.2% of patients in the placebo plus exemestane treated group. The most commonly reported SAEs in the everolimus group were pneumonitis (2.5%), pneumonia (1.5%), anaemia, dyspnoea, pulmonary embolism, pyrexia, and renal failure (all 1.2%).

There were 52 patients (10.8%) in the everolimus plus exemestane group compared with 3 patients (1.3%) in the placebo plus exemestane group that experienced SAEs that were suspected to be

adverse drug reactions. The most commonly serious adverse drug reactions were pneumonitis (everolimus: 12 [2.5%]; placebo: 0), renal failure (5 [1.0%]; 0) and hyperglycemia (4 [0.8%]; 0).

## Deaths

From the safety population of 720 patients, 51 patients (10.6%) and 31 patients (13.0%) died in the everolimus plus exemestane compared to placebo plus exemestane treatment groups. A summary of the causes of death is shown in Table 42. In the everolimus+exemestane treated arm, one death (0.2%) was suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment (after 32 days of treatment); for this patient the primary cause of death was hemorrhage from tumor (right anterior chest wall mass). The remaining 6 deaths were not suspected to be related to study treatment, although 4 were due to events that reflect known risks of everolimus therapy. All 6 of these additional deaths from data cut-off of 08-July-2011 were attributed to the underlying malignancy (4 due to study indication and single cases of metastatic breast cancer and neoplasm progression).

On-treatment deaths are deaths which occurred up to 28 days after the discontinuation of study treatment.

## Other significant events

The most commonly occurring AEs necessitating dose interruption and/or reduction in the everolimus plus exemestane group were stomatitis (22.0% of patients), pneumonitis (6.0%), and thrombocytopenia (5.0%) with a total of 57.7% of such AEs compared to 12.2% in the placebo plus exemestane group). Dose adjustments as the result of AEs from the following SOCs were more common in the everolimus plus exemestane group: 'gastrointestinal disorders' (+24.6% relative to placebo), 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders' (+12.0%), 'investigations' (+9.1%), 'blood and lymphatic system disorders (+7.5%), 'infections and infestations' (+7.3%), 'skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders' (+5.2%), and 'general disorders and administration site conditions' (+5.0%).

There were 6 AEs that required additional treatment in the everolimus plus exemestane group: stomatitis (+35.4% relative to placebo plus exemestane), rash (+14.3%), pneumonitis (+7.1%), anemia (+6.6%), hyperglycemia (+6.0%), and headache (+5.6%). On the other hand, in the placebo group bone pain and pain in extremities required about 3.5% more frequently additional therapy.

The incidence of bone-related AEs was low (less than 2.5% overall), and these events were reported in a similar proportion of patients across the two treatment arms. No grade 3-4 fractures were reported in the everolimus plus exemestane arm (0 out of 11 patients) compared with 3 grade-3 events in the exemestane plus placebo arm (1.3%; 3 out of 6 patients). One patient experienced spinal compression fracture (grade 2) in the everolimus plus exemestane arm which was considered related to study medication.

## Laboratory findings

Higher rates of clinical and heamatological abnormalities were observed in treated patients with everolimus plus exemestane compared to placebo plus exemestane group (Table 43). Hyperglycemia and elevated lipids were managed with concomitant medication and/or dietary intervention. Anemia was commonly treated with blood transfusion. Patients with creatinine elevations required varied interventions, primarily volume repletion and/or change in potentially nephrotoxic medications.

SGOT(AST) Serumglutamicoxaloacetictransaminase;SGPT(ALT) Serumglutamicpyruvic transaminase

Abnormal glomerular filtration rates (defined as grades 2 to 4) were reported more frequently in the everolimus plus exemestane treated group (30.9%) compared to placebo plus exemestane (21.8%) group; most of these abnormalities were grade 2.

Differences in vital signs and body weight between treatment groups were not considered to be clinically noteworthy. No significant change in blood pressure, changes in pulse, respiratory rate, or temperature was recorded at any time during the study in either treatment arm.

## Hypersensitivity Reactions

The rates of hypersensitivity for both treatment groups are shown in Table 44.

One patient (0.2%) in the everolimus plus exemestane arm required dose adjustment/interruption as a result of angio-oedema.

## Safety in special populations

## Age

38% (275/449) of the patients in the pivotal study were aged ≥ 65 years. The following AE categories were found to be higher in the age groups of ≥ 65 years versus &lt; 65 years:

- -AEs grade 3 (42.2% versus 32.8%) or grade 4 (9.9% versus 5.5%)
- -AEs leading to study drug discontinuation: 29.2% versus 12.4% (e.g. dyspnea, fatigue, decreased appetite, rash)
- renal events: 14.1% versus 6.2% (mainly blood creatinine increased)
- haemorrhages: 24.0% versus 16.6% (mainly epistaxis)

- Deaths: 4.7% versus 1.0%

- SAEs: 29.2% versus 18.6%

- Clinically notable AEs:

Breakdown of the elderly population ( ≥ 75 years, ≥ 70 to &lt; 75 years, and ≥ 65 to &lt; 70 years) provided no further evidence of relevant differences across these subgroups as the numbers of patients were too low.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Pharmacokinetic blood samples in 130 patients were collected for the assessment of everolimus, exemestane, and oestradiol levels (please refer to clinical pharmacokinectic section 2.4.2). Exposure to everolimus expressed as trough concentrations (Cmin) or 2 hours post administration (C2h) was (mean±SD) 16.04±9.356 ng/mL and 46.50±17.954 ng/m L, respectively.

Following co-administration of everolimus+exemestane, Cmin and C2h were 45% and 71% higher than placebo+exemestane values.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Altogether, 13% of the patients in the everolimus+exemestane group withdrew due to AEs or 'patient wish' compared to 5% in the placebo+exemestane group. Discontinuations directly attributable to AEs were more frequent in the everolimus group (19.1% vs. 4.6% with placebo) and about half of the cases were grade 3 or 4 events. The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pneumonitis (3.9% of patients), stomatitis (2.3%), fatigue (1.9%), decreased appetite (1.7%), dyspnea (1.7%), anemia (1.2%), and nausea (1.0%), but except for dyspnea these events were predominantly of grades 1-2.

Discontinuations due to the following SOCs were more common in the everolimus plus exemestane arm: 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders' (+7.3% relative to placebo plus exemestane), 'gastrointestinal disorders' (+4.4%), and  'general disorders and administration site conditions' (+3.7%).

## Post marketing experience

The MAH did not submit new safety information on post-marketing usage in the claimed indication.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety and tolerability of everolimus 10-mg daily in combination with exemestane 25-mg daily in the treatment of oestrogen-receptor positive postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer after previous non-steroidal aromatase-inhibitors was assessed. The median duration of treatment for everolimus plus exemestane was 14.6 months, while the placebo plus exemestane group received treatment for a median of 12 months.

In general, the reported adverse events were similar to what has been reported for RCC and pNET treatments at the same dose. The most common adverse drug reactions, with an incidence ≥ 10%, reported in association with everolimus plus exemestane therapy were: stomatitis, rash, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, nausea, pneumonitis, weight decreased, epistaxis, and thrombocytopenia.  Stomatitis was reported more than 5-fold compared to the placebo arm (64.5% vs. 10.9%). Haemorrhages were seen twice as often as in the placebo group (19.5% vs. 8.9%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse drug reactions, with an incidence ≥ 2% were: stomatitis, hyperglycaemia, pneumonitis, anaemia, fatigue, elevated alanine transaminase, thrombocytopenia, elevated aspartate transaminase, dyspnoea, and neutropenia.

The total percentage of on-treatment deaths were 2.5% in the combination group vs. 1.7% in the control group.  In those patients with 'AE' as primary cause of death, the proportions were 1.5% vs. 0.4%, respectively. Infectious events might be the major cause of AE related deaths.  Non-infectious pneumonitis, stomatitis/oral mucositis, and an increased susceptibility to infection represent the most important clinical issues.

Interestingly, the very common exemestane ADR 'hot-flushes' was reported less frequent in the everolimus plus exemestane group than in the placebo plus exemestane arm. The mechanism of action was unknown.

There were no unexpected results concerning abnormal laboratory values for everolimus plus exemestane treatment.

Concerning AEs in the elderly, AEs were reported more often in patients above 65 years. In a subgroup of Asian, i.e. Japanese patients, a higher rate of some ADRs, especially stomatitis was reported.

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females

Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g. oral, injected, or implanted non-oestrogen-containing hormonal method of birth control, progesterone-based contraceptives, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device [IUD], and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment.

## Pregnancy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no adequate data from the use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity effects including embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

Everolimus is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in breast milk. However, in rats, everolimus and/or its metabolites readily pass into the milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, women taking everolimus should not breast-feed.

## Fertility

The potential for everolimus to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown, however secondary amenorrhoea and associated luteinising hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) imbalance has been observed in female patients. Based on non-clinical findings, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with everolimus (see section 5.3).

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The safety and tolerability of everolimus in study Y2301 showed no unexpected toxicities.  No new safety concerns have emerged in the combination of everolimus plus exemestane. The SmPC already lists the ADRs observed in this phase III study and thus, no need to update the safety information in section 4.8.

Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non- infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue Afinitor therapy without dose adjustments. If symptoms are moderate, consideration should be given to interruption of therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be indicated. Afinitor may be reinitiated at 5 mg daily. For cases where symptoms of non- infectious pneumonitis are severe, Afinitor therapy should be discontinued and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Therapy with Afinitor may be reinitiated at 5 mg daily depending on the individual clinical circumstances.' |

Non- infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) was described in 12% of patients taking Afinitor (see section 4.8). Some cases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed. A diagnosis of non- infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough or dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations.

Warning in SPC Section 4.4: Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically thereafter. Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with Afinitor (see section 4.8). Renal function of patients should be monitored particularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.' Increased creatinine, proteinuria, and renal failure are included as ADRs in SPC Section 4.8. |

Study CRAD001M2301: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of RAD001 in the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Study M2301 includes a trial extension phase to follow-up of all patients until they reach Tanner stage V, or until the age of 15 for females and 16 for males, regardless of end of trial therapy. Study CRAD001C2485: Everolimus (RAD001) therapy of giant cell astrocytomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (including children). Assessments include the collection of weight and height (before and after enrollment into the study), changes in hormones (LH and FSH, all patients; estrogen, females; testosterone, males) as well as Tanner staging until sexual maturation. For study M2301, these potential developmental effects will continue to be assessed until patients reach Tanner stage V, or until the age of 15 for females and 16 for males, regardless of end of trial therapy. | Relevant information included in SPC Section 5.3: 'In rats, everolimus caused embryo/ foetotoxicity at systemic exposure below the therapeutic level. This was manifested as mortality and reduced foetal weight. The incidence of skeletal variations and malformations (e.g. sternal cleft) was increased at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg. In rabbits, embryotoxicity was evident in an increase in late resorptions.' |

| Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and PgP inhibitors  | Routine pharmacovigilance including cumulative analysis in PSUR.  | Relevant information in SPC Section 4.4: 'Co-administration with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and/or the multidrug efflux pump P- glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided. If co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 and/or PgP inhibitor or inducer cannot be avoided, dose adjustments of Afinitor can be taken into consideration based on predicted AUC (see section 4.5). Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors result in dramatically increased plasma concentrations of everolimus (see section 4.5). There are currently not sufficient data to allow dosing recommendations in this situation. Hence, concomitant treatment of Afinitor and potent inhibitors is not recommended.' Relevant information in SPC Section 4.5: 'Substances that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP may increase everolimus blood concentrations by decreasing the metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. Interaction by and recommendations regarding concomitant administration of specific CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors is included in Table 1 in the same SPC section.'

| BOLERO-6 (Y2201): A three-arm randomized phase II study investigating the combination of everolimus with exemestane versus everolimus alone versus capecitabine in patients with estrogen-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer after recurrence or progression on letrozole or anastrozole. The trial aims to estimate the value of exemestane when added to everolimus versus everolimus monotherapy in this group of patients in terms of progression-free survival, response rate, clinical benefit rate, pharmacokinetics, and safety. The trial will also evaluate capecitabine monotherapy relative to the combination of everolimus and exemestane, with respect to the same endpoints. Patients will be followed for survival for up to two years after randomization of last patient. A total of 300 patients (100 per treatment arm) are planned to be recruited uniformly over a 18 month period. | 3Q 2017        |

In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into consideration when an update of the RMP is submitted:

- -Addition of comparator data for all approved indications in section 1.5.2.
- -Addition of information on observed outcomes for the important identified and potential risks, e.g. number and percentage of fatal, recovered/with/without treatment/sequelae, not recovered or hospitalised in section 1.5.2.
- -Update of the summary table to include information on developmental toxicity and not on teratogenicity (the corresponding studies were summarised in the part on non-clinical safety: In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study with rats, the administration of everolimus at 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg, or rapamycin at 1.5 mg/kg on postpartum days 7 to 70 with 13- and 26-week recovery periods resulted in systemic toxicity at all doses, including reduced absolute body weight gain and food consumption, and delayed attainment of some developmental landmarks, with full or partial recovery after cessation of dosing [.]).

No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## 2.8. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

- -The changes to the Package Leaflet were considered minor with no consequential impact on the readability of the package leaflet.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint and the efficacy of everolimus in combination with exemestane 'for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor' is considered

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

established. The median PFS was prolonged by 4.63 months, from 3.19 months for patients receiving placebo plus exemestane to 7.82 months for patients treated with everolimus plus exemestane.

The secondary endpoints, tumour related endpoints (ORR) and OS, and subgroup analyses were supportive of the primary analysis.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There is uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the additional benefit of exemestane in the combination treatment effect over everolimus treatment alone. The design of the study precludes any information on the potential benefit of everolimus treatment as a single agent in the patient population studied in the clinical trial. The MAH was requested to submit the results of the study BOLERO-6, a study comparing everolimus alone with everolimus plus exemestane after prior therapy with NSAI in order to confirm the synergistic/additive effect of exemestane.

The interim results for OS, which were immature at the time of assessment, appeared to suggest a trend favouring the combination treatment. However, as the number of events and criteria for unblinding had not been met, there was uncertainty over the final results of OS. The MAH was asked to submit the final OS results as part of an RMP measure.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety and tolerability of everolimus in combination with exemestane was in general consistent with the approved SmPC for Afinitor. However, everolimus plus exemestane treatment was accompanied by substantially more toxicity than exemestane treatment alone with 10% more SAEs, 35% more drug-related AEs and a threefold increase in the number of on-treatment deaths. The risk of non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, stomatitis and hemorrhages was also increased in the combination treatment.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

There were no uncertainties in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects that could affect the benefit-risk balance of the final proposed indication.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Overall, the pivotal study provided satisfactory results with respect to efficacy (prolongation of PFS) and safety (no emergence of a major safety signal) in the proposed indication. Thus, the beneficial effect of everolimus plus exemestane treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer was regarded as clinically relevant.

## Benefit-risk balance

Based on the results of the pivotal trial Y2301, the benefits of everolimus in combination with exemestane treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer (PFS prolongation of 4.63 months) outweighed the adverse events (stomatitis, rash, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, nausea, pneumonitis, weight decreased, epistaxis, and thrombocytopenia). Therefore, the CHMP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered that the benefit-risk balance for everolimus in the indication 'for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor' is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change(s):

| Variation accepted   |                                                                                                                      | Type   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a              | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Extension of indication to include Afinitor for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Consequently sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated. Section 4.6 was updated to align with wording in the SmPC for Votubia and minor editorial changes were made to section 5.3 to revise the wording to correlate exposure in rats in a male fertility study and clinical exposure. The Risk Management Plan and the Package Leaflet were updated accordingly.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
