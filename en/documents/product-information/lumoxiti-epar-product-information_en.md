ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Lumoxiti1 mg powder for concentrate and solution for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

<!-- image -->

The recommended dose of Lumoxiti is 0.04 mg/kg administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28-day cycle. Patients should continue treatment for a maximum of 6 cycles, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment may be stopped at the physician's discretion if complete response (CR) without minimal residual disease (MRD) is achieved prior to the completion of 6 cycles.

One vial of powder for concentrate contains 1 mg moxetumomab pasudotox. Reconstitution with water for injections results in a final moxetumomab pasudotox vial concentration of 1 mg/mL. Moxetumomab pasudotox is produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder for concentrate and solution for solution for infusion. Powder for concentrate: white to off-white lyophilised powder. Solution (stabiliser): colourless-to-slightly yellow, clear solution with a pH of 6.0. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Lumoxiti as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) after receiving at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analogue (PNA). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hydration

In patients over 50 kg, 1 L isotonic solution (e.g. dextrose 50 mg/mL [5%] and sodium chloride 9 mg/mL [0.9%] or 4.5 mg/mL [0.45%] solution for injection) should be administered intravenously over 2-4 hours before and after each Lumoxiti infusion. Patients under 50 kg require 0.5 L to be administered.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be adequately hydrated. Patients are advised to drink 3 L of oral fluids per 24 hours on Days 1 through 8 of each 28-day cycle. In patients under 50 kg, 2 L per day is recommended.

Fluid balance should be monitored to avoid fluid overload (see section 4.4).

## Premedication

Premedication is required 30-90 minutes prior to each Lumoxiti infusion with an oral antihistamine (e.g. hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine), an antipyretic (e.g. paracetamol), and a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine, or cimetidine).

If a severe infusion related reaction occurs, see section 4.4 for further instructions.

Adverse reactions graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) Patients who experience Grade 2 or higher CLS should receive appropriate supportive measures including treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids, with monitoring of weight, albumin levels, and blood pressure until resolution (see section 4.4). Table 3 CLS grading and management guidance Lumoxiti dosing Grade 2 Symptomatic; intervention indicated Delay dosing until recovery of symptoms. Grade 3 Severe symptoms; intervention indicated Discontinue Lumoxiti. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Adverse reactions graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Increased creatinine For patients with baseline serum creatinine within normal limits, dosing should be delayed for Grade 2 or higher creatinine increases (greater than 1.5-times baseline or the upper limit of normal). Lumoxiti should be resumed upon recovery to at least Grade 1 (1.0- to 1.5-times baseline, or between the upper limit of normal and 1.5-times the upper limit of normal). For patients with baseline serum creatinine of Grade 1 or 2, delay dosing for creatinine increases to Grade 3 or higher (greater than 3-times baseline or the upper limit of normal). Lumoxiti should be resumed upon recovery to baseline grade or lower. Refer to section 4.4 for further monitoring and evaluation information. Special populations Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥65 years of age) (see Renal function monitoring in section 4.4, and Elderly in sections 4.8 and 5.1).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment of Lumoxiti is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment. Data supporting use of moxetumomab pasudotox in moderate renal impairment is limited. Moxetumomab pasudotox has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see Renal function monitoring in section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment of Lumoxiti is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Moxetumomab pasudotox has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Lumoxiti in children aged 0 to 18 years in the treatment of HCL.

## Method of administration

Lumoxiti is for intravenous use.

The diluted solution is administered intravenously over 30 minutes. An infusion set fitted with a sterile, low-protein binding 0.22 micron in-line filter should be used. After the infusion, the intravenous administration line should be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same rate as the infusion. This ensures the full Lumoxiti dose is delivered. For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) HUS has been reported in patients treated with Lumoxiti and is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and progressive renal failure (see section 4.8). Lumoxiti should be avoided in patients with prior history of severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) or HUS. Prophylactic fluids are recommended during treatment with Lumoxiti (see section 4.2). In Study 1053, patients with a platelet count ≥100,000/mm 3 received low-dose acetylsalicylic acid on Days 1 through 8 of each 28-day cycle for prophylaxis of renal insufficiency. Blood chemistry and complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose and as clinically indicated during treatment. Monitoring mid-cycle is also recommended. Diagnosis of HUS should be considered in patients who develop haemolytic anaemia, worsening or sudden onset of thrombocytopenia, worsening of renal function, elevation of bilirubin and/or LDH, and have evidence of haemolysis based on peripheral blood smear schistocytes (see section 4.2).

The events of HUS may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed with increased risk of progressive renal failure requiring dialysis. If HUS is suspected appropriate supportive measures including fluid repletion and haemodynamic monitoring should be initiated, and hospitalisation as clinically indicated should be considered. For Grade 2 HUS, treatment with Lumoxiti should be withheld until resolution, and permanently discontinued for Grade ≥3 HUS (see section 4.2).

Capillary leak syndrome (CLS)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CLS has been reported among patients treated with Lumoxiti and is characterized by hypoalbuminaemia, hypotension, symptoms of fluid overload and haemoconcentration (see section 4.8).

Patient weight and blood pressure should be monitored prior to each Lumoxiti infusion and as clinically indicated during treatment. Patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of CLS including weight gain (≥10% from Day 1 of current cycle), hypotension, peripheral oedema, shortness of breath or cough, and pulmonary oedema and/or serosal effusions. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may help identify CLS: hypoalbuminemia, elevated haematocrit, leucocytosis and thrombocytosis (see section 4.2).

CLS may be life-threatening or fatal if treatment is delayed. Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CLS occur at any time. Patients who develop CLS should receive appropriate supportive measures, including concomitant oral or intravenous corticosteroids, and hospitalisation as clinically indicated. For Grade 2 CLS, treatment with Lumoxiti should be withheld until resolution, and permanently discontinued for Grade ≥3 CLS (see section 4.2). Renal function monitoring Patients who experience HUS, those ≥65 years of age, or those with baseline renal impairment may be at increased risk for worsening of renal function following treatment with Lumoxiti (see section 4.8). Treatment with Lumoxiti is not recommended in patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤29 mL/min). Renal function should be monitored prior to each infusion of Lumoxiti, and as clinically indicated throughout treatment. Lumoxiti dosing should be delayed in patients with Grade ≥3 elevations in creatinine, or upon worsening from baseline by 2 or more grades (see section 4.2). Infusion related reactions If a severe infusion related reaction occurs, the Lumoxiti infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical management initiated. An oral or intravenous corticosteroid should be administered approximately 30 minutes before resuming, or before the next Lumoxiti infusion(s). See section 4.2 for information on premedication to reduce risk of infusion related reactions. Lumoxiti contains sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 'sodium-free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Moxetumomab pasudotox is a recombinant immunotoxin that binds specifically to CD22+ B cells. Based on the mechanism of action of moxetumomab pasudotox, no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Women of childbearing potential/contraception

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox and for at least 30 days after the last dose.

## Pregnancy

There are no human or animal data to assess the risk of moxetumomab pasudotox use during pregnancy. Based on its mechanism of action and observed adverse findings of moxetumomab pasudotox in non-pregnant female monkeys including body weight loss, moxetumomab pasudotox may be expected to cause maternal and embryofetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant woman. Moxetumomab pasudotox should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

There is no information regarding the presence of moxetumomab pasudotox in human milk, the absorption and effects on the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Lumoxiti therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No adverse findings of moxetumomab pasudotox were observed on reproductive organ weights or reproductive organ histopathology following dosing of sexually mature monkeys. There are no data available to directly determine the potential effects on human fertility (see section 5.3).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## HUS

In Study 1053 in patients with HCL treated with Lumoxiti, HUS occurred in 8.8% of patients, including Grade 3 in 5.0% and Grade 4 in 1.3%.

The median time to first onset of HUS was 33 days (range: 9-92), and may occur during any cycle of treatment with Lumoxiti. Most cases of HUS occurred in the first 9 days (range: 1-16) of a treatment cycle. The median time to resolution of HUS was 23.5 days (range: 2-44). All cases resolved, including those who discontinued Lumoxiti. The median end of treatment creatinine clearance (as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) was higher among patients without HUS (89 mL/min, range 42-195) compared with patients with HUS (76 mL/min, range 19-96). For clinical management of HUS, see section 4.4. CLS In Study 1053 in patients with HCL treated with Lumoxiti, CLS occurred in 8.8% of patients, the majority were Grade 2. There were 2.5% Grade 4 events. The median time to onset of CLS was 37 days (range: 5-92), and may occur during any cycle of treatment. Most cases of CLS occurred in the first 9 days (range: 1-24) of a treatment cycle. All CLS resolved, with a median time to resolution of 36 days (range: 10-53). For clinical management of CLS, see section 4.4. Increase in serum creatinine In Study 1053, increases in creatinine up to a maximum of 3-times the upper limit of normal were reported in 11.3% of patients. At the end of treatment, serum creatinine levels were within normal limits for the majority (82.5%) of patients. Serum creatinine levels remained elevated above Grade 2 in 5% of patients, two of these patients had Grade 3 or 4 HUS. Infusion related reactions Infusion-related reactions as reported by investigator or retrospectively defined as two or more symptoms of headache, dizziness, hypotension, myalgia, pyrexia, chills, nausea, and/or vomiting on the day of treatment with study drug occurred in 25% of patients, including Grade 3 in 2.5% of patients. Infusion related reactions may occur during any cycle of treatment with Lumoxiti (see section 4.2). Special populations Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Elderly

In Study 1053, 39% of patients treated with Lumoxiti were 65 years of age or older. Patients ≥65 years of age had lower median creatinine clearance at baseline and at the end of treatment compared with patients &lt;65 years of age (78 and 69 mL/min versus 114 and 98 mL/min, respectively).

## Immunogenicity

In Study 1053, 88% (70/80) of patients were positive for ADA (before or after treatment). Fifty-eight percent (45/77) of patients tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) prior to any treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox, and 66% (49/74) of patients tested positive for ADAs whilst on treatment. Neutralising antibodies against moxetumomab pasudotox were detected in 84% of patients (67/80) at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

any time. No clinically relevant effects of ADA on safety were identified. See Immunogenicity in section 5.2.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for moxetumomab pasudotox overdose. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XC34 Mechanism of action Moxetumomab pasudotox is a CD22-targeted immunotoxin designed to direct the cytotoxic action of the truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin to cells which express the CD22 receptor. CD22 is a B-lymphocyte restricted transmembrane protein with a similar or higher receptor density in HCL cells relative to normal B cells. Nonclinical data indicate that the anticancer activity of moxetumomab pasudotox is due to the binding of the immunotoxin to CD22-expressing tumour cells, followed by internalisation of the Lumoxiti-CD22 complex and processing to release the active PE38 exotoxin. The exotoxin is translocated to the cytosol where it inactivates elongation factor 2 (EF-2), causing inhibition of protein synthesis leading to apoptotic cell death. Pharmacodynamic effects In patients with HCL, treatment with Lumoxiti resulted in a reduction of circulating CD19+ B cells. In Study 1053, circulating CD19+ B cells were reduced by 89% from baseline following the first three infusions of Lumoxiti. This reduction was sustained for at least one month post-treatment. Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy and safety of Lumoxiti were evaluated in Study 1053, a multicentre, single-arm, Phase 3 study in patients with relapsed/refractory HCL. Study 1053 was conducted in patients with histologically confirmed HCL or HCL variant who had received prior treatment with at least 2 systemic therapies, including 1 PNA, with a need for therapy based on at least one of the following criteria: neutrophils &lt;1.0 x 10 9 /L, platelets &lt;100 x 10 9 /L, haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL or symptomatic splenomegaly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study excluded patients who have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, patients with history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant, patients with known brain metastases, retinal or choroidal detachment, or uncontrolled illness including uncontrolled infection. Further exclusion criteria were a history of thromboembolism, known congenital hypercoagulable conditions, thrombotic microangiopathy/HUS or clinical evidence of severe disseminated intravascular coagulation.

A total of 80 patients were enrolled; 77 with classic HCL and 3 with HCL variant. The median age was 60 (range 34 to 84) years, 79% were male, and 94% were Caucasian at primary analysis. At baseline, 98% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median number of prior treatments was 3 (range 2 to 11); all patients received prior PNA therapy, including 29% in combination with rituximab. The most common other prior treatment regimens were rituximab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monotherapy (51%), interferon-alpha (25%), and a BRAF inhibitor (18%). At baseline, 33% (26/80) of patients had low haemoglobin (&lt;10 g/dl), 68% (54/80) of patients had neutropenia (&lt;1.0 x 10 9 /L), and 84% (67/80) of patients had baseline platelet counts &lt;100 x 10 9 /L. Almost half (48%) of the patients had enlarged spleens at baseline. During screening, 23.8% of patients had an ongoing infection which was adequately controlled or resolved prior to treatment initiation.

Patients received Lumoxiti 0.04 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles or until documentation of complete response (CR), disease progression, initiation of alternate therapy, or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 63% of patients completed 6 cycles and 15% of patients completed treatment earlier than 6 cycles with documentation of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. An independent review committee (IRC) performed efficacy evaluations using blood, bone marrow, and imaging criteria adapted from previous HCL studies and consensus guidelines.

The major efficacy outcome of Study 1053 was durable CR, as confirmed by maintenance of haematologic remission (haemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL, neutrophils ≥1.5 x 10 9 /L, and platelets ≥100 x 10 9 /L without transfusions or growth factor for at least 4 weeks) more than 180 days after IRC-assessed CR. At the time of final analysis (cut-off date of 29 April 2019), the median follow-up was 24.6 months (range 1 to 72). The efficacy results from Study 1053 are summarised in Table 5. Table 5 Efficacy results in patients with HCL in study 1053 Medicinal product no longer authorised

IRC = Independent Review Committee-Assessed; HR = Haematologic Remission; CI = Confidence Interval; CR = Complete Response; OR = Overall Response.

a CR defined as clearing of the bone marrow of hairy cells by routine Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin stain, radiologic resolution of pre-existing lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly, and haematologic remission

b PR defined as ≥ 50% decrease or normalisation (&lt;500/mm 3 ) in peripheral blood lymphocyte count, reduction of pre-existing lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly, and haematologic remission.

c SD defined as ≥ 50% decrease of peripheral blood lymphocyte count, reduction of pre-existing lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly, and haematologic remission or 50% improvement over baseline for haematologic parameters if not meeting haematologic remission criteria.

MRD was evaluated by IRC via immunohistochemistry assessment of bone marrow biopsies. At the time of the final analysis, of the 33 patients who achieved IRC-assessed CR, 82% (27/33) were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MRD-negative and 26 of the 29 patients (89.7%) who achieved a durable CR were MRD-negative. The median duration of CR was 12.0 months for MRD-positive patients (n = 6) and 62.8 months for MRD-negative patients (n = 27).

Pre-specified sub-group analyses of primary and secondary endpoints were performed for the ITT population including age (&lt;65 years, ≥65 years), gender, baseline spleen status (splenectomy, &lt;14 cm, ≥14 cm), number of prior treatments with PNA (1, 2, &gt;2) and HCL histology (classic, variant). The analyses showed that the effect on durable CR rate and CR rate across the majority of sub-groups evaluated were consistent with the results for the ITT population. For subjects ≥65 years, the durable CR rate was 19% (95% CI: 8%, 38%) and the CR rate assessed by IRC was 26% (95% CI: 12%, 47%). Data are limited for the splenectomy and HCL variant subgroups. No CRs were reported; 2 of 4 patients in the splenectomy subgroup and 1 of 3 patients in the HCL variant subgroup achieved a PR.

Based on noncompartmental PK analysis, moxetumomab pasudotox Cycle 1 Day 5 estimated mean (CV%) systemic clearance was 4.8 L/hr (82.3%) and the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.32 hours (range: 0.17 to 57.4). The elimination half-life following the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1) could only be estimated in 6 out of 68 patients (mean t 1/2 =0.98 hours).

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Lumoxiti in all subsets of the paediatric population in HCL (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). Other information This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics (PK) of moxetumomab pasudotox was studied in 68 patients with HCL at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 of a 28-day cycle. PK exposure increased after subsequent infusions compared with the first infusion, which is likely related to the depletion of malignant B cells after treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox and subsequent reduction of the CD22 sink. All trough concentration levels were negligible, indicating there was no systemic accumulation of moxetumomab pasudotox. Distribution Based on noncompartmental PK analysis and consistent with restriction to extracellular fluid, the mean Cycle 1 Day 5 volume of distribution was 6.06 L, with an inter individual variability (CV) of 46.3%. Biotransformation The exact pathway through which moxetumomab pasudotox is metabolised has not been characterised. Like other protein therapeutics, moxetumomab pasudotox is expected to undergo proteolytic degradation into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways. Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary elimination pathways of moxetumomab pasudotox are assumed to include CD22mediated internalisation and proteolysis or catabolism. Renal excretion has not been studied for moxetumomab pasudotox. Data from a similar precursor compound indicate that intact protein is excreted into urine. However, renal excretion is not expected to be a major elimination pathway due to the molecular size.

## Special populations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Age (34 to 84 years), sex, race, mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN or AST &gt; ULN; n=7), or mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60-89 mL/min; n=19), had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of moxetumomab pasudotox, based on an analysis of noncompartmental PK data by covariates. With body weight dosing, a trend of increased exposure was observed with increasing weight. No dose adjustments are recommended for these demographics.

Moxetumomab pasudotox has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN or AST = Any) and moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min).

## Immunogenicity

There is a trend of reduced Cmax with increased ADA titre at later treatment cycles (Cycle 3 and beyond); however, these results are not conclusive due to the limitation of the bioanalytical method for moxetumomab pasudotox at high ADA titres. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity No studies have been conducted to assess the carcinogenic or genotoxic potential of moxetumomab pasudotox. Repeat-dose toxicity Moxetumomab pasudotox was studied in cynomolgus monkeys for 13 weeks. At doses ≥10-times the human recommended dose, minimal to moderate degeneration of heart tissue was observed microscopically without corresponding changes in ECG. At doses of approximately 34-times the human recommended dose, microscopic evidence of gliosis and axonal degeneration was observed in the brain and spinal cord, respectively, along with observations of body tremors. Reproductive toxicology Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with moxetumomab pasudotox. In a 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study using sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse findings on male or female reproductive organs were observed at doses approximately 34-times the human recommended dose. 6.

## 6.3 Shelf life

## Unopened vial

4 years.

Lumoxiti concentrate (i.e. reconstituted Lumoxiti powder for concentrate) The Lumoxiti concentrate should be immediately further diluted.

From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. Lumoxiti solution (i.e. diluted Lumoxiti concentrate in the prepared infusion bag) Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C or 4 hours at room temperature up to 25°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 6.4 Special precautions for storage Store and transport refrigerated (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original carton in order to protect from light. For storage conditions after reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 6.5 Nature and contents of container Lumoxiti 1 mg powder for concentrate is provided in a Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric stopper and a dark blue flip-off aluminium seal. The 1 mL solution (stabiliser) is provided in a Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric stopper and a dark grey flip-off aluminium seal. Each pack contains:  2 vials of powder for concentrate and 1 vial of solution (stabiliser) or  3 vials of powder for concentrate and 1 vial of solution (stabiliser) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

For single use only. Lumoxiti powder for concentrate must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique.

## Step 1: Calculate dose

-  Calculate the dose (mg) and the number of Lumoxiti powder for concentrate vials (1 mg/vial) to be reconstituted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Number of vials of Lumoxiti powder for concentrate =  0.04 mg/kg  x  patient weight (kg) 1 mg/vial

- o Do not round down for partial vials. For example, a person whose body weight is 55 kg would need 3 vials of Lumoxiti powder for concentrate.
-  Individualise dosing based on the patient's actual body weight prior to the first dose of the first treatment cycle.
- o A change in dose should only be made between cycles when a change in weight of greater than 10% is observed from the weight used to calculate the first dose of the first treatment cycle. No change in dose should be made during a particular cycle.

Step 2: Reconstitute Lumoxiti vials Lumoxiti powder for concentrate must be reconstituted with water for injections. Water for injections is not provided in the pack. A solution (stabiliser) is provided inside the Lumoxiti carton and is added to the infusion bag prior to addition of reconstituted powder for concentrate. Do not use this solution (stabiliser) for reconstitution of the powder for concentrate.  Reconstitute each Lumoxiti powder for concentrate vial with 1.1 mL water for injections. o Direct the water for injection along the walls of the vial and not directly at the lyophilised powder. o The final vial concentration of the reconstituted Lumoxiti powder for concentrate (i.e. Lumoxiti concentrate) is 1 mg/mL.  Gently swirl the vial until completely dissolved. Invert the vial to ensure all powder in the vial is dissolved. Do not shake.  Visually inspect that the Lumoxiti concentrate is clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow, and free from visible particles. Do not use if solution is cloudy, discolored, or contains any particles. Following reconstitution, immediately proceed with the dilution process in Steps 3 and 4. Do not store the Lumoxiti concentrate. Step 3: Prepare infusion bag The solution (stabiliser) must be added to the infusion bag only. The solution (stabiliser) must be added to the infusion bag before the Lumoxiti concentrate is added. Only 1 vial of solution (stabiliser) should be used per infusion bag. Any extra vial(s) of solution (stabiliser) should be discarded.  Obtain a 50 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection infusion bag.  Add 1 mL solution (stabiliser) to the infusion bag. o Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake. Step 4: Add Lumoxiti concentrate to infusion bag Medicinal product no longer authorised

Withdraw the required volume (calculated from Step 1) of Lumoxiti concentrate from the reconstituted vial(s).

-  Inject Lumoxiti concentrate from the reconstituted vial(s) into the infusion bag containing 50 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and 1 mL solution (stabiliser).
-  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake.
-  Visually inspect the diluted Lumoxiti concentrate (i.e. Lumoxiti solution). Do not use if this solution is cloudy or contains any particles.

Following this dilution step, infuse the Lumoxiti solution (from the final infusion bag) immediately (step 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 5: Administer Lumoxiti

-  Immediately administer the Lumoxiti solution intravenously over 30 minutes. Use an infusion set fitted with a sterile, low-protein binding 0.22 micron in-line filter.
-  Do not mix Lumoxiti, or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products.
-  After the infusion, flush the intravenous administration line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same rate as the infusion. This ensures the full Lumoxiti dose is delivered.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Lumoxiti 1 mg powder for concentrate and solution for solution for infusion moxetumomab pasudotox

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start being given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Lumoxiti is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given Lumoxiti 3. How Lumoxiti will be given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Lumoxiti 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Lumoxiti is and what it is used for What Lumoxiti is Lumoxiti contains the active substance moxetumomab pasudotox. What Lumoxiti is used for Lumoxiti is used on its own to treat a rare cancer called hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) in which the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. It is intended for use in adults when:  the cancer has come back or  previous treatment has not worked. Lumoxiti is for patients who have received at least 2 other treatments for their HCL, including a type of medicine called purine nucleoside analogue. How Lumoxiti works Lumoxiti acts by attaching to cells that have a protein called CD22. HCL cells have this protein. After attaching to the HCL cells, the medicine delivers a substance into the cells that causes the HCL cell to die. 2. What you need to know before you are given Lumoxiti Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Do not use Lumoxiti:

-  if you are allergic to moxetumomab pasudotox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lumoxiti if you:

-  have had a blood vessel and kidney disease called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a serious side effect of Lumoxiti (see section 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  have had clots forming in small blood vessels due to a condition called severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
-  have had a condition whereby fluid leaks from your small blood vessels into your body called capillary leak syndrome (CLS). CLS is a serious side effect of Lumoxiti (see section 4).
-  have kidney problems.

Patients who have previously experienced any of the above conditions may be at greater risk of experiencing them again whilst undergoing treatment with Lumoxiti. If you think any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine.

## Tests and checks

Before and during treatment with Lumoxiti, your doctor may check your blood pressure and weight and carry out some tests. For example, blood tests and urine samples may be required to check how well your kidneys are working. Children and adolescents Lumoxiti should not be used in children and adolescents because it has not been studied in patients with HCL aged less than 18 years due to extreme rareness of HCL in these age groups. Other medicines and Lumoxiti Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Contraception, pregnancy and breast-feeding Contraception You must use effective birth control if you are a woman who could become pregnant while you are being treated with Lumoxiti. You must continue using birth control for at least 30 days after your last dose. Discuss with your doctor the most appropriate methods of birth control. Pregnancy Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. This is because Lumoxiti may harm your unborn baby.  Do not use Lumoxiti during pregnancy - unless you and your doctor agree that it is the best option.  If you become pregnant during Lumoxiti treatment - inform your doctor or nurse immediately. Breast-feeding Tell you doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. It is not known if Lumoxiti passes into your breast milk.  You and your doctor should decide what is best for you and for your baby.  This may mean that you will not breast-feed and receive Lumoxiti or that you will breast-feed and not receive Lumoxiti. Driving and using machines Lumoxiti is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you feel you are not able to concentrate well enough and react quickly, be careful when driving or using machines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other sources of information Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: Method of administration Lumoxiti is for intravenous use. Lumoxiti powder for concentrate must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Step 1: Calculate dose  Calculate the dose (mg) and the number of Lumoxiti powder for concentrate vials (1 mg/vial) to be reconstituted. Number of vials of Lumoxiti powder for concentrate =  0.04 mg/kg  x  patient weight (kg) 1 mg/vial o Do not round down for partial vials. For example, a person whose body weight is 55 kg would need 3 vials of Lumoxiti powder for concentrate.  Individualise dosing based on the patient's actual body weight prior to the first dose of the first treatment cycle. o A change in dose should only be made between cycles when a change in weight of greater than 10% is observed from the weight used to calculate the first dose of the first treatment cycle. No change in dose should be made during a particular cycle. Step 2: Reconstitute Lumoxiti vials Lumoxiti powder for concentrate must be reconstituted with water for injections. Water for injections is not provided in the pack. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A solution (stabiliser) is provided inside the Lumoxiti carton and is added to the infusion bag prior to addition of reconstituted powder for concentrate. Do not use this solution (stabiliser) for reconstitution of the powder for concentrate.

-  Reconstitute each Lumoxiti powder for concentrate vial with 1.1 mL water for injections.
- o Direct the water for injection along the walls of the vial and not directly at the lyophilised powder.
- o The final vial concentration of the reconstituted Lumoxiti powder for concentrate (i.e. Lumoxiti concentrate) is 1 mg/mL.

United Kingdom AstraZeneca UK Ltd Tel: +44 1582 836 836

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Gently swirl the vial until completely dissolved. Invert the vial to ensure all powder in the vial is dissolved. Do not shake.
-  Visually inspect that the Lumoxiti concentrate is clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow, and free from visible particles. Do not use if solution is cloudy, discolored, or contains any particles.

Following reconstitution, immediately proceed with the dilution process in Steps 3 and 4. Do not store the Lumoxiti concentrate.

## Step 3: Prepare infusion bag

The solution (stabiliser) must be added to the infusion bag only. The solution (stabiliser) must be added to the infusion bag before the Lumoxiti concentrate is added.

Only 1 vial of solution (stabiliser) should be used per infusion bag. Any extra vial(s) of solution (stabiliser) should be discarded.  Obtain a 50 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection infusion bag.  Add 1 mL solution (stabiliser) to the infusion bag. o Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake. Step 4: Add Lumoxiti concentrate to infusion bag Withdraw the required volume (calculated from Step 1) of Lumoxiti concentrate from the reconstituted vial(s).  Inject Lumoxiti concentrate from the reconstituted vial(s) into the infusion bag containing 50 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and 1 mL solution (stabiliser).  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake.  Visually inspect the diluted Lumoxiti concentrate (i.e. Lumoxiti solution). Do not use if this solution is cloudy or contains any particles. Following this dilution step, infuse the Lumoxiti solution (from the final infusion bag) immediately (step 5). Step 5: Administer Lumoxiti Lumoxiti is for intravenous use.  Immediately administer the Lumoxiti solution intravenously over 30 minutes. Use an infusion set fitted with a sterile, low-protein binding 0.22 micron in-line filter.  Do not mix Lumoxiti, or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products.  After the infusion, flush the intravenous administration line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same rate as the infusion. This ensures the full Lumoxiti dose is delivered. Disposal Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
