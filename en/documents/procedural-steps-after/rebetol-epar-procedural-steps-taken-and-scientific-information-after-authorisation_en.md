This type II variation is grouped with a type 1b variation to update section 5.2 of the SmPC with agreed wording on the bioequivalence between oral solution and capsule formulations, as requested in FU2 57.4. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0 and to include some minor editorial and linguistic revisions. C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested Medicinal product | 21/11/2013 | 28/04/2014 no | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | To address the CHMP concern regarding the reversibility of growth inhibition observed in children treated with ribavirin in combination with (pegylated) interferon, the MAH performed a long-term follow-up of study P02538 in children treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin bitherapy and study P01906 in children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. The final results from the long-term follow-up of these studies confirm that height (linear growth) can be seriously affected by combination therapy with (pegylated) interferon/ribavirin, in particular in paediatric patients treated for 48 weeks or longer. Growth inhibition that may be irreversible was observed in some patients. As reflected in the product information, initiation of therapy in children who have not reached their adult height should be restrictive and carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. In a single dose, crossover study of ribavirin in healthy adult subjects, the capsule and oral solution formulations were found to be bioequivalent. This information has been |

The malformative risk is possible in human, but it is not confirmed. For paternal exposure, the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. Taking into account the number of reference cases outnumbering 300 after paternal exposure with no increase of congenital anomaly risk, it is |

In order to get a better insight to this issue, and to improve the information available to prescribers in SmPC of interferon-alfa containing products, the CHMP requested the MAH to provide yearly literature review on the management of psychiatric disorders in HCV- infected patients. This first literature review indicated that, as for patients with psychiatric disorders, patients with substance abuse/use need to be carefully managed with the aim of improving the adherence to therapy and the treatment success. It was noted that this issue was currently not addressed in the SmPC of interferon- alfa/ribavirin containing products as well as data on the management of patients with alcohol abuse. Thus, the recommendations in the product information for this sensitive population of patients have been updated. |

Some cases reported in post- marketing with one of these combinations had also been added in this section (such as pure red cell aplasia, seizure or pancreatitis). However, a certain number of adverse reactions reported in post-marketing and generally attributed to interferon therapy but that had been reported in the context of hepatitis C therapy (thus, in combination with Rebetol) were unlisted in the Rebetol SPC. For the sake of consistency and clarity, section 4.8 of Rebetol SPC has therefore been entirely reviewed to include adverse events reported in post-marketing with Rebetol in combination with interferon-containing products. authorised   |

| II/0037 | Update of section 4.8 of the SPC to include the adverse reaction \"seizure\", as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of PSURs 10 and 11 (covering the period from 25 July 2005 to 24 July 2006). Section 4 of the PL has been updated accordingly and has been further completed in order to reflect all adverse events listed in the SPC. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet product | 24/05/2007 | 09/07/2007 no | SmPC and PL         | During the period covered by PSURs 10 and 11 (25 July 2005 to 24 July 2006), 9 serious cases of seizures or convulsions were reported. Some of them occurred in patients without a history of convulsion. The role of ribavirin in these cases could not be excluded due to a suggestive temporal causality. Furthermore, \"seizure\" is already listed in the Company Core Data Sheet for Rebetol and is also mentioned in the SPCs of peginterferon alfa-2b and interferon alfa-2b. Therefore, the CHMP considered that this adverse event should be included in the Rebetol SPC as well as in the Package Leaflet. |

No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed regarding neurobehavioral or reproductive development. In view of the results of the preclinical study on bone growth, a warning was warranted in order to highlight to prescribers the need to clearly assess the benefit-risk of the combined use of ribavirin and interferon alpha 2b in young children in period of growth. Sections 4.4 and 5.3 of the SPC are updated accordingly. longer authorised |

The Package Leaflet has been updated to reflect the SPC changes. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Medicinal product | 28/06/2006 no | SmPC and PL | Following a safety review on suicide and attempted suicide Section 4.4 of the SPCs of a number of the interferon alfa- 2b products and Rebetol were updated to include a warning on the duration of psychiatric disorders. This update took place in September 2005. On assessment of a subsequent pharmacovigilance follow up measure for Rebetol the CHMP requested a class labelling to put more emphasis on psychiatric disorders in the SPC and Package Leaflet of the interferon-alfa and ribavarin containing products. Due to differences in the indications it was not possible to propose a class labelling \"text\" for all these products. Therefore the existing paragraphs pertaining to psychiatric disorders in the SPC and Package Leaflet of Rebetol have been moved to the beginning of the corresponding sections and placed in a warning box in order to draw attention to these serious adverse effects. |

(period covered  8 March 2004 to 9 September 2004) a report has drawn attention to a potential increase of anaemia in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV who received concomitant treatment with interferon or pegylated interferon and  ribavirin with Zidovudine (AZT). As anaemia is an important limiting factor for the success of combination therapy in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, the safety data with regard to the necessity to include a warning in the SPC and Package Leaflet were reviewed. In light of this safety review the CHMP concluded that the hypothesis of an interference between haemolysis due to ribavirin and the myelosuppresive effect of AZT with reduction of erythropoiesis as suggested in literature should be taken into consideration. This has been reflected as a warning in the SPC's of Rebetol, IntronA/ Viraferon, and PegIntron/ViraferonPeg.

Following the assessment of PSUR 8 of Rebetol (8 November 2003 to 7 November 2004) concerns were raised regarding the risk of mitochondrial toxicity when ribavarin is co-administered with didanosine. Further to a safety review on lactic acidosis/mitochondrial toxicity, the SPC of Rebetol was updated in order to warn clinicians against coadministration of ribavirin and didanosine. During the evaluation of the data regarding didanosine and the risk of mitochondrial toxicity the CHMP also noted that there were arguments suggesting that coadministration of ribavirin with stavudine also increased the risk of mitochondrial toxicity and considered that the prescription of stavudine should be avoided as far as possible in HIV/HVC co-infected patients in order to reduce the risk of overlapping mitochondrial toxicity, all the more because

alert the prescribers to the fact that patients treated with Rebetol and  interferon combination therapy and Zidovudine could be at an increased risk of anaemia, further to the assessment of PSUR 7 of interferon alfa-2b (period covered  8 March 2004 to 9 September 2004) as well as Pharmacovigilance follow-up measure.  Section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC has also been updated with a  warning  pertaining to coadministration of ribavirin and didanosine and the consequent risk of mitochondrial toxicity,  upon CHMP request, further to the assessment of PSUR 8 (8 November 2003 to 7 November 2004) of Rebetol. The Package Leaflet has been up dated accordingly. Further, section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated with a warning pertaining to the coadminstration of stavudine and ribavirin and the consequent risk of mitochondrial toxicity, upon CHMP request, further to the assessment of PSUR 8 of Rebetol. The Package Leaflet has been up dated accordingly. In section 4.2 of the SPC a minor correction to the paragraph on duration of treatment is introduced in order to replace the term  \"posology\" by \"duration of treatment\" and the annexes have been updated in line with the latest QRD template (version 7).

| II/0027 | Update of the information in section 5.1 of Rebetol SPC with results of the long-term follow-up protocol to assess patients after completing 24 weeks of follow-up in a Clinical trial for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with Rebetol and IntronA. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 23/02/2006 product | 29/03/2006 no | SmPC                   | This was a 5-year, long-term follow-up study of naïve or relapse subjects who completed the 24-week follow-up period in 1 of 6, placebo controlled treatment protocols comparing IntronA (non pegylated interferon alfa- 2b)/Rebetol (ribavirin) combination therapy (for 24 or 48 weeks), with Intron A monotherapy (for 24 or 48 weeks) in naïve or relapse subjects. Long-term follow-up began at the Follow-Up Week 24 visit in the treatment protocol, ie, 6 months post-treatment. The results of the study confirm the durability of the virologic response up to 5 years. The likelihood of maintaining virologic response over 5 years in subjects who initially achieved a sustained response is 97% with a 95% Confidence Interval of [95%, 99%]. The limitations of the study (limited percentage of non responders that enter the long term study and high number of discontinuation), preclude any conclusion across initial treatment groups. Further, if the long-term clearance of the virus could be considered as a clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events related to progression of liver disease. This change in section 5.1 of the SPC applies to Rebetol and also to Intron A and Viraferon, both non pegylated interferon alfa-2b. longer authorised |

| II/0026   | To update section 4.4 of the SPC with a wording on the possibility of dental and periodontal disorders together with a recommendation to promote optimal health and to include a wording on the psychiatric disorders as requested by CHMP in its conclusions (FUM 025) dated 7 April 2005 further to the review of the safety database of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH). Corresponding revisions to point 2 of the PL are proposed. The address of the Polish representative is updated in point 6 of the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Medicinal product | 15/09/2005   | 25/10/2005 no | SmPC and PL       | A total of 392 cases of dental disorders were reported through 1st April 2004 in the Schering-Plough Safety Database. Most of the cases were reported as \"tooth disorder\" without other specification precluding to any physiopathological interpretation. Furthermore, in France, there was concern about a worrying reporting of 7 non- serious and 1 serious cases of receding and teeth brittle for which no obvious aetiology other than hepatitis combination therapy was considered. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the substantial number of cases of tooth loss reported, including cases with a possible relationship to HCV treatment, along with the fact that reporting of such events is rather unusual in pharmacovigilance support the need to include the risk for the significant dental complication (loss of teeth) in the SPC and the PL. A total of 2077 cases of suicide-related events were reported through 7st June 2004 in the Schering-Plough Safety Database. Analysis by time to event and age group showed that: 1) there is no obvious trend for a higher reporting rate of suicide-related AE in the youngest population when taken into account demographic and epidemiologic data; 2) interestingly, a predominance of suicide attempt and complete suicide were reported in the early follow-up period. The CHMP concluded that in accordance with literature and the available data from Schering-Plough database, the wording on psychiatric and CNS disorders in Section 4.4 of the SPC for Rebetol should longer authorised |

| II/0025 | To update section 4.2 and section 5.1 of the SPC with new data obtained in the genotype 1 low viral load final study report: \"PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b) plus Rebetol (ribavirin) for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in previously untreated subjects infected with HCV 2 or 3 or 2/3 and subjects with HCV 1 with pre-treatment HCV-RNA \" 2,000,000 copies/ml\". The PL has been updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet product | 27/07/2005 | 30/08/2005 no | SmPC and PL | Single arm, open label, European multicenter study of 24 weeks of treatment with PEGINTRON (peg-interferon) plus REBETOL (Ribavirin) in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in anti-hepatitis C naïve patients infected with HCV 2 or 3 or 2/3 and in anti-hepatitis C pretreated patients infected with HCV 1 and with a HCV-RNA < 2,000, 000 copies/ml was presented. In total, 235 subjects with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin. The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%. Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 24 of therapy. In this subgroup, there was a 92 %(89/97) sustained virological response rate. The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48). Limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 24 weeks of treatment). longer authorised |
