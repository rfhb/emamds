## Questions and answers on the review of gadolinium-containing contrast agents

The European Medicines Agency has completed a review of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)  in  patients  receiving  gadolinium-containing  contrast  agents.  The  Agency's  Committee  for Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  has  concluded  that  a  number  of  measures  need  to  be introduced  into  the  prescribing  information  for  these  medicines,  to  minimise  the  risk  of  NSF associated with their use.

The review was carried out under 'Article 31' 1 and 'Article 20' 2 referrals.

## What are gadolinium-containing contrast agents?

Gadolinium-containing contrast agents are diagnostic agents used in patients undergoing a magnetic resonance  imaging  (MRI)  scan.  They  contain  gadolinium,  a  'rare  earth'  metal,  which  is  used  as  a 'contrast enhancer' to help make the inside of the body more visible on the scan. The medicines are only used by MR specialists. Patients receive an injection of the contrast agent just before or during the scan.

Gadolinium-containing  contrast  agents  include  nine  different  active  substances:  gadobenic  acid, gadobutrol, gadodiamide, gadofosveset, gadopentetic acid, gadoteric acid, gadoteridol, gadoversetamide and gadoxetic acid.

Most of these medicines are authorised nationally. Two  of these products  -  OptiMARK (gadoversetamide) and Vasovist (gadofosveset) - have received a marketing authorisation that is valid throughout the European Union (EU).

## Why were gadolinium-containing contrast agents reviewed?

An association between the use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents and NSF was first observed in  January  2006,  when cases of the disease were reported in Denmark and Austria in patients with kidney problems undergoing MRI scans. NSF is a rare disease that causes thickening of the skin and connective tissues in patients with severe kidney problems. It may affect several organs such as the liver, lungs and heart.

During 2007, more cases of the disease were reported and the CHMP's Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) held several discussions to establish how the risk of NSF could be reduced.

1 Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, referral under Community interest.

2 Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

In December 2007, the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) for Diagnostics of the CHMP was convened to discuss the approach of the PhVWP. The SAG agreed with the PhVWP that the risk of developing NSF depends on the type of gadolinium-containing contrast agent used, and advised that these agents should be categorised into three groups:

- high  risk: gadoversetamide  (OptiMARK),  gadodiamide  (Omniscan)  and  gadopentetic  acid (Magnevist, Magnegita, and Gado-MRT-ratiopharm);
- low risk: gadoteric acid (Dotarem), gadoteridol (ProHance) and gadobutrol (Gadovist).
- medium  risk: gadofosveset (Vasovist), gadoxetic acid (Primovist) and gadobenic acid (MultiHance);

The  SAG  also  highlighted  the  need  to  harmonise  the  prescribing  information  regarding  the  use  of these agents particularly in high-risk groups, such as pregnant and breast-feeding women, children, the elderly and patients undergoing liver transplant.

Consequently, in November 2008 the Danish medicines regulatory agency asked the CHMP to carry out an assessment of the risk of NSF for the non-centrally authorised gadolinium-containing contrast agents,  and  to  recommend  measures  that  could  be  taken  to  reduce  this  risk.  At  the  same  time,  the European  Commission  requested  the  CHMP  to  carry  out  the  same  assessment  for  the  centrally authorised agents.

## Which data has the CHMP reviewed?

The CHMP has assessed all of the available information on the risks of NSF associated with the use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents, particularly those used in patients with kidney problems and patients receiving a liver transplant, in neonates and infants, the elderly and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. This  included  information  from  preclinical and  clinical studies, as well as information provided by the companies that make the medicines.

## What are the conclusions of the CHMP?

Based  on  the  evaluation  of  the  currently  available  data  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the Committee, the CHMP agreed with the SAG classification of gadolinium-containing contrast agents into  high-,  medium-  and  low-risk  agents  based  on  their  risk  of  causing  NSF.  However,  the  CHMP recognised  that  within  the  high-risk  group  the  risk  of  NSF  with  gadoversetamide  and  gadodiamide appears higher than with gadopentetic acid, based on physicochemical properties, studies in animals and the number of cases of NSF reported worldwide. The Committee also concluded that an additional factor that may contribute to the risk of NSF is the way these medicines are used (such as the dose, how often they are given and for how long).

To minimise the risk of NSF the Committee recommended a number of changes to the prescribing information of these medicines, depending on the risk classification of the agents.

For high-risk gadolinium-containing contrast agents, the CHMP recommended that:

- their  dose  should  be  restricted  to  the  minimum  recommended  dose  in  patients  with  moderate kidney problems and infants up to one year of age, and there should be at least a period of seven days between scans;
- they must not be used in patients with severe kidney problems, in patients around the time of liver transplantation, and in newborn babies less than four weeks of age, who are known to have immature kidneys;
- as a precaution, breastfeeding should be discontinued for at least 24 hours after the patient has received a high-risk agent;
- all patients should be screened for kidney problems using laboratory tests before receiving these agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For medium- and low-risk agents the CHMP recommended that:

- their  dose  should  be  restricted  to  the  minimum  recommended  dose  in  patients  with  severe kidney problems, patients around the time of liver transplantation and neonates and infants up to one year of age, and there should be at least a period of seven days between scans;
- warnings should be added to the prescribing information for their use in patients with severe kidney problems and patients receiving a liver transplant;
- the decision to continue or suspend breastfeeding for at least 24 hours after a scan should be taken by the doctor and the mother;
- screening  for  kidney  problems  using  laboratory  tests  is  recommended  for  all  patients  before receiving these agents.

In addition, the prescribing information of all gadolinium-containing contrast agents should include:

- a statement that there is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis (a blood clearance technique) to prevent or treat NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis;
- a warning that the elderly may be at particular risk of NSF, because their kidneys are less able to remove gadolinium from the body;
- information on the cases of NSF reported for each agent.

Finally, the CHMP recommended that further studies should be carried out on the long-term retention of gadolinium in human tissues (such as bone) released from gadolinium-containing contrast agents.

A communication containing the key messages of this review will be distributed to doctors at national level.

## What are the recommendations for patients and prescribers?

- These medicines should only be used in accordance with the updated prescribing information.
- Gadolinium-containing  contrast  agents  remain  suitable  diagnostic  agents  for  use  in  patients undergoing an MRI scan, but doctors should be aware of the associated risk of NSF especially in patients with kidney problems, and other high-risk groups.
- Doctors should record in the patient's notes the type and dose of contrast agent used.
- Patients who have any questions should speak to their doctor.

The European Commission issued a decision on 1 July 2010.
