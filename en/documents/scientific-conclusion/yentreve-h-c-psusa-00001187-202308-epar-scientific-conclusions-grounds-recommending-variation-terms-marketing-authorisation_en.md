## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for duloxetine, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS ) and stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) from the literature, spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC  considers  a  causal relationship  between  duloxetine  and  NMS  and  stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing duloxetine should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for duloxetine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing duloxetine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
