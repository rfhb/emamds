The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement a minor correction in section 5.1 of the SmPC, to implement editorial changes and to align the annexes with the latest QRD template. An updated RMP version 3.3 was agreed during the procedure.

| II/0032   | Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC, following a cumulative review of Acute Kidney Injury events undertaken upon request by PRAC (EPITT No 19204), to add information regarding the potential for dulaglutide to possibly contribute to the volume depletion event, which could indirectly contribute to the occurrence of AKI. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the local representatives in the package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 31/01/2019 | 23/08/2019 | SmPC and PL | Dehydration, sometimes leading to acute renal failure or worsening renal impairment, has been reported in patients treated with dulaglutide, especially at the initiation of treatment. Many of the reported adverse renal events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or dehydration. Patients treated with dulaglutide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration, particularly in relation to gastrointestinal side- effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. |

| II/0022   | Update of sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for Trulicity following completion of a Phase 3 study H9X-MCGBDX comparing the effect of once-weekly Trulicity with insulin glargine on glycaemic control over 52 weeks in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and moderate or severe chronic kidney disease. In addition, the MAH took to opportunity to update the ATC code and to correct the \"Instructions for use\" in Section 6.6 of the SmPC to make it consistent with instructions on \"How to store Trulicity\" in the Package Leaflet (PL), which was also updated in section 2 'Warnings and precautions' to reflect the information in the 'renal impairment' section 4.2 of the SmPC. The RMP version 1.12 has also been agreed. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/01/2018   | 22/02/2018 | SmPC and PL | No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <90 to ≥15 mL/min/1.73m2). There is very limited experience in patients with end stage renal disease (<15 ml/min/1.73m2), therefore Trulicity cannot be recommended in this population. In a 52 week study, Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were compared to titrated insulin glargine as add-on to prandial insulin lispro to evaluate the effect on glycaemic control and safety of patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Patients discontinued their prestudy insulin regimen at randomisation. The pharmacokinetic profile of Trulicity 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies. This clinical study did not include patients with end stage renal disease. At 26 weeks, both Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg were non- |

A similar percentage of patients achieved HbA1c targets of < 8.0 %at 26 and 52 weeks with both dulaglutide doses as well as insulin glargine. The rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia with Trulicity 1.5 mg and Trulicity 0.75 mg, and insulin glargine were 4.44, 4.34, and 9.62 episodes/patient/year, respectively. No patients reported cases of severe hypoglycaemia with Trulicity 1.5 mg, six with Trulicity 0.75 mg, and seventeen with insulin glargine. The safety profile of Trulicity in patients with renal impairment was similar to that observed in other studies with Trulicity. For more detailed information please refer to the Summary   |

| II/0013   | Update of sections 4.2, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Trulicity following completion of a phase 3b Study (Study H9X-MCGBDI (GBDI)) to reflect the study's findings concerning the use of dulaglutide in combination with basal insulin. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 13/10/2016   | 12/12/2016   | SmPC and PL        | With this variation the product information of Trulicity was updated to include information from a new study which examined the efficacy and safety of Trulicity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were already receiving therapy with basal insulin with or without metformin. The safety data from the new study were consistent with the findings of previous studies with Trulicity. In general, there were no significant new or unexpected findings and the new safety data from the study do not raise any major concerns. The key relevant safety information and warnings are already included in the SmPC but updates to Sections 4.2, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1 were agreed to include the specific findings of the study about the concomitant use of dulaglutide with basal insulin.                                                                                                   |

| II/0012   | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information to reflect findings from a recently completed phase 3b study (Study H9X-MC-GBDG (GBDG)) concerning the use of dulaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea alone. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                                                                         | 13/10/2016   | 12/12/2016   | SmPC and Labelling | With this variation the product information of Trulicity is updated to include information from a new study which examined the efficacy and safety of Trulicity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were already receiving therapy with a sulphonylurea, a common class of drugs used to lower blood sugar. The results of the study confirmed the efficacy of dulaglutide in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, when taken as add-on to a sulphonylurea. New safety data from the study did not raise any new safety concerns. The relevant key safety information and warnings are already included in the SmPC but an update, as proposed by the MAH, was needed to include the specific findings of the study about the concomitant use of dulaglutide with a sulphonylurea alone. As a consequence, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were updated. |
