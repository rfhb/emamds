## 1. Introduction

On 26-11-2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study, Study CA209744, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) Nº1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

Nivolumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumour growth.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Nivolumab (OPDIVO) is approved worldwide for the treatment of multiple tumour types, as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab and other medicinal products. Among the currently approved indications, OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with R/R cHL after ASCT and treatment with brentuximab vedotin (Bv) or after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy including ASCT.

Study CA209744 is part of the agreed Nivolumab (OPDIVO) Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) covering the conditions of treatment of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue and treatment of malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system (PIP number: EMEA-001407-PIP02-15-M07; latest EMA Decision P/0138/2024, dated 06-May-2024). The submission of these data is intended to fulfil the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) Nº 1901/2006, which sets out the obligation for marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) to submit any MAH-sponsored study involving the use of an authorised medicinal product in the paediatric population to the competent authority, within six months of its completion.

In addition, submission of the results of Study CA209744 is planned as part of a future variation.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Subjects received nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion, on Day 8 of cycle 1 and then on Day 1 for each subsequent 3-week treatment cycle.

The brentuximab vedotin (Bv) dose was 1.8 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of every 3week treatment cycle, and Bv 1.8 mg/kg (Day 1 of each cycle) in combination with bendamustine 90 mg/m2 (Days 1 and 2 of each cycle).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final report(s) for Study CA209744.

CA209744 is a Phase 2, open-label study intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg + brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg (hereafter referred to as N+Bv) in pediatric and young adult

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects with R/R CD30 + cHL after failure of first-line therapy. There were 2 treatment cohorts in this study:

- Cohort R1 for subjects at low risk of relapse and
- Cohort R2 for subjects at standard risk of relapse.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study CA209744

Study CA209744 is a Risk-based, Response-adapted, Phase II Open-Label Trial of Nivolumab + Brentuximab Vedotin (N+ Bv) for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults (age: 5 to &lt; 30 years) with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) CD30 + Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after Failure of First-line Therapy, followed by Brentuximab Vedotin + Bendamustine (Bv + B) for Participants with a Suboptimal Response.

All subjects entered the Induction Phase and received treatment with N+ Bv. Subjects moved into the Intensification Phase if they received treatment with Bv+B. Subjects moved into the Consolidation Phase if they received radiation therapy (Cohort R1) or HDCT/ASCT (Cohort R2).

The planned study duration included a treatment period of 6 to 8 months and a follow-up period of at least 36 months after completion of treatment for all subjects.

## Methods

## Study participants

The enrolled population consisted of males and females, 5 through 30 years of age, with confirmed cHL, excluding nodular lymphocyte-predominant cHL, after failure of or non-response to first-line therapy, at least 1 measurable site of disease using Lugano 2014 criteria (International Working Group criteria), and FDG-PET-avid and bidimensional measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm in longest axis as documented by radiographic technique (CT preferred).

Subjects &gt; 16 years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level ≥ 50%, and participants ≤ 16 years of age must have a Lansky performance level ≥ 50. Subjects who previously received an allogeneic and/or ASCT for cHL were excluded, as were subjects with prior exposure to anti-PD1, antiPDL1, anti-PD-L2, anti CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.

## Treatments

Subjects received nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion, on Day 8 of cycle 1 and then on Day 1 for each subsequent 3-week treatment cycle. This dose was selected for treatment of all subjects based on the preliminary analysis from Study CA209070 showing similar exposures in paediatric and adult subjects.

The Bv dose (1.8 mg/kg as a 30-minute infusion on Day 1 of every 3-week treatment cycle) used in this study has been shown to be generally well tolerated and is approved for the treatment in adult patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma in both the US and EU. Bv 1.8 mg/kg (Day 1 of each cycle) in combination with bendamustine 90 mg/m2 (Days 1 and 2 of each cycle) was selected for use in this study based on a manageable safety profile reported in a Phase 1/2 clinical study.

## Premedication

Subjects treated with N+Bv received prophylactic premedication ≥ 30 minutes prior to study treatment starting at Cycle 2: famotidine (adult: 40 mg IV; paediatric: 0.5 mg/kg IV) and diphenhydramine (adult: 50 mg IV; paediatric: 1 mg/kg IV) or equivalent H2/H1 blocker.

Subjects treated with Bv+B received prophylactic premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines 30-60 minutes prior to Bv infusion (days when Bv and bendamustine were administered): methylprednisone (adult: 100 mg IV or equivalent; paediatric: 0.8 mg/kg) and diphenhydramine (adult: 50 mg IV or equivalent; pediatric: 1 mg/kg).

Acetaminophen (adult: 650 mg; paediatric: 15 mg/kg) was administered as premedication per investigator discretion.

## Dose Modifications

Dose reductions or escalations were not permitted for nivolumab. Dose reductions of Bv were allowed down to 1.2 mg/kg; dose escalations above 1.8 mg/kg were not permitted. Dose modifications for bendamustine were permitted per local package insert or patient information leaflet. Dose delays were permitted for all study treatments. If nivolumab or Bv doses were delayed, the other study treatment was also delayed until combination therapy was resumed.

## Objective(s)

Primary Objectives:

- Cohort R1 (Low Risk): To describe the complete metabolic response (CMR) rate prior to Radiation Therapy (RT) and event-free survival (EFS) rate at 3 years, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), using Lugano 2014 response criteria.
- Cohort R2 (Standard Risk): To describe the CMR rate prior to high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (HDCT/ASCT) by BICR, using Lugano 2014 response criteria.

## Secondary Objectives:

- To assess overall response rate (ORR) (CMR + partial metabolic response [PMR]) using Lugano 2014 criteria of the low risk and standard risk cohorts following 4 cycles of N + Bv by BICR.
- To assess progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 years by BICR using Lugano 2014 criteria.
- Duration of Response (DOR) will be evaluated for those participants who achieved PMR or CMR by BICR as well as for those participants who achieved CMR by BICR prior to RT in the low risk cohort and for those participants who achieved CMR prior to HDCT/ASCT in the standard risk cohort.
- To evaluate efficacy as assessed by investigators using Lugano 2014 response criteria.
- To describe the toxicity of N + Bv in combination in paediatric and young adult participants with R/R cHL after failure of first-line treatment.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Efficacy Endpoints:

## Cohort R1:

- CMR rate by BICR at any time prior to RT

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- EFS rate at 3 years.

## Cohort R2:

- CMR rate by BICR at any time prior to HDCT/ASCT

The CMR rate is defined as the proportion of all response-evaluable participants who, assessed by the BICR, achieve best response of CMR using Lugano 2014 criteria.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

Both Cohort R1 and R2:

- ORR by BICR following 4 cycles of N+Bv
- PFS rate by BICR at 3 years
- DOR for subjects who achieved PMR or CMR by BICR
- All of the above efficacy endpoints (CMR, ORR, PFS, DOR) by Investigator

## Secondary Safety Endpoint:

Serious and non-serious AEs, clinical laboratory tests (haematology, chemistry, urinalysis), vital sign measurements

## Sample size

The sample size was not based on any formal statistical testing or power considerations. This study targeted treating initially approximately 40 subjects in each risk cohort. Subsequently due to a change in enrolment projections in Cohort R1, the sample size was modified to reduce the total number of participants from 80 to 72 (total number of treated participants enrolled in Cohort R1 = 28 and Cohort R2 = 44) to be able to proceed with closing the study and reporting the results in a timeframe that could be more meaningful for paediatric participants and treating physicians. Assuming 24 responders out of 28 Cohort R1 participants, the exact 2-sided 90% confidence interval would be 70.23% to 94.97%. Subjects who were not response-evaluable in Cohort R2 were replaced. The width of 90% CIs for CMR rate/ORR in Cohort R2 was provided (Table 3) to illustrate the precision of estimation based on this sample size (assuming different scenarios of observed response).

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Study CA209744 is as an open-label study.

An aligned risk-stratified algorithm was used to stratify subjects to Cohort R1 (low risk) or Cohort R2 (standard risk) based on relapse-risk category. All subjects were assigned to treatment using an IRT.

## Statistical Methods

The rate of CMR per BICR (using Lugano 2014 criteria) at any time prior to HDCT/ASCT was derived from the time-point assessments provided by the BICR and analysed based on the population of response-evaluable subjects. The estimated CMR rate and the exact 2-sided 90% CI are provided.

The EFS function per BICR and the 3-year EFS rate were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier productlimit method when all participants had (whichever was earlier) been followed for at least 3 years, withdrawn consent, or had an EFS event. Its corresponding 90% CI was derived based on Greenwood formula for variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied on the survivor function s(t).

The estimated ORR per BICR and an exact 2-sided 90% CI is provided. The PFS function per BICR and the 3-year PFS rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method when all participants had been followed for at least 3 years, died, progressed, or withdrawn consent, whichever is earlier. The DOR per BICR was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. In addition to the responders of CMR or PMR (primary analysis), the duration of complete response (DOCR) was also estimated (CMR responders). Time to response is summarized by response type (CMR or PMR, CMR, and PMR). The same analyses described above was performed using investigator assessments as well. The OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method for Cohorts R1 and R2, respectively.

The following descriptive analyses were conducted for PRO:

- PRO questionnaire completion rate
- EQ-5D-3L VAS and UI: mean score and mean change from baseline using descriptive statistics and proportion of subjects reporting each response level for each dimension
- FACT-Lym total and subscale scores: mean score and mean change from baseline.

Safety analyses was performed in all treated participants per cohort. Descriptive statistics of safety are presented using NCI CTCAE version 4. All on-study AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs, and drug-related SAEs are tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE criteria by system organ class and MedDRA preferred term.

## Efficacy results

## Primary Endpoints:

- A total of 88.9% (90% CI: 69.0, 98.0) of paediatric subjects at low risk of relapse (Cohort R1) and 90.3% (90% CI: 76.8, 97.3) of subjects at standard risk of relapse (Cohort R2) achieved CMR per BICR prior to consolidation.
- The 3-year EFS rate in Cohort R1 was 79.8% (90% CI: 55.6, 91.7). 15 paediatric subjects (83.3%) were censored for EFS per BICR (on the date of last tumour assessment on-study or last assessment prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy).

## Secondary Endpoints:

- High rates of PFS and ORR per BICR following 4 cycles of N + Bv (&gt;90%) were observed in both Cohort R1 and Cohort R2. Efficacy assessments by investigator were comparable to those by BICR.

## Exploratory Endpoint:

- The 3-year OS (90%CI) rate was 100.0% (100.0, 100.0) in Cohort R1 and 96.7% (83.9, 99.3) in Cohort R2. Median OS was not reached in either Cohort.

The 5-year OS rates (90% CI) were 100% (100.0, 100.0) and 97.6% (88.0, 99.5) among all treated subjects in Cohorts R1 and R2, respectively, with similar results observed within each cohort for treated paediatric subjects.

The overall safety profile of N + Bv in Cohort R1 and Cohort R2 (all treated subjects and treated paediatric subjects) was manageable and consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual components. No new safety signals or toxicities were identified.

- 1 death was reported in the treated paediatric population in Cohort R2; the cause of death was reported as disease.
- The overall frequencies (all causality and drug related) of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were similar between all treated subjects and treated paediatric subjects in both cohorts.
- In Cohort R1, the most frequently (≥25% subjects) reported all -causality AEs were headache, nausea, pyrexia, and ALT increased in the all-treated subjects while nausea, headache, and pyrexia were the most frequently reported AEs in the treated paediatric subjects. In Cohort R2, the most frequently (≥ 25%) reported all -causality AEs were nausea, diarrhoea, and pyrexia in the all-treated and treated paediatric subjects.
- In Cohort R1, pyrexia was the only SAE that was reported in &gt; 1 subject in the all-treated and treated paediatric subjects. In Cohort R2, the SAEs that were reported in &gt; 1 subject were pyrexia and hypersensitivity in the all-treated subjects while hypersensitivity was reported in the treated paediatric subjects.
- In Cohort R1, Grade 3-4 AEs reported in &gt; 1 subject were AST increased (3 subjects) and ALT increased (2 subjects) in all treated subjects while no Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in &gt; 1 subject in the treated paediatric subjects. In Cohort R2, Grade 3-4 AEs reported in &gt; 1 subject were neutropenia (3 subjects) and infusion-related reaction (2 subjects) in the all-treated subjects while neutropenia (3 subjects) was reported in the treated paediatric subjects.
- Select AEs and IMAEs were mostly Grade 1-2 and were manageable.
- All drug-related select AEs and IMAEs were reported to have resolved prior to the clinical cutoff date.
- Laboratory abnormalities (haematology, liver, kidney, and thyroid function tests, and electrolytes) were primarily Grade 1-2 in severity and were consistent across all treated and treated paediatric population.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

## Hematology

Cohort R1

Grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities reported in treated subjects or treated pediatric subjects included:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- All treated subjects: hemoglobin (1 subject), lymphocytes (2 subjects), absolute neutrophil count (3 subjects).
- Treated pediatric subjects: hemoglobin (1 subject), lymphocytes (1 subject).

A shift from Grade 0/1/2 at baseline to Grade 3/4 post-baseline was observed for the following hematology parameters:

- All treated subjects: hemoglobin (1 subject), absolute neutrophil count (3 subjects), lymphocytes (2 subjects each).
- Treated pediatric subjects (Table S.R1.7.25.2): hemoglobin (1 subject) and lymphocytes (1 subject).

## Cohort R2

Grade 3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities reported in treated subjects or treated pediatric subjects included:

- All treated subjects: platelet count (1 subject), leukocytes (3 subjects), lymphocytes (8 subjects), and absolute neutrophil count (5 subjects).
- Treated pediatric subjects: platelet count (1 subject), leukocytes (3 subjects), lymphocytes (7 subjects), and absolute neutrophil count (5 subjects).

A shift from Grade 0/1/2 at baseline to Grade 3/4 post-baseline was observed for platelet count (1 subject), leukocytes (3 subjects), lymphocytes (4 subjects), absolute neutrophil count (5 subjects) in all treated subjects and treated pediatric subjects.

## Serum Chemistry

## Liver Function Tests

## Cohort R1

Grade 3 or 4 hepatic abnormalities of AST and ALT (2 subjects each) were reported in all-treated subjects. None of the treated pediatric subjects had Grade 3 or 4 hepatic abnormalities.

A total of 8 (28.6%) all-treated subjects and 3 (16.7%) treated pediatric subjects reported ALT or AST increased &gt; 3× ULN and none of these subjects had concurrent elevation in bilirubin &gt; 2× ULN.

## Cohort R2

Grade 3 or 4 hepatic abnormalities of AST and ALT (2 subjects each) were reported in all-treated and treated pediatric subjects.

A total of 5 (11.4%) all-treated subjects and 4 (12.9%) treated pediatric subjects reported ALT or AST increased &gt; 3× ULN and none of these subjects had concurrent elevation in bilirubin &gt; 2× ULN.

## Kidney Function Tests

## Cohorts R1 and R2

Abnormalities in creatinine (increases from baseline) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and no Grade 3 or 4 increased creatinine levels were reported in all treated subjects or treated pediatric subjects.

## Thyroid Function Tests

## Cohort R1

## Immunogenicity

In Cohort R1, none of the subjects were ADA-positive at baseline while in Cohort R2, 2 subjects were ADA positive for nivolumab, including 1 pediatric subject at baseline. Post-baseline, among all treated subjects in Cohorts R1 and R2, a majority (~96% and 59% respectively) were brentuximab ADA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

positive while a smaller proportion (36%, and ~13% respectively) were nivolumab ADA positive with a similar trend observed within each cohort for the pediatric subjects.

All subjects with ADAs to brentuximab had neutralizing antibodies while none of the subjects with ADAs to nivolumab had neutralizing antibodies. Despite the higher brentuximab ADA and neutralizing antibody incidences, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions in the study was small and the combination of nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin was able to induce a CMR before consolidation in &gt;90% of patients.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study CA209744 is a risk-based, response-adapted, Phase 2, open-label trial of nivolumab + brentuximab vedotin (N +Bv) for children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD30 + classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after failure of first-line therapy, followed by brentuximab + bendamustine (Bv + B) for participants with a suboptimal response.

The R1 cohort (for subjects at low risk of relapse) received N+Bv for 2 cycles (6 weeks) followed by tumour assessments (TA). Participants with radiographic progression, assessed by the Investigator at cycle 2 of N+Bv, taken off the study treatment and entered follow-up. All other participants received 2 additional cycles of N+Bv study treatment (total 4 cycles = 12 weeks).

Participants who developed a complete metabolic response (CMR), as assessed by BICR, after a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks) of N+Bv, received 2 additional cycles of N+Bv treatment (for a total of 6 cycles [18 weeks]), followed by Radiotherapy (RT).

The R2 cohort (for subjects at standard risk of relapse) received N+Bv for 2 cycles (6 weeks), followed by TA. Participants with radiographic progression, assessed by the Investigator at cycle 2 of N+Bv, were taken off from study treatment and entered follow-up (unless treatment beyond progression is indicated). All other participants received 2 additional cycles of N+Bv study therapy (total 4 cycles = 12 weeks).

Baseline disease characteristics of all treated paediatric subjects were consistent with those of a paediatric patient population with R/R cHL. In Cohort R1, most paediatric subjects (61.1%) had Stage IIA disease at study entry; while in Cohort R2, overall higher disease stages were reported at study entry, with 29.0% of subjects assessed as Stage IVA. The mean Karnofsky and Lansky performance status was &gt; 95% in both cohorts. The time from end of prior therapy to relapse was ≥ 12 months for most paediatric subjects in Cohort R1, while it was &lt; 12 months in most paediatric subjects in Cohort R2.

The median age of paediatric subjects was 16.0 years in Cohort R1 and 15.0 years in Cohort R2. The majority of subjects (77.6%) were from Europe or the United Kingdom.

Most subjects were in the age group of ≥ 5 years to &lt;18 years and of White race. In Cohort R1, most of the subjects were female while in Cohort R2, most of the subjects were male.

The study protocol has been amended 4 times. Most notably, Amendment 2 which added the coprimary endpoint CMR rate, and Amendment 4 which considered reducing the number of accrued R1 participants from 40 to 28 and closing recruitment in the R1 cohort due to feasibility issues encountered in accrual. The original size of the R1 cohort was estimated at approximately 40 participants.

In Study CA209744, participants received nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of each treatment cycle every 3 weeks, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or study termination, whichever comes first.

The selected dose was based on a previous study of nivolumab involving paediatric participants (CA209070). The preliminary analysis showed that paediatric participants (6-12 years) have similar exposure to adults.

Brentuximab vedotin is generally well tolerated in paediatric patients at a dose of up to 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Five participants aged 12-17 with cHL were enrolled in the pivotal Phase 2 trial that led to the FDA approval and there were no common severe toxicities or premature discontinuation of therapy related to an AE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to the study results, the efficacy of N + Bv in subjects with cHL who progressed or relapsed after first-line treatment failure was demonstrated in both standard-risk and low-risk patients. Results demonstrated high rates of durable responses in both cohorts in all-treated and paediatric subjects. CMR for the low risk group is considered a surrogate endpoint to provide short-term impact on response to assess response earlier, in addition to EFS rate at 3 years that provides important efficacy insight on the longer-term clinical benefit.

CMR rates by BICR before transitioning to consolidation therapy were high in both all-treated (92.9% R1 cohort and 88.6% R2 cohort) and paediatric subjects (88.9% R1 cohort and 90.3% R2 cohort). In addition, high CMR rates by Investigator assessment prior to consolidation therapy were observed in all-treated (89.3% R1 cohort and 88.4 R2 cohort) and paediatric subjects (83.3% R1 cohort and 90.3% R2 cohort).

Similarly to the reported high ORR per BICR following 4 cycles of N+Bv (96.4% R1 cohort and 93.2% R2 cohort in all-treated subjects and 94.4% R1 cohort and 93.5% R2 cohort in treated paediatric subjects), other endpoints support the primary endpoint. DOR per BICR (10.7% R1 cohort and 7% R2 cohort in all-treated subjects and 16.7% R1 cohort and 6.5% R2 cohort in treated paediatric subjects), EFS rate at 3-years per Investigator (88.5% R1 cohort and 82.4% R2 cohort in all-treated subjects), PFS rate at 3-years per BICR (92.5% R1 cohort and 91.1% R2 cohort in all-treated subjects and 91.7% R1 cohort and 91.8% R2 cohort in treated paediatric subjects) and the 5-years OS rates were 100% and 97.6% among all- treated subjects in Cohorts R1 and R2, respectively, with similar results observed within each cohort for treated paediatric subjects.

The CA209744 study was conducted in 10 countries worldwide (although only 8 of these were able to recruit participants) with 75 centres activated in total; however, only 20% of all centres recruited R1 participants. Although the R1 and R2 cohorts began recruitment at the same time (March 2017, the study start date), R2 was closed in May 2018 as the target number of participants was reached (44 subjects), based on the revised protocol. R1 enrolled only 28 participants, confirming the rarity of this disease.

The overall safety profile of the combination treatment of N + Bv in Cohort R1 and Cohort R2 for both all-treated subjects and treated paediatric subjects were manageable and consistent with the known safety profiles of the therapeutic agents. No new safety signals were identified. There was a low frequency of hematologic toxicity, and none of the hematologic treatment related AEs led to treatment discontinuation and there were no Grade 5 hematologic treatment related AEs reported.

No deaths were reported in Cohort R1. One death was reported in the treated paediatric population in Cohort R2. The subject completed the induction, intensification, and consolidation (ASCT) phases, and then progressed &lt; 12 months after the first study drug dose and died 505 days after the last dose of study drug. The subject had disease progression at the time of death.

No new safety signals were identified. There was a low frequency of haematological toxicity, and none of the treatment-related haematological AEs led to treatment discontinuation .

In the cohort 1, the most frequently ( ≥ 25% subjects) reported all-causality AEs were headache, nausea, pyrexia, and ALT increased in the all-treated subjects while nausea, headache, and pyrexia were the most frequently reported AEs in the treated paediatric subjects. Grade 3-4 AEs reported in &gt; 1 subject were AST increased (3 subjects) and ALT increased (2 subjects) in the all-treated subjects. None of the Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in &gt; 1 subject in the treated paediatric population.

In the cohort 2, the most frequently ( ≥ 25%) reported all-causality AEs were nausea, diarrhoea, and pyrexia in the all-treated and treated paediatric subjects. Grade 3-4 AEs reported in &gt; 1 subject were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neutropenia (3 subjects) and infusion-related reaction (2 subjects) in the all-treated subjects while neutropenia (3 subjects) was reported in the treated paediatric subjects.

The overall frequencies of SAEs in the cohort 1 were similar between all-treated subjects and treated paediatric subjects. Pyrexia was the only SAE that was reported in &gt; 1 subject in the all-treated and treated paediatric subjects. None of the Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in &gt; 1 subject.

The overall frequencies of SAEs (all causality and drug related) in the cohort 2 were similar between all-treated subjects and treated paediatric subjects. The SAEs that were reported in &gt; 1 subjects were pyrexia and hypersensitivity in the all-treated subjects while hypersensitivity was reported in the treated paediatric subjects. None of the Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in &gt; 1 subject in the all-treated and treated paediatric subjects.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, the MAH has submitted a final study report for Study CA209744. Study CA209744 is a Phase II study of nivolumab + brentuximab vedotin for paediatric subjects, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD30+ classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after failure of first-line therapy, followed by brentuximab + bendamustine for participants with a suboptimal response.

Study CA209744 is part of the agreed nivolumab Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) covering the conditions of treatment of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue and treatment of malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system (PIP number: EMEA-001407-PIP02-15-M07; latest EMA Decision P/0138/2024, dated 06-May-2024).

Based on the study objectives, the efficacy of N + Bv in subjects with cHL who progressed or relapsed after first-line treatment failure was demonstrated in both standard-risk and low-risk patients. Safety results were consistent with the know safety profile of the individual components. There are no issues arising from assessment of this completed study that otherwise require further regulatory action at this time. The MAH is planning to submit the results of study CA209744 as part of a future variation.
