The PL has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this worksharing to update the PL with the details of the local representatives for Croatia and to introduce the Croatian language annexes for Emtriva and to update the bottle label to include the EDQM short standard term for the pharmaceutical form for Stribild.

As a consequence, the recommendations for post- exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| WS/0484 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Worksharing procedure to update of section 4.5 of the SmPC of Stribild, Tybost and Vitekta based on a phase 1 study evaluating the drug interaction potential between telaprevir (TVR) and elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate single tablet regimen and between telaprevir and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus elvitegravir. . This study was conducted in fulfilment of MEA009 for Tybost. The PL is updated accordingly as relevant. Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity to revise section 6.1 of the SmPC list of excipients, to update the designation of the excipients. product | 20/02/2014 11/02/2015 SmPC and no | PL Study GS-US-236-0135, is a Phase I study in healthy subjects that evaluated the drug-drug interaction potential of the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir with the fixed dose combination tablet Stribild (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) and with Vitekta 85mg (elvitegravir) and atazanavir boosted by ritonavir. The study results did not indicate clinically significant interactions between telaprevir and Stribild nor between telaprevir and elvitegravir (with atazanavir/ritonavir). Section 4.5 of the SmPCs (and corresponding sections of the PLs) were updated to state that no dose adjustments are required when Stribild or Tybost are administered with telaprevir, nor when Vitekta is administered with ritonavir- boosted atazanavir plus telaprevir. The most frequently reported adverse events reported in the study were in line with the safety profiles of the drugs administered and no new safety concerns were identified. |
