## 1. Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most frequent cancers in the world, affects one person in 20 in the developed countries, being the second most common malignant disease with 700,000 new cases and 500,000 deaths  world  wide  each  year.  Primary  therapy  is  surgery  with  75%  of  the  patients  being operable at the time of diagnosis. However, even when resection is considered curative, the overall five-year survival is only 50%. Approximately, 30% of all patients with CRC have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Five-year survival is 78% in stage II, 54% in stage III and only 5% in stage IV. Survival in  stage  III  patients  has  been  shown  to  be  increased  by  application  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  with 5-fluorouracil, folic acid. Current state-of-the-art therapies for metastatic disease approved in Europe include  irinotecan  and/or  oxaliplatin,  each  in  combination  with  bolus  or  infusional  5-fluorouracil, leucovorin.

More recently, 2 monoclonal antibodies have been approved in EU for colorectal cancer treatment. On one hand, bevacizumab which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is approved as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with 5- fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. On the other hand, cetuximab which act as a signal transduction inhibitor  of  EGFR  is  approved  for  use  in  combination  with  irinotecan  in  patients  with  EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal cancer who has failed prior irinotecan therapy.

Patients treated with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies tend to progress after a certain time and their only treatment option is best supportive care.

Panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that is directed against the human EGFR. The  EGFR  is  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein  that  promotes  cell  growth  in  a  variety  of  normal  and transformed tissues. The receptor has several natural ligands including EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha.  Binding  of  the  ligand  to  the  receptor  stimulates  cell  proliferation.  Blocking  this interaction by means of a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor inhibits tumour growth in vivo .  Panitumumab is produced in a proprietary strain of mouse (XenoMouse) in which the murine heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes were inactivated and most of the human heavy and light chain (both kappa and lambda) immunoglobulin genes were inserted.

Amgen Europe B.V. has applied for a marketing authorisation through the centralised procedure for Vectibix 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum after failure of oxaliplatin- and/or irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. The recommended  dose  of  panitumumab  is  6 mg/kg  of  body  weight  given  once  every  14  days  as  an intravenous infusion.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Panitumumab  is  produced  from  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary  (CHO)  cells  and  purified  by  a  series  of chromatography steps, viral inactivation step, viral filtration step and ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps.

The active substance is formulated with sodium acetate trihydrate as buffering agent, sodium chloride as tonicity modifier, acetic acid for pH adjustment and water for injection.

Vectibix is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion (20 mg/ml) in a single-use vial of 5, 10 or 20 ml and is diluted in 0.9 % sodium chloride prior to administration.

## Active Substance

## Nomenclature

INN Name:

panitumumab

Compendial Name:

not applicable

Chemical Name:

anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor

USAN/BAN/JAN Name:

panitumumab

CAS Registry Number:

339177-26-3

## Description of the active substance

Panitumumab is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody of IgG2 subclass. Panitumumab has two gamma heavy chains and two kappa light chains. Glycosylated panitumumab has a total molecular weight  of  approximately  147  kDa.  Panitumumab  is  expressed  as  a  glycoprotein  with  a  single consensus  N-linked  glycosylation  site  located  on  the  heavy  chain.  Panitumumab  is  produced  in genetically engineered mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells.

## · Manufacture

The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Amgen,  Fremont,  California,  USA.  This  facility  was inspected by the Dutch inspectorate (IGZ) and it is considered that this site is operated in accordance to current EU Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), with standard operating procedures in place to describe all procedures and controls.

## Development genetics

The expression plasmid containing the genes for the heavy and light chains was transfected into CHO cells. Following cloning and subcloning steps, one clone producing panitumumab at high levels was selected as lead cell line.

## Cell bank system

A two-tiered cell  banking  system  of  Master  Cell  bank  (MCB)  and  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  has been developed and maintained in accordance to cGMP and ICH guidelines.

Procedures  followed  in  the  preparation  of  MCB  and  WCB  have  been  appropriately  described.  An extensive  range  of  tests  has  been  performed  for  their  characterisation,  in  accordance  with  ICH guidelines,  including  identity,  viability,  stability,  presence  of  adventitious  agents  (bacteria,  fungi, mycoplasma, viral contaminants including endogenous retrovirus-like particles known to be present in CHO cell lines).

## Fermentation process

One  vial  of  WCB  is  thawed  and  cells  are  expanded  in  a  selective  serum-free  growth  medium  to generate the cell inoculum. A series of bioreactors with increasing volumes is then used to expand the cell  mass to generate sufficient cells for the inoculation of the production bioreactor. Following the production  phase, the bioreactor contents are harvested and  clarified to generate a cell-free intermediate designated as harvested cell culture fluid.

Panitumumab cell culture conditions and in-process controls (IPC) have been sufficiently described and are considered appropriate.

## Purification process

Panitumumab is purified using a series of chromatography, concentration and diafiltration and viral inactivation and filtration steps.

Each step of the purification process has been adequately described, and suitable IPC controls are in place, with acceptable limits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacturing process development and process validation

Several  manufacturing  changes  were  introduced  during  development,  including  change  of  cell  line, scale-up  of  the  fermentation  process,  various  changes  to  the  purification  process  and  change  of manufacturing site.

The  comparability  exercise  and  the  overall  data  provided  to  support  the  different  changes  were considered acceptable.

The  commercial  manufacturing  process  was  validated  in  order  to  demonstrate  that  the  process consistently maintained process parameters within specified ranges and met pre-established acceptance criteria for performance indicators. Overall, process validation was considered satisfactory.

## Characterisation

A) Elucidation of structure and other characteristics:

## A1) Physicochemical characterisation:

The primary, secondary and tertiary structures of panitumumab were analysed by various techniques.

Several  structural  complexes  resulting  from  different  organisations  of  the  disulfide  bridges  in  the hinge region on the antibody were identified. These complexes were adequately analysed.

Several  charge  variants  were  identified,  which  all  exhibit  comparable  potency  to  the  reference standard.

Characterisation  of  glycosylation  indicated  that  panitumumab  has  a  single  consensus  N-linked glycosylation site located on the heavy chain. The predominant glycan structures observed correspond to complex bi-antennary structures terminating with or without galactose residues. Fucosylated forms have also been observed. No O-linked glycosylation was detected.

The size distribution of panitumumab was appropriately evaluated by different techniques.

Free sulfhydryl content was consistently detected, indicating low levels of unpaired cysteine residues that are not assigned.

The  active  substance  has  been  comprehensively  characterised,  using  state-of-the-art  methods  for physicochemical characteristics. Sources of heterogeneity have been analysed in detail using a wide variety of state-of-the-art techniques.

## A2) Biological characterisation:

The  methods  used  for  the  evaluation  of  the  biological  activity  were  based  on  the  ability  of panitumumab to  bind  directly  to  the  extracellular  domain  of  EGFR  and  inhibit  ligand  binding  and subsequent cellular responses.

The biological properties of panitumumab have been properly characterised and the assays that were chosen and the data provided are considered adequate.

## B) Impurities:

The  potential  product-related  impurities  identified  are  aggregates,  fragments  and  other  product variants.  Potential  process-related  impurities  include  cell  substrate  derived  impurities  (host  cell proteins, DNA), cell culture derived and downstream derived impurities.

Overall, impurities have been properly identified and characterised.

## Specifications

The active substance release specifications have been suitably justified and are supported by consistent data from multiple lots.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

The  design  of  the  stability  programme,  including  the  testing  intervals  and  temperature  storage conditions, are in accordance with current ICH guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from the release specifications selected for stability-indicating properties.

The  stability  data  provided  were  within  the  specifications  and  support  a  shelf  life  of  24  months at 2-8°C.

## Finished Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

Sodium chloride is used in the formulation to provide an isotonic solution for intravenous infusion and is used as a stabiliser against thermally induced aggregation. Acetic acid is used to adjust pH to target of  5.8.  Water  for  injection  is  also  used  as  solvent  in  the  formulation.  There  are  no  overages  in  the formulation.

Panitumumab finished product is diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride and administered via an infusion pump,  using  an  0.2 µm  in-line  filter  to  reduce  sub-visible  particles,  through  a  peripheral  line  or indwelling  catheter.  Data  provided  demonstrated  that  this  in-line  filter  is  effective  at  removing panitumumab particulates to levels below Ph. Eur. limits without any impact on protein concentration.

The proposed container for panitumumab finished product is a single-use vial (type I glass) with an elastomeric  stopper,  aluminium  seal  and  a  plastic  flip-off  cap.  One  vial  contains  100 mg  of panitumumab  in  5 ml,  200 mg  panitumumab  in  10 ml,  or  400 mg  panitumumab  in  20 ml  of concentrate for solution for infusion.

## Adventitious agents

An  assessment  performed  on  all  materials  used  for  the  panitumumab  commercial  manufacturing process concluded that the risk for TSE associated with any material of animal origin is negligible. The active substance is produced in a serum-free culture medium.

The  applicant  has  demonstrated  that  the  cell  banks  are  free  of  detectable  viruses  except  for  the presence  of  retroviral  particles  known  to  be  present  in  CHO  cell  lines.  Routine  testing  of  the unprocessed bulk is performed as part of the viral safety programme.

The viral clearance studies presented by the applicant demonstrate that the panitumumab purification process provides sufficient clearance of the model viruses.

## Manufacture of the product

The finished product is manufactured by a facility that was inspected by the Dutch inspectorate (IGZ) and  it  is  considered  that  this  site  is  operated  in  accordance  to  current  EU  Good  Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  consists  of  a  formulation  step  followed  by  aseptic filtration, using two 0.2 µ m filters, aseptic filling into vials, stoppering and capping steps.

## Criteria for re-filtration of formulated bulk have been established and justified.

The media fill and process validation results, lot-to-lot consistency data and critical process controls have shown that the sterile filtration and aseptic filling process are robust and well controlled and that the finished product can be consistently manufactured.

## Specifications

The control of finished product relies to a large extent on the same analytical methods as those used for  the  control  of  the  active  substance.  The  tests  and  rationale  for  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the finished product were considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability of the Product

Real-time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance with ICH guidelines and per protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. Based on the data provided, the approvable shelf life for the finished product is 24 months at 2-8°C.

The  last  inspection  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  manufacturing  facilities  showed compliance to the current EU-GMP.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Safety studies complied with GLP. However, the dose formulation analyses and some of the analytical tests to quantify panitumumab and antibodies to panitumumab were not in compliance with GLP but were in compliance with Standard Operating Procedures at the laboratories.

## Pharmacology

The ability of panitumumab to inhibit growth of EGFR-expressing tumour cells was tested using in vitro methods and in  vivo in  tumour-xenotransplanted mice. Effects of panitumumab in combination with other therapeutic agents were assessed. Cross reactivity supported the choice of the cynomolgus monkey for safety testing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

Panitumumab acts as a competitive antagonist at the ligand binding site of EGFR to inhibit binding and  signalling  mediated  by  EGF  and  transforming  growth  factor α ,  the  natural  ligands  for  this receptor. The affinity of binding of hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab to the EGFR was determined in recombinant EGFR using BIAcore methods. Binding affinity of hybridoma-derived panitumumab was determined to be 5 x 10 -11 M; binding affinity of CHO-derived panitumumab was determined, in two experiments, to be 3.5 and 5.7 x 10 -12 M; in comparison the binding affinity of EGF reported in the literature is 3 x 10 -9 M.

Inhibition of binding of EGF was shown in A431 cells, a human epidermal carcinoma cell line that expresses  EGFR.  Intracellular  acidification,  phosphorylation  and  internalisation  of  the  EGFR,  that occur upon binding of EGF to EGFR, were blocked in a dose-dependent manner by panitumumab in A431 cells. Panitumumab was also shown to inhibit cell growth in vitro and in vivo (xenotransplants in mice) in the same cell line. Additionally, panitumumab could be detected in tumour tissue.

The ability of panitumumab to inhibit growth of a range of tumour types when these were transplanted into athymic mice was shown. Comparisons of cell surface levels of EGFR versus Her2 and response to panitumumab treatment indicate a correlation between a higher EGFR:Her2 ratio and responsiveness  to  panitumumab.  Tumour  types  that  express  17,000  EGFR  per  cell  or  more  may respond to panitumumab.

In  combination  with  5-fluorouracil  or  with  oxaliplatin,  no  additional  efficacy  of  panitumumab  was shown in comparison to monotherapy. However, with irinotecan, additional tumour inhibitory effect was shown when the effect of the combination was compared to each agent alone.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The characterisation of secondary  pharmacodynamics included assessment of the effects of panitumumab,  either  as  a  single  agent,  or  in  combination,  in  a  large  number  of  studies  in  mice xenotransplanted  with  different  tumour  types.  These  studies  are  supportive  of  the  potential  use  of panitumumab in other tumours whose growth is EGFR-dependent.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

One  study  was  conducted  to  assess  potential  toxicity  to  the  cardiovascular,  respiratory  and  central nervous systems in conscious cynomolgus monkeys, by telemetry methods. Groups of 4 males were given a single intravenous dose of panitumumab at 0, 7.5, 30 or 60 mg/kg. These dosages resulted in exposure  that  is  similar  to,  or  4  or  8  times  the  exposure  in  patients  given  a  therapeutic  dose.  The animals were observed for at least 6 days post-dose to assess the reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of effects related to panitumumab administration.

In this study, no clinical signs related to panitumumab were observed. Neuro-behavioural tests did not reveal any effect on the central nervous system. Neither effects of panitumumab on respiratory rate, minute and tidal volume nor on body temperature were identified. There was also no electrocardiographic evidence of test article action. There were neither test-article -related effects on PR  interval,  QRS  interval,  RR  interval  or  QTc  interval  nor  on  systolic,  diastolic  or  mean  blood pressure.  However,  QT  was  significantly  prolonged  across  all  doses  at  sporadic  time  points. Examination of individual data for QT over this time period indicates that the maximal individual QT interval is 317 ms and is in the low dose (7.5 mg/kg) group, at 12 hours post dose. Heart rate shows a significant decrease over this time period. QTc shows no such effect and QTc values are 346, 347, 345 and 346 over the period 0-2 hours in the control, low, mid- and high dose groups respectively.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Pharmacodynamic interaction studies were performed with a range of chemotherapeutic and targeted agents as described above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Quantification  of  panitumumab  and  of  antibodies  to  panitumumab  used  either  an  ELISA  or  an electrochemiluminescence  (ECL)  method  validated  for  use  in  monkey  serum.  Validation  of  the quantification in mouse serum was not provided and therefore these data are not considered further. Tissue distribution studies were performed in cynomolgus monkeys after administration of 125 I-iodinated panitumumab.

Pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab  is  presented  from  a  one-month  repeated  dose  study  using  once weekly intravenous injection in cynomolgus monkeys. Panitumumab showed dose-dependent kinetics and a ten-fold increase in dose was associated with an approximately proportionate increase in Cmax, Cavg and AUC (Table 4).

Mean (SD)

Panitumumab pharmacokinetic is dose-dependent and consistent with saturation of clearance of the antibody. No accumulation on repeated, weekly, administration was noted. Nine of ten monkeys in the low  dose  group  were  MAHA  positive  (Monkey  anti-human  antibody  defined  as  anti-panitumumab antibody);  frequency  for  MAHA  positive  was  2/10  and  1/10  in  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups. Monkeys that developed MAHA were noted to have more rapid elimination of panitumumab.

## · Absorption

The drug is administered IV.

## · Distribution

Three  reports  on  the  distribution  of  panitumumab  are  provided.  The  most  representative  study consisted in a single intravenous dose of 7.5 mg/kg 125 I-panitumumab administered to male and female monkeys. One animal of each sex per time point was killed at 2, 48, 120 and 216 hours after dosing to examine tissue distribution with whole body auto-radiography. Blood was also drawn from available monkeys  for  quantification  of 125 I-panitumumab.  Urine  and  faeces  were  collected  to  quantify elimination. Pharmacokinetic data from the study are presented in the Table 5.

In females, tissue:serum concentration ratios were found for abdominal (0.155) and brown fat (0.192), and the ovary (0.541) and uterus (0.441).

Radioactivity was also noted in brain and spinal cord tissue.

## · Metabolism

Metabolism studies were not conducted with panitumumab.

## · Excretion

Excretion of radioactivity after administration of 125 I-panitumumab was predominantly in urine. After 216 hours, 65.6% (in males) and 76.5% (in females) of the administered dose was excreted in urine with only 1.6% excreted in faeces. Overall recovery of radioactivity was over 80% at 216 hours. In urine, radioactivity was present in the form of free iodide or as small peptides.

## · Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Studies

No studies were performed with panitumumab.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

No single dose general toxicology studies were conducted.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeated dose general toxicity studies were conducted using intravenous administration of panitumumab to male and female cynomolgus monkeys. These studies had a dosing duration from 4 weeks  to  6  months,  and  all  used  once-a-week  dosing.  Table  6  summarises  the  general  toxicity studies.

Toxicity to skin and diarrhoea was the primary toxicity of panitumumab in monkeys. These effects were severe enough to cause a significant number of unscheduled deaths. There were 4 unexpected deaths that were caused by either electrolyte imbalance or allergic-type reactions.

The  onset  of  skin  toxicity  was  typically  within  7-14  days  (i.e.  after  two  or  three  doses).  Severity correlated with dose and there is evidence that severity also correlated with duration of dosing. There was improvement in condition of monkeys after stopping dosing. The severity of toxicity to skin at times  resulted  in  some  monkeys  skipping  doses  and  various  veterinary  treatments  were  applied  to alleviate  discomfort  (e.g.  ketoprofen  anti-inflammatory,  cephazolin  antibiotic  etc).  Skin  toxicity  is described as: erythema, irritation, crusting (with secondary infection), flaky skin (dandruff-like), loss of fur, abrasions, pustular dermatitis, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, scabs, chronic dermal inflammation, chronic folliculitis, dermal oedema, papules and ulceration/necrosis, which could affect most areas of the body.

Diarrhoea, or soft or liquid faeces, was also a common finding and also occurred in the lowest dose groups. Intestinal  mucosal  hyperplasia  of  the  large  intestines  was  observed  in  the  initial  toxicology studies.  The  GI  tract  was  histologically  unremarkable  in  subsequent  studies,  including  the  6-month

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

toxicity study. Severe electrolyte disturbances occurred (hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, hypochloraemia)  with  greater  severity  in  higher  dose  groups.  This  effect  was  observed  only  in  the early studies (secondary to the severe diarrhoea) where supportive fluids were not administered. It was not observed in subsequent studies, including the 6-month toxicity study, when supportive fluids were administered. Diarrhoea was a contributory factor to dehydration, and, it was suggested, to reductions in albumin in serum. Changes in food intake and body weight (described as cachexia in some cases) were considered to be related to general malaise arising from both these primary toxic effects.

Myocardial  degeneration  was  evident  in  the  first  1-month  study.  Changes  were  focal  to  focally extensive with affected myocytes adjacent to normal myocytes and involved the myocardium of both the  septum  and  ventricular  free  walls.  Degenerative  changes  were  described  as  sarcoplasmic vacuolisation/fatty change, hypereosinophilia, ring fibre formation and fibre shrinkage. No significant inflammatory cell infiltrates were present. Immunohistochemical examination showed that panitumumab bound to endomysial cells of the myocardium plus nerve supporting cells and epicardial mesothelium.  Human  heart  binding  was  examined  for  comparison  and,  in  contrast,  there  was  only binding  to  human  endomysial  cells,  not  to  nerve  or  epicardial  cells.  Specific  testing  of  cardiac enzymes did not indicate presence of myocardial toxicity. Examination of hearts from monkeys in the 3-month general toxicity study by electron microscopy could not identify any abnormality in relation to  treatment.  No  abnormal  effects  on  the  ECG  were  evident  and  of  unexpected  deaths,  none  were suspected to be due to an arrhythmia. Follow-up studies in which supportive fluids were administered determined that the cardiotoxicity observed in the initial 1-month study was related to prolonged and untreated dehydration and electrolyte imbalance secondary to severe diarrhoea. As a result, supportive fluids were administered to prevent dehydration in all subsequent studies. No  evidence of treatment-related cardiac toxicity was observed in animals administered supportive fluids, including the  6-month  toxicity  study.  Additionally,  no  effects  on  cardiovascular  function  were  observed  in  a formal safety pharmacology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.

Other effects included anaemia, diffuse hyperplasia in the adrenal glands and enlargement of inguinal, axillary and lumbar lymph nodes. This later one correlated with lymphoid cell hyperplasia and plasma cell  hyperplasia  after  histopathological  examination.  Toxicity  to male  fertility  was  not  identified  on histopathological  examination  of  relevant  tissues.  No  consistent  changes  were  observed  in  serum magnesium concentrations.

## · Genotoxicity

Panitumumab has not been evaluated in genotoxicity studies.

## · Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

One study was conducted to assess reproductive performance and early embryonic development. A total of 44 female cynomolgus monkeys were given doses of 0, 7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg IV once weekly for two menstrual cycles throughout the mating period to Day 20 of gestation. Males were not dosed. Overall rates of pregnancy in control, low-, mid- and high-dose groups were 6/12 (50%), 2/5 (40.0%), 1/6  (16.7%) and 2/6 (33.3%). In total, 5 out of 17 (29.4%) monkeys that were mated, having been treated  with  panitumumab,  became  pregnant.  There  were  notable  findings  of  amenorrhea  and  of prolonged menstrual cycles. Because of the different length of cycle in each animal, the number of administered doses was variable across the study and ranged from 7 to 23 doses. The day at which maximal  concentrations  of  serum  17 β -oestradiol  and  progesterone  were  reached  was  significantly delayed by panitumumab treatment, and the maximal concentration of progesterone (but not serum 17 β -oestradiol) was also reduced.

Panitumumab  was  administered  intravenously  to  pregnant  female  cynomolgus  monkeys  to  assess potential embryotoxic and teratogenic effects. Dosage groups were 0, 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg and group sizes were 12, 15, 18 and 5 respectively -at 30 mg/kg, three of the first five monkeys aborted. Each monkey was dosed once weekly from Day 20 of gestation for a total of 5 doses. The last dosing day was Day 48. Pregnancies were terminated at Day 100 to 103 and foetuses were examined. The high

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose  group  showed  a  statistically  significantly  higher  frequency  of  abortion/foetal  death  than  the control group. Data for total abortion/foetal death are:

|   Dose (iv, mg/kg) | Frequency of abortion/foetal death   | Frequency of abortion/foetal death   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|                0   | 8.3%                                 | (1/12)                               |
|                7.5 | 33.3%                                | (5/15)                               |
|               15   | 16.7%                                | (3/15)                               |
|               30   | 60.0%                                | (2/5)                                |

However, there was no effect on foetal weight, organ weights, placental weights, foetal and placental external measurements, and foetal and placental histopathology. There was no NOAEL in this study, as even the lowest dose was associated with foetal abortions or death and with significant maternal toxicity. No teratogenic effect was observed in surviving foetuses.

- Local tolerance

Local tolerance was studied as part of the general toxicology studies using the intravenous route.

- Other toxicity studies

## Comparability of hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab

A repeated-dose general toxicity study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to compare the kinetics and toxicity of hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab, using once-a-week injections for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week recovery period. Dosage groups were 0, 7.5 and 30 mg/kg IV. There was no evidence of difference between hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab.

## Comparability of 2-kl and 12-kl litre scale CHO-derived panitumumab

A  study  of  similar  design  was  performed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  to  compare  toxicity  and toxicokinetics  of  panitumumab  manufactured  at  two  different  scales:  2,000  litres  or  12,000  litres (commercial scale). Monkeys were dosed with 0, 7.5 or 30 mg/kg IV, once-a-week, for 3 months, with a recovery period of 6 weeks. During dosing, a 0.22 µ m filter was in place. There was an additional group of monkeys who were dose with 7.5 mg/kg every two weeks and an additional further group of monkeys who were dosed with 30 mg/kg every week, but without a filter. It was concluded that there was no apparent difference in the toxicology or kinetics of panitumumab, dependent on the scale of its manufacture.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

The rationale for EGFR inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer is well established. The applicant has shown  that  panitumumab  specifically  binds  to  epidermal  growth  factor  receptors  and  inhibits signalling  through  this  receptor.  As  an  IgG2,  panitumumab is  not  expected  to  act  via  Fc-dependent mechanisms (e.g., antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity).

The induction of hypomagnesaemia by panitumumab occurs in clinical use (6%) but was not detected in monkeys. It could be that there is a genuine species difference between monkeys and humans or that the studies in monkeys simply failed to detect this effect, due to the low frequency of its occurrence. Hypomagnesaemia has been adequately addressed in clinical studies.

It was concluded that the statistically significant prolongation of QT seen is not biologically relevant. Nevertheless, apparent greater frequency of QT prolongation at the highest dose group over the period closest  to  drug  administration  could  represent  a  potential  signal.  The  lack  of  change  in  QTc  is reassuring. There was no evidence of treatment-related effect on cardiovascular parameters (heart rate,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PR intervals, QRS intervals, RR intervals, QT intervals, QTc intervals, systolic and diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure) in the formal safety pharmacology study.

## Pharmacokinetics

Two methods to quantify panitumumab in monkey serum were used. However, data suggested that these  are  not  equivalent  and  that  the  validated  ECL  method  may  have  quantified  panitumumab concentrations at significantly higher than the ELISA method. The presence of anti-idiotypic MAHA directed against the antigen-binding site of panitumumab was raised as a possible interference factor. In view that significant immunogenicity response has not been reported in humans and that levels of panitumumab in serum will not be determined in the clinical setting the issue has not been considered of clinical relevance.

Quantification of panitumumab in mouse serum has not been validated. Therefore, the data on mice are judged merely indicative. The studies in cynomolgus monkeys provide sufficient information on the  distribution  and  elimination  of  panitumumab.  Although  no  study  was  specifically  conducted  to assess  foetal  exposure,  this  is  considered  likely,  as  IgG2  immunoglobulins  are  known  to  cross  the placenta and to be secreted in milk.

## Toxicology

In  the  initial  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  where  no  supportive  fluids  were  administered  myocardial degeneration was seen in all treatment groups, both at Day 29 and following 14 days recovery. No evidence of myocardial degeneration was observed in any other studies where supportive fluids were administered  to  prevent  dehydration  secondary  to  diarrhoea,  including  the  6-month  toxicity  study. Immunohistochemical staining of cardiac tissues revealed variable tissue binding of panitumumab to cells  of  the  myocardium  and  of  the  epicardial  mesothelium  in  the  monkey  heart  tissue  samples. However,  specificity  of  the  staining  could  not  be  determined  and  it  is  possible  that  the  positive staining observed in study was an artefact. In support for this argument, there were no clear correlation between myocardial degeneration and cardiac staining. Further, no binding of panitumumab was noted in human or monkey cardiac tissue in a formal tissue cross-reactivity studies which utilised optimised immunohistochemical techniques to assess specific panitumumab binding.

Toxicity to skin and diarrhoea was the primary toxicity of panitumumab in monkeys. These effects are also seen with cetuximab, a chimeric anti-EGFR antibody and with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR such as gefitinib. It is considered directly related to the pharmacological action of drugs that inhibit EGFR signalling.

Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development since foetal panitumumab exposure levels were not examined. EGF and EGF receptors are involved in embryo-foetal growth and development,  and  effects on growth  and  development  would  therefore  be  expected. Indeed, panitumumab  has  been  shown  to  be  an  abortifacient  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  when  administered during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 5-fold the exposure of recommended human dose of 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

No pre- and post-natal development animal studies have been conducted with panitumumab.

## 4. Clinical aspect

## Introduction

Panitumumab  is  a  fully  human  IgG2  monoclonal  antibody  that  is  directed  against  the  EGFR.  The EGFR  is  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein  that  promotes  cell  growth  in  a  variety  of  normal  and transformed tissues. The receptor has several natural ligands including EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha.  Binding  of  the  ligand  to  the  receptor  stimulates  cell  proliferation.  Blocking  this interaction by means of a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor inhibits tumour growth in vivo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical development of panitumumab was designed to assess its efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum after failure of oxaliplatinand/or irinotecan-containing  chemotherapy  regimens.  The  clinical  studies  submitted  included  15 clinical studies in patients with a variety of solid tumours (n = 1304). Among those studies, one Phase III, four Phase II  and  three  pharmacokinetics  studies  were  submitted  in  the  target  patient  population.  With regard to clinical efficacy, progression-free survival, overall survival, objective tumour response and disease-related  symptoms  as  well  as  quality  of  life  were  assessed.  During  the  development  of panitumumab, clinical trials have been conducted under the sponsorship of 3 companies, Abgenix Inc., Immunex Corporation and Amgen Inc.

At the initiation of the clinical programme, panitumumab was produced by a human hybridoma cell line. Later, a decision was made to shift to CHO cells. The change took place in two steps. The first was from hybridoma to small scale CHO fermentation (2 kl), and subsequently to a commercial scale production (12 kl). Therefore, the clinical programme has involved patients receiving panitumumab of all three origins, with steps in between seeking to show equivalence between them.

## GCP

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  data  were  obtained  as  part  of  the  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  studies.  Healthy volunteers were not used. The pharmacokinetic programme (Table 7) involved use of panitumumab from different sources, in various cancer forms, at various dose regimens and in some cases also with concomitant administration of chemotherapy.

For human samples, an immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection was used to measure panitumumab. A biotinylated, anti-idiotypic antibody was immobilised on magnetic beads to bind to panitumumab in serum. A ruthenium-labelled panitumumab anti-idiotypic antibody was used to detect panitumumab by electrochemiluminescence. The lower limit of quantification was 78 ng/ml in serum.

## · Absorption

The drug is administered IV.

## · Distribution

In  Study  20030138  where  modelling  has  been  applied,  the  results  indicate  a  central  volume  of distribution of 42 ml/kg which corresponds to the typical plasma volume in humans.

## · Elimination

The applicant quotes ICHS6, that biotransformation studies are not required for monoclonal antibodies as  it  is  expected  that  the  antibody  is  degraded  to  small  peptides  and  individual  aminoacids.  The modelled half-life was approximately 8 days at steady state for doses ranging from 2.5 mg/kg once a week to 9 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Dose-finding  used  skin  toxicity  as  a  marker  of  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect.  A  plateau  in  the incidence of integument (skin, nails and hair) and eye toxicity occurred at 2.5 mg/kg once weekly. At this dose the trough concentrations exceeded the panitumumab concentration at which the non-linear pathway is saturated by 90% in animal xenograft models.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that mean ±SD Cmax concentrations for 2.5 mg/kg once a week, 6 mg/kg every two weeks or 9 mg/kg every three weeks were 119±35, 219±54 and 257±41 µ g/ml, respectively and trough concentrations were 56 ± 22, 47 ± 19 and 49 ± 29 µ g/ml, respectively.

In Study 20030138, steady state was reached after six weeks of treatment and the half-life after the 2.5 mg/kg  once/week,  6  mg/kg  every  two  weeks  or  9  mg/kg  every  three  weeks  were  8.5,  7.5  and 8.4 days, respectively.

The modelling suggests that plasma concentrations vs . time can be described by a two-compartmental model with two elimination pathways: elimination occurs in a first-order fashion via the reticuloendothelial system like other IgG and by internationalisation of the EGF receptor. Non-linear pharmacokinetics was observed in the dose-range 0.75-9.0 mg/kg. The time-averaged clearance value decreases with increasing dose. The panitumumab concentration that produces 90% saturation of the nonlinear  clearance  pathway  was  to  be  9.77 ± 1.94 µg/ml  (95% CI: 5.93-13.6).  The  relationship between doses and clearance is visualised in Figure 5.

## · Special populations

The population pharmacokinetic analyses used data from five studies with intensive sampling; for the other eight studies only peak and trough samples were taken. There were 463 men and 243 women included in the analysis, of these 600 were classified as white and 106 as other race. The tumour type was classified  as  colon/rectum  in  247,  lung  in  162,  renal  in  210  and  other  in  87.  The  product  was manufactured by hybridoma in 613 patients and CHO cells in 93. Concurrent chemotherapy was given in 167 and not in 539. Weight mean and range were 81 kg (32-166); for age 60 years (21-88); for body surface area 2 m 2 (1-3); for height 1.72 m (1.31-1.98) and for EGFR maximum staining intensity 2, (0-3).

Panitumumab serum concentrations and body weight showed a correlation with higher concentrations in  heavier  patients  when  dosed  by  weight.  Despite  this,  dosing  according  to  body  weight,  as recommended  in  the  proposed  labelling,  reduced  inter-subject  variability.  Larger  body  weight  was associated with larger volumes of distribution and higher clearance.

Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  were  carried  out  using  modelling.  It  is  suggested  that  EGFR expression in tumour cells, primary tumour type, gender, race, age, impaired renal and impaired liver function  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab.  Modelling  showed  inter-individual coefficients of variation for the volume of the central compartment and of clearance of 53% and 25% respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effect  of  gender  was  assessed  in  kinetic  data  from  three  studies  where  83  patients,  37%,  were women.  These  data  indicate  that  peak  concentrations  were  similar  although  the  mean  trough panitumumab concentration was 15% higher for women. In the same studies, 87 patients, 39%, were 65 or older and showed no differences in kinetics compared to those &lt; 65 years. For those over 75, the mean panitumumab concentration was approximately 10% higher.

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## In vitro

No study is available.

## In vivo

Interactions  between  panitumumab  and  chemotherapy  agents  were  tested  in  two  Phase II  trials. Panitumumab had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, paclitaxel + carboplatin, irinotecan or  the  active  metabolite  of  irinotecan  (SN-38).  Irinotecan  and  its  metabolite  did  not  affect  the pharmacokinetics of panitumumab. Interaction with carboplatin alone was not evaluated.

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No in  vitro permeability,  metabolism  or  metabolic  drug-drug  interaction  studies  that  used  human biomaterials were performed for this programme.

## · Bioequivalence

Bioequivalence between panitumumab of different origins and manufacturing process was explored in two studies: Studies 20030138 and 20030251.

Study 20030138 was  an  open-label,  Phase I  study enrolling 97 patients in 4 investigational centres. Diagnostic  inclusion  criteria  were  solid  tumours  that  had  proven  refractory  to  chemotherapy.  The primary objective was safety of multidose panitumumab (at various doses) and pharmacokinetics, as secondary objective. Patients received 4 doses of panitumumab ranging from 0.1 to 9.0 mg/kg where the panitumumab was sourced from hybridoma and 6.0 and 9.0 mg/kg from CHO 2 kl origin.

The drug was administered once a week (qw) for doses up to 5 mg/kg, every two weeks (q2w) for 6 mg/kg  and  every  three  weeks  (q3w)  for  9  mg/kg.  Serum  sampling  times  were,  for  qw-dosing  at Dose 1: pre-infusion, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 24, and 96 hours. At Doses 2, 3 and 4 only pre- and post-infusion samples were collected. Serum sampling times were, for q2w-doing at Doses 1 and 3: pre-infusion, 0.5, 8, 24, 96, 168, 240 and 288 hours. At Doses 2 and 4 only pre- and post-infusion samples were collected. Serum sampling times were, for q3w-doing at Doses 1 and 3: pre-infusion, 0.5, 8, 24, 96, 168, 336 and 408 hours. At Doses 2, and 4 only pre- and post-infusion samples were collected.

The population studied was 75% male, mean age 64 years (SD 11 years). Table 8 provides AUC and Cmax for hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab after the first dose of 6 and 9 mg/kg.

Study 20030251 was an open-label, Phase I study, enrolling 57 patients in 7 investigational centres. Diagnostic inclusion criteria were solid tumours that had proven refractory to standard chemotherapy. The  primary  objective  was  safety  and  pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab  derived  from  12  kl  CHO fermentation. The drug was administered at a concentration of 6 mg/kg every two weeks (as either a 30- or 60-minute infusion) and at 9 mg/kg every three weeks (60-min infusion). The treatment was administered until disease progression.

At Weeks 1 and 5, 20 patients who had received 6 mg/kg had samples drawn at pre-, post-dose and at 24, 96, 168 and 240 hours. Generally, pre- and post-dose samples were also drawn at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

The anti-tumour effects of panitumumab are thought to be primarily mediated by directly targeting the EGFR,  as  shown  in  the  preclinical.  Panitumumab  binds  to  the  EGFR  ligand-binding  domain  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by endogenous ligands, since it has no agonistic activity. In addition, panitumumab induces internalisation of the receptor in EGFR-expressing cells.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

No  study  was  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers  because  of  concerns  of  toxicity.  The  primary pharmacology  of  an  anti-cancer  agent  will  come  from  the  clinical  efficacy  data.  Several  other functions  of  EGFR  can  be  used  to  detect  pharmacodynamic  effect  such  as  the  role  of  EGFR  on epidermal  cells,  dose-finding  studies  were  based  on  the  incidence  of  rash  used  as  a  marker  of pharmacodynamic activity.

Unwanted effects related to the primary mode of action occurred through the blockade of the EGFR. These  included  the  skin  and  eye  toxicity  which  occurred  in  91%  of  the  monotherapy  patients. Hypomagnesaemia occurred in 39%. EGFR is expressed in the kidney, particularly in the ascending loop  of  Henle,  where  70%  of  filtered  magnesium  is  reabsorbed.  It  is  thought  that  EGFR  inhibitors block  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  filtered  magnesium,  or  possibly  by  interfering  with  magnesium absorption in the gut.

## Clinical efficacy

The  clinical  study  programme  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  comprises  a  total  of  five  studies,  one pivotal (Study 20020408) with an extension (Study 20030194) and three supportive studies (Studies 20025405, 20030167, 20030250) (Table 10) conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer  (mCRC)  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  including  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan, and/or oxaliplatin.

Panitumumab is also being investigated in the following indications:

- -Advanced non-small cell lung cancer in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
- -Renal carcinoma as monotherapy
- -Hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without metastases as monotherapy

## · Dose response study(ies)

Results  from  a  Phase  I  study  (20030138)  and  a  Phase  II  study  (20020374)  were  the  basis  for  the selection  of  the  dose  regimen  of  panitumumab.  Skin  rash  incidence  and  severity  was  used  as  an on-target pharmacodynamic marker for EGFR blockade.

Figure 6. Study 20030138: Incidence of skin toxicities during the treatment period in study

<!-- image -->

The incidence (Figure 6) and severity of skin rash increased as dose increased from 1 to 2.5 mg/kg once a week, reaching an apparent plateau at 2.5 mg/kg once a week.

Also,  at  2.5 mg/kg  once  a  week  the  time-averaged  panitumumab  clearance  value  approached  the clearance value for endogenous IgG2, indicating that EGF-mediated clearance was saturated.

The dose schedule of 6 mg/kg every two weeks (and 9 mg/kg every three weeks) were selected from modelling  of  pharmacokinetic  data  from  Study  20030138,  in  order  to  achieve  steady-state  through panitumumab  concentrations  (Cmin)  comparable  to  those  obtained  with  2.5 mg/kg  once  a  week  in Study 20025405.

## · Main study

Study 20020408 was conducted as a pivotal clinical study in metastatic CRC with the following title: 'An open-label, randomised, phase 3 clinical trials of ABX-EGF plus best supportive care vs. best supportive  care  in  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer'.  Patients  with  progression  in  the  best supportive care (BSC) alone-arm were allowed to cross over to receive panitumumab in an open-label extension study (Study 2003194).

## METHODS

## Study Participants

This was a multicentre study conducted at 81 centres in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

Main inclusion criteria were:

- -metastatic colorectal carcinoma
- -documented  evidence  of  disease  progression  during  or  after  treatment  with  a  fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer
- -ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2
- -tumour  expressing  EGFR  by  immunohistochemistry  (membrane  staining  was  to  be  positive  in ≥ 1% of evaluated tumour cells)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Main exclusion criteria were:

- -use of systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 30 days before randomisation
- -prior  anti-tumour  therapies  including  prior  experimental  agents  or  approved  anti-tumour  small molecules and biologics with short serum half-life (&lt; 1 week) within 30 days before randomisation, or prior experimental or approved proteins/antibodies with longer serum half-life (e.g., bevacizumab) within 3 months before randomisation
- -prior EGFR targeting agents
- -chemotherapy other than fluoropyrimidine (or raltitrexed), irinotecan, or oxaliplatin for colorectal carcinoma  in  accordance  with  the  regimens  specified  (leucovorin  and  levamisole  were  not considered as chemotherapy in this exclusion criterion)

## Treatments

The eligible patients were allocated to one of the two treatment arms:

- -Arm 1: 6 mg/kg panitumumab intravenous once every two weeks in a minimum of 100 ml normal saline, over 60 to 90 minutes (depending upon volume) and BSC
- -Arm 2:  BSC  comprised  any  concomitant  medications  or  treatments:  antibiotics,  analgesics, radiation  therapy  for  pain  control  (limited  to  bone  metastases),  corticosteroids,  transfusions, psychotherapy, growth factors, palliative surgery, or any other symptomatic therapy necessary to provide BSC, except other investigational agents or anti-neoplastic chemotherapy

The cycles continued until disease progression, inability to tolerate panitumumab or other reason for discontinuation.  Patients  in  BSC  alone  arm  had  the  option  to  receive  panitumumab  6 mg/kg  once every  two  weeks  in  an  open-label  extension  study  (Study  20030194)  after  disease  progression, determined by the investigator.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  whether  panitumumab  plus  BSC  improves progression-free survival compared with BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who failed standard chemotherapy.

Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  overall  survival,  objective  response,  duration  of  response, time-to-response,  time-to-disease  progression,  time-to-treatment  failure,  duration  of  stable  disease, patient-reported outcomes and the safety profile of panitumumab plus BSC compared with BSC alone.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary outcome measure

The  primary  outcome  measure  was  progression-free  survival  which  was  defined  as  the  time  from randomisation to the date of the first observed progression or death.

## Secondary outcome measures

- -Overall survival: time from randomisation to death
- -Best objective response over time: the best disease status from randomisation through the end of the study
- -Duration  of  response:  for  responders  as  the  time  from  the  first  response  to  either  disease progression or death due to disease progression
- -Time-to-response:  time  from  randomisation  to  first  partial  or  complete  response,  subsequently confirmed ≥ 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met
- -Time-to-disease  progression:  time  from  randomisation  to  disease  progression  or  death  due  to disease progression
- -Time-to-treatment failure: time from randomisation to the time a decision was made to withdraw from the treatment phase for any reason
- -Duration  of  stable  disease:  patients  whose  best  response  was  stable  disease  as  the  time  from randomisation to disease progression or death due to disease progression
- -Quality of life measured by time-adjusted area under the curve for EUROQOL EQ-5D index and time-adjusted AUC for NCCN/FACT CRC subscale.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were evaluated for tumour response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) at Weeks 8, 12, 24, 32, 40, and 48 and thereafter every 3 months until disease  progression.  Patients  with  symptoms  suggestive  of  disease  progression  were  evaluated  for tumour status at the time the symptoms occurred. Tumour responses were to be confirmed no less than 4  weeks  after  the  criteria  for  response  were  first  met.  In  addition  to  the  investigator's  assessments, scans of all patients evaluated for tumour response were evaluated by a masked Independent Review Committee (IRC). The primary efficacy analysis was based on the masked IRC data.

## Sample size

The sample size was estimated to achieve &gt; 90% power for a 2-sided 1% significance level, given a hazard  ratio  (panitumumab  plus  BSC:BSC)  of  0.67,  which  can  be  translated  into  a  50%  relative median increase in progression-free survival (2.50 vs. 3.75 months) or a 14% absolute increase in the 6-month progression-free rate (19% vs. 33%). To achieve the sample-size goal, at least 362 patients in total were  required to have  either documented  evidence  of  objective  progression  by  the modified-RECIST criteria assessed by IRC or to have died. It was estimated that a total of 430 patients would be required.

## Randomisation

Patients  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  panitumumab  plus  BSC  or  BSC  alone. Randomisation  was  stratified  by  ECOG  performance  status  (0  or  1 vs. 2)  and  geographic  region (Western Europe vs. Central and Eastern Europe vs. rest of the world).

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study. Masking was considered by the applicant not possible because of the expected  skin-related  toxicities  related  to  panitumumab.  Access  to  the  data  was  restricted  to  a minimum  number  of  individuals  and  masked  data  were  reviewed  by  the  IRC  for  the  event-based progression-free survival analysis.

## Statistical methods

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival which was compared by a stratified log rank test. The stratification factors were ECOG performance status and geographic region.

If  the  log-rank  test  for  progression-free  survival  was  significant,  the  co-secondary  endpoints  of survival  and  best  objective  response  rate  over  time  were  analysed  simultaneously.  Survival  was analysed at the 4% significance level, while response rate was analysed at the 1% significance level. Hazard  ratios  and  corresponding  95%  confidence  intervals  were  estimated  by  Cox'  proportional hazards model.

After completion of the 2-year long-term follow-up, descriptive statistics will be provided for all data collected. For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard error (SE; for efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and quality of life endpoints), standard deviation (SD; for other measures), median, 25 th ,  75 th percentile, minimum, and maximum are provided. For discrete data, the frequency and percent distributions are provided.

## Recruitment

The enrolment period was from 16 January 2004 to 16 March 2005 and the cut-off date for clinical data was 30 June 2005.

Most  patients  were  enrolled  at  study  centres  in  Western  Europe  (77% panitumumab  plus  BSC, 78% BSC alone). One investigational centre was the highest-enrolling centre, with 63 patients (14%) overall:  35 patients  (15%)  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC  group  and  28 patients  (12%)  in  the  BSC alone group. The other study centres enrolled between &lt; 1% and 7% of patients overall.

## Conduct of the study

The  protocol  for  this  study,  originally  dated  12  September  2003,  was  amended  4  times.  All  the amendments were in effect prior to the data cut-off date (Table 12).

## Baseline data

In  the  ITT  population,  except  for  ECOG  status,  the  two  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with regard to demographic data and disease characteristics (Tables 14, 15 and 16).

BSC - best supportive care

Most patients in the panitumumab plus BSC and BSC alone groups had a partial response (29% and 33%,  respectively)  or  stable  disease  (45%  and  41%,  respectively)  as  their  best  response  to  any previous  line  of  chemotherapy.  The  percentages  of  patients  with  an  objective  response  or  stable disease decreased with increasing lines of chemotherapy and most patients in the panitumumab plus BSC  and  BSC  alone  groups  had  progressive  disease  as  their  best  response  to  the  last  line  of chemotherapy (58% and 57%, respectively). Medical history was generally similar between treatment groups.  In  both  treatment  groups,  the  median  percentage  of  tumour  cells  with  positive  EGFR membrane staining was 20%. The percentage of patients with positive EGFR membrane staining in &lt; 10% of tumour cells was similar in the panitumumab plus BSC group (26%) and BSC alone group (25%). A higher percentage of patients had positive membrane staining in &gt; 35% of tumour cells in the panitumumab plus BSC group (40%) than in the BSC alone group (31%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The IRC identified and measured target lesions at baseline for 95% of patients in the panitumumab plus  BSC  group  and  91%  of  patients  in  the  BSC  alone  group;  the  remaining  patients  had  only non-target  lesions  or  no  lesions  evaluated  by  the  IRC  at  baseline.  The  median  sum  of  target  lesion diameters was lower in the panitumumab plus BSC group (179.5 mm) than in the BSC alone group (193.0 mm), although the means were similar (198.2 and 198.4 mm, respectively).

## Numbers analysed

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  all  efficacy  endpoints  was  conducted  using  the  ITT  population. Secondary  analyses  of  all  efficacy  endpoints  were  conducted  using  the  Adjudicated  prior  failures population. The Per Protocol population was used in sensitivity analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival for protocol deviations.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint

## Progression-free survival (ITT population)

With a median follow-up of approximately 20 weeks, 193 patients (84%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group  and  208  patients  (90%)  in  the  BSC  alone  group  had  disease  progression  per  modified RECIST  criteria  by  IRC  or  died  due  to  any  reasons.  A  statistically  significant  improvement  in progression-free survival was observed for patients in the panitumumab plus BSC group compared with the BSC alone group (p &lt; 0.0001, stratified log-rank test).

## Secondary endpoints

## Overall survival (ITT population)

Most of the deaths occurred during long-term follow-up (29% panitumumab plus BSC group, 20% BSC alone group) or during Study 20030194 (22%) after patients in the BSC arm had crossed over to receive  panitumumab  monotherapy.  A  high  percentage  of  patients  in  the  BSC  group  (75%)  had radiographic disease progression by investigator assessment and crossed over into Study 20030194.

## Best objective response rate over time

In the ITT population, 19 patients (8%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group had an objective response per  modified  RECIST  criteria  assessed  by  the  IRC;  all  were  partial  responses  compared  with  no patient in the BSC alone group. Additionally, 64 patients (28%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 24 patients (10%) in the BSC alone group had a best response of stable disease.

## Quality of life

At Week 5, EUROQOL EQ-5D data were available for 91% of patients in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 70% of patients in the BSC alone group; by Week 17, data were available for 30% and 4% of patients, respectively. The amount of available data at Weeks 5 and 17 for the NCCN/FACT CRC subscale was very similar to that of the EUROQOL EQ-5D.

The panitumumab plus BSC group had a lower time-adjusted AUC for the DLQI92 (which assesses the  frequency  and  impact  of  skin  conditions  on  the  patient,  including  bother  and  embarrassment), indicating that these patients had more frequent skin symptoms (i.e., itchy, sore, painful skin) and were more embarrassed and bothered by their skin condition than patients in the BSC alone group. These results  are  consistent  with  the  higher  incidence  of  skin-  and  eye-related  adverse  events  in  the panitumumab  plus  BSC  group.  Although  patients  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC  group  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

negatively  affected  by  skin  toxicity  relative  to  the  BSC  alone  group,  no  statistically  significant  or clinically meaningful differences in overall quality of life were observed between treatment groups.

## Time-to-disease progression

In the ITT population, 189 patients (82%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 208 patients (90%) in the BSC alone group had disease progression per modified RECIST criteria assessed by the IRC or died of disease progression. The median time-to-disease progression was 8.0 weeks (95% CI: 7.9-8.7) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 7.3 weeks (95% CI: 7.1-7.7) in the BSC alone group.

## Time-to-treatment failure

In the ITT population, 202 patients (87%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 229 patients (99%) in the BSC group had ended the treatment period. The median time to treatment failure was 9.0 weeks (95% CI: 8.3-12.0) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 7.1 weeks (95% CI: 6.4-7.6) in the BSC alone group.

## Duration of stable disease

For the 64 patients (28%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 24 patients (10%) in the BSC alone group who had a best response of stable disease in the ITT population, the median duration of stable disease was 23.7 weeks (95% CI: 16.0-24.3) and 17.3 weeks (95% CI: 15.4-24.1), respectively.

## Duration of response and time-to-response

Of the 19 patients (8%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group who had a partial response assessed by the IRC, 10 patients (53%) later had disease progression and one patient died. The median duration of response was 17.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.4-25.3). The maximum duration of response was 40.4 weeks. The median follow-up time for censored patients (progressive disease not confirmed by the IRC, on treatment at cut-off) was 17.9 weeks. For those patients who had an objective response, the median time to response was 7.9 weeks (95% CI: 7.3-8.1).

## Ancillary analyses

## Prospective sensitivity analyses

## Progression-free survival

Several  prospectively  defined  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of  the results  for  progression-free  survival,  overall  survival  (OS)  and  objective  response  rate  (ORR). Consistent results were observed in prospectively-defined sensitivity analyses.

## Post-hoc sensitivity analyses

## Progression-free survival

Before Week 8, the percentage of patients with unscheduled assessments was 59% in the BSC alone group and 36% in the panitumumab plus BSC group. To evaluate potential bias based on the timing of unscheduled tumour assessments, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted in which events of disease progression confirmed by the IRC were moved to the day of the closest scheduled assessment time  in  both  treatment  groups  (deaths  were  not  moved).  The  treatment  effect  size  in  this  analysis (hazard ratio = 0.605, 95% CI: 0.491-0.745) was smaller than that observed in the primary analysis.

## Subgroup-analyses

## Progression-free survival

Exploratory  analyses  of  prospectively  defined  potential  prognostic  factors  for  progression-free survival in the ITT population (i.e., ECOG performance status, geographic region, EGFR membrane staining in tumour cells, age, gender, race, primary tumour diagnosis and progression during or after the  last  prior  chemotherapy  regimen),  independent  of  treatment  group,  indicated  that  ECOG performance  status  and  age  had  a  significant  effect  on  progression-free  survival.  Patients  with  an ECOG status of 0 or 1 were less likely to have disease progression or death relative to patients with an ECOG  status  of  2  or  3  (p &lt; 0.001,  log  rank  test),  regardless  of  treatment.  In  addition,  patients ≥ 65 years of age were less likely to have disease progression or death relative to patients &lt; 65 years of age (p = 0.055, log-rank test), regardless of treatment. Similar results were observed in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for randomised treatment.

## Overall survival

Exploratory subgroup analyses of the ITT population indicated that, as was observed for progression-free survival, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 was associated with a significantly lower  death  event  rate  than  an  ECOG  status  of  2  or  3  (p &lt; 0.001,  log-rank  test),  independent  of treatment  group.  In  addition,  EGFR  membrane  staining  of  3+  at  baseline  was  associated  with  a significantly  higher  death  event  rate  than  no  3+  staining  (p = 0.012,  log-rank  test),  independent  of treatment  group.  This  effect  of  EGFR  membrane  staining  was  statistically  significant  only  in  the panitumumab plus BSC group. Maximum integument and eye toxicity was possibly associated with survival, with a lower death rate for patients with more severe toxicity. This effect was only observed in the panitumumab plus BSC group; in the BSC alone group, the effect was reversed.

## Study 20020194

Study 20020194 was an open-label, single arm extension study to assess the safety of panitumumab monotherapy  in  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  who  had  progressed  in  the  BSC  arm  of Study 20020408  (Figure 10).  Panitumumab  was  administered  without  pre-medication.  However, throughout the study, investigators could prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary,  except  investigational  agents,  anti-EGFR  targeting  agents  other  than  panitumumab, experimental or approved anti-tumour therapies (e.g., bevacizumab), chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

- 1 q2w - every second week; BSC - best supportive care
- 2 If &gt; 3 months, a separate screening visit was required. All eligibility criteria were assessed before enrolment
- 3 Discontinuation due to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or request of patient or investigator

## Participants

One hundred eighty-one (181) patients were screened, of which 175 patients were enrolled. ECOG performance status and CEA levels had increased since the time of enrolment into Study 20020408. For other demographics and disease baseline characteristics, the data are in consistent with the data from Study 20020408.

## Outcomes/Endpoints

Efficacy endpoints

- -progression-free survival time
- -duration of response
- -objective response rate
- -time-to-response
- -survival time
- -duration of stable disease
- -time-to-treatment failure

Patients were evaluated for tumour response using modified-RECIST criteria every 8 weeks from the first  dose  of  panitumumab  and  at  the  time  of  suspected  disease  progression.  Local  assessment  was used  for  the  primary  analysis  of  response  rate.  Tumour  responses  were  to  be  confirmed  by  repeat assessments  no  less  than  4  weeks  after  the  criteria  for  response  were  first  met.  Time-to-disease progression was neither a pre-specified efficacy endpoint in the protocol nor in the statistical analysis plan.  The  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  the  investigators'  assessment  for  the  efficacy analysis.

## Results

Fifty-nine  of  the  175  patients  (34%)  withdrew  during  the  treatment  period  for  reasons  other  than disease  progression.  This  incidence  was  higher  than  that  observed  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC group of Study 20020408 (22%). Similar to Study 20020408, the most common of these reasons were adverse  events  (11  [8%]),  death  (19  [14%])  and  'other'  (including  clinical/symptomatic  disease progression, 23 [17%]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  median  follow-up  time  (Q1-Q3)  was  10.7  weeks  (7.4-18.3).  The  median  follow-up  time  for censored patients was 8.0 weeks, which is shorter than in Study 20020408 (17.9 weeks).

The efficacy results are shown in Table 22.

## · Study 20025405

## Participants

Three  hundred  eighty  (380)  patients  were  screened,  from  which  a  total  of  150  patients  (106  into Cohort A and 44 into Cohort B) were enrolled from 17 study sites.

## Treatments

Panitumumab was administered once weekly (2.5 mg/kg intravenous) for 8 consecutive weeks with a 1-week  rest  between  each  course.  The  maximum  duration  of  panitumumab  administration  was 54 weeks,  with  provisions  for  extended  treatment  beyond  6 courses  in  the  absence  of  disease progression or intolerability to panitumumab. Disease evaluation was performed every 9 weeks.

## Sample size

As outlined in the protocol, with a sample size of 100 patients in Cohort A (high EGFR expression), this study had 80% power at the 5% significance level (2-sided) to test the null hypothesis that the response  rate  was  10% vs. the  alternate  hypothesis  that  the  response  rate  was  truly  20%.  If  the observed  response  rate  was  20%,  this  sample  size  allowed  estimation  of  response  rate  to  within 8 percentage points with 95% confidence. With a sample size of 50 patients in Cohort B (low EGFR expression),  if  the  observed  response  rate  were  20%,  this  sample  size  would  allow  estimation  of response rate to within 11 percentage points with 95% confidence.

## Outcomes/endpoint

## The primary endpoint

- -Objective  tumour  response  after  the  initial  8-week  treatment  period  using  RECIST  criteria (confirmed by a scan no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met).

## The secondary endpoints

- -Best overall objective tumour response throughout study
- -Progression-free survival time
- -Time to disease progression
- -Survival time

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary analyses of efficacy were performed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study drug and were based on a centralised review of tumour scans performed by a third party.

## Results

Overall,  the  distribution  of  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  are  similar  to  the  pivotal Study 20020408.

All  but  two  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  panitumumab.  Eighty  six  percent  (86%)  ended treatment due to disease progression, 5% due to adverse events, 3% due to death and 4% due to patient refusal and other reasons.

Median follow-up time (from the first dose of panitumumab to last physician consult) in the whole dataset was 7 months (range: 0-25) for all patients. Median follow-up in Cohort A was approximately 1.5 months shorter than for Cohort B.

The objective tumour response rate after the first 8-week treatment period was 6.8% (95% CI: 3.3-12.1). Across all 148 patients, there were no complete response and 10 partial responses. Cohort B had a higher percent of responders than Cohort A (11.6% vs. 4.8%, respectively). The 4.8% response  rate  in  Cohort  A  was  not  significantly  different  from  10%  (p = 0.085)  or  from  Cohort  B (p = 0.155).

The response rate across the entire treatment period was 8.8% (95% CI: 4.8-14.6), time-to-progression was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.9-3.7) and median survival was 8.6 months (95% CI: 5.9-9.8).

## · Studies 20030167 and 20030250

## Participants

In Study 20030167, 300 patients were screened for this study of which 93 patients were enrolled into the study from 54 study centres.

In Study 20030250, 99 patients were screened for this study of which 88 patients were enrolled from 59 study centres (24 of these centres also enrolled patients into the Study 20030167).

## Treatments

Panitumumab was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 6 mg/kg given once every two weeks  until  patients  developed  progressive  disease,  were  unable  to  tolerate  panitumumab  or discontinued treatment for other reasons (e.g., administrative decision).

## Outcomes/endpoint

The  primary  efficacy  endpoints  (centrally  assessed)  were  objective  response  rate  through  Week 16 (responses needed to be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met) and duration of response.

The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (centrally  assessed  except  as  otherwise  noted)  were  objective response  rate  throughout  study,  time-to-response,  progression-free  survival  time,  time-to-disease progression, time-to-treatment failure (not centrally assessed), duration of stable disease (not centrally assessed), survival time.

Patients were evaluated for tumour response (both locally and centrally) at pre-specified timepoints, Weeks 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 and every 3 months thereafter during the treatment until disease progression.  The  primary  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  a  masked  IRC  of  scans  at  the  central imaging laboratory using modified-WHO criteria.

## Results

Overall,  the  distribution  of  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  are  similar  to  the  pivotal Study 20020408.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary efficacy subset for the interim report is evaluable adjudicated patients defined as patients who had ≥ 20 weeks potential follow-up, were determined to be eligible by the IRC (i.e., had received prior chemotherapy at the protocol-specified dose intensity and exposure, had developed progressive disease during or after their prior chemotherapy regimen and whose time between documented tumour progression and study entry was ≥ 6 months). These datasets were composed 39 and 23 patients for Study 20030167  and  20030250,  respectively.  A  supportive  analysis  was  conducted  on  evaluable patients  defined  as  patients  who  consented  and  enrolled  patients  who  had ≥ 20  weeks  of  potential follow-up. These evaluable patients were 59 patients in Study 20030167 and 32 in Study 20030250.

In Study 20030167, 91 of the 93 enrolled patients (98%) received at least one dose of panitumumab. The two patients who did not receive treatment were both determined to be ineligible after enrolment. As  of  the  data  cut-off  date  for  the  report,  18 patients  (19%)  were  still  in  the  treatment  period. Fifty-three patients (57%) ended treatment because of disease progression, 3% due to adverse events, 8% due to death and 5% due to protocol specified criteria.

In Study 20030250, all 88 enrolled patients received at least one dose of panitumumab. As of the data cut-off  for  the  report,  28  (32%)  patients  were  still  in  the  treatment  period.  Forty-five  (51%)  of  all enrolled patients ended treatment because of disease progression, 3% due to adverse events, 2% due to death and 2% due to protocol specified criteria.

In  Study  20030167,  protocol  deviations  included  six  patients  who  received  bevacizumab  within 6 weeks  before  enrolment  and  one  who  received  cetuximab  before  enrolment.  In  Study  20030250, protocol deviations included 10 patients who received bevacizumab within 6 weeks before enrolment.

In both studies, the median follow-up time (from enrolment to the last on-study safety follow-up or long-term follow-up visit) was 15 weeks (range: 1-64 weeks). The median potential follow-up time was 24 weeks (range: 4-64 weeks).

The results of the primary and the main secondary efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 24.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

None  of  the  studies  focused  on  thorough  pharmacokinetic  characterisation  of  panitumumab  in  the target patient population using a commercial batch (12 kl CHO) at the proposed dose with reasonable number of patients and none had pharmacokinetics as primary purpose. The applicant has chosen to rely on argumentation for equivalence between hybridoma-derived panitumumab and 2 kl-CHO derived panitumumab and subsequent equivalence between 2 kl-CHO derived panitumumab and 12 kl-CHO derived panitumumab. The study of the bioequivalence of the two products from the manufacturing change from a hybridoma to a CHO expression system suggests that they are similar. The  90% CI  did  not  fall  within  the  CHMP  Bioequivalence  Note  of  Guidance  recommended  range

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 80-125%, certainly because of small numbers of patients. The equivalence between panitumumab from 2 kl fermentation and 12 kl fermentation seems  to be the most critical regarding the pharmacokinetics and for that reason the demonstration of the equivalence should be very solid and reliable. Due to absence of a proper pharmacokinetic study and provided data from a limited number of patients, it is difficult to conclude with certainty on bioequivalence.

Panitumumab is administered intravenously. The results indicate a central volume of distribution of 42 ml/kg, which corresponds to the typical plasma volume in humans. Panitumumab is expected to be degraded into peptides and amino acids by reticulo-endothelial system (RES), like other IgG and also by receptor internalisation. The pharmacokinetics of panitumumab can be described by a 2-compartment  pharmacokinetic  model  with  dual  linear  (probably  RES)  and  non-linear  (probably EGFR) clearance pathways. Non-linear pharmacokinetics was observed in the dose-range 0.75-9.0 mg/kg. The time-averaged clearance value decreases with increasing dose.

Pharmacokinetic  steady-state  is  claimed  to  be  obtained  after  3  doses  at  6 mg/kg  every  two  weeks, however not obvious from the serum concentrations-time curves of the different studies. The half-life is approximately 8 days.

No studies were designed that specifically enable estimation of intra- or inter-individual variability. It would  have  been  appropriate  to  consider  both  intra-  and  between-subject  variation  in  much  more depth.

There  is  reasonable  evidence  that  gender,  age,  hepatic  function  or  tumour  type  does  not  affect  the pharmacokinetics for panitumumab to a large extent. Renally impaired patients seem to have higher peak  serum  concentrations  than  normal  patients.  Some  racial  variation  was  observed,  non-white patients having lower panitumumab serum concentrations at peak and trough. Body weight was found to be an influential covariate on panitumumab disposition, with increasing exposure of panitumumab with increasing body weight. There is no experience with children.

From  the  interactions  studies,  residuals  from  irinotecan  treatment  are  unlikely  to  interfere  with panitumumab after a switch from irinotecan to panitumumab.

The  principal  mechanism  is  known  with  acceptable  certainty  already.  There  is  no  overwhelming reason  to  believe  that  active  protein  binds  other  targets  in  a  clinically  relevant  fashion  but  the possibility can of course not be excluded. The link between pharmacodynamic effect and skin toxicity seems straightforward. However, recently (ASCO 2006 Annual Meeting) it has been reported that the EGFR antagonist, nimotuzumab, YM BioSciences, was not associated with any cases of severe rash.

This application is based on one pivotal, open-label, randomised, two arms, Phase III study and four uncontrolled,  single-arm,  Phase  II  studies  which  were  conducted  with  patients  with  metastatic colorectal  cancer  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  including  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin.

The pivotal study was conducted at 81 centres across Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and compared panitumumab at 6 mg/kg every two weeks and best supportive care vs. best supportive care  only.  The  treatment  was  given  until  disease  progression,  inability  to  tolerate  investigational product or other reason for discontinuation. The study design is acceptable as no generally recognised treatment options are available for patients who have failed prior chemotherapy regimens including 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin at the start of the study.

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  whether  panitumumab  plus  BSC  improves progression-free survival compared with BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had failed standard chemotherapy. Secondary objectives were to evaluate overall survival, objective response, duration of response, time-to-response, time-to-disease progression, time-to-treatment failure, duration of stable disease, patient-reported outcomes and the safety profile of panitumumab plus BSC compared with BSC alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At progression, patients in the BSC alone-arm had the option to receive panitumumab in an open-label extension  study  after  disease  progression.  At  the  cut-off  date  for  clinical  data,  a  large  proportion (75%) of the patients who had disease progression in the BSC alone group had crossed over to the extension  study.  The  crossover  occurred  early  in  the  study  (median  time-to-disease  progression  of 7.0 weeks). Therefore this crossover design makes interpretation of the overall survival data difficult.

In the two treatment arms, the baseline data of the recruited patients were not balanced with respect to metastatic site (liver: 77 vs. 84%), ECOG status (0: 46 vs. 34%; 1: 41 vs. 50%) and median tumour size (179.5 vs. 193.0 mm)  for panitumumab  plus  BSC  and  BSC  alone,  respectively. Other demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. Overall, the demographics  and  disease  baseline  characteristics  are  considered  as  representative  of  patients  with advanced mCRC.

There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two  treatments  arms  (p &lt; 0.0001)  with regard to the primary endpoint, progression-free survival. However, the difference between median progression-free survival in the two arms was only 5 days (8.0 vs. 7.3 weeks for panitumumab plus BSC arm and BSC alone arm, respectively). The hazard ratio, adjusted for ECOG (0 - 1 vs .  2+) and region, was in favour of the panitumumab plus BSC arm, 0.542 (95% CI: 0.443 - 0.663). There was a higher rate of unscheduled tumour assessments (between Weeks 0 and 8) for patients in the BSC alone group than in the panitumumab plus BSC group (59 vs. 36%, respectively). When corrected for this bias,  the  treatment  effect  size  (hazard  ratio  =  0.605,  95%  CI:  0.491-0.745,  p &lt; 0.0001)  was  smaller than  that  observed  in  the  primary  analysis.  At  Week  8  (first  tumour  assessment),  52  and  70%  had progressed in panitumumab plus BSC and BSC alone groups, respectively.

No  significant  difference  in  overall  survival  between  the  two  treatment  arms  (p = 0.6065)  was detected. The median overall survival time was 6.3 and 6.0 months for panitumumab plus BSC arm and  BSC  alone  arm,  respectively. Partial response was  detected in 19 patients (8%)  in the panitumumab plus BSC and none in the BSC alone groups and none of the patients  had  complete response. No significant difference was observed in the Quality of Life assessment.

The efficacy results from the four uncontrolled, monotherapy Phase II studies which included similar patient  populations  supported  the  efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  study.  However,  it  is  difficult  to compare across these supportive studies and the pivotal study as there are different eligibility criteria, different methods of evaluation of tumour response (modified-RECIST and WHO criteria), timepoints for  tumour  assessments,  primary  endpoints  and  panitumumab  production  procedure  (hybridoma vs . CHO). The general  picture  is  that  there  is  anti-tumour  efficacy  but  the  response  rate  is  low.  Only partial response was seen.

Overall,  the  data  from  the  pivotal  study  showed  statistically  significant  difference  between  the panitumumab  plus  BSC  and  BSC  alone  arms  with  respect  to  progression-free  survival.  However, together with the small difference in median progression-free survival (0.7 week) and no significant difference  in  overall  survival,  concerns  remain  regarding  the  clinical  relevance  of  panitumumab treatment effect.

The high mortality rate in advanced mCRC, with one-year survival of 43% (supported by results of the pivotal where approximately 50% of patients had died by Week 28), would have been ideal condition for  using  overall  survival  as  the  primary  endpoint..  Overall  mortality  would  have  been  a  more convincing primary endpoint, particularly as this was an open-label design.

There is also a problem with quantifying the size of the benefit in terms of median progression-free survival, because more than 50% of patients on both groups experienced progression before the first scheduled  assessment  visit.  The  scheduling  of  the  first  visit  was  probably  related  to  a  general underestimation  of  the  severity  of  the  patient  population.  When  powering  the  study  the  median progression-free survival on best supportive care was estimated to be about 2.5 months but in fact it was much shorter. This makes the study less sensitive to detect differences than it would have been if an earlier visit had been included, increasing the confidence that the highly significant benefit seen is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

real. But it does mean that summarising the results using median progression-free survival would not be appropriate.

Panitumumab affected cell growth of some EGFR positive tumour cell lines in vitro but not the growth of  those  with  no  or  negligible  EGFR.  The  expression  level  of  EGFR  in  a  subset  of  human  tumour xenografts did not predict a response to panitumumab. However the applicant assumed the mechanism of  action  would justify the adopted EGFR binary classification of positive or negative tumours and that efficacy would be reflected in the EGFR receptor data. This assumption was proven to be false, as EGFR status did not correlate with efficacy. It would have been more informative to recruit patients with a range of EGFR expression, including negative.

## Clinical safety

Safety evaluations of panitumumab have included analyses of 15 clinical studies in patients (n = 1304) with a variety of solid tumours (Table 25). Among those studies, 10 clinical studies of panitumumab monotherapy  have  enrolled  patients  (n = 789)  in  the  target  patient  population  (i.e.,  with  metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum after failure of prior standard chemotherapy).

The  applicant  provided  an  update  of  safety  data  from  clinical  studies  in  which  panitumumab  was administered as monotherapy in the target patient population which includes 131 new patients (a total of 920 patients and a longer follow-up time from 137 patients who remained on study at the time of the application submission). Thus, the median  length of follow-up for  this  updated  mCRC monotherapy set was 21 weeks compared with 17 weeks of those described in the original submission. Overall, these updated safety results confirmed the conclusions previously presented in this section.

SD - standard deviation; mCRC - metastatic colorectal cancer

Long-term exposure to panitumumab (i.e., ≥ 6 months) was limited as most studies were ongoing at the time of data cut-off and patients in these studies had an advanced stage of disease and progressed relatively  quickly,  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  treatment.  Most  patients  (91%)  in  the  mCRC monotherapy patient population received &lt; 6 months of panitumumab exposure. Data from long-term exposure ( ≥ 6 months) is available for 74 patients (9%) in the mCRC monotherapy patient population and 18 among these 74 patients had received ≥ 9 months of exposure. The median follow-up time for the mCRC monotherapy patient population was 17.0 weeks, with a range of 1 to 111 weeks.

Table 28 displays the patient baseline demographic and disease characteristics for  mCRC monotherapy and all monotherapy patient populations.

1 Patient incidence of common ( ≥ 5%) adverse events, NA: - incidence &lt; 5%

2 Patient incidence of common Grade 3 or higher adverse events, NA - incidence &lt; 2%

3 Adverse event terms indicative of progression of the underlying malignancy were grouped under the term 'disease progression'

The most common adverse events and reactions from the mCRC monotherapy patient population were skin adverse events followed by gastro-intestinal adverse events. These findings were also observed in the other datasets: All patients, All monotherapy for adverse events or reactions.

Targeted  adverse  events :  Adverse  events  of  special  interest  in  the  setting  of  panitumumab administration include integument and eye toxicities, stomatitis/oral mucositis, diarrhoea, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, pulmonary toxicity, vascular toxicity cardiac toxicity and infusion reactions  occurred  with  a  similar  incidence  and  severity  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  and  All monotherapy patient population, are detailed below.

Eight percent (8%) of patients required a temporary interruption and/or reduction of the panitumumab dose as a result of an integument- or eye-related toxicity. However, panitumumab administration was resumed after improvement of skin toxicity in 72% of these patients. Two percent (2%) of patients permanently  discontinued  panitumumab  administration  for  integument-  and  eye-related  toxicities. Forty patients (5%) had Grade 3 acneiform rash and one patient was reported to have 'acne' that was life  threatening  in  severity.  The  median  time  to  first  symptom  of  acneiform  rash  was  27  days (95% CI: 21 28) and the median duration of toxicity was 102 days (95% CI: 85-126).

Stomatitis/oral  mucositis  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  98%  of  patients  yielding  an  overall incidence of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis-type adverse events of 0.3%. However,  one case of life-threatening fungal stomatitis occurred approximately one month after  panitumumab  was discontinued.  The  patient  later  died  due  to  fatal  systemic  mycosis.  The  event  was  not  considered related to panitumumab by the investigator.

Diarrhoea  as  adverse  events  were  reported  in  29%  of  patients  and  were  considered  related  to panitumumab in 13% of patients. Most patients (93%) with diarrhoea had events mild or moderate in intensity. Fifteen patients (2%) had diarrhoea classified as severe. No patient had life-threatening or fatal diarrhoea. Six patients (1%) had events of diarrhoea by this definition that was serious; only one patient was considered related to panitumumab. Diarrhoea rarely led to modification of panitumumab administration: dose alteration and study discontinuation due to diarrhoea each occurred in one patient (&lt; 1%) and none interrupted panitumumab treatment because of diarrhoea.

Overall, 39% of patients with normal magnesium levels at baseline had decreases in serum magnesium levels of any grade. Grade 3 or 4 levels were observed in 5% of patients. Most of the decreases in serum  magnesium  were  asymptomatic  and  the  hypomagnesaemia  generally  responded  promptly  to intravenous administration of magnesium. No causal relationship was apparent between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypomagnesaemia and cardiac toxicity. Five patients (0.8%) had concurrent severe hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia. In 3 of these cases, the hypomagnesaemia preceded the hypocalcaemia by at least one day. The median duration of the concurrent Grade 3 events was 8 days (range: 4-49).

Most  treatment-related  pulmonary  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  most patients  with  treatment-related  pulmonary adverse events had pulmonary metastases at study entry, and  approximately  half  of  the  pulmonary  adverse  events  were  ongoing  after  discontinuation  of panitumumab.  One  severe  treatment-related  adverse  event  was  reported  (dyspnoea);  this  patient experienced dyspnoea 30 minutes after the first panitumumab infusion. No Grade 4 or 5 pulmonary adverse events were considered by the investigator to be treatment related. Interstitial lung disease was not identified as a complication in any patient.

The majority of the cardiac  adverse  events  were  either  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  Five  patients (&lt; 1%) experienced adverse events associated with cardiac function that led to either discontinuation or interruption of treatment, while no event led to an alteration of the dose. Most of the 12 patients with  serious  adverse  events  associated  with  cardiac  function  had  either  a  prior  history  of  the  same event  occurring  at  some  time  prior  to  study  enrolment  or  a  history  of  predisposing  cardiovascular co-morbidity and/or risk factors; nearly half of these patients had both prior event history as well as additional risk factors. Fatal events were reported for two patients and an additional two patients had Grade 4 (i.e., life-threatening) events associated with cardiac function. There did not appear to be a relationship  between  the  incidence  of  cardiac  adverse  events  and  duration  of  exposure,  length  of follow-up,  dosing  regimen,  panitumumab  cell  line  or  manufacturing  scale  nor  did  severity  of  the cardiac toxicities appear to be influenced by these factors.

The  overall  patient  incidence  of  oedema,  venous  and  arterial  vascular  adverse  events  was  19%. About 4% of these were Grade 3 or higher and 2% were considered to be related to study drug. In Study 20020408,  this  incidence  was  similar  as  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  patient  population  in panitumumab group (21%) but higher than the BSC alone group (10%). Three percent (3%) of patients experienced serious vascular adverse events, all of which could be explained by predisposing medical problems  such  as  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  adenocarcinoma,  advanced  age  or  the pre-existing history or medical complications. Seven patients (1%) were discontinued prematurely due to  vascular  adverse  events,  one  vascular  adverse  event  led  to  dose  interruption  and  one  led  to  dose alteration.

Adverse  events  defined  as  vascular  toxicity  was  experienced  by  16 patients  and  were  considered related to study drug: oedema peripheral (8 patients), pulmonary embolism (3 patients), hypertension (2 patients)  and  cerebrovascular  accident,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  oedema  and  thrombophlebitis superficial (1 patient each). The adverse events were mild (5 patients), moderate (6 patients), severe (1 patient), life-threatening (2 patients, both pulmonary embolism) and fatal (1 patient with cerebrovascular accident and 1 with pulmonary embolism).

No  potential  infusion  reaction  was  life-threatening  or  fatal.  Most  of  the  symptoms  of  potential infusion reactions were mild in intensity, occurred during the panitumumab infusion, resolved without treatment and were isolated occurrences without alteration or interruption of panitumumab administration.

Immunological  events :  As  a  human  antibody,  an  immunological  response  is  possible  to  the panitumumab molecule. In addition, during the CHO manufacturing process an extra sequence of light chain  can  be  translated.  This  extra  sequence  may  emerge  as  a  pre-monomer  peak  before  the panitumumab peak that is approximately 1% of the main peak. Immunogenicity to both panitumumab and the pre-monomer were evaluated.

An  acid  dissociation  ELISA  was  used  as  a  screening  immunogenicity  assay,  an  immunodepletion assay  as  confirmation,  a  bioassay  to  test  for  neutralising  activity  and  a  Biocore  based  assay  for isotyping and affinity testing. Table 32 presents these results.

- 1 Collected at least 21 days after the last panitumumab infusion
- 2 One patient tested positive for neutralizing antibodies in the in vitro biological assay in a post-dose sample

3 One of these two patients with follow-up samples tested positive for pre-existing antibodies at baseline

- 4 Two of the patients with post-dose samples tested positive for pre-existing antibodies at baseline

When compared to patients who did not develop antibodies, no relationship between the presence of anti-panitumumab antibodies and pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety has been observed.

The  incidence  and  type  of  serious  adverse  events  in  the  All  monotherapy  patient  population  were consistent with those in the mCRC monotherapy patient population.

## Deaths

Table 34 displays the number and percent of the reasons of deaths that occurred on study or within 30 days  of  the  last  dose  of  panitumumab  for  mCRC  monotherapy  and  All  monotherapy  patient populations.

## mCRC monotherapy patient population

Most  other  non-disease  progression  causes  of  death  also  appeared  to  be  related  to  the  underlying primary malignancy (such as hepatic failure, intestinal perforation, pleural effusion, small intestinal obstruction).  Of  the  14  non-disease  progression  deaths  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  population  two were considered to be possibly related to panitumumab by the investigator: pulmonary embolism in one patient and myocardial infarction in another.

An additional 69 deaths in the mCRC monotherapy population occurred between 31 and 60 days after the  last  dose  of  panitumumab.  Fifty-six  (81%)  of  these  deaths  were  due  to  disease  progression. Non-disease progression deaths included respiratory failure, systemic mycosis  resulting  from mucositis and 'unknown' (one patient each) and for 10 deaths the cause was not reported at the report cut-off date.

## All monotherapy patient population

In  the  1,130  patients  in  the  monotherapy  patient  population,  134  (12%)  died  during  panitumumab treatment or within 30 days of the last dose. Disease progression was reported as the cause of death in 118 patients. There were an additional 85 deaths that occurred between 31 and 60 days after the last dose of panitumumab and all of these deaths were considered to be caused by disease progression.

## · Combination treatment

There were 174 patients who received panitumumab (for 93% at dose of 2.5 mg/kg once a week) in combination with chemotherapy. Nineteen patients received panitumumab  with IFL regimen (irinotecan,  leucovorin  and  5-fluorouracil),  24  with  FOLFIRI  regimen  (irinotecan,  leucovorin  and 5-fluorouracil) and 131 with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

Overall, the safety profile of the combination regimens was dominated by adverse events related to the chemotherapy,  with  the  addition  of  the  skin  toxicities  attributable  to  panitumumab.  While  no  clear additive  effect  was  observed  in  the  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  setting  where  panitumumab  was combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel, in the mCRC setting panitumumab in combination with IFL, the incidence of severe diarrhoea was notably higher than that historically expected for this already highly GI-toxic chemotherapy regimen and one patient had an episode of Grade 4 diarrhoea that was also considered serious. Of note, panitumumab in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen using the same agents  but  different  doses/infusion  times  was  well  tolerated  with  an  incidence  of  severe  diarrhoea similar to that expected from the literature for this chemotherapy regimen alone.

There were three fatal events in the all combination patient population which were considered possibly related  to  panitumumab  therapy.  The causes  of  the  deaths  were  pulmonary  fibrosis,  gastrointestinal perforation and cerebrovascular accident. Of the 174 patients, 17 died during panitumumab treatment or within 30 days of drug discontinuation. Disease progression was the primary cause of death in eight of  these.  Many  of  the  others  reflected  the  toxicity  of  the  chemotherapy,  including  pneumonia  and pancytopenia or were related to malignancy, such as gastrointestinal perforation and paralytic ileus. There were a further two deaths between 31-60 days of stopping treatment caused by cardiopulmonary arrest and complications from elective surgery.

## · Post-marketing experience

None, although recently approved in the USA.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Safety was assessed by review of death, discontinuation of treatment, analyses of laboratory data, vital signs,  serious  and  non-serious  adverse  events.  Data  from  1304  patients  (789  with  mCRC  and monotherapy,  341  with  other  solid  tumours  and  monotherapy;  174  with  mCRC  and  combination therapy)  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  panitumumab  was  included  in  the  safety  analyses. Safety  assessment  focused  on  key  safety  findings  observed  with  administration  of  panitumumab  as monotherapy (mCRC monotherapy; All monotherapy), as monotherapy is the applied regimen. The majority  of  the  patients  (77  and  58%  in  mCRC  monotherapy  and  All  monotherapy,  respectively) received  as  per  proposed  posology  (6  mg/kg  every  two  weeks).  There  is  limited  data  on  long-term exposure to panitumumab (74 patients with ≥ 6  months of exposure); however, this is acceptable as the  indication  sought  assumes  a  patient  population  with  limited  life  expectation.  Overall,  the  two datasets of interest are comparable with respect to demographics and disease baseline characteristics. The population included in the primary analysis for safety (mCRC monotherapy patient population) is considered representative of patients with advanced mCRC.

All patients in the mCRC monotherapy patient population had at least one adverse event during the study  period.  The  most  common  ( ≥ 15%)  adverse  events  were  associated  with  the  skin,  including acneiform dermatitis (52%), pruritus, erythema (49% each), and rash (38%), skin exfoliation (23%), paronychia (19%) and skin fissures and dry skin (16% each) which reflect the pharmacological effect of  inhibition  of  EGFR  signalling  pathway.  Other  common  adverse  events  were  fatigue  (33%), nausea (29%),  diarrhoea  (26%),  constipation,  abdominal  pain  (20%  each)  and  anorexia  (19%). Approximately one-half of patients (54%) reported at least one Grade 3 or higher adverse event and the  most  common  ones  were  pruritus,  rash,  and  abdominal  pain  (5%  each).  The  adverse  events frequency and distribution are similar between the mCRC monotherapy and All monotherapy patient populations,  except  for  skin  exfoliation  which  occurred  with  a  difference  in  incidence  of ≥ 5% (23% vs. 17%, respectively).

The most common adverse events reported as severe, life threatening or fatal were directly attributed to the underlying cancer. Two patients had fatal adverse events (one patient with pulmonary embolism and one with cardiovascular accident and myocardial infarction) reported as related to panitumumab treatment. Additionally, eight patients (1%) had life-threatening adverse events that were considered related  to  panitumumab  (one  patient  had  acute  myocardial  infarction,  three  had  hypomagnesaemia, one had acute renal failure, two had pulmonary embolism, and one had acne and erythema).

Due  to  high  percentage  of  patients  still  on  study,  suboptimal  compliance  with  protocol-required sample collection at follow-up, complete immunogenicity data are available for only approximately one-third of the patients enrolled. From these limited data available, there is no apparent impact the presence of anti-panitumumab antibodies on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety parameters.

Like  other  EGFR-inhibitors,  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  related  to  panitumumab pharmacological effect, inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway. However, the one fatal and two life-threatening cases of pulmonary embolism in this relatively small safety population raise concerns.

No data are  available  to  evaluate  safety  profile  of  panitumumab  in  patients  with  renal  impairment, paediatric patients and pregnant women. No notable differences were observed in panitumumab safety profile when assessed by gender, age or race.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The preclinical testing programme for panitumumab included primary and secondary pharmacology studies,  assessment  of  cross  reactivity,  one  safety  pharmacology  study,  a  number  of  repeated  dose general toxicology studies and two studies assessing toxicity to reproductive function.

Panitumumab  binds  to  the  ligand-binding  domain  of  EGFR  to  competitively  inhibit  the  action  of EGFR ligands to promote phosphorylation of EGFR. Where EGFR stimulation drives tumour growth, this competitive binding disrupts the EGFR ligand signal and consequently has an anti-tumour action. EGFR expression is abnormal in malignant transformations in a variety of cell types. The ability of panitumumab  to  inhibit  growth  of  a  range  of  tumour  types  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  when  these  were transplanted into athymic mice has been adequately shown.

Toxicity to skin and diarrhoea was the primary toxicity of panitumumab in monkeys. These effects are also seen with other chimeric anti-EGFR antibody and with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR. It is considered directly related to the pharmacological action of drugs that inhibit EGFR signalling.

Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development since foetal panitumumab exposure  levels  were  not  examined.  EGF  and  EGFR  are  involved  in  embryo-foetal  growth  and development  and effects on growth and development  would  therefore be expected. Indeed, panitumumab  has  been  shown  to  be  an  abortifacient  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  when  administered during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 6-fold the exposure of recommended human dose on a  mg/kg  basis.  No  pre-  and  post-natal  development  animal  studies  have  been  conducted  with panitumumab.

The  pivotal  study  compared  panitumumab  plus  BSC  to  BSC  alone  in  patients  with  metastatic colorectal  cancer  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, allowance of crossing over for patients in the controlled arm if they are declared progressing. The first assessment of progression was done at 8 weeks, at which time a large proportion of patients had already progressed. As this was an open-label  study,  more  patients  in  the  BSC  arm  had  unscheduled  visits  to  their  physician  before Week 8,  allowing  disease  progression  to  be  detected  earlier in these patients.  A  very  small improvement  in  progression-free  survival,  no  significant  difference  in  overall  survival  and  a  low objective response rate were observed.

## Safety

Like  other  EGFR-inhibitors,  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  related  to  the  pharmacological effect  (inhibition  of  the  EGFR  signalling  pathway)  and  resulted  mainly  skin  toxicity.  The  high incidence of adverse events affecting the patients' quality of life is a safety concern. Although most deaths were secondary to disease progression, there were several deaths that may have been related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action of panitumumab.

Anti-idiotypic  antibodies  may  inhibit  the  mechanism  of  action.  From  these  limited  data  available, there  is  no  apparent  impact  of  the  presence  of  anti-panitumumab  antibodies  on  pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety parameters but this could not be totally ruled out.

## User consultation

The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  (PIL)  for  Vectibix  20 mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion (panitumumab)  has  been  tested in English in  accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive  2004/27/EC.  The  PIL  for  Vectibix  20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion  (panitumumab)  was  found  to  contain  all  the  necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing.

## Risk/benefit assessment

In  the  pivotal  study,  panitumumab  plus  best  supportive  care  (BSC)  was  compared  to  BSC  alone  in patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  containing 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The pivotal study was not adequately designed to demonstrate difference in overall survival as patients in  the  BSC  arm  were  allowed  to  cross-over  to  the  panitumumab  arm  when  progressing,  thereby confounding the comparison of overall survival between treatment groups. In late stage cancer patients with short expected lifetime, it would have been possible to run a trial without cross-over which would have allowed estimating the effect of treatment with panitumumab on overall survival.

The first assessment of progression was done at 8 weeks, at which time a large proportion of patients had  already  progressed.  As  this  was  an  open-label  study,  more  patients  in  the  BSC  arm  had unscheduled  visits  to  their  physician  before  Week 8,  allowing  disease  progression  to  be  detected earlier in these patients. The lack of a scheduled early visit in both treatment arms leads to bias, and the  overall  difference  in  PFS  is  probably  overestimated.  Notwithstanding  these  methodological weaknesses, only a very small improvement in progression-free survival, no significant difference in overall  survival  were  observed,  and  a  low  objective  response  rate.  A  clinically  relevant  benefit  has thus not been sufficiently proven.

The  most  common  adverse  events  reported  as  severe,  life  threatening  or  fatal  were  related  to  the underlying disease, however some deaths may have been related to panitumumab pharmacodynamic mode of action. As expected for an EGFR inhibitor, the most common adverse reactions by patient incidence  were  skin  reactions,  including  acneiform  dermatitis,  pruritus,  erythema  and  rash  which reflect  the  pharmacological  effect  of  inhibition  of  EGFR  signalling  pathway.  The  quality  of  life assessment  indicated  that  the  patients  experiencing  these  adverse  reactions  were  more  embarrassed and disturbed by their skin condition than patients in the BSC alone group.

Of note, a study with panitumumab combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy vs. bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone (PACCE), as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic CRC has been stopped  due  to  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  PFS  in  patients  receiving  panitumumab.  The addition of panitumumab in the PACCE trial also led to a considerably higher frequency of severe adverse events, including deaths. Although the study is not of direct relevance to the indication sought the safety information is of major concern, also, for the claimed indication.

In conclusion, the risk/benefit of panitumumab in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy containing 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin is not considered favourable due to the following grounds:

- The pivotal, open-label study is difficult to interpret because the majority of patients in the BSC were switched to panitumumab early on. More patients in the BSC arm had unscheduled visits to their  physician  before  Week 8  (first  scheduled  study  visit),  allowing  disease  progression  to  be detected earlier in these patients.
- Only a very small effect on progression-free survival has been observed, and no favourable effect has been shown in terms of overall survival or other clinical benefit endpoint.
- Treatment with panitumumab was associated with skin reactions, including acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, and poorer quality of life was reported in patients experiencing these adverse reactions.  In  addition,  safety  information  from  the  PACCE  study  raised  additional  concerns, including increased mortality in panitumumab-treated patients.
- The clinical efficacy observed is too small to constitute a clinical benefit and does not outweigh the risks associated to treatment with panitumumab.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal after failure of prior chemotherapy containing 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## 7. Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 24 May 2007

Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  the  risk/benefit  balance  of  panitumumab  in  the  treatment  of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy containing 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin  was  unfavourable,  the  applicant  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the re-examination of the grounds for refusal. The applicant presented a number of arguments regarding the grounds for refusal.

Ground #1 (design of the pivotal study). The Applicant acknowledged that:

-  Study  20020408  was  the  first randomised  study  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of panitumumab against BSC in an advanced, refractory mCRC
-  the study  design allowed  patients  in  the  BSC  group  who  progressed  to  be  enrolled  in Study 20030194 to receive panitumumab ('active crossover') which confounds a direct evaluation of the effect of panitumumab on overall survival
-  More patients in the BSC arm had unscheduled visit before Week 8, allowing disease progression to be detected earlier in these patients.

However, sensitivity analyses were performed to facilitate the interpretation of the results in which progression  (assessed  by  IRC)  were  imputed  either  a)  at  the  closest  scheduled  assessment  time  or b) the next scheduled assessment time. For each method of imputation, PFS was modelled either as a continuous or discrete time variable. The results of these analyses are show in Table 38.

| Discrete time model b                                           | 0.54           | 0.41 - 0.71 |

Note: Cox models adjusted for randomisation factors (ECOG score and geographic region)

The  hazard  ratio  ranges  for  the  continuous  and  discrete  time  models  are  very  consistent  with  the primary analysis. Thus, even the most conservative estimate indicates the rate PFS was decreased by approximately 40% in the panitumumab group compared with BSC.

Ground #2 (treatment effect). The Applicant argued that:

- PFS  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of  patients  receiving  panitumumab  (Table 18),  as above-mentioned sensitivity analyses showed hazard ratios ranging from 0.53 to 0.61 (Table 38).
- There was a greater probability of being alive and progression free at Week 8 of treatment with panitumumab  compared  to  BSC  alone.  A  similar  estimate  was  observed  up  to  Week 24 post-randomisation (Figure 12).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- Remaining progression free at Week 8 was strongly associated with a better survival prognosis on panitumumab (Table 39).
- Panitumumab had an impact on tumour burden, 42% of patients randomised to panitumumab had a decrease in target lesions compared with 3% of patients randomised to BSC (Figure 13).

- Due  the  possibility  of  initiating  panitumumab  treatment  in  BSC  patients  after  progression,  the Study 20020408 design did compromise any conclusion on OS improvement. However, a study using monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) in mCRC demonstrated an association between PFS and OS (Jonker et al, 2007).

Overall,  the  observed  magnitude of  the  treatment  effect  on  PFS  as  measured  by  the  hazard  ratio  is clinically meaningful in the targeted patient population after failure of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin  therapy  and  compares  favourably  with  that  observed  with  other  agents  licensed  for  the treatment of metastatic CRC. Additional trials of panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy are ongoing to further characterise the effect of panitumumab on OS.

Ground #3 (safety profile). The Applicant stated that:

- Treatment-related adverse events were predominantly mild-to-moderate skin toxicities, a recognised  class  effect  of  EGFR  inhibitors.  Approximately 75%  of  patients  who  reduced  or interrupted panitumumab dosing because of a skin-related adverse event were able to subsequently reinstate their initial dose. Patients most bothered by their skin toxicity appeared to experience the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

best  overall  outcomes  (Figure 14),  i.e.,  better  PFS  and  better  OS.  Similar  results  have  been observed with other EGFR inhibitors for worst severity of skin toxicity (Perez-Soler et al, 2005). In clinical studies, there were a low incidence of infusion reactions (none were life-threatening or fatal), even in the absence of premedication.

- Severe, life-threatening or fatal adverse events were generally attributable to comorbid illnesses rather than to panitumumab.
- In the Study 20020408, the QoL was assessed using:
- the  NCCN/FACT  CRC  symptom  index  (FCSI)  for  colorectal  cancer  symptoms.  The  FCSI results were numerically in favour of panitumumab
- the  modified  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (mDLQI)  subscale  for  the  impact  of  skin toxicity. Patient treated with panitumumab had lower scores, indicating that they were more symptomatic and more embarrassed and/or bothered by their skin symptoms than were patient with BSC alone
- the EuroQol-5D Health Index (EQ-5D Index) and the EORTC Global Health/Quality of Life Scale (EORTC Global) for the overall QoL. The results indicate that panitumumab did not have a negative impact on overall QoL.
- The  PACCE  study  was  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  (primary  endpoint  PFS,  secondary endpoints OR rate, time to treatment failure, OS) and safety of bevacizumab and chemotherapy (oxaliplatin or irinotecan) combined or not with panitumumab for first-line treatment of mCRC.
- Initial interim safety results were based on all 926 enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Of these, 793 patients received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and 133  patients  received  irinotecan-based  chemotherapy,  the  reported  results  are  based  on patients  who  received  oxaliplatin  as  chemotherapy.  A  summary  of  main  safety  results  is displayed in Table 40.

1: Does not include deaths attributed to disease progression (i.e., neoplasms)

- The  planned  interim analysis showed  an  unfavourable  benefit  for  panitumumab  plus bevacizumab/oxaliplatin vs. bevacizumab/oxaliplatin alone based on reduced PFS (8.8 months 95%  CI:  8.3  to  9.5)  versus  10.5 months  95%  CI:  9.4  to  12.0,  HR  1.44,  p = 0.0004),  on progression rate or died (ICR assessment) (147 [36%] versus 110 patients [27%], respectively),  overall  survival  (HR 1.56  [1.11,  2.17])  and  best  overall  response  rates  (ICR assessment) (39% vs. 41%, respectively).
- The interim data from two ongoing clinical trials investigating combination treatment (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) with panitumumab do not reveal alarming trends observed in the panitumumab arm of the PACCE study (diarrhoea, dehydration, infection, pulmonary embolism or thromboembolic events). No alarming signal is revealed when pooled safety data from these studies are compared with historical safety data from other mCRC  trials that included only chemotherapy (i.e., FOLFOX or FOLFIRI).

The overall safety profile and pattern of adverse events remained consistent with mCRC monotherapy compared with the ongoing post-marketing safety surveillance and clinically manageable. Moreover, PACCE study are consistent with the observed toxicity of dual pathway inhibition in combination with chemotherapy, therefore PACCE study results should not be generalised to the use of panitumumab as monotherapy.

Ground #4 (risk/benefit  balance).  The  Applicant  has  identified  a  biomarker  (KRAS)  which  allows selecting patients who will not benefit from panitumumab treatment.

- The median PFS in the wild type KRAS population was 12.3 weeks vs. 7.3 in the mutant type KRAS population  which  is  a  difference  of  5  weeks  (HR  0.45,  95%  CI  0.34-0.59)  (Figures 15 and 16).

- The results on PFS are supported by the OR and SD rates (assessed by the IRC) where 17 and 34%  was  observed  in  the  wild-type  vs.  0  and  12%  in  mutant-type,  respectively.  Beneficial treatment  effect  is  present  when  maximum  decrease  in  tumour  size  is  considered  however  no effect on OS was observed in this subgroup of patients either.
- This subgroup analysis indicates that patients with wild-type KRAS receives more infusions and had a slightly increased incidence of adverse events, however the rates observed were comparable to those seen in the mCRC monotherapy dataset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The applicant is conducting two large pivotal, Phase III studies (Studies 20050181 and 20050203) in patients with mCRC using panitumumab in combination as first or second-line treatment. The applicant commits:
-  using that further data for confirming treatment effects in the wild-type and mutant KRAS populations
-  exploring  the  utility  of  other  biomarkers  that  may  further  identify  those  more  likely  to respond.

Ground #5 . From clinical efficacy and safety data presented above, the Applicant is of viewpoint that the  treatment  effect  observed  in  the  subpopulation  of  patients  who  had  progressed  on  all  available anticancer therapies patient and presenting with wild type KRAS phenotype is of clinical relevance with an acceptable safety profile.

The CHMP requested the SAG to answer to following 3 questions:

1. Does  the  observed  treatment  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  represent  a  clinical  benefit,  taking  into account:
- concerns with the reliability of the PFS measure, in particular due to the design and conduct of the pivotal study (open-label and asymmetry of the unscheduled visit before Week 8) and
- lack  of  evidence  of  any  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  overall  survival  or  other  important clinical benefit endpoints

Divergent views were expressed but the SAG-oncology globally considers that:

- Overall Survival remains the most appropriate endpoint for end stage of the disease. There is no suggestion that treatment with panitumumab had any effect on important clinical endpoints such as overall survival.
- Progression-free survival is considered to be an endpoint that is of relevance in earlier lines of the treatment. Regardless of line of treatment, PFS would require large effects in order to be considered of any benefit to the patient (PFS). Despite the statistically significant difference observed in terms of the primary endpoint PFS, the observed difference is very small and is not considered to be of clinical relevance. Small differences of this kind are, may be, partly due to chance and partly caused by imbalances of known and unknown prognostic factors. In this  respect,  concerns  were  raised  on  unbalanced  baseline  characteristics  of  recognised prognostic factors favouring the experimental treatment arm.
2. Does the toxicity profile of panitumumab in the claimed indication raise safety concerns? To what extent  does  the  toxicity  observed  in  the  PACCE  study,  including  increased  mortality  in panitumumab-treated patients, contribute to safety concerns for the claimed target population in this submission?

The SAG-oncology does not consider that the safety profile of panitumumab is a major concern since  it  appears  being  not  really  different  from  those  described  for  other  EGFR  inhibitors.  The panitumumab toxicity is recognised to be clinically manageable by the experts. However, in the absence of a meaningful benefit, the benefit risk was considered negative.

3. Would KRAS mutation status be an appropriate bio-marker for selecting patients for initiating a treatment with panitumumab? Would further data be necessary to support this observation or to fully demonstrate that KRAS mutation status is a relevant bio-marker for patient selection?

The results of the post-hoc analyses on KRAS being a possible biomarker for selection of patients to be treated with panitumumab are interesting but remain exploratory findings which need to be confirmed by results of prospective, well-designed, well-conducted study(ies). From a pharmacological point of view this remains a possible theory but there are no data to confirm it.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The pivotal trial showed an effect on PFS that is considered small, but of a comparable magnitude to those observed in other studies which have supported recent regulatory approvals for other anticancer drugs as irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, or cetuximab.

For Study 20020408, additional analysis results showed a statistically significant larger panitumumab treatment  effect  on  PFS  in  patients  with  the  wild-type  KRAS  compared  with  patients  with  the mutant-type.

Most  common  adverse  events  observed  in  clinical  trials  of  panitumumab  monotherapy  or  in combination with chemotherapy were skin rash, it is a well-known side  effect of EGFR inhibitors. These effects were manageable since 75% of patients who reduced or interrupted panitumumab dosing because  of  a  skin-related  adverse  event  were  able  to  subsequently  reinstate  their  initial  dose. Moreover, measures of overall Quality of Life do not indicate that panitumumab has a clear positive impact on Quality of Life.

Finally,  results  taken  from  the  PACCE  study  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  in  the  context  of panitumumab being used together with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. These results should not  be  generalised  to  include  the  use  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  regimens alone or the monotherapy settings.

Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Overall,  the  additional  arguments  and  analyses  presented  indicate  that  the  benefit-risk  profile  of panitumumab is marginally positive in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin.  However,  the inability  to  select  patients  that  respond  to  treatment  is  a  pitfall  of  available  options  in  this  setting. Additional efficacy analyses provided indicated an interaction of panitumumab with KRAS mutation status.  Although  this  interaction  is  being  investigated  further  in  prospective  trials,  this  interaction allows selecting patients for treatment with panitumumab and the indication should be restricted based on this criterion. The ability to select patients that might benefit from treatment with this type of agent is considered a major therapeutic advantage to those affected.

In addition, the applicant has agreed to provide a prospective statistical analysis plan describing the analysis  of  a  wild-type  KRAS  subpopulation  in  ongoing  Phase 3  trials.  The  applicant  has  also committed to explore and report the utility of other biomarkers that may further identify those more likely to respond and to provide additional data on Quality of Life using a validated scale. Finally, the applicant has committed to ensure the availability of KRAS test kit.

Thus, concerning the grounds for negative opinion, having considered the additional arguments and analyses presented by the applicant and the answers from the SAG, the CHMP concluded that:

- Based on sensitivity analyses presented, unscheduled visits are unlikely to alter the conclusions in terms  of  the  statistically  significant  effect  observed  in  terms  of  PFS  and  major  bias  can  be excluded.
- A small but statistically significant effect in terms of progression-free survival has been observed and  efficacy  can  be  considered  demonstrated  even  in  the  absence  of  a  statistically  significant difference in terms of overall survival.
- The safety  profile  of  panitumumab  is  not  a  major  concern  and  appears  to  be  similar  from  that described for other EGFR inhibitors. The toxicity of panitumumab is recognised to be clinically manageable.
- The clinical efficacy observed is small but a positive benefit-risk profile can be established in a restricted indication.

The CHMP considered the need to provide additional information to refine the understanding about the  interaction  of  panitumumab  with  KRAS  mutation  status  in  prospective  studies,  and  having

consulted with the applicant considered the granting of a marketing authorisation subject to specific obligations to be reviewed annually by the Agency.

The  CHMP  considers  that  Vectibix  falls  within  the  scope  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  507/2006,  with particular  reference  to  Article  2,  based  on  the  following  grounds.  Vectibix  aims  at  the  treatment  of metastatic colorectal cancer which a seriously debilitating and life-threatening disease.

The  CHMP  considers  that  Vectibix  fulfils  the  requirements  of  Article  4  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 507/2006 based on the following grounds:

- (a) The main clinical efficacy data for Vectibix are based on a randomized trial of Vectibix plus best supportive care vs. best supportive care in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Vectibix was  administered  as  monotherapy  at  the  recommended  dose  of  6 mg/kg  of  bodyweight  given once  every  two  weeks.  Patients  to  be  included  had  to  have  documented  evidence  of  disease progression  during  or  after  treatment  with  a  fluoropyrimidine,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin  for metastatic  colorectal  carcinoma.  In  this  randomised,  controlled,  clinical  trial,  a  statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival has been observed among Vectibix treated patients compared with those who received best supportive care alone. In an analysis adjusting for  potential  bias  from  unscheduled  assessments,  based  on  all  patients,  the  rate  of  disease progression or death in patients who received Vectibix was reduced by 40% relative to patients who received best supportive care alone. Additional retrospective efficacy analyses studied the association  between KRAS mutation  status  determined  in  archived  paraffin  embedded  tumour tissue and clinical outcome. In the KRAS wild-type subgroup, the rate of disease progression or death in  patients  who  received  Vectibix  was  reduced  by  51%  relative  to  patients  that  received best  supportive  care  alone.  No  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  the KRAS mutant group. The safety profile in the KRAS wild-type subgroup was considered acceptable. Thus, the benefit-risk profile of Vectibix monotherapy, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive in the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma  with  non-mutated  (wild-type) KRAS after  failure  of  fluoropyrimidine-,  oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens.
- (b) Studies (20050181 and 20050203) to provide a better understanding of the role of the interaction between panitumumab and KRAS mutation status are ongoing and it is expected that results will be submitted in the agreed timeframe as specific obligations to be reviewed on a yearly basis. Ongoing trials, although conducted in different clinical settings from the proposed indication, will provide  valuable  information  about  the  impact  on  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  the  interaction between treatment effect of panitumumab and KRAS mutation status. Therefore, it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data.
- (c) There are few treatment options available for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma after failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin.  Cetuximab, which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor of EGFR is approved for use in combination with irinotecan in patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed prior irinotecan  therapy.  Patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  and  monoclonal  antibodies  tend  to progress after a certain time and their only treatment option is best supportive care. The inability to select patients that respond to treatment is a pitfall of available treatment options in this setting. The retrospective analyses presented for Vectibix monotherapy indicated an interaction between treatment effect of panitumumab and KRAS mutation status. In the KRAS wild-type subgroup, the rate  of  disease  progression  or  death  in  patients  who  received  Vectibix  was  reduced  by  51% relative  to  patients  that  received  best  supportive  care.  No  significant  treatment  effect  was observed in the KRAS mutant group. This interaction allows to select patients for treatment with panitumumab and to exclude patients that are unlikely to benefit from this type of treatment and for  whom  other  options  might  be  available.  The  ability  to  select  patients  with  metastatic colorectal  carcinoma  who  are  likely  to  benefit  from  Vectibix  monotherapy  treatment,  allowing physicians  to  make  an  informed  decision  about  the  best  treatment  options  for  patients  having failed a number of previous combination regimens, is considered a major therapeutic advantage. Therefore, Vectibix will address an unmet medical need.
- (d) In  view  of  the  favourable  benefit-risk  profile  in  the  restricted  indication,  and  the  fact  that  the additional data required only concern the interaction between panitumumab and KRAS mutation,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  immediate availability on the market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision that the risk/benefit balance  of Vectibix as  monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens was favourable and therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  conditional  marketing  authorisation,  subject  to  the following specific obligations: to provide results of ongoing studies 20050181 and 20050203.
