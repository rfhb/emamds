## Introduction

This concerns the CHMP's AR on the MAH's response to the RSI of P46 052 as adopted in February 2015. The assessment of the RSI can be found in section 4 of the current report.

On 28 November 2014, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Optaflu, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. It concerns the CSR for study V58\\_31. A CSR of for the study V58P12 was also submitted, but this is only to include the CSR in eCTD. The actual study has already been assessed as part of FUM 034, CHMP's AR dated 11 th  November 2010. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 1. Scientific discussion 1.1. Information on the development program The MAH stated that V58\\_31: A Phase III, Observer-blind, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study to  Evaluate  the  Safety  of  a  Trivalent  Subunit  Influenza  Vaccine  Produced  either  in  Mammalian  Cell Culture or in Embryonated Chicken Eggs (Fluvirin®), in Healthy Children and Adolescents 4 to 17 Years of Age is a stand alone study. 1.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Not applicable. 1.3. Clinical aspects 1.3.1. Introduction Annual influenza epidemics are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly and in those with underlying diseases. Although in healthy adults clinical influenza infections generally have an uncomplicated course, it may have a substantial economic impact, e.g. due to days lost from work. The main objective of influenza vaccination in elderly is reducing the number of deaths caused by influenza infections. In younger populations, influenza associated morbidity is more important than mortality risk, especially in those at good health. Trivalent influenza vaccines contain an A/H3N2, an A/H1N1 and a B strain component. The selection of the A and B influenza virus strains for the vaccines is based on the annual WHO and Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) strain recommendations. These viruses are the predominant strains most appropriate to the epidemiological situation in each hemisphere. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since their development, inactivated influenza vaccines have been produced in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hen eggs. However, the efficiency of the method is low, requiring one or more eggs for each dose of the vaccine produced. The use of mammalian cell lines eliminates the reliance on the supply of embryonated eggs and generates more flexibility, adequate availability of substrate for virus growth and the possibility of higher virus yields. In addition, the cell culture-derived vaccines do not require extensive advance planning and can, in principle, be vital in responding to the threat of an emerging pandemic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH has developed a cell-derived, trivalent, surface antigen, inactivated influenza vaccine (Optaflu, referred to as TIVc throughout this document) produced in the mammalian cell line Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK). Optaflu is currently registered in the European Union (EU) for prophylaxis of influenza for adults, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications and should be used in accordance to official guidance.

The definitions were as follows:

The present study was performed as a post-approval commitment to the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but is not part of the approved EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for Optaflu (EMEA-000124-PIP01-07-M02; currently on hold upon request of the MAH, until testing in the pediatric population be conducted with the MAH's Quadrivalent cell culture influenza vaccine that is under development). 1.3.2. Clinical study Study V58\\_31: A Phase III, Observer-blind, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety  of  a  Trivalent  Subunit  Influenza  Vaccine  Produced  either  in  Mammalian  Cell  Culture  or  in Embryonated Chicken Eggs (Fluvirin®), in Healthy Children and Adolescents 4 to 17 Years of Age. Conducted in 34 centers in 5 countries: 18 sites in the US, 6 sites in Australia, 2 sites in New Zealand, 5 sites in the Philippines and 3 sites in Thailand. Study period: 22 May 2013 till 13 June 2014. Description Methods Objective(s) To  evaluate  safety  and  tolerability  of  one  or  two  doses  (administered  4  weeks  apart)  of  the  TIVc (Optaflu) and TIVf (Fluvirin) in children and adolescents ≥4 to ≤17 years of age. Study design This was a phase 3, observer-blind, randomized, multicenter, controlled study to evaluate safety and tolerability of TIVc or TIVf vaccine in healthy subjects ≥4 to ≤17 years of age. The study vaccines used included the WHO recommended influenza strains intended for use in the prevention of influenza in the 2013 Southern Hemisphere and the 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere . Study population /Sample size Study population: Individuals were healthy male and female children and adolescents ≥ 4 to ≤ 17 years of age. The study enrolled children who were designated as 'previously vaccinated' or 'not previously vaccinated' based on their previous influenza vaccination history. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Previously vaccinated:

- Any child ≥9 years of age
- Any child &lt;9 years of age who has (since 2010) received 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Not previously vaccinated:

- Any child &lt;9 years of age in any country who does not meet the conditions for previously vaccinated (including fewer than 2 doses given since 2010, or receipt of exclusively nonseasonal (pandemic) influenza vaccines).

|----------|

Sample size: The present study was designed to extend the safety database of the cell-derived vaccine in the pediatric population ≥ 4 to ≤ 17 years of age, as requested by the US CBER, in order to reach a safety database of at least 3000 subjects vaccinated. Having 3000 children in the total safety database will allow the evaluation of AEs that occur at a rate of 1 in 1000 children with a probability of 95%. Table 2-2 provides the planned and actual number of subjects enrolled in the study per age category per vaccine. CHMP's comment: The number of subjects enrolled in the present study was in agreement with enough to reach the MAH's goal to extend the safety database of the TIVc in subjects ≥ 4 to ≤ 17 years of age to reach a safety database of at least 3000 subjects vaccinated. Treatments Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive either TIVc or TIVf and stratified according to age (4 to &lt; 9 and 9 to &lt; 18 years of age) and previous influenza vaccination status. Previously vaccinated children received one dose of vaccine, not previously vaccinated children received two doses, given 4 weeks apart. One dose consisted of 0.5 mL of the commercially available TIVc and TIVf, containing 15 μg hemagglutinin (HA) from each of the three viral strains in compliance with the annual World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. For 'not previously vaccinated' subjects ≥4 to ≤8 years of age the total participation was planned for up to approximately 7 months. The observation periods were as follows: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Treatment period: day 1 through day 49, including 2 clinic visits and 4 reminder calls.
- Follow-up period: day 50 through day 213, including 2 clinic visits and 4 safety calls.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For 'previously vaccinated' subjects ≥4 to ≤8 years of age and for all subjects ≥9 to ≤17 years of age, regardless of their previous vaccination status, the total participation was up to approximately 6 months. The observation periods were as follows:

- Treatment period: day 1 through day 28, including 1 clinic visit and 2 reminder calls.
- Follow-up period: day 29 through day 183, including 2 clinic visits and 4 safety calls.

AEs were summarized by MedDRA by System Organ Class and Preferred Terms. Outcomes/endpoints · Percentages of subjects reporting solicited AEs. · Percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs summarized according to toxicity grading scale. · Percentages of subjects reporting other indicators of reactogenicity (body temperature and use of analgesics/antipyretic medication for prophylaxis or treatment). · Percentages of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs. · Percentages of subjects reporting SAEs, New Onset Chronic Diseases (NOCD), AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal and medically attended AEs collected for the whole study. CHMP's comment: Body temperature is listed as systemic solicited AE, but, together with use of analgesics/antipyretic medication for prophylaxis or treatment, has been mentioned by the MAH as separate safety measurement assessed. Statistical Methods No statistical (null) hypothesis was associated with the safety objective, as evaluation of the safety endpoints was of descriptive nature without prespecified criteria. The study was not powered to assess differences in terms of safety and tolerability between the two vaccine groups. Results Recruitment/ Number analysed A total of 2055 subjects were enrolled in this study. Three subjects were enrolled in the study but did not receive study vaccination, they were excluded from the safety sets. A total of 1359 subjects from the TIVc and 673 subjects from the TIVf group completed the study. Thirteen subjects (&lt;1%) from the TIVc and 10 subjects (1%) from the TIVf group were prematurely withdrawn from the study. The most common reason of premature withdrawal from the study in both TIVc and TIVf groups was lost to follow-up. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Baseline data

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were well balanced among the TIVc and the TIVf groups. Mean age of subjects was ~9 years; weight ~33 to 34 kg and height ~134 cm among the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups. The majority of the enrolled subjects were Asians (65% in both groups) and a lower proportion were whites (31%). More females (51%) were enrolled in both vaccine groups.

## Safety results

CHMP's comment: Overall the baseline characteristics of the two vaccine groups were similar. For both age groups ( ≥4 to ≤8 years and ≥9 to ≤17 years) the gender distribution was slightly different between the two vaccine groups. However, as the patients were randomized, this is likely to be a coincidence. Slightly more subjects with child bearing potential were included in the TIVf group. Efficacy results Not applicable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Of a total of 2055 subjects, 2052 subjects received study vaccination and were included in the safety sets. Two subjects were lost to follow up; no unsolicited AE data were available for these subjects; they were excluded from unsolicited safety sets.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Percentages of subjects reporting solicited AEs

Overall, the percentages of subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups who reported solicited local AEs were 58% and 53% respectively, and who reported solicited systemic AEs were 39% and 35% respectively (Table 12.2.1-1). The percentages of subjects reporting solicited local and systemic AEs were higher in the TIVc group when compared with the TIVf group.

- Percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs summarized according to toxicity grading scale.

CHMP's comment: More solicited AEs were reported in TIVc vaccinated subjects (67% of TIVc vaccinated individuals reported any solicited AE vs 63% of TIVf vaccinated subjects, Table 12.2.1-1). However, the study was not powered to assess differences between the two vaccine groups so a formal comparison can not be made. The number of subjects in the different age categories for each of the vaccine groups, provided in Table 12.2.1-1 do not add up to the same totals (e.g. TIVc: 688+681≠1370; TIVf: 338+340≠679). The MAH is requested to explain the discrepancy. Subgroup analysis for age showed that the percentages of subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups who reported solicited local AEs were higher in ≥4 to ≤8 years age group (61% and 60% respectively) when compared to subjects ≥9 to ≤17 years of age (54% and 47% respectively). The percentages of subjects in the TIVc group who reported solicited systemic AEs were lower in ≥ 4 to ≤ 8 years (37%) when compared to ≥ 9 to ≤ 17 years age groups (39%), and in the TIVf group similar percentages of subjects reported solicited systemic AE in ≥ 4 to ≤ 8 years and ≥ 9 to ≤ 17 years age group (33% for both). Solicited AEs were more commonly reported by female subjects compared to males, White subjects vs those of other races and subjects from US, Australia and New Zealand compared to Asian countries. Percentages of subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups, reporting any solicited AEs were lower for previously vaccinated (65% and 58%) when compared with not previously vaccinated subjects (74% for both after any vaccination). The lower reporting of solicited AEs in the 'previously vaccinated' group here could at least partially be explained by the fact that this sub-group also included the older age ≥9 to ≤17 years of age subjects who reported lower reporting of solicited events. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the TIVc and TIVf groups, the most commonly reported solicited local AE was injection-site pain (54% and 49% respectively) followed by erythema (16% and 14% respectively), induration (11% for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both groups) swelling (9% for both groups) and ecchymosis (7% and 6% respectively). The percentages of subjects reporting injection-site pain and erythema were higher in the TIVc group when compared with the TIVf group. Similar percentages of subjects reported other solicited local AEs (induration, swelling, and ecchymosis) in the TIVc and TIVf groups (Table 12.2.3-1).

Most of the solicited local AEs in the TIVc and TIVf groups had their onset within 2 days after vaccination. Most of the solicited local AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Severe injection-site pain was reported by 9/1369 (1%) subjects in the TIVc group and 1/676 (&lt;1%) in the TIVf group, severe erythema was reported by similar percentages of subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups 1/1369 and 1/676 (&lt;1% for both). There were no reports of severe ecchymosis, induration and swelling in both TIVc and TIVf groups.

In the TIVc and TIVf groups, the most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs were headache (17% and 15% respectively), myalgia (17% and 13% respectively), fatigue (15% and 13% respectively) and malaise (15% and 13% respectively) (Table 12.2.3-2). Other solicited systemic AEs (chills, nausea, arthralgia, loss of appetite and sweating) were reported by no more than 9% of subjects across the TIVc and TIVf groups. Except fever, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited systemic AEs were higher in the TIVc group when compared with the TIVf group.

CHMP's comment: Most of the solicited local AEs were of mild to moderate in severity. Injection-site pain was the commonest solicited local AE with few (1% or less) being in the severe category. While the mild injection-site pain was reported more commonly in ≥ 9 to ≤ 18 year old children on TIVc when compared with the TIVf group, these two vaccine groups can not formally be compared as the study was not powered to do so. Moreover, these differences may not be clinically relevant. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Most of the solicited systemic AEs were of mild to moderate severity, severe solicited systemic AEs (chills, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, loss of appetite and malaise) were reported by similar percentages of subjects (≥1%) in both TIVc and TIVf groups.

Higher percentage of subjects reported to have continuing AEs beyond day 7 in TIVc group compared to TIVf group. Between 1% and 18% subjects who experienced the following solicited systemic AEs in the TIVc group: nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fatigue, chills, sweating, loss of appetite and malaise reported these events as ongoing 7 days after first or second vaccination. However in the TIVf group 1% to 3% subjects who experienced fatigue, sweating and malaise were described to have these events ongoing at 7 days after first vaccination. No subject in the TIVf group reported continuing solicited systemic AEs beyond day 7 after second vaccination. CHMP's comment: The most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs were headache, myalgia, fatigue and malaise. Except for fever, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited systemic AEs were higher in the TIVc group when compared with the TIVf group. Severe solicited systemic AEs (chills, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, loss of appetite and malaise) were reported by similar percentages of subjects (≥1%) in both TIVc and TIVf groups. Solicited local and systemic AEs lasting longer than 7 days were more commonly reported in the TIVc group as compared to the TIVf group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Percentages of subjects reporting other indicators of reactogenicity.

In the TIVc and TIVf groups, the majority of subjects had body temperature within the normal range, body temperature≥38°C was reported by 4% and 5% subjects respectively. Three subjects from the TIVc group reported body temperature &gt;40°C. Similar percentages of subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups were administered analgesic and/or antipyretic medications prior to vaccination (6% for both) and after vaccination (10% and 9% respectively).

| longer   |
|----------|

CHMP's comment: The majority of subjects in both TIVc and TIVf group had a normal body temperature, but all subjects reporting body temperature &gt;40°C (n=3) were in the TIVc group. No differences in the percentage of subjects using analgesic and/or antipyretic medications were observed. · Percentages of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs Percentages of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs were similar in the TIVc and TIVf groups (32% and 33% respectively, Table 12.2.1-2). The percentages of AEs judged by the investigator as possibly related to the study vaccine were similar in the TIVc and TIVf (6% and 7% respectively), and not very different in ≥4 to ≤8 years age group (7% and 8% respectively) when compared with subjects ≥9 to ≤17 years of age (5% and 6% respectively). In subjects ≥9 to ≤17 years of age, the percentages of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs in the TIVc group were lower when compared with the TIVf group (23% and 26% respectively). No differences were observed in the percentages of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs in the TIVc and TIVf group in the younger age group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP's comment:

The percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs was higher in the younger age group compared with the older age group, most notably for Upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, cough, and pyrexia. Again, the study was not powered to assess differences in safety between the two vaccine groups, so the observed (small) differences should be interpreted with caution.

· Percentages of subjects reporting SAEs, NOCD, AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal and medically attended AEs collected for the whole study There were 40 subjects (24 (2%) subjects from TIVc group and 16 (2%) subjects from TIVf group) who together reported 46 SAEs throughout the study period (Table 12.3.1.2-1). In subjects ≥9 to ≤17 years of age a total of 16 subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups (1% and 3% respectively) experienced SAEs during the entire course of the study. No differences were observed between TIVc and TIVf in the younger individuals (both 2%). None of the reported SAEs was judged by the investigator as related to the study vaccines. Most of the SAEs experienced throughout the study period were consistent with common intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur in childhood. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were no deaths reported during the entire course of the study. Similar percentages of subjects in the TIVc and TIVf groups experienced an AE classified as NOCD during the entire course of study (1% for both groups). No subjects withdrew from the study due to an AE.

A total of 700 (34%) subjects reported medically attended AEs. The percentages of subjects reporting medically attended AEs were lower in TIVc when compared with TIVf group (33% and 36% respectively). Medically attended AEs and NOCDs were reported by higher percentages of subjects in the ≥4 to ≤8 years age group in both TIVc and TIVf groups when compared to ≥9 to ≤17 years of age. Most of the medically attended AEs were mild to moderate severity.

A total of 3 pregnancies were confirmed during the course of the study, 1 is ongoing, 1 resulted in a spontaneous abortion, and 1 resulted in still birth. Neither of the two adverse outcomes was judged to be related to study vaccine in the opinion of the investigator. Overall safety CHMP's comment: Percentages of subjects reporting any solicited AEs were lower for previously vaccinated subjects when compared with not previously vaccinated subjects, which could at least partially be explained by the fact that the previously vaccinated sub-group also included the older age (≥9 to ≤17 years); subjects who reported lower reporting of solicited events The safety results are in line with the currently known safety profile and no new safety signals were identified. It is agreed that the SAEs were considered not possibly or probably related to the study vaccines. It should be noted that the study was not powered to assess differences in terms of safety and tolerability between the two vaccine groups. 1.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects The study described the safety and tolerability of one or two doses (administered 4 weeks apart) of the TIVc (Optaflu) and TIVf (Fluvirin) in children and adolescents ≥4 to ≤17 years of age. Immunogenicity was not assessed in this study. With regard to Table 12.2.1-1: Number (%) of Subjects with Solicited Adverse Events from 6 Hours Through Day 7 After Any Vaccination- Solicited Safety Set , there was a discrepancy in the number of subjects included in the solicited safety set, as the number of subjects in the different age categories for each of the vaccine groups do not add up to the same totals. The MAH is requested to explain the discrepancy. Overall the TIVc and TIVf vaccines were well-tolerated. Most solicited and unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and transient in nature, most resolved within 7 days after vaccination. None of the subjects were withdrawn from the study because of AEs and none of the reported SAEs were considered related to the study vaccines. Injection-site pain was the commonest solicited local AE with few (1% or less) being in the severe category. While the mild injection-site pain was reported more commonly in ≥ 9 to ≤ 18 year old children on TIVc when compared with the TIVf group, these two vaccine groups can not formally be compared as the study was not powered to do so. Moreover, these differences may not be medically significant. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The solicited systemic AE reporting was higher in the TIVc group when compared with the TIVf group though most of these events were mild to moderate in intensity. While the numbers were small, solicited local and systemic AEs lasting longer than 7 days was more commonly reported in the TIVc group as compared to the TIVf group. However, as no subject withdrew from the study due to these

events and use of analgesics/antipyretics to treat pain was low and similar between both vaccine groups, the tolerability profile seems similar and acceptable for the two vaccines.

Percentages of subjects reporting any solicited AEs were lower for previously vaccinated when compared with not previously vaccinated subjects, which could at least partially be explained by the fact that the previously vaccinated sub-group also included the older age ≥9 to ≤17 years of age subjects who reported lower reporting of solicited events.

In conclusion, TIVc was well tolerated in children ≥ 4 to ≤ 17 years of age. 2. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation Overall conclusion The safety results from study V58\\_31 in children ≥4 to ≤17 years of age are in line with the known safety profile of TIVc. The most commonly reported AE was injection site pain. None of the SAEs reported in this study was judged by the investigator as possibly or probably related to the study vaccine. No new safety signals were identified. The results from study V58\\_31 do not impact the positive benefit-risk profile of TIVc. With regard to the current SmPC, it is noted that the SmPC now states that no data in the paediatric population is available. The MAH is requested to provide a proposal for a sentence under the relevant section in 5.1, stating the availability and relevance of the limited data obtained in the paediatric population so far. Recommendation Not fulfilled: The MAH is requested to explain the discrepancy in the number of subjects included in Table 12.2.1-1: Number (%) of Subjects with Solicited Adverse Events from 6 Hours Through Day 7 After Any Vaccination- Solicited Safety Set. Additional clarifications requested 1. The number of subjects in the different age categories for each of the vaccine groups, provided in Table 12.2.1-1, do not add up to the same totals (e.g. TIVc: 688+681≠1370; TIVf: 338+340≠679). The MAH is requested to explain the discrepancy. 2. With regard to the current SmPC, it is noted that the SmPC now states that no data in the paediatric population is available.

## 3. Assessment of the responses to the request for supplementary information

1. The number of subjects in the different age categories for each of the vaccine groups, provided in Table 12.2.1-1, do not add up to the same totals (e.g. TIVc: 688+681≠1370; TIVf: 338+340≠679). The MAH is requested to explain the discrepancy.

MAH response: In CSR Table 12.2.1-1 \"Number (%) of Subjects with Solicited Adverse Events from 6 Hours Through Day 7 after Any Vaccination - Solicited Safety Set\" the frequencies of solicited AEs (\"Any\" defined as &gt;= 1 mm) are presented per age cohort ( ≥ 4 to ≤ 8 years of age and ≥ 9 to ≤ 17 years of age) and total ( ≥ 4 to ≤ 17 years of age) for TIVc and TIVf groups. The overall solicited safety set ( ≥ 4 to ≤ 17 years of age) comprises of N=1370 TIVc subjects and N=679 TIVf subjects. The distribution in each age cohort is; N=688 TIVc subjects and N=338 TIVf subjects in the 4 to 8 years of age and N=682 TIVc subjects and N=341 subjects in the 9 to 17 years of age. CSR Intext Table 12.2.1-1 is based on source SAS tables 14.3.1.1.2 for the \"total frequencies' and 14.3.1.1.2.1 for the 'frequencies in each age cohort'. The number of subjects in the two age cohorts for each of the vaccine groups do not add up to the total presented in the CSR intext table (e.g. TIVc: 688+681 ≠ 1370; TIVf: 338+340 ≠ 679) due to a minor discrepancy noted in source table 14.3.1.1.2.1. In cohort 9-17 years of age there were two subjects with missing local reactions from 6 hours onwards - subject 2533102 in TIVc and subject 2533114 in TIVf, who were not displayed and not counted for the group sums (N) in Table 14.3.1.1.2.1 as in other tables. Due to an error in the programming for the specific table(s) mentioned the affected subjects were erroneously treated as missing completely at random and therefore excluded. Besides not summing up to group totals, this error has no impact on the overall safety results: The percentages will not change when calculated by dividing with 681+1 resp. 340+1. Therefore a reanalysis of the respective summaries was not performed. CHMP's Assessment: The explanation provided by the MAH is accepted. It is agreed that the percentages will not change upon recalculation, it is therefore accepted that no reanalysis has been performed. Issue resolved. 2. With regard to the current SmPC, it is noted that the SmPC now states that no data in the paediatric population is available. The MAH is requested to provide a proposal for a sentence under the relevant section in 5.1, stating the availability and relevance of the limited data obtained in the paediatric population so far. MAH response: Medicinal product no longer authorised

The second request for additional clarification will be addressed with the submission of a type II variation (classification C.I.3.b). As agreed with EMA this variation will include both the data from studies V58P12/V58\\_31 (submitted with procedure P46/052) and from study V58P15 (submitted with procedure P46/053), and will be submitted within 60 days following the receipt of the outcome of procedure P46/053.

## CHMP's Assessment:

The MAH's proposal to update section 5.1 via a type II variation is endorsed. Issue resolved.
