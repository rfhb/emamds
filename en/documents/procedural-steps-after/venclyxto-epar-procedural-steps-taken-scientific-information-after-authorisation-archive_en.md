| II/0048 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update safety and efficacy information on paediatric population following the assessment of procedure P46/018 based on final results from study M13-833 - A Phase 1 Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Venetoclax in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Malignancies. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.3.z - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 45/46 - Other variation          | 05/09/2024 | SmPC and PL | The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax were evaluated in a two-part, multi centre, open-label, phase 1 study (M13-833) of venetoclax as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in 140 paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory malignancies. Within this mixed patient population, the Objective Response Rate (ORR) reported in the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) cohort was 16% with an estimated median DOR of 2.6 months (95% CI: 0.5, 7.9). The ORR was 42% in the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) cohort, with an estimated median DOR of 10.2 months (95% CI: 2.8, 14.2). The ORR was 31% and the CR rate was 22% in the neuroblastoma cohort, with an estimated median DOR of 9.3 months (95% CI: 3.9, NE). |

| II/0031   | to update venetoclax SmPC wording regarding Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis and management following an update to the Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS), as well as amendment of the annex II.D to propose additional risk minimisation measures in the form of Patient Card implementation and Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) distribution as result of a medical safety assessment conducted on TLS post-marketing reports. The Package leaflet and RMP (version 8) have also been updated, accordingly. The proposed changes to the SmPC include section 4.2 and 4.4: • Section 4.2: A more prescriptive table which replaces the text around the risk assessment, prophylaxis and monitoring measures based on the level of tumor burden. In addition, the text on the recommended dose modifications for toxicities is replaced by a table format for clarity. • Section 4.4: the text is revised to emphasize the fact that TLS occur in all patients and requires adequate risk assessment that considers comorbidities, particularly renal impairment, and other risk factors such as splenomegaly. The Annex A has also been updated at EMA request. | 20/05/2021   | 21/06/2021 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | This procedure concerns an application to update of product information for venetoclax related to TLS (tumor lysis syndrome) prophylaxis and management following a medical safety assessment conducted by MAH on post- marketing reports of TLS. The EMA scientific committees CHMP and PRAC included a request for additional minimisation measures and educational material for which a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) with the purpose of informing EU prescribers of the product changes which encompass the totality of CLL patients treated with Venclyxto as well as to emphasize that adherence to TLS mitigation measures as per SmPC is essential in these patients. A patient card has also been included since the Package leaflet as the routine risk minimisation measure is not considered a sufficient tool for such serious risk and the available evidence of its background. The proposed key elements are the following: contact details on the prescriber and the patient, signs and symptoms of TLS, the need to seek immediate medical attention in case of their occurrence, a warning message for healthcare professionals treating the patient at any time that this treatment is associated with the risk of TLS and the need to carry the card at any time. The SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4, Annex II, and PL has been updated accordingly. |

| II/0020             | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to modify posology recommendations in patients with severe hepatic impairment and to reflect the final results of study M15-342 (A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Dose of Venetoclax in Female Subjects with Mild, Moderate, or Severe Hepatic Impairment) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 3.4 has also been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 29/05/2019 | 28/06/2019 | SmPC and PL | In a dedicated hepatic impairment study, venetoclax Cmax and AUC in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A; n=6) or moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=6) hepatic impairment were similar to subjects with normal hepatic function, after receiving a 50 mg single dose of venetoclax. In subjects with severe (Child-Pugh C; n=5) hepatic impairment, the mean venetoclax Cmax was similar to subjects with normal hepatic function but venetoclax AUCinf was on average 2.7- fold higher (range: no change to 5-fold higher) than venetoclax AUCinf in the subjects with normal hepatic function. In conclusion, a dose reduction of at least 50% throughout treatment is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. These patients should be monitored more closely for signs of toxicity. |

The aim of the study was to better characterise the Safety in long- term exposure (> 12 months) of venetoclax and second primary malignancy and Richter's transformation in longer exposure to venetoclax monotherapy. Study M13-982 is now fully enrolled and exposure time is longer compared to previously submitted data; the efficacy endpoints do not differ from previously reported data; the safety profile is consistent with previous data. Approximately 14% of patients experienced Richter's transformation and 15% reported a second primary malignancy. No clear pattern has been detected regarding the different types of second primary malignancies reported. A causal association between venetoclax |

However, no dose adjustment is considered necessary during short-term use of azithromycin when administered concomitantly with venetoclax. In addition, the information is included on interaction between venetoclax with digoxin, a P-gp substrate, which resulted in an increase in digoxin Cmax and a AUC. The SmPC already includes warning that co administration of narrow therapeutic index P gp, or BCRP substrates with venetoclax should be avoided.   |
