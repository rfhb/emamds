## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures,  which have been finalised  before  21  March  2002.  For  scientific  information  on  procedures  after  this  date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Myocet  is  a  liposome  formulation  of  a  clinically  well-established  drug,  doxorubicin  hydrochloride (HCl),  and  an  anthracycline  cytotoxic  agent.  Myocet,  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  is indicated for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women. The product is presented as a three-vial system; Myocet doxorubicin HCl, Myocet liposomes and Myocet buffer. At constitution, the  doxorubicin  HCl  is  dissolved  in  20  ml  0.9%  sodium  chloride  for  injection  and  heated  before  a mixture of the liposomes and the buffer is added to form a liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin-citrate complex. The resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet contains 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl/25 ml of concentrate for liposomal dispersion for infusion (2 mg/ml). The recommended initial dose is 60-75 mg/m 2 every  3  weeks  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide  (600  mg/m 2 ).  Myocet  should  be constituted  and  diluted  prior  to  administration  and  should  be  administered  by  intravenous  (i.v.) infusion over a period of one hour.

## Anthracyclines

Anthracyclines  still  belong  to  the  most  commonly  used  cytotoxic  agents  against  haematological  as well as solid tumours. Since their introduction in cancer treatment in the late 1960's, anthracyclines have been associated with cardiotoxicity.

Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy appears to result from free radical damage to the myocardium. Free  radicals,  in  turn,  cause  damage  to  multiple  intracellular  sites  including  the  cell  membrane, mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and DNA. In the presence of iron, a Fe 3+ -doxorubicin chelate complex forms. This complex accelerates the reaction leading to increased production of free radicals with increased myocardial damage.

In  solid  tumours,  doxorubicin  has  been  the  dominating  anthracycline  but  has  increasingly  been substituted  in  Europe  by  the  analogue  epirubicin.  Doxorubicin  may  exert  its  antitumour  and  toxic effects by a number of mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II, intercalation with DNA and RNA polymerases, free radical formation and membrane binding.

Several  analogues  of  doxorubicin  and  other  anthracyclines  have  been  studied  aiming  at  lessened cardiac  toxicity.  Epirubicin  (4'-epidoxorubicin)  demonstrates  a  small  but  statistically  significant decrease  in  cardiac  toxicity,  compared  with  doxorubicin  given  by  rapid  infusion.  Preliminary  data concerning pirarubicin suggest this analogue of doxorubicin may have significant less cardiotoxicity than  doxorubicin  given  standard  infusion  schedules.  Idarubicin  (demethoxy  daunorubicin),  when given in amounts of equivalent myelotoxicity to daunorubicin, has cardiotoxicity similar to this drug. Anyway, cardiotoxicity from these agents is cumulative and crossing over from one agent to another does not offer protection.

Encapsulation  of  doxorubicin  within  liposomes  has  been  another  way  of  trying  to  reduce  cardiac toxicity.  Preclinical  studies  have  shown  that  liposomes  reduce  the  peak  distribution  of  doxorubicin, apparently linked to cardiac toxicity, while favouring the distribution of encapsulated drug to reticuloendothelial organs and to areas of inflammation or of fenestrated endothelium as in tumour tissue.

## Metastatic breast cancer (MBC)

In  breast  cancer,  anthracycline  based  combination  chemotherapy  has  been  found  superior  to previously used regimens without anthracyclines, both in the adjuvant and in the metastatic setting. Although the use of newly introduced taxanes is increasing, anthracycline-based combinations could still  be  considered  standard  of  care  in  chemotherapy  of  breast  cancer  (BC).  Doxorubicin  is  usually used  in  combination  with  one  or  two  cytotoxic  drugs  of  other  classes  to  improve  the  benefit/risk balance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The risk of irreversible cardiomyopathy is the most important treatment-limiting factor in the longterm.  The  clinical  presentation  of  anthracycline-induced  cardiomyopathy  is  congestive  heart  failure (CHF). At a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 500 mg/m 2 the  risk  for  CHF is  approximately 5% and thereafter it increases exponentially. It may lead to CHF in 1-10% of the patients at a cumulative dose of &gt;550 mg/m 2 . Although acute myopericarditis may occur following doxorubicin administration, the later occurring cardiomyopathy  is  of greater concern. The  late presentation of anthracycline cardiomyopathy has been described to occur up to several years after completion of the treatment. It is observed  in  patients  who  had  recovered  from  subacute  cardiac  symptoms  or  in  patients  with  no previous symptoms.

There  is  considerable  individual  difference  in  sensitivity  to  doxorubicin-induced  cardiomyopathy, which sometimes occurs after a very low cumulated dose. Combination of doxorubicin with 5-FU and cyclophosphamide in the CAF regimen seems to increase the risk for CHF many fold.

The  current  standard  strategy  to  decrease  the  risk  for  doxorubicin  induced  CHF  is  to  limit  the cumulative  dose  to  approximately  550  mg/m 2 and/or  to  pursue  therapy  under  regular  cardiac monitoring until a significant decrease in LVEF is observed.

Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for assessment of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Histopathology  correlates  reasonably  well  to  multigated  radionuclide  angiography  (MUGA)  scan based measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) which could be considered a routine standard  for  the  assessment  of  anthracycline  induced  cardiac  effects.  LVEF  measurement  based  on echocardiography is generally considered to be less accurate.

Doxorubicin has so far been administered as i.v. bolus injection or as short 30 min to 1 h i.v. infusion. Prolonged infusion over up to 96 h has been described to decrease the risk for doxorubicin induced CHF,  seemingly  without  compromising  the  antitumour  activity.  However,  despite  the  promising results prolonged infusion of doxorubicin is not in routine use in the treatment of BC.

Among many compounds that have been studied to evaluate possible protection from anthracyclineassociated  cardiomyopathy,  dexrazoxane,  a  bisdiketopiperazine,  is  the  most  interesting.  This  drug demonstrated  significant  cardioprotection  in  a  trial  where  patients  where  randomised  to  receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without dexrazoxane and in subsequent trials. However, experimental data concerning a putative decrease of anti-tumour activity of doxorubicin when given with dexrazoxane are still equivocal.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Myocet is presented as a three-vial system; Myocet doxorubicin HCl, Myocet liposomes and Myocet buffer.  In  addition  a  small  amount  of  0.9%  sodium  chloride  for  injection  is  needed,  which  is  not provided  in  the  package.  The  constituted  product  is  a  liposome-encapsulated  doxorubicin-citrate complex.

The formulation contains doxorubicin HCl, lactose and methyl parahydroxybenzoate (methylparaben). The constituted liposomes are stable pluri-lamellar liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and cholesterol and with an aqueous core. It is important to follow the avian encephalitis (AE) situation  in  countries  used  for  EPC  production  and  report  changes  to  the  CPMP  and  national authorities. A protocol on how this is accomplished should be submitted.

Doxorubicin HCl is provided in 50 ml type I (Ph. Eur.) glass vials sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium flip-off seals. The liposomes are filled in 2 ml type I flint glass tubing vial with grey stoppers siliconised with dimethicone and a flip-off seal. The buffer is filled in 5 ml type I moulded glass  vials  with  grey  stoppers  siliconised  with  dimeticone  and  a  flip-off  seal.  After  constitution  the finished product is in the vial, which originally contained the doxorubicin HCl powder.

## Active substance

Doxorubicin HCl is an antineoplastic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. It  is  described  in  Ph.  Eur.  During  the  manufacture,  Daunorubicin  HCl  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

converted into 14-bromodaunorubicin and the next step yields doxorubicin HCl. The following main related substances are identified in an HPLC method: doxorubicinone, 11-deoxydoxorubicin HCl, 13dihydrodaunorubicin  HCl,  13-dihydrocarminomycin  HCl,  daunorubicin  HCl.  Typically,  batches contain between 0.14% and 0.30% total related substances.

The active ingredient manufacturer controls doxorubicin HCl according Ph. Eur. with the TLC method for  related  substances  replaced  by  the  HPLC-method  used  for  assay.  This  is  acceptable.  Individual impurities are controlled in the active substance specifications of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. However, as individual impurities are not included in their release specifications for the lyophilised doxorubicin, there  is  no  need  for  the  applicant  to  include  individual  impurities  in  their  release  specifications. Doxorubicin HCl complies with the main pharmacopoeias including Ph. Eur. and USP. Results of 4 batches have been presented. All batches meet the specifications.

Stability data of three batches in amber glass bottles with a polypropylene closure and a polyethylene inner stopper over 6 months at 25 °C/60% RH and 6 months at 40 °C/70% RH are presented. The results support a retest period of one year.

## Other ingredients

Myocet  liposomes:  Citric  acid,  nitrogen,  sodium  hydroxide  and  water  for  injections  are  controlled according to Ph. Eur. Cholesterol is controlled according to Ph. Eur. and NF with an additional test for purity of not less than 95.0% by HPLC. EPC is obtained by purifying egg yolk through extractions and chromatography. In view of a potential for contamination of the phosphatidylcholine with aflatoxins, suitable upper limits for aflatoxins need to be included in the specification. Therefore, the applicant agreed  to  submit  a  variation  addressing  aflatoxin  control  during  the  manufacturing  process  The remaining lipids other than phosphatidylcholine are sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine.

Myocet buffer: Sodium carbonate and water for injections are controlled according to Ph. Eur.

## Product development and finished product

## Product development

The objective of the development program was to obtain an effective but less cardiotoxic parenteral dosage form of doxorubicin using liposome technology.

The  constituted  liposomes  are  stable  pluri-lamellar  liposomes,  with  an  aqueous  core,  comprised  of EPC and cholesterol. The drug is entrapped into the liposomes during the constitution of the ready to use liposomal formulation. During constitution, doxorubicin is driven across the liposome membrane by  a  pH  gradient.  A  pH  of  4-5  is  maintained  inside  the  liposomes  by  citric  acid  and  outside  the liposomes a pH of 7-8 is obtained by adding sodium carbonate buffer. Dissolved doxorubicin HCl is added and the membrane-permeable neutral form (in excess at pH 7.5) crosses the liposome bilayer into  the  aqueous  core  where  it  is  protonated  and,  as  such,  forms  a  complex  with  citric  acid.  The complex is in the form of flexible fibres comprised of stacked doxorubicin molecules cross-linked into bundles  by  the  citrate  anions.  The  complexing  with  citrate  aids  the  retention  of  the  doxorubicin molecules within the liposome.

The loading efficiency as well as the biological activity of liposomal doxorubicin was used to establish the  optimal  lipid/drug  ratio,  EPC/cholesterol  ratio,  liposome  size  and  concentration  of  the  citrate buffer.  Larger  liposomes  had  less  acute  toxicity  while  smaller  liposomes  had  a  higher  anti-tumour efficacy. Taken together, the mean survival time in a murine leukemia model increased with smaller liposomes. Based on these studies it was decided to have a mean diameter of 100-230 nm. In the same study the drug to lipid ratio was investigated. It was found that a higher drug to lipid ratio was less toxic than a lower drug to lipid ratio. This is suggested to result from a more stable complex between doxorubicin  and  citrate  at  the  higher  drug  to  lipid  ratio,  resulting  in  a  slower  deaggregation  and subsequent  release  of  doxorubicin  from  the  liposomes.  The  highest  drug  to  lipid  ratio  studied  was 0.28:1. This ratio showed the lowest acute toxicity and was selected for the final composition.

The development studies are thoroughly performed and described, and are considered to support the chosen formulation. The clinical trial formulation was identical to the formulation to be used for the market.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacturing process

Myocet doxorubicin HCl: the applicant purchases Doxorubicin HCl as a finished product. The vials are relabelled. During manufacture the product is sterilised using a 0.22 µm filter.

Myocet liposomes: The citric acid buffer is prepared, the pH adjusted with sodium hydroxide solution, and filtered through a 0.2 µm nominal filter into a reactor.

The  liposomes  are clarified by filtration and subsequently filtered through a 0.22 µm  filter (sterilisation  process)  and  stored  under  nitrogen  pressure  at  2-8°C  before  filling.  The  vials  are sterilised using dry heat and the stoppers are autoclaved. The particle size distribution is measured as an important part of the in-process controls.

Myocet buffer: Sodium carbonate is added to water for injections, the solution is mixed and filtered through a 0.22 µm filter into sterile tank and stored at room temperature prior to filling.

## Validation

The validation results for Myocet liposomes are satisfactory.

Myocet buffer: Twelve stability and clinical batches produced during the last 8 years with different batch  sizes  and  equipment  gave  products  within  specifications.  The  buffer  is  sterilised  by  filtration since autoclaving the high pH solution results in the formation of glass related particles in the solution.

Constitution:  Several  validation  studies  were  conducted  on  the  constitution  procedure  and  all constituted products were found to be acceptable supporting the ruggedness of the procedure. GMP

The product is being manufactured in a facility that holds the necessary Manufacturing Authorisation (see Annex II of the Opinion).

## Specifications

The  finished  product  specifications  for  the  constituted  liposomal  doxorubicin  include  tests  for appearance, pH, particle size, 'entrapment', i.e. the percentage of active substance encapsulated in the liposome interior which is also an indicator of 'free' doxorubicin, and assay.

## Batch analysis

Batch analysis results of 2 batches were presented. Both batches comply with the specifications.

## Stability of the product

The results of stability studies indicate that a shelf life of 18 months for the finished product, when stored at 2-8 °C, is acceptable. Protection from light is not necessary. The constituted drug product was shown to be chemically and physically stable when stored at 2-8°C for 8 days and for 24 hours at room temperature.  From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 ο C - 8 ο C, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Introduction

The pharmacology and toxicology of doxorubicin (Dox) are well established and, thus, the preclinical file for Myocet aimed mainly at comparing liposome-encapsulated Dox with conventional Dox with respect to efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacodynamics

## In vitro and in vivo studies

Antitumour  activity  of  liposomal  and  conventional  Dox in  vivo was  compared  in  murine  tumour models  using  a  range  of  murine  and  human  xenograft  tumour  types. The  drug  formulations  were administered  via  the  i.v.  route.  At  similar  doses,  liposomal  Dox  appeared  to  be  as  effective  as conventional Dox in these models, possibly with the exception of the melanoma model, and was better

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tolerated. Survival was recorded until day 60. Therapeutic response was based on the median day of death and expressed as the percent increased life span compared with untreated controls. The change in viable tumour cell population was also assessed. The results indicate that the liposome formulation permitted delivery of higher Dox doses and the more intensive treatment resulted in apparent cures that  were  not  achieved  with  the  conventional  Dox.  Clear  dose-response  relationships  were  seen  for both formulations, up to the optimal dose (the highest dose without drug-induced deaths). Although direct comparisons at similar doses were not made, no apparent decrease in efficacy of liposomal Dox compared with conventional Dox was observed.

No  antitumour  activity  studies  using  BC  models  were  performed.  However,  there  is  a  long-term clinical experience of Dox in this disease and it would not be expected that liposome-encapsulation of the  drug  affects  possible  disease-specificity  that  is  due  to  mechanism  of  cytotoxic  action.  Thus,  the results from other tumour types, indicating that liposomal Dox is at least as effective as conventional Dox, may most likely be extrapolated also to BC models.

No  preclinical  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  efficacy  of  liposomal  Dox  in  cytotoxic  drug combinations. Liposomal Dox did not increase the drug sensitivity of Dox-resistant cancer cell lines, neither in vitro nor in vivo .

The equal or improved survival of animals receiving Myocet compared with conventional Dox may indicate  that  liposome-encapsulation  of  Dox  does  not  decrease  its  activity  against  metastases. However,  from  these  data  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  long-term  protection  against  micrometastases because of lack of long-term follow-up of survivors (the animals were observed for 60 days). This issue is not considered critical in the palliative setting of MBC. However, further investigations would be  needed  in  order  to  clarify  the  issue  with  respect  to  the  adjuvant  setting  (see  SPC  4.4, Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

## Interaction studies

The  effect  of  liposomal  Dox  or  free  Dox  formulations  on  the  single  dose  toxicity  (lethality)  of cyclophosphamide (CPA), 5-FU or CPA + 5-FU was compared showing similar toxicological profiles when combined with each of the drugs individually or with both.

## General and safety pharmacology programme

The  effects  of  liposomal  Dox  on  CNS,  cardiovascular  and  reproductive  system  have  not  been investigated in pharmacology studies. This is considered acceptable, due to the vast clinical experience with Dox, and since results in the toxicology studies indicate qualitatively similar toxicity of free and liposome-encapsulated Dox. The distribution study in dogs indicates that liposome-encapsulation of Dox  does  not  increase  the  uptake  of  drug  into  CNS.  In  a  temperature  response  study  in  rabbit, liposomal  Dox  induced  temperature  increases  of  1.0  to  2.1  ºC  at  5  to  9  hr  post-dose  while  no temperature increases were seen in animals treated with conventional Dox.

## Pharmacokinetics

In  dogs,  at  the  same  dose  (1.5  mg/kg)  the  liposomal  formulation  resulted  in  higher  plasma concentrations  and  &gt;80  times  higher  exposure  (AUC)  for  total  Dox  (encapsulated+free)  than  did conventional  Dox.  The  liposomal  formulation  gave  somewhat  lower  Cmax  but  higher  systemic exposures of free (unencapsulated) Dox than did conventional Dox. However, there are doubts on the validity of the assay to measure free Dox, due to methodological difficulties.

Administration of liposomal 14 C-doxorubicin to dogs resulted in lower concentrations of Dox-related radioactivity  in  the  myocardium  and  gastrointestinal  tissues,  but  higher  concentrations  in  the  liver, spleen and bone marrow, compared with conventional 14 C-doxorubicin. This is in agreement with the observed reduction in cardiomyopathy and increased bone marrow toxicity for liposomal Dox.

In mice with subcutaneously growing human breast carcinoma cells, the Dox-related fluorescence in tumour tissue seemed to be higher after administration of liposomal Dox than after administration of conventional  Dox.  Taken  together  with  clinical  efficacy  data,  the  results  indicate  that  liposomeencapsulated  Dox  is  distributed  to  and  effective  against  BC  cells  to  at  least  a  similar  extent  as conventional Dox.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The metabolism of Dox from liposomal formulations was not investigated. The main metabolite of Dox is doxorubicinol. Metabolism in man is reported to be similar to rabbit and mouse.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  of  liposomal  Dox,  conventional  Dox  and  empty  liposomes  was  evaluated  in mouse  and  dog.  In  acute  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  dog,  liposomal  Dox  and  conventional  Dox induced  similar  toxicity  profiles,  but  toxicity  was  less  severe  or  occurred  at  higher  doses  for  the liposome-encapsulated  drug.  Female  mice  appeared  less  susceptible  than  males  to  liposomal  Dox. This sex difference was not seen for other species.

Single dose toxicity of conventional Dox or liposomal Dox in combination with 5-FU or CPA in mice was evaluated indicating that also in combination the acute toxicity of liposomal Dox is lower than that of conventional Dox.

The  potential  for  liposomal  Dox  to  induce  thrombi  was  studied  in  rabbits.  There  were  no  signs  of thrombi or emboli in rabbits receiving a high single dose of liposomal Dox.

## Repeat dose toxicity

In chronic toxicity studies, where dogs were administered 1.5 mg/kg Dox once every three weeks for 8-12 cycles, the toxicity profiles were qualitatively similar between the two preparations. Liposomal Dox appeared  better  tolerated,  inducing  less  severe  gastrointestinal  toxicity  and  fewer  unscheduled deaths compared with conventional Dox, although histopathological data indicated more severe bone marrow atrophy in liposomal Dox treated dogs.

The  only  effect  specific  for  liposomal  Dox  but  not  seen  with  conventional  Dox  in  the  toxicology studies  was  an  increase  in  body  temperature  in  dogs,  generally  occurring  around  24  hr  post-dose, whereas no temperature increases were seen in animals treated with conventional Dox. Although it is not possible to draw  definite conclusions, one possible explanation for  the  Myocet-induced temperature increase is that liposome-encapsulation of Dox results in a greater uptake of Dox by the phagocytic  cells  of  the  reticulo-endothelial  system  (RES),  and  thus,  mediators  of  inflammation become responsible for the observed temperature increase.

A blood compatibility test of liposomal Dox and empty liposomes was performed as part of the two acute toxicity studies. The results from the two studies were similar and indicated a low haemolytic potential of the liposome formulations.

## Cardiotoxicity

Apparently,  liposome-encapsulation  of  Dox  did  not  prevent  cardiac  toxicity  but  delayed  it.  In  one study, histopathological evidence of cardiac toxicity was noted in all dogs that received eight doses of conventional Dox at 1.5 mg/kg but in none of the dogs treated with the same dose of liposomal Dox. In  a  second  study,  all  dogs  receiving  8-10  cycles  of  conventional  Dox  had  lesions  consistent  with myocardial toxicity and heart failure, and none of these animals survived more than 10 doses. After 8 doses, cardiac lesions were also seen in liposomal Dox-treated animals, but were graded less severe than in the conventional-Dox group. In the animals receiving 12 doses of liposomal Dox there were signs  of  cardiotoxicity  in  most  animals,  at  a  similar  grade  of  severity  as  in  the  conventional  Doxtreated  animals  after  8  doses.  The  more  severe  toxicity  observed  in  preclinical  studies  after administration of conventional Dox may partly have been due to very high peak concentrations of free drug that would not have been obtained if the treatment had been given as slow infusion. Nevertheless, the  difference  between  the  infusion  time  used  in  preclinical  studies  and  that  recommended  for  the clinical administration is probably not of concern regarding relevance for the myocardial effect.

## Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity

Studies to evaluate genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of liposomal Dox were not performed and are not considered necessary, due to the known mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Dox.

## Reproduction toxicity

Dox per se is known to be teratogenic in animals and humans and to induce abortions (rabbits).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Local tolerance

Local  macroscopic reactions in rabbit after a single perivascular or subcutaneous bolus injection of liposomal  Dox  and  conventional  Dox  were  similar  but  were  graded  slightly  less  severe  in  the liposomal Dox-treated animals. No ulceration was observed in the liposomal Dox-treated animals.

## Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment

Based on the pattern of use and disposal of Myocet coupled to the predicted annual usage and low estimates for concentrations in the environment it has been considered that no immediate risk for the environment is associated to the therapeutic use of Myocet.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

The  antitumour  activity  of  Myocet  has  been  investigated  in  several  murine  tumour  models  and compared  with  that  of  free  Dox.  Myocet  allowed  the  administration  of  higher  (or  at  least  similar) doses of Dox without increased toxicity. Myocet seemed to display a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to the free Dox formulation. Some increased therapeutic benefit expressed by increased life span was shown by the liposomal formulation in most (but not all) studies performed.

The claimed reduction of toxicity on the formulation has been shown in some studies, in relation to cardiotoxicity  (dog)  after  repeated  administration,  but  on  the  other  side  increased  bone  marrow suppression was observed when compared to the free Dox one.

From the preclinical data it is difficult to assess the long-term protection against micrometastases due to the lack of long-term follow-up. This issue is not considered critical in the metastatic setting but further  investigations  would  be  needed  in  order  to  evaluate  this  possible  effect  with  respect  to  less advanced stages of the disease (see SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ).

## 4. Clinical aspects

Myocet,  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide  (CPA),  is  indicated  for  the  first  line treatment  of MBC in women. The clinical database comprises data from 3 pivotal phase III trials (studies 1-3), 4 supportive phase II trials in MBC (studies 4-7) and 11 phase I/II trials (8-18) in solid tumours, non small-cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  acute  nonlymphocytic  leukaemia  (ANLL),  AIDS-related  Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) and brain metastases (Table 1).

## Clinical pharmacology

Six single dose studies were conducted. One was conducted as a pharmacokinetic substudy of a phase III  study  (study  1),  in  which  both  Myocet  and  conventional  Dox were administered in combination with CPA. Three single-arm studies (8, 9 and 13) with Myocet were conducted and two other studies (12  and  18)  compared  Myocet  with  conventional  Dox.  In  studies  12  and  9,  attempt  was  made  to separate free Dox from encapsulated substance. The main metabolite doxorubicinol was measured in studies 1 and 12.

## Pharmacodynamics

Dox is a well-known cytotoxic agent, with a very broad spectrum of clinical anticancer activity and is one  of  the  most  frequently  prescribed  anti-neoplastic  agents.  Against  BC,  Dox  presents  curative potential  when  it  is  included  in  multimodality  regimens,  and  has  an  established  value  in  palliative treatment of patients with advanced tumors.

Cardiomyopathy  is  limiting  with  respect  to  cumulative  dose  and  this  liposomal  formulation  was developed having in view the reduction in the risk of cardiotoxicity.

The choice of using the same dose of Myocet as of conventional Dox in phase III trials is justified by the results of preclinical studies and the phase I and phase II trials (see Dose-response studies ) where comparable efficacy and reduced cardiac and gastrointestinal toxicity were apparent.

## Pharmacokinetics

As long as Dox is associated with its carrier, the pharmacokinetics of the drug is determined by the pharmacokinetics of the liposome. Liposomes of the size of Myocet are generally cleared from blood by uptake by the RES-cells. There is a gradual release of drug from the liposome, dependent on factors such as drug properties, liposome composition, pH  or osmotic gradients and the liposome environment.  Since  released  Dox  displays  the  same  elimination  pathway  as  conventional  Dox,  the pharmacokinetic behaviour of Myocet is a mixture of the behaviour of encapsulated and free Dox.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  variability  in  all  pharmacokinetic  parameters  is  markedly  higher  for  liposomal  drug  compared with  conventional  dosing.  This  may  to  some  extent  be  due  to  the  poor  performance  of  the  assay procedure so that kinetic data should be interpreted with caution.

The clearance of total doxorubicin was 5.1±4.8 l/h and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vd) was 56.6 l, while after conventional doxorubicin, clearance and Vd were 46.7±9.6 l/h and 1,451±258 l, respectively. With Myocet given over 1 hour, the total Dox peak plasma level is very high (~ 9-fold greater  than  that  seen  with  conventional  Dox)  but  since  most  of  the  drug  is  encapsulated,  the  peak level of free drug is likely to be very low, mimicking a continuous infusion. The AUC of total Dox in patients receiving Myocet is also very high (~ 20 fold greater than that in patients receiving the same dose of conventional Dox) but, again, most of the circulating drug is encapsulated. The precise plasma AUC of released Dox in patients receiving Myocet is unknown due to analytical difficulties, however, the exposure to free Dox after administration of Myocet appears similar to the exposure to Dox after administration of the same dose of conventional drug.

When Dox is given as a continuous infusion, the peak plasma levels are much reduced compared with the  usual slow bolus administration while the plasma AUC is the same. Clinical trial data from the literature  support  the  hypothesis  that  chronic  cardiotoxicity  is  related  primarily  to  peak  drug concentration,  whereas  anti-tumour  effect  is  more  dependent  on  the  total  drug  exposure  (AUC). Mucositis and the potential for extravasation injury are however increased with prolonged infusions of conventional  Dox.  A  similarity  between  the  formulations  as  regards  the  general  toxicity  profile (excluding cardiac toxicity) and the antitumour activity suggest the concept that liposomeencapsulation  provides  an  'intravenous  slow-release  formulation'.  However,  based  on  an  observed difference in incidence and severity of mucositis and diarrhoea it is possible to speculate that Myocet does not merely mimic infusional Dox.

For conventional Dox a relationship between AUC and dose-limiting granulocytopenia is observed. Preclinical  studies  in  dogs  have  shown  that  bone  marrow  atrophy  was  somewhat  more  pronounced after treatment with liposome-encapsulated compared with conventional Dox. However, no differences between Myocet and conventional Dox regarding haematological parameters (neutropenia, anaemia,  thrombocytopenia)  were  observed  either  in  the  preclinical  or  clinical  studies.  No  definite conclusion regarding the relationship between AUC and myelotoxicity can be drawn from available data. As dose adjustment for Myocet is not based on AUC levels but on haematological monitoring, the issue is not considered critical.

The  pharmacokinetics  of  one  of  the  metabolites,  doxorubicinol,  is  similar  after  liposomal  and conventional Dox, with the exception of a slower formation rate after liposomal Dox. Doxorubicinol is formed in the liver via aldo-keto-reductase enzymes. It appears in the plasma later with Myocet than with conventional Dox.

No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with respect to age, impaired renal or hepatic function. The available data from patients with impaired liver function is too limited to be a basis for a dose recommendation in these patients. Therefore, the Marketing Authorisation Holder agreed to perform further post-marketing investigations on the pharmacokinetics and safety of Myocet in patients with impaired  liver  function.  Until  these  further  data  become  available,  conservative  dose  reduction recommendations are necessary (see SPC 4.2, Posology and method of administration ).

Clinically  significant  drug  interactions  between  Dox  and  cytochrome  3A4  substrates  have  been described for agents, which also interact with P-glycoprotein (PgP), e.g., cyclosporin and paclitaxel. It appears  as  if  PgP-inhibitors  increase  the  exposure  to  both  Dox  and  its  metabolite.  No  formal interaction studies were performed for Myocet. However, the interaction potential for Myocet might be even higher due to a more pronounced distribution to the liver compared to conventional Dox. A warning considering concomitant treatment with PgP-inhibitors has been included in the SPC. Also, concomitant treatment with other substances reported to be cardiotoxic or with cardiologically active substances  (e.g.  calcium  antagonists)  may  increase  the  risk  for  cardiotoxicity.  Concomitant  therapy with other liposomal or lipid-complexed drugs or i.v. fat emulsions could change the pharmacokinetic profile of Myocet (see SPC 4.5, Interactions with other medicaments and other forms of interactions ).

Myocet should be used in combination with CPA. CPA is metabolised mainly by CYP2B6. No formal interaction  studies  were  conducted  with  CPA  and  Dox.  However,  no  changes  in  Dox  or  CPA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetics were evident when compared with other studies, although the variability was very high.

In  conclusion,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  liposomal  Dox  in  plasma  have  been  characterised  in cancer patients, confirming the expected behaviour of a liposomal formulation. From the pharmacokinetic  documentation  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  any  conclusions  regarding  specific liposomal tumour targeting. Liposomal Dox and conventional Dox essentially show similar efficacy and,  except  for  the  cardiac  toxicity,  also  similar  toxicity  profiles.  This  might  be  explained  by  the exposure to free Dox after liposomal compared to conventional dosing of Dox being of the same range but with different time characteristics.

## Clinical efficacy

Pivotal data on the efficacy and safety of Myocet derive from 3 phase III trials, studies 1, 2 and 3. Supportive data in MBC were obtained from 4 phase II trials, studies 4 - 7.

## Dose-response studies

Results from 11 phase I/II clinical trials in 242 patients with a diverse range of tumours were reported. The results showed that the dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia. In dose-ranging studies, the MTD was 75 - 90 mg/m 2  without G-CSF support. With G-CSF, a subsequent phase II trial showed that a dose of 135 mg/m 2  was associated with unacceptable toxicity. With the exception of cardiac toxicity, the  adverse events seen in the phase I/II studies of Myocet were similar in type to those seen with conventional Dox. Although the numbers of patients at the various dose levels are relatively small, there is a rough correlation with the dose of Myocet and frequency of adverse events commonly seen with Dox.

Bolus administration of Myocet was associated with an acute syndrome of infusion-related side effects and  there  is  very  limited  experience  from  other  schedules  for  administration  of  Myocet.  For monotherapy trials, a dose of 75 mg/m 2 administered every three weeks was selected.

The recommended dose of Myocet is 60-75 mg/m 2 in combination with CPA (600 mg/m 2 ), every three weeks. The administration is by i.v. infusion over a period of one hour.

## Main studies

Three  pivotal  trials  with  similar  designs  were  performed.  All  studies  were  randomised  multicentre, parallel group, open-label studies. Treatment was assigned using blocked randomisation (block size of 2 for studies 1 and 2, size unknown to the investigators), which was stratified according to centre and in studies 1 and 2 also according to prior adjuvant Dox.

Study  1  compared  Myocet,  60  mg/m 2 ,  in  combination  with  CPA, versus Dox,  60  mg/m 2 ,  in combination with CPA. Study 2 compared Myocet, 75 mg/m 2 (with dose escalation up to 105 mg/m 2 ), monotherapy, versus Dox,  75  mg/m 2 ,  monotherapy  and  study  3  compared  Myocet,  75  mg/m 2 ,  in combination with CPA versus epirubicin (Epi) 75 mg/m 2 in  combination with CPA. Regimens were administered every three weeks and in all combination regimens, CPA, 600 mg/m 2 was given as i.v. bolus injections or short infusions prior to Myocet or Dox.

The main selection criteria were histologically or cytologically proven MBC, adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function and resting LVEF ≥ 50%. Prior radiotherapy (RT) to the mediastinum &gt;35 Gy was  an  exclusion  criterion.  In  studies  1  and  3,  G-CSF  was  permitted  in  the  case  of  pronounced myelotoxicity whereas in study 2, and later in study 1, it was started routinely 48 h after Myocet was administered.  Dexrazoxane  was  permitted,  at  the  discretion  of  the  physician  in  trials  1  and  2  in patients with a lifetime cumulative dose of Dox of &gt;300 mg/m 2 but never came to use in any patient.

## Endpoints

## Efficacy endpoints

Response rate according to WHO criteria with confirmation after 6 weeks was the primary efficacy endpoint in all three studies. An independent blinded response review of radiology imaging was not carried out. Although an independent blinded review of all tumour imaging would have been optimal, a procedure involving a 'blinded' core radiologist in each site was used in trials 1 and 2 and this is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered to be acceptable from a data quality point of view. In general, progression-free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are considered  more clinically relevant endpoints in advanced BC. However, it is possible that in direct comparison between two Dox formulations response rate could be a sensitive endpoint for detection of a difference. Furthermore, provided reliable results in other relevant endpoints are obtained, it seems reasonable to give relative weight to various endpoints based on  scientific  reasoning.  Thus,  response  rate  can  be  considered  as  an  adequate  endpoint  as  long  as findings are supported by reliable data on PFS and OS, which were also interpreted in the light of any subsequent treatments administered.

## Safety endpoints

Reduction of cardiotoxicity was an additional primary objective in studies 1 and 2. Independent/blinded evaluation of CHF was not required in any protocol but was used for the final establishment of CHF. LVEF assessment was blinded in all trials. A cardiac toxicity event was defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following conditions:

- Type I: decrease in resting LVEF of ≥ 20 points from baseline, to a final value ≥ 50%;
- Type II: decrease in resting LVEF of ≥ 10 points to a final value &lt;50%;
- Clinical evidence of CHF.

Patients  experiencing  a  cardiotoxicity  event  were  discontinued  from  study  treatment.  Additional criteria  for  study  treatment  discontinuation  were  patient  refusal,  SAE,  surgical  removal  of  target lesions,  RT  to  target  lesions,  progressive  disease  and,  subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  investigator, stable disease after 4 courses.

Cardiac  evaluation  was  performed  by  ECG  and  by  MUGA  scans    (study  1  and  2)  or  by echocardiography (study 3). Irrespective of method, evaluation was to be performed:

- at baseline;
- prior to the next cycle after reaching a lifetime cumulative Dox or Epi dose of 300 mg/m 2  and 400 mg/m 2 ;
- prior  to  each  subsequent  cycle  after  reaching  a  lifetime  cumulative  Dox  or  Epi  dose  of  500 mg/m 2 ;
- three months after the last dose of study medication (post study discontinuation);
- at the end of treatment visit, if a patient had received a lifetime cumulative Dox or Epi dose of ≥ 300 mg/m 2  and a MUGA scan had not been performed within the previous 3 weeks;
- any other time clinically indicated.

For  cardiotoxicity,  a  significant  decrease,  as  defined  in  the  protocols,  in  LVEF  blindly  and prospectively  assessed  by  MUGA  scans  seems  to  be  an  established  surrogate  endpoint  of  clinical relevance for the later occurrence of CHF. Evaluation by echocardiography is considered less accurate but is considered acceptable because evaluation was blinded. CHF is not considered to be a reliable measure due to the fact that only those cases selected by the unblinded investigator were reviewed independently.  Thus,  for  cardiotoxicity  the  main  outcome  measure  is  suggested  to  be  changes  in LVEF.

Secondary  endpoints  were  time  to  progression,  overall  survival,  change  in  performance  status  and disease related symptoms and, in studies 1 and 3, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (BR23) questionnaire.

## Statistical design

With  respect  to  response  rate,  all  trials  were  designed  to  show  non-inferiority.  Non-inferiority  was defined  so  as  to  rule  out  a  reduction  in  response  rate  for  Myocet  of  15%  or  more  ( ∆ =15%).  The antitumour efficacy data are presented according ITT  (all  randomised patients according to randomised treatment). Confirmatory analyses were carried out on the per protocol population (PPP). With  respect  to  cardiotoxicity,  treatment  arms  were  compared  using  the  logrank  test  stratified  by adjuvant  doxorubicin,  with  a  two-sided  type  I  error  of  0.05.  The  patient  population  for  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cardiotoxicity  endpoint  was  all  randomised  patients  who  started  treatment,  according  to  treatment actually received.

The most notable differences in baseline characteristics (Table 2) were a higher proportion of patients in  the  Myocet  group  with  visceral  involvement  in  study  1  (72% versus 60%),  and  a  significantly higher proportion of patients receiving Myocet with negative progesterone-receptor status in study 2 (43% versus 29%). Study-drug exposure was comparable between treatment groups within each study. The median number of cycles per patient was six for both combination-regimen studies (studies 1 and 3),  and  four  for  the  single-agent  study.  Study  3  was  planned  for  300  patients  but  was  terminated prematurely due to cost and rate of enrolment.

Study-drug  exposure  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups  within  each  study.  The  median number of cycles per patient was six for both combination-regimen studies (studies 1 and 3), and four for the single-agent study as detailed in table 3.

The  main  reasons  for  study  treatment  discontinuation  for  study  1  were  (Myocet/CPA versus Dox/CPA):  progressive  disease  (31 versus 25%),  maximum  response  achieved  (25 versus 27%), institutional practice (11 versus 10%), refusal (8 versus 5%), cardiotoxicity (5 versus 10%), adverse event (5 versus 8%), risk of cardiotoxicity (1 versus 5%) and death (5 versus 1%). For study 2 these were  (Myocet versus Dox):  progressive  disease  (52 versus 28%),  maximum  response  achieved  (12 versus 14%), refusal (9 versus 7%), cardiotoxicity (10 versus 25%), adverse event (3 versus 7%), risk of cardiotoxicity (2 versus 8%) and death (0 versus 2%). For study 3 these were (Myocet/CPA versus Epi/CPA): progressive disease (18 versus 24%), maximum response achieved (9 versus 4%), refusal (9 versus 12%), cardiotoxicity (4 versus 5%), adverse event (4 versus 7%), risk of cardiotoxicity (1 versus 0%) and death (4 versus 5%).

## Antitumour efficacy

According  to  the  predefined  criterion,  Myocet  in  combination  with  CPA  showed  non-inferiority  in response rate compared to Dox (Table 4). Generally, the predefined ∆ of 15% for response rate would be considered to be too large, nevertheless the results shown in terms of confidence intervals allows to rule  out  smaller  differences.  Particularly,  Myocet  in  combination  with  CPA  showed  non-inferiority with respect  to an a  posteriori defined ∆ of  10%.  In  all  three  studies  the  majority  of  patients  were assessed using objective imaging techniques (75 - 91%). The results of the analyses performed in the PPP (data not shown) were consistent with those performed in the ITT population. Response rate in patients  with  prior  adjuvant  Dox  treatment  was  50 versus 20%  (combination)  and  17 versus 5% (monotherapy), for Myocet and Dox respectively. In patients with no prior Dox treatment response rate  was  42 versus 45%  (combination)  and  28 versus 31%  (monotherapy),  for  Myocet  and  Dox respectively.

The observed response rate in the monotherapy study was low in both arms, compared to what has been  seen  in  trials  with  single-agent  Dox.  Nevertheless,  the  difficulties  of  comparisons  between studies, particularly with respect to response rates, make the similar relative efficacy of the treatment arms more relevant. In addition, the monotherapy study by itself is of limited value in assessing the role of Myocet in combination with CPA.

Outcome with respect to PFS and OS are summarised in Table 5. The data are considered reasonably mature. For study 1, in a 24-month period, 108 of 142 patients (76%) in the Myocet arm progressed (median PFS 5.1 months) compared to 126 of 154 patients (82%) on the Dox arm (median PFS 5.5 months).

In  study  2,  Myocet  was  found  to  have  worse  OS  although  the  difference  was  not  statistically significant at the 5% level (logrank p -value=0.076). A multiple regression analysis for response rate, PFS and OS exploring the importance of baseline covariates was performed for study 2. Adjustment for baseline prognostic factors did not result in any important changes in response rate, PFS or OS. Based on the response rate and all other efficacy data from the 3 pivotal trials and taking into account

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that study 2 was a single-agent study, the observed tendency for worse survival for Myocet compared with Dox seems of limited concern. The survival difference in favour of Dox is likely to be related to events  after  treatment  or  to  differences  in  unknown  prognostic  factors.  Furthermore,  although comparison with historical data is hazardous, it might be concluded that survival for the Myocet arm was not significantly compromised.

With respect to changes in performance status, body weight, pain and other symptoms in study 1 there were  no  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  There  were  minor  changes  to  the  advantage  of Myocet in patient-reported symptoms at cycles 2, 3 and 4 but not when comparing changes throughout the  study.  Mean  changes  for  most  QoL  parameters  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  Minor differences  in  a  few  parameters  to  the  advantage  of  either  arm  were  observed.  In  study  2,  no differences in weight, pain or other symptoms were observed. The Dox group improved slightly, but significantly more than the Myocet arm in performance status.

## Supportive studies

The supportive phase II trials (study 4, 5, 6 and 7) do not provide any critical data for this assessment but rather confirm the feasibility of Myocet administration with respect to efficacy and safety.

Study 6-combined Myocet with CPA and 5-FU, resulting in a high response rate without obviously increased cardiotoxicity but with a tendency for more pronounced other toxicity. Study 7 (single-agent Myocet with a starting dose of 135 mg/m 2 as a 1 h infusion every three weeks, with G-CSF), on the other  hand,  confirmed  the  fairly  modest  advantage  from  Myocet  since  the  high  dose  used  clearly produced unacceptable cardiotoxicity.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The choice of treatment in the control and the experimental groups in trials 1 is considered relevant. Dox/CPA is still  regarded  as  a  clinically  relevant  combination  although  the  inclusion  also  of  5-FU (CAF regimen) is more commonly used. Single-agent Dox at conventional doses is probably mostly not  accepted  as  a  clinical  standard  but  for  the  purpose  of  elucidating  differences  in  the  therapeutic ratios for Myocet and Dox, the comparison is relevant.

The Myocet versus Epi comparison at identical doses in study 3 is more problematic with respect to antitumour  efficacy  due  to  the  comparison  at  identical  doses  with  Epi,  which  might  have  a  better therapeutic  index  than  Dox.  Based  on  prior  experience  Epi  seems  to  be  less  cardiotoxic,  with  an incidence of CHF at 900 mg/m 2 approximately similar to that of 550 mg/m 2 Dox. Although equivalent antitumour efficacy is suggested from randomised comparisons using identical doses, this is not yet fully accepted. Currently, many clinicians would probably suggest that 75 mg/m 2 of Epi correlates to approximately 60 mg/m 2 of Dox with respect to toxicity and efficacy.

Unfortunately,  very  precise  data  on  the  effect  of  chemotherapy  on  OS  in  MBC  are  missing  but retrospective cohort data indicate a survival benefit from non-anthracycline chemotherapy versus no treatment in the range 6 - 9 months. A somewhat better effect might be expected from anthracyclinebased  treatment.  Against  this  background,  a  non-inferiority  requirement  for  the  lower  bound  95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio for PFS and OS in the range 0.7 - 0.8 was considered relevant.

With respect to antitumour efficacy, some of the data presented are not fully satisfactory, notably the survival data from study 2 as well as choice of tumour response rate as primary endpoint in the phase III trials. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that the survival difference in study 2 is unlikely to be due to different antitumour activity of Myocet versus Dox. Based on a global assessment of all efficacy data from the phase III trials, it seems reasonable to conclude that Myocet is non-inferior to Dox and, thus, an active drug for the treatment of MBC.

## Clinical safety

Adverse events were graded according to NCI CTC criteria. Safety data were presented according to treatment actually received.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patient exposure

Three hundred and twenty-three patients were actually exposed to Myocet in studies 1 - 3. Fourteen and  13%  of  Myocet  and  Dox  cycles,  respectively,  were  delayed  in  study  1  and  the  corresponding figures for study 2 were 16 and 14% and 17 and 15% for study 3. The fraction of cycles with dose reductions was 4 and 9% for Myocet and Dox, respectively, in study 1, 28 and 25% in study 2 and 11 and  4% in study 3. The main reason for dose delays/reductions was  myelosuppression. G-CSF use between treatment arms was 38 and 45% of cycles for Myocet and Dox, respectively in study 1, with corresponding figures of 56 and 68% in study 2 and 39 and 29% in study 3.

## Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths

In study 1, there were 10 patients on the Myocet/CPA arm who died within 30 days of study treatment administration. Four of these deaths occurred after one cycle of therapy; 3 were considered to be due to  progressive  disease  and  1  death  was  due  to  sepsis  in  the  setting  of  grade  4  neutropenia.  Four Myocet/CPA patients died after their second cycle of study therapy; 3 died of progressive disease and 1 of the four died of complications related to coronary artery disease. One patient died due to a preexisting  radiation-induced  constrictive  pericarditis  and  the  tenth  Myocet/CPA  death  was  observed after six cycles due to grade 4 neutropenic sepsis. Two Dox/CPA patients died within 30 days of their last dose of study therapy, one of unknown causality after one cycle. The second patient died after two cycles, due to progressive disease. In study 2, two Dox patients died while on the study, both due to progressive  disease.  There  were  no  deaths  on  the  Myocet  arm.  In  study  3,  3  Myocet/CPA  and  4 Epi/CPA patients died within 30 days of study treatment administration. All cases were considered to be due to progressive disease.

The  observed  SAEs  in  studies  1  and  3  did  not  present  any  unexpected  findings  with  respect  to incidence or type of SAEs, nor in the comparisons across treatment arms. In study 2, SAEs other than deaths were reported for 41 and 40% of patients in the Myocet and Dox arms, respectively. Eightynine and 94%, respectively, of these SAEs were of grade 3 or 4 and are partly also covered in the adverse events section below. The overall incidence of grade 3 - 4 SAEs according to organ system was fairly balanced (including types of events).

## Cardiotoxicity

Cardiotoxicity results for studies 1 and 2 in which MUGA scans were used, are summarised in Table 6. A total of 9 versus 32 cardiotoxic events were observed in the Myocet and Dox arms, respectively, in study 1. The corresponding figures for study 2 were 18 and 44. The 5 confirmed cases of CHF in study 1 had lifetime Dox exposures in the range 360 - 480 mg/m 2 with 1 patient having received a cumulative dose of adjuvant Dox of 240 mg/m 2 . The 2 patients with CHF in the Myocet arm in study 2 had life-time Dox exposure of 1100 and 785 mg/m 2 (290 mg/m 2 adjuvant), respectively. The 9 patients with CHF in the Dox arm had lifetime Dox exposure in the range 525 - 765 mg/m 2 with 2 patients having a cumulative dose of adjuvant Dox of 195 and 300 mg/m 2 , respectively.

In study 2, cardiac biopsies were performed in the initial phase of the study, for patients with lifetime Dox exposure of &gt;400  mg/m 2 .  Thirty-six  patients  (19  Myocet  and  17  Dox)  had  biopsies  that  were blindly  evaluated  and  scored  according  to  Billingham.  None  of  the  patients  in  the  Myocet  arm compared with 7 in the Dox arm showed the highest score, i.e. ,  3.0,  whereas 5 patients in each arm had a score of 2.5. Nevertheless, although an important selection bias is unlikely, the data for the 36 patients with a biopsy need to be assessed with caution.

Cardiotoxicity  was  not  a  primary  endpoint  in  study  3  and  a  less  reproducible  method  for  LVEF monitoring, i.e. ,  echocardiography, was used. The maximal cumulative dose of Myocet and Epi was 600 mg/m 2 . Nine patients (12%; 5 type I and 4 type II) in the Myocet arm and 8 patients (10%; 5 type I and 3 type II) in the Epi arm developed reductions on LVEF. There were no cases of CHF.

Three hundred and seventy-nine anthracycline-naive patients with solid tumours treated with Myocet at starting doses of &lt;100 mg/m 2 in all clinical studies were included in the assessment of risk of CHF. Two patients (0.5%) developed CHF. The cumulative risk of developing CHF was 3% at 650 mg/m 2 and  9%  at  750  mg/m 2 .  Exploratory  analyses  indicated  that  the  cardiotoxicity  advantage  of  Myocet over Dox was observed in subgroups seemingly at higher risk for cardiotoxicity (by age, prior Dox and radiation to the chest) as well as in remaining lower-risk subgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Follow-up  with  respect  to  LVEF  changes  was  similar  between  treatment  arms  and  generally  most events occurred within the study periods. With respect to CHF, 6 of the 16 total cases were reported &gt;3 months after the last study treatment administration. Thus, the majority of CHF cases were reported close to the trials, which increase the reliability of these data. However, CHF might occur very late after therapy and there is probably a risk for underreporting since events might be attributed to 2 nd line or other therapy, part of natural ageing, etc . Thus, with respect to CHF there remains uncertainty about the  quality  of  the  data  due  the  procedure  for  data  collection, i.e. ,  spontaneous  reporting  from  the investigators.

## Clinical adverse events and laboratory findings

In  study  2  the  median  duration  of  thrombocytopenia  was  6  and  5  days  for  Myocet  and  Dox, respectively. In study 3 the median duration of thrombocytopenia was 9 and 5 days for Myocet and Epi. In study 3 median duration of neutropenia was 7 and 10 days for Myocet and Epi, respectively. Otherwise there were no differences in the duration or degree of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.

There was generally little skin toxicity. With respect to palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, 1 Dox/CPA patient developed a grade 1 reaction whereas in study 2, there were 2 grade 2 cases in the Dox arm and 1 grade 2 cases in the Myocet arm. This toxicity was not detailed for study 3. Pronounced alopecia was observed in approximately 80 - 90% of patients in both arms in all studies. Injection site reactions were  more common in the Dox arm but significantly so only in study 3. Experience of  9 cases of extravasation of Myocet was reported. Ulcerative lesions or necrosis were not observed.

There were no apparent differences between the treatment arms in events considered less relevant for chemotherapy or with incidences &lt;5%. Table 7 summarises the non-cardiac clinical and haematological adverse events considered to be relevant for chemotherapy and with a frequency of &gt;5% in either arm.

There was no indication of apparent different safety profiles in patients below and above 65 years of age.  There  is  no  experience  reported  on  the  safety  profile  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  or  liver function.

Drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported for the Myocet but not for the Dox arm in study 1 included  bronchospasm,  emotional  lability,  pain,  pneumonia  and  supraventricular  tachycardia  (1 patient each). Corresponding observations for study 2 were folliculitis, glossitis, pericardial effusion and  pruritus  (1  patient  each)  and  for  study  3  stomatitis  (5  patients),  gastric  ulcer  (2  patients), somnolence  (2  patients),  bronchitis,  haemorrhagic  cystitis,  dizziness,  dysphonia,  abnormal  gait,

gingivitis,  herpes  zoster,  melena,  muscle  weakness,  palpitation  and  supraventricular  tachycardia  (1 patient each).

Other  laboratory  parameters measured  included  transaminases,  alkaline phosphatase,  bilirubin, sodium,  potassium,  urea,  creatinine,  albumin,  urate,  calcium,  phosphate,  glucose,  chloride  in  blood and renal toxicity was also investigated by dipsticks/microscopy for erythrocytes, leukocytes, protein, glucose  and  casts.  There  were  essentially  no  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  these parameters.

Twenty  and  18%  of  Myocet  and  Dox  patients,  respectively,  in  study  1  had  at  least  one  grade  3 toxicity.  The corresponding figures for study 2 were 18 and 11% and for study 3, 5 and 10%.

Grade 3 and 4 hepatic laboratory abnormalities ranged 0 - 4% and 0 - 1%, respectively, in trials 1 - 3, with no apparent differences between treatment arms. There was 1 patient in each arm of trial 1 with creatinine elevation of grade 3 and a few cases in both arms of grades 3 - 4 electrolyte and mineral abnormalities in trials 1 and 3. In study 3, there were 4 patients in each arm with serum urea elevation of grade 3.

## Discussion on clinical safety

With respect to cardiotoxicity, Myocet compared to Dox (studies 1 and 2) clearly reduced the risk for a  significant  decrease  in  LVEF  although  the  absolute  differences  were  small.  There  was  also  a difference in the incidence in CHF although this observation is less convincing given the unblinded procedures for reporting this event. Differences in LVEF changes or incidence of CHF did not appear to be due to differences in post-study therapy. Based on the seemingly acceptable surrogate value of a decreased LVEF for the future development of CHF it is concluded that the cardiac safety profile for Myocet is better than that of Dox.

Myocet  by  no  means  completely  relieves  the  risk  of  significant  cardiotoxicity  from  Dox  based chemotherapy. Thus, LVEF changes were observed also in the Myocet groups and seemed to be dosedependent, as evidenced by comparing studies 1 and 2. In both trials the relative Myocet/Dox dose to produce similar frequencies of LVEF changes approximately ranged 1.2 - 1.5/1. This is a modest but clinically relevant achievement that might improve cardiac safety and/or the possibility to prolong a putatively beneficial treatment in MBC patients.

Most  observed  cases  of  CHF  occurred  quite  early  after  treatment  and  there  remains  a  risk  for underreporting of very late occurring events. It seems unlikely that poor or biased reporting of late CHF  would  change  the  overall  conclusion  regarding  cardiac  safety  of  Myocet  compared  to  Dox. Nevertheless, late onset cardiotoxicity is known to occur with anthracyclines and the comparison of cardiotoxic  events  after  long-term  follow-up  needs  to  be  considered.  Thus,  it  will  be  necessary  to perform  future  surveillance  in  order  to  assess  the  long-term  cardiotoxicity  for  patients  who  have received Myocet.

The profiles for Myocet and Dox were similar with a trend for Myocet to be less myelotoxic and to produce less stomatitis. Particularly, Myocet was associated with less frequent anaemia (85% versus 96% in study 2), infection (36% versus 58% in study 2), and stomatitis / mucositis (40% versus 56%, in  study  1).  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  these  differences  concern  all  grades  of  those  events, while  statistically  significant  differences  are  not  attained  for  the  higher  intensities  of  the  same manifestations. Furthermore, the assessment of myelotoxicity is obscured by the frequent use of GCSF.

Compared  to  Epi,  Myocet  was  associated  with  significantly  more  frequent  haematological  adverse events  and  mucositis  but,  as  Epi  was  probably  underdosed,  evidence  of  definitive  inferiority  of  the safety profile of Myocet cannot be retained. In study 3, cardiotoxicity was not a primary endpoint and was  less  accurately  assessed.  Cardiotoxicity  seemed  to  be  similar  between  the  treatment  groups. Tentatively,  and  based  on  the  experience  of  lower  cardiotoxicity  of  Epi  compared  with  Dox  at identical doses, this would also suggest a favourable cardiac safety profile for Myocet. The favourable cardiotoxic profile of Myocet also seemed to hold for patients at increased risk for cardiotoxicity.

## 5. Overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment

## Quality

The quality of Myocet is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Aflatoxin control, the risk assessment of virological inactivation and validation of use of a dry heat block in the preparation of the final constituted product will be addressed as a Follow-up Measures.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

The antitumour activity of Myocet has been investigated in animal models and compared with that of free  Dox.  Myocet  allowed  the  administration  of  higher  doses  of  Dox,  which  seemed  to  display  a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to the free Dox formulation.

The  equal  or  improved  survival  that  was  observed  in  short-term  animal  studies  of  Myocet versus conventional  Dox  allows  speculating  that  Myocet  might  maintain  its  activity  also  against  the development of metastases. However, the actual long-term protection against the effect of micrometastases  cannot  be  determined  from  the  data.  This  issue  is  not  considered  critical  in  the palliative setting of MBC whereas it would need further investigations in earlier stages of the disease.

In summary, the preclinical data for Myocet are satisfactory.

## Efficacy

Although pharmacokinetic data may be somewhat unreliable, it appears that liposome-encapsulation of Dox results in lower peak plasma concentrations (thus mimicking continuous infusion) while the AUC for free drug may be approximately similar for the two treatments. This could explain why the efficacy and toxicity profiles are similar for Myocet and conventional Dox, whereas cardiotoxicity is somewhat reduced for Myocet.

The  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  in  patients  with  impaired  liver  function  will  be  addressed  as  a follow-up measure.

The choice of the combination Dox/CPA in the control and the experimental groups in one pivotal trial is considered relevant although the CAF regimen is more commonly used. Single-agent Dox at conventional  doses,  as  was  used  in  the  second  pivotal  trial,  although  generally  not  accepted  as  a clinical standard, is considered relevant for the purpose of elucidating differences in the therapeutic ratios for Myocet and Dox.

In  general,  PFS  and  OS  are  considered  more  clinically  relevant  endpoints  than  response  rate  in advanced  BC.  However,  in  direct  comparison  between  two  Dox  formulations,  response  rate  was considered to be a sensitive endpoint for detection of a difference, if adequately supported by reliable PFS and OS data.

The  pivotal  trials  show  that  Myocet  is  non-inferior  to  Dox  on  a  mg  per  mg  basis  with  respect  to antitumour  efficacy.  It  is  acknowledged  that  there  are  some  efficacy  concerns,  notably  the  inferior survival  data  observed  for  Myocet  in  study  2.  However,  it  appears  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the survival difference in study 2 is unlikely to be due to different antitumour activity of Myocet versus Dox. In addition, this study is less relevant for the approved indication.

Based on the assessment of all efficacy data from the pivotal trials it seems reasonable to conclude that Myocet is an active drug for the treatment of MBC and that its activity is non-inferior to that of Dox. Concerns  were  raised  about  the  real  added  value  of  the  liposomal  formulation  compared  to conventional Dox.

It should be noted that demonstrated differences in pharmacokinetics between Myocet and Dox might be of importance for the eradication of micrometastasis. Myocet should therefore not be used in the adjuvant treatment of BC.

## Safety

With respect to cardiotoxicity, both in combination or single-agent studies, Myocet reduced the risk of a  decrease  in  LVEF  compared  to  Dox  although  the  absolute  differences  were  small.  The  observed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

difference  in  the  incidence  in  CHF  in  favour  of  Myocet  is  less  convincing  given  the  unblinded reporting of cases. Based on the acceptable surrogate value of a decrease in LVEF for the development of CHF it is concluded that the cardiac safety profile for Myocet is better than for Dox.

Most  observed  cases  of  CHF  occurred  quite  early  after  treatment  and  there  remains  a  risk  for underreporting  of  very  late  occurring  events.  Late  onset  cardiotoxicity  is  known  to  occur  with anthracyclines  and  the  comparison  of  cardiotoxic  events  after  long-term  follow-up  needs  to  be considered.

Excluding cardiotoxicity, the  combination and single-agent trials  of  Myocet/CPM versus Dox/CPM and Myocet versus Dox showed comparable toxicity profiles. Experimental safety data are insufficient to allow a comparison of Myocet with Epi.

Myocet  does  not  completely  relieve  the  risk  for  significant  cardiotoxicity.  LVEF  changes  were observed also with Myocet and seemed to be dose-intensity dependent. The relative Myocet/Dox dose to produce similar frequencies of LVEF changes was approximately 1.2 to 1.5 times that of Dox. For MBC  patients,  this  is  a  modest  but  still  clinically  relevant  achievement  that  might  provide  an improved cardiac safety and/or the possibility to prolong treatment.

The evaluation of left ventricular function is considered mandatory before each additional administration  of  Myocet  once  a  patient  exceeds  a  lifetime  cumulative  anthracycline  dose  of  550 mg/m 2 or  whenever  cardiomyopathy  is  suspected  (see  SPC  4.4, Special  warnings  and  special precautions for use ).

It will be necessary to monitor the long-term cardiotoxicity for patients who have received Myocet.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Overall  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  Myocet  lowers  the  risk  of  cardiotoxicity  compared  with conventional Dox in dosages clinically equipotent with respect to antitumour activity. The absolute benefit  from  this,  however,  appears  modest  in  patients  with  MBC.  With  respect to  other  aspects  of toxicity, the safety profiles of Myocet and Dox are clinically similar.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by majority decision that the benefit/risk  profile  of  Myocet,  in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide,  in  the  first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women was favourable.
