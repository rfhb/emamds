## 1.1. Introduction

Xeloda (capecitabine), is a pro-drug of 5-FU and is indicated for:

- -the adjuvant treatment of patients following surgery for stage III (Dukes´stage C) colon cancer
- -the first line monotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer
- -in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous  therapy  should  have included an anthracycline.
- -as  monotherapy for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer after  failure  of  taxanes  and  an  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy  regimen  or  for  whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated

This application is made to support an enlargement of the mCRC indication from 'Xeloda is indicated for first  line  monotherapy  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (see  section  5.1)'  to Xeloda is indicated  for  the  treatment  of  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (see  section  5.1)  and  resulting changes in SPC sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4,  4.5,  4.8,  and  5.1.  In  effect,  it  is  claimed  that  Xeloda  is  also indicated in (any) combination at any line of treatment.

The  backbone  of  treatment  for  colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  is  fluorouracil  which  is  thought  to  act primarily  by  inhibiting  thymidylate  synthase,  the  rate  limiting  enzyme  in  pyrimidine  nucleotide synthesis.  Prospective  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  use  of  chemotherapy  in  patients  with metastatic disease (mCRC) prolongs survival and enhances quality of life in comparison to palliative care alone 1 . An estimate for the clinical benefit derives from a meta-analysis of 13 such trials revealing that systemic chemotherapy leads to an improvement in 1-year survival from 34 percent to 50 percent and an improvement in median survival by 3.7 months 2 .

For the past 40 years, 5-FU used alone, or more recently in combination with leucovorin (LV), was the only established chemotherapy for mCRC. In the past 8 years, 5 new substances, 3 with a cytotoxic mechanism  of  action  (irinotecan,  oxaliplatin,  capecitabine),  and  2  targeted  monoclonal  antibodies (bevacizumab and cetuximab) have been introduced into clinical practice.

The current ESMO (European Society of Medical Oncology) Minimum Clinical Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of advanced colorectal cancer 3 reads as follows:

- Surgery should be considered for solitary or confined liver or pulmonary metastases.
- First line palliative chemotherapy should be considered early and consists of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in various combinations and schedules. Infused regimens of 5-FU/leucovorin (LV) are generally less toxic than bolus regimens. The oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine is an alternative to infusional 5-FU/LV [I, B].
- Combination chemotherapy with 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin or 5-FU/LV/irinotecan provides better survival than 5-FU/LV. [II, A].
- Novel targeted agents, i.e. monoclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in combination with chemotherapy may be considered in carefully selected patients.
- Second line chemotherapy should be considered for selected patients with maintained good performance status [I, A].

Concerning combination therapy with BV, the MAH consider that it is recommended, but comparative phase II and III data were only available for the combinations of IFL and BV, FOLFOX, and FOLFIRI (5-FU/LV, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan) as first-line therapy and FOLFOX and BV as second-line therapy. Therefore, combination therapy of capecitabine with oxaliplatin and BV needed to be investigated. An extension of the current indication for capecitabine would allow the benefits of capecitabine combination therapy to be made available to patients across all current standard treatment

regimens and increase the ability of oncologists to choose the most appropriate therapy for their patients.

The  MAH  states  that  clinical  data  generated  to  date  consistently  suggest  that  capecitabine  has equivalent efficacy to 5-FU/LV in mCRC. This statement is underlined with reference to the results of three  large  phase  III  studies  in  colorectal  cancer  (M66001  [=X-ACT  trial  in  the  adjuvant  setting  of colon cancer], SO14796, and SO14695 [both the pivotal trials for the first MAA granted to Xeloda as monotherapy  in  mCRC];  which  have  demonstrated  that  capecitabine  is  at  least  as  effective  with respect  to  PFS  and  overall  survival  (OS)  when  administered  as  intravenous  bolus  5-FU/LV  (Mayo regimen), with a comparable safety profile.

Currently,  FOLFOX-4 has become a standard treatment for mCRC. Since capecitabine provides an effective,  convenient  and  generally  tolerable  safety  profile  compared  to  5-FU/LV,  and  since capecitabine and oxaliplatin show no overlap of key toxicities, studies combining capecitabine with oxaliplatin were needed to evaluate whether capecitabine can provide benefit in this combination in the setting of mCRC.

## 1.2 Clinical aspects

The clinical program is mainly based on 2 pivotal Phase III non-inferiority trials: NO16966 and NO16967

Supplemental data supporting the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of the XELOX and XELOX+BV dosing regimens are provided from the following studies:

- Trial NP18587 (PK1), an open label multi-centre trial to assess the PK interaction between capecitabine and oxaliplatin in the absence or presence of BV in patients with mCRC. NP18587 (PK1) is a PK sub-study of trial NO16966 in Canadian centres.
- A published 4 phase I trial to determine the optimal dosing regimen for XELOX.
- Trial M66016 an open-label, multicenter, multi-national, single-arm, Phase II study evaluating the overall response rateto XELOX combination therapy in patients with advanced and/or mCRC.
- Trial NO16968 , an ongoing study in the adjuvant setting, for which available safety data are included exclusively in the Summary of Clinical Safety (CSS)

Two smaller clinical trials (M66009, Phase I, and M66016, Phase II) have investigated the combination of capecitabine with oxaliplatin and revealed significant activity with a tolerable safety profile. Based on these two studies, 2 non-inferiority Phase III studies comparing XELOX with FOLFOX-4 in the first- (NO16966) and second-line (NO16967) settings were started in 2002. In 2003, two randomized, controlled clinical trials of BV in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy (AVF0780g, Phase II and AVF2107g, Phase III) were reported. The AVF2107g trial showed that BV in combination with IFL as first-line chemotherapy in patients with mCRC was superior in terms of disease free survival and OS compared to chemotherapy (IFL) alone. As a consequence, the first-line trial NO16966 was amended to assess the potential improvement when BV is added to XELOX or FOLFOX-4.

## 1. 2. 1.  Clinical Phrmacology

## PK interactions between capecitabine and oxaliplatin (+/-bevacizumab) in patients with mCRC

Trial NP18587 (PK1) was conducted (as a sub-study of trial NO16966) in three centres in Canada between August 8, 2005 and September 21, 2006. The objectives of this PK study were to determine whether oxaliplatin influences the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and vice versa, as well as any combination of the two with bevacizumab.

It was an open label, multi-centre trial with a primary treatment phase of 16 cycles of treatment or until progressive disease or withdrawal. Samples for PK analysis were collected during the first 3

4 Ann Oncol 13:558-65, 2002

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cycles of treatment. Treatment in cycle 4 to 16 consisted in the triple combination (capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab) administered at cycle 3 as long as no dose modification /interruption/ stopping of a single combination partner was required. The schedule investigated for capecitabine and oxaliplatin in trial NP18587 (PK1) reflects the recommended dose deriving from the published phase I trial where diarrhoea was the DLT.

The primary parameter for Capecitabine was AUC0-∞ of 5'-DFUR.

Secondary parameters were AUC0-∞ , AUC0-last , Cmax, and t½ β of capecitabine and its metabolites (5'DFCR, 5-FU, and FBAL); AUC0-last, Cmax, and t½ β of 5'-DFUR.

The primary parameter for Oxaliplatin was AUC0-∞ of free platinum.

Secondary parameters were AUC0-∞ , Cmax, AUC0-last, t½, VSS and CL of total platinum; Cmax, AUC0-last, t½, VSS and CL of free platinum. The PK results are best summarised as in Table 1:

Treatment with the capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in combination was generally well tolerated with no new or unexpected safety signals. The most common types of adverse events reported were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea) and nervous system disorders (peripheral sensory neuropathy and neuropathy peripheral), both of which are common toxicities of capecitabine and oxaliplatin. As of September 21, 2006 there were no deaths reported in this study.

## MTD/DLT of Capecitabine in Combination with Oxaliplatin (XELOX)

A phase I dose escalation trial (M66009) conducted to investigate the safety of the combination of oxaliplatin and oral capecitabine has been submitted as a publication 5 only. Twenty-three patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours received a 3-weekly intermittent regimen of oral capecitabine (500, 825, 1000 or 1250 mg/m 2 , x 14 days, 7days rest) in subsequent cohorts of 3 patients (provided that no dose limiting toxicities [DLT] occurred) each in combination with a fixed dose (130 mg/m 2 , 2 hr  IV  infusion,  4-6  hours  after  the  first  morning  dose  of  capecitabine)  of  oxaliplatin.  Dose-limiting toxicities were such which occurred during the first treatment cycle, did not resolve within 2 days of symptomatic treatment, and fulfilled one of the following criteria: grade 3/4 diarrhoea, any other grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxicity, grade 3 hand-foot-syndrome, grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy, any other  clinically  relevant  grade  3/4  toxicity,  prolonged  (grade  4  &gt;  5  days)  granulocytopenia  with complications (such as neutropenic fever, mucositis, or diarrhoea)

In  the  cohorts  treated  with  500  to  825  mg/m 2 bid  capecitabine  no  DLT  occurred.  Dose  limiting diarrhoea was observed in 1 of 9 patients treated at the dose level 1000 mg/m 2 bid capecitabine. Two of 6 patients treated at the dose level 1250 mg/m 2 bid capecitabine experienced dose limiting diarrhoea which was accompanied either by grade 3 thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia

Based on the study results the recommended dosing schedule for capecitabine was 1000 mg/m 2 twice daily (x 14 days) in combination with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 (day  1)  in  an  every  3  week  treatment cycle.

5, Protocol Version E as of 02 December 2005

Trial NO16966 consists in two parts: The trial was started under protocol version A approved on 31 January 2003. According to this version, patients were randomized to one of two different treatment groups (XELOX or FOLFOX-4). In May of 2003, the results of a large phase III trial showed that bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan plus bolus 5-FU/LV (IFL) as first line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, was significantly superior in terms of OS, progression free survival and rate of best response compared to IFL chemotherapy alone (see also MA status of Avastin). Consequently, on 04 August 2003 the protocol was amended to version B. In this amendment, bevacizumab or placebo was added to the chemotherapeutic regimens being studied. This changed the design to a four-arm, partially blinded study which included an additional comparison between bevacizumab and placebo. During this subsequent 2x2 factorial part additional patients were randomized into one of the four treatment groups XELOX+P (XELOX + placebo),  FOLFOX-4+P (FOLFOX-4 + placebo), XELOX+BV (XELOX + bevacizumab), or FOLFOX-4+BV (FOLFOX4+bevacizumab). Overall, trial NO16966 is a partially blinded (as regards to BV/placebo treatment and IRC assessment [see below], open as regards to the chemotherapy treatments), randomised, large,

international 6 , multi-centre 7 phase III trial investigating overall 6 treatments, 4 of them in terms of a 2x2 factorial design, in two subsequent parts.

Starting with protocol version B, the co-primary objectives of trial NO16966 were:

- To demonstrate that the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) with or without bevacizumab (BV) is at least equivalent to the combination of fluorouracil and folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) with or without BV in terms of time to tumour progression or death due to any cause.
- To demonstrate that BV in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX+BV/FOLFOX-4+BV) is superior to chemotherapy alone (XELOX+P/FOLFOX-4+P) in terms of time to tumour progression or death due to any cause.

Secondary objectives were:

- To evaluate and compare the efficacy (OS, overall response rate according to the RECIST criteria, time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment failure) of XELOX with or without BV to the combination of FOLFOX-4 with or without BV.
- To evaluate and compare the efficacy (OS, overall response rate according to the RECIST criteria, time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment failure) of BV plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone (XELOX+BV, FOLFOX-4+BV) to (XELOX+P, FOLFOX-4+P).
- To evaluate and compare the safety profiles of the four treatment groups using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
- To evaluate and compare perceived treatment convenience and satisfaction with treatment for patients who received XELOX with or without BV to patients who received FOLFOX-4 with or without BV.
- To evaluate and compare medical care utilization in the four treatment groups.
- To collect pathological specimens of the patients' tumours in a prospective fashion for studies of diagnostic biomarkers that may be relevant to fluoropyrimidine metabolism [ie, thymidine phosphorylase (TP), thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)] and oxaliplatin (chemopredictive project).
- At selected centres, to enroll patients participating in NO16966 into a stand-alone study NP18587 (PK-1; see above).
- At selected centres, to enroll patients participating in this study into sub-study NO16966 PK2. The sub-study was designed to compare the exposure of two different dosing regimens of bevacizumab, 7.5 mg/kg every 3rd week and 5 mg/kg every 2nd week, at steady state. Due to low recruitment, this sub-study was transferred to stand-alone study NP18587.
- To offer patients participating in the study the possibility to also participate in the independent sub-study NO16966RG. This sub-study was designed to derive pharmacogenetic information to facilitate research regarding prediction of response to specific drug therapy, susceptibility to develop adverse effects, progression to more severe disease or identifying genetic risk factors for disease.

The rationale for the XELOX (+/- Placebo; +/- BV) schedule investigated (1000 mg/m 2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days if combined with 130 mg/m 2 Oxaliplatin on day 1 in an every 3 week treatment cycle) is directly based on the results of phase I and II trials M66009 and M66016. The rationale for the FOLFOX (+/- Placebo; +/- BV) schedule investigated is the MA status of Eloxatin (oxaliplatin), or better, the schedule investigated with trial EFC 2962 8 (i.e. 85 mg/m 2 Oxaliplatin 2-hr IV Day 1 every 2

weeks, FA 200 mg/m 2 2-hr  IV followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m 2 IV  bolus 5-FU 600 mg/m 2 22-hr CIV Day 1 and 2 every 2 weeks vs. the de Gramont 9, 10 schedule).

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  typical  for  a  trial  selecting  for  an  adult,  non  pregnant  first  line population of patients with histologically confirmed metastatic adeno-carcinoma of colon or rectum at otherwise good health. It may be mentioned that the switch from protocol version A to B introduced additional exclusion criteria taking into account contraindications and warnings for Avastin (such as e.g. wound healing complications or haemorrhage).

After screening, patients were randomized in the first part to Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin (XELOX, arm A'), 5-FU/ Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, arm B'), and in the second part in a 2x2 factorial manner to overall 4 arms (XELOX+P, arm A; FOLFOX+P, arm B; XELOX+BV, arm C; and FOLFOX+BV, arm D). The process was adaptive randomization, with stratification. This process of randomization (including stratification) was employed to ensure that the two treatment arms were balanced with regard to the following  prognostic  factors:  overall  study,  ECOG  Performance  Status  (0  versus  1),  number  of metastatic  sites  (organs)  at  baseline  (1  versus  &gt;1),  alkaline  phosphatase  level  at  baseline  (within normal range versus above normal range), liver as a site of metastasis (yes versus no), and geographic region.

The trial (in both parts) comprised three phases:

Patients were to receive up to 16 cycles (arms A', A and C) or 24 cycles (arms B', B and D) of treatment during the Primary Study Treatment Phase (each 48 weeks). Actual duration of treatment depended on individual response and tolerance. If one of the treatment combination components was discontinued due to toxicity or patient refusal, treatment could be continued with the remaining treatment(s).

Patients who completed the 48-week primary study treatment phase without progressive disease (ie, who had a CR, PR, or SD) were eligible to enter the Post-Study Treatment Phase at the discretion of the investigator and the sponsor. Patients who entered this phase were to continue treatment on the same regimen to which they were initially randomized (including any dose modifications implemented during the primary study treatment phase) until either progression of disease was documented, unacceptable toxicity occurred, or patient withdrew consent to continue in the study. Patients who terminated study treatment during the primary or post-study treatment phase were followed until disease progression or death (Follow-up Phase).

An overview of the different schedules in the overall 6 different treatment arms is provided with some more details in Figure 1 and Figure 2 whereas the rational for dose selection was already presented.

10 Please note that the de Gramont Schedule is administered every 2 weeks . The recommended dose for Oxaliplatin is 130 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks . For administering Oxaliplatin in addition to the de Gramont schedule, single Oxaliplatin was already reduced for the means of trial EFC 2962 from 130 mg/m2 every 3 weeks to 85 mg/m 2 in order to achieve a comparable cumulative dose/exposure.

The primary efficacy parameter was PFS based on investigators' tumour assessments. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first day of documented disease progression or death due to any cause.

## Secondary efficacy parameters included:

- PFS for superiority of XELOX over FOLFOX-4
- PFS for tumour assessments by the IRC
- PFS (on treatment approach)
- PFS for Curative Surgery not censored
- Overall Survival
- Overall Rate of Best Response
- Overall Rate of Best Response (IRC)
- Time to Response
- Duration of Response
- Duration of Complete Response
- Time to Treatment Failure
- Time to Treatment Failure (on treatment approach)

The independent response review was based on the RECIST criteria for response and was undertaken by an independent response review committee (IRC). Patients were reviewed in a blinded fashion. The independent response review was strictly a radiological review, based solely on the scans.

## Non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX-4

All analyses of non-inferiority were based on the EPP 11 . Key analyses were repeated for the ITT 12 and PPP 13 .  At least equivalence of XELOX with/without bevacizumab to FOLFOX-4 with/without bevacizumab was tested via the following hypotheses: H0: HRA'AC/B'BD ≥ 1.23 versus H1: HRA'AC/B'BD &lt; 1.23.

Where, HRA'AC/B'BD denoted the HR of XELOX with/without bevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 with/without bevacizumab. At least equivalence was concluded if the upper limit of the two sided 97.5% confidence interval for the HR did not exceed 1.23.

The analysis was stratified using the following three strata:

Stratum 1:

Patients randomized during the initial 2-arm part of the study (arms A' and B');

Stratum 2:

Patients randomized during the 2x2 factorial part of the study to arms A or B (arms with placebo treatment);

11 Eligible Patient Population: excluded patients from the ITT who had violated major protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria

12 Intent-to-treat Population: all randomized patients (=ALL) who provided written informed consent.

13 Per-Protocol Population: Subgroup of the EPP mainly excluding from the EPP those patients who did not start a prespecified number (3 of 4 dependent on the arm) of treatment cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stratum 3: Patients randomized during the 2x2 factorial part of the study to arms C or D (arms with bevacizumab treatment).

In addition, Kaplan-Meier estimates, median times to tumour progression as well as progression-free rates at 6, 12, and 18 months with 95% confidence intervals are reported separately for the pool of all patients treated with XELOX and all patients treated with FOLFOX-4. The interpretation of this analysis (one combined median time for two different treatments), however, might be difficult and therefore these results were also reported separately for the four treatment groups A/A', B/B', C, and D.

For the assessment of non-inferiority in the different treatment subgroups, two separate analyses were performed:

- Based on all patients who were randomized to the initial 2-arm part of the study or to the placebo containing treatment arms of the 2x2 factorial part of the study (arms A', A, B' and B)
- Based on all patients who were randomized to the bevacizumab-containing treatment arms of the 2x2 factorial part of the study (arms C and D)

## Results

A total of 2035 patients from 32 countries were randomized to any one of the treatment groups in study NO16966 (634 patients in the initial 2-arm part and 1401 in the 2x2 factorial part of the study). In the initial 2-arm part of the study, the first patient was randomized on July 15, 2003 and the last patient was randomized on May 7, 2004. In the 2x2 factorial part of the study, the first patient was randomized on February 4, 2004 and the last patient was randomized on February 10, 2005. As switch from protocol version A to B was performed centre by centre, last and first randomisation dates are overlapping.

Thirty-seven randomised patients received no study medication. One patient was randomised twice into the study at a different study centre each time.

Table 2 provides a summary of patient disposition at the time of clinical cut-off in the ITT population (January 31, 2006).

Demographic data were well balanced. There are small differences concerning demographic differences between the initial 2-arm and the 2x2 factorial part of the study as follows:

- The proportion of Caucasian patients that enrolled in the 2x2 factorial part was higher compared to the initial 2-arm part because centres in China did not participate in the 2x2 factorial part of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- An increase of approximately 10% was observed in the percentages of patients with an ECOG PS of 0 in the 2x2 factorial compared with patients in the initial 2-arm part of the study.

Concerning stratification factors and as adaptive randomisation with stratification was performed) distribution of patients in the different levels of each stratum was well balanced across the treatment groups.

A similar percentage of XELOX and FOLFOX-4- treated patients (ITT) from the initial 2-arm part were withdrawn prematurely from treatment (93% and 95%, respectively) and withdrawn prematurely from treatment for safety related reasons (36% and 32% respectively). The percentage of patients withdrawn for non-safety reasons was 64% in the FOLFOX-4 and 57% in the XELOX arm. The major reason for premature withdrawal was insufficient therapeutic response (i.e., disease progression documented during the treatment phase of the study); the percentage of patients was similar in the XELOX treatment arm 131/317 (41%) and the FOLFOX-4 treatment arm 127/317 (40%).

Adding the2x2 factorial part, the majority of patients overall withdrew from study treatment (all treatment components) due to non-safety reasons (1222/2034 patients, 60%), mostly for insufficient therapeutic response. The proportion of patients who withdrew due to disease progression was lower for patients who had bevacizumab in their treatment regimen (203/699, 29%) compared with those who did not (587/1335, 44%). Safety reasons were the cause of withdrawal from all treatment components in the primary study treatment phase for a total of 589/2034 (29%) patients. In the initial 2-arm part, approximately 30% of the patients experienced an AE leading to withdrawal. In the 2x2 factorial part, 20% of patients in the control arm and approximately 30% in the BV containing arms reported AE as a reason for withdrawal.

## Results: Primary Endpoints

## Primary Endpoint (PFS): non-inferiority Results

The first co-primary objective (non-inferiority in PFS in the EPP, investigators' assessment ) was met (see Table 3).

Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in the overall comparison was demonstrated. The upper limit of the 97.5% CI was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.23. Kaplan-Meier curves are virtually super-imposable (see Figure 3).

Any statistically significant or clinically relevant interaction between BV and the chemotherapy backbone was ruled out justifying, according to the applicant, the pooling of the treatment subgroups in the primary analysis.

Results were similar in the ITT population and in the PPP.

Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the treatment subgroup comparison of XELOX/XELOX+P versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P. The same applies on the exploratory subgroup comparison of XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV. Non-inferiority was further supported by the results of the exploratory subgroup comparison of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 from the initial 2-arm part of the protocol.

However, results for PFS according to IRC assessment were not supportive for the non-inferiority analysis (table 4) In the overall comparison, the HR was 1.22 (97.5% CI = [1.05; 1.42]).

Subgroup analyses reveal similar results: In the treatment subgroup comparison of XELOX / XELOX + P versus FOLFOX-4 / FOLFOX-4 + P, HR was 1.25 (97.5% CI = [1.04; 1.50]). In the exploratory subgroup comparison of XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV, HR was 1.17 (97.5% CI= [0.90; 1.53]).

Results of the analysis for non-inferiority (EPP) for PFS using the on-treatment approach were not supportive for the non-inferiority analysis. In the overall comparison, the HR was 1.24 (97.5% CI = [1.07; 1.44]). Similar results were seen in the treatment subgroup comparison for XELOX/XELOX+P versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P (HR=1.22, 97.5% CI = [1.03; 1.45]) and in treatment subgroup comparison XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV (HR=1.29. 97.5% CI = [0.97; 1.71]).

Results were similar in the ITT population and in the PPP.

## Results: Secondary Endpoints

PFS for superiority of XELOX over FOLFOX-4 (not significant), PFS for tumour assessments by the IRC, PFS (on treatment approach) and PFS for Curative Surgery not censored were pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints of trial NO169662. As these endpoints have already been discussed in context and in relation to the primary endpoints (in the sense of sensitivity analysis of the primary), they are not displayed here again.

## Overall Survival OS: Non-Inferiority of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4

Trial NO16966 was not powered for testing non-inferiority of XELOX vs. FOLFOX-4 with respect to overall survival. The same margins used for the PFS analysis were therefore applied to OS as well. The analysis of non-inferiority in the EPP in terms of OS was supportive of the results obtained in the primary analysis of non-inferiority for PFS. For the overall comparison, HR was 0.97 (97.5% CI =

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[0.84; 1.14]; see also Table 3). The result was rather robust in subgroup analysis. The MAH did also demonstrate that the results are relatively mature. It should be noted that by trend OS for XELOX is slightly longer than for FOLFOX once median (of about 18 months) is reached (see also Figure 4).

OS: Superiority of Chemotherapy plus BV over Chemotherapy Alone

<!-- image -->

The MAH considers the result concerning the second, blinded part of the trial as still to immature to draw any reliable conclusion. Therefore, he presented the data without any further comment. The most relevant result at time point of cut-off may be briefly presented here:

In the ITT population the number of events in the FOLFOX-4+P/XELOX+P was 252 and 228 in the FOLFOX-4+BV/XELOX+BV arm. Median time to event (death) was 574 and 551 days respectively, resulting in a HR of 0.89 (97.5%CI [0.72; 1.09], p= 0.1921). Only this result is displayed also graphically as a Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 5.

## Rate of Best Overall Response (BOR), investigators' assessment

## Tumour Response (Investigators' Assessments): Non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX-4

The criteria for non-inferiority were met in the EPP for the overall comparison of FOLFOX4/FOLFOX-4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV versus XELOX/XELOX+P/XELOX+BV. For the overall comparison in the EPP the BOR was 46.3% vs. 45.5% (HR=0.89, 97.5% CI = [0.72; 1.09]). According to the applicant, the non-inferiority criteria was consistently met also in other analysis populations (ITT, PPP), and subgroup comparisons.

For the overall comparison in the EPP, time to response was similar between arms, with the majority of responses (approximately 70%) occurring after week 6 and prior to week 18. Duration of response was 239 days in 347 patients responding to FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV and 226 days in 326 patients responding to XELOX / XELOX + P / XELOX +BV (Hazard ratio=1.02 [0.86;1.22], EPP).

In the EPP population for non-inferiority, duration of complete response could be assessed for only 14 patients in the comparison of XELOX/XELOX+P/XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4/FOLFOX4+P/FOLFOX-4+BV, 12 patients in the comparison of XELOX/XELOX+P versus FOLFOX4/FOLFOX-4+P, and 2 patients in the comparison of XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX-4+BV. It was not possible to draw any conclusions from these limited data.

## BOR (IRC): Non-inferiority of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4

Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms (BOR 37.1%) compared with the FOLFOX-4containing arms (BOR 38.6%) with respect to BOR as assessed by the IRC was demonstrated in the overall comparison (OR=0.94, 97.5% CI = [0.76; 1.16]) and treatment subgroup comparison.

## TTF: Non-inferiority of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4

The results of the analyses for time to treatment failure were supportive of the results from the main analysis which demonstrated non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX-4 in regards to PFS. For the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overall comparison in the EPP using the general approach, the TTF was 191 days for FOLFOX arms and 179 days for XELOX arms respectively (HR=1.08; 97.5% CI = [0.97; 1.20]).

## Additional Anti-cancer Treatment Taken after Discontinuation of Study Treatment

There were no major imbalances between XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, XELOX+P versus FOLFOX+P, and XELOX+BV versus FOLFOX+BV concerning the proportion of patients receiving second-line chemotherapy after disease progression. More patients in the placebo-containing arms received second-line chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab-containing arms. The most common therapy given as second-line treatment was Irinotecan; the second most frequent agent was 5-FU.

- Irinotecan 33% to 47%
- 5-FU 22% to 33%
- Capecitabine 5% to 16%
- Cetuximab 8% to 13%
- Bevacizumab 2% to 8%

Radiotherapy was administered in 7% to 13% of the patients.

## Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the internal consistency of the study and the robustness of the findings for the efficacy endpoints of PFS, OS, and BOR. Three categories of subgroups were used for the non-inferiority comparisons and for the superiority comparisons:

- Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
- Stratification Variables used for Randomization
- Geographic Region

Overall, the subgroup analyses confirmed result as regards to the primary non-inferiority as well as primary superiority analysis concerning PFS, OS, and BOR.

## 1. 3. Clinical Safety

Safety is discussed by using the safety population and overall 3 comparisons:

- A pooled XELOX/FOLFOX-4 comparison: pooled safety data from the XELOX arm of the initial 2-arm part of the study and the XELOX+P arm of the 2x2 factorial part of the study versus the pooled safety data from the FOLFOX-4 arm of the initial 2-arm part of the study and the FOLFOX-4+P arm of the 2x2factorial part of the study.
- The chemotherapy + bevacizumab (BV) comparisons:
- o The chemotherapy + BV / chemotherapy + P comparison
- o The 4-arm comparison: the 4 arms of the 2x2 factorial part of the study (XELOX+P, FOLFOX-4+P, FOLFOX-4+BV and XELOX+BV).

Unless otherwise specified, the safety analysis refers to events occurring during the primary treatment phase.

## Exposure to study treatment

Exposure to study treatment in the primary treatment phase was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 group.

A similar proportion of patients in each treatment group completed the 48 weeks of treatment, 9% in the pooled XELOX group and 7% in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group. The median number of cycles during the primary study treatment phase was 7 (21 weeks) in the pooled XELOX group and 11 (22 weeks) in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group; the median duration in days was 162 days in the pooled XELOX group and170 days in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group. Only a small proportion of patients in each group continued into the post-study treatment phase (approximately 5%). The median cumulative doses of bolus 5-FU and 5-FU infusion were 14,100.0 mg and 22,025.0 mg, respectively. The median cumulative dose of capecitabine was 323,150.0 mg. Median Oxaliplatin cumulative doses were similar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between pooled treatment groups. As shown in Table 5, relative dose intensity of all components decreased over time, but decreased comparably in both arms.

The percentage of patients who modified their treatment doses was higher in the FOLFOX-4 groups (34.8%) than in the XELOX groups (29.1%). It should be taken into consideration that the cycle length of XELOX and FOLFOX-4 were different (3 weeks XELOX and 2 weeks FOLFOX). Of note, the applicant performed an analysis of the relationship of dose-modifications and efficacy showing both for 5-FU and capecitabine that patients without dose-modifications had the shortest PFS. The applicant concludes that dose-modifications do not affect, at least negatively, efficacy.

The analysis of exposure in the chemotherapy + BV vs. chemotherapy + P comparisons revealed nothing significant else than the following:

The median cumulative doses of the FOLFOX-4 treatment components (5-FU bolus, 5-FU infusion, folinic acid, and Oxaliplatin) and the XELOX treatment components (Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin) were both higher in the BV groups compared with their corresponding placebo groups. Doses of BV were similar between the FOLFOX-4+BV and XELOX+BV groups. However, the median relative dose intensities of the treatment components were similar between each BV arm and its corresponding placebo arm.

## Pooled XELOX/FOLFOX-4 Comparison

Overall, tolerability was similar in both treatment groups, with a similar incidence of AEs, SAEs, and withdrawals due to AEs. The following key findings were observed:

- The incidence of grade 4 AEs was lower in the in the XELOX group compared to the FOLFOX-4 group (12.4% vs. 24.8%), a difference driven primarily by haematological events.
- The incidence of all haematological AEs (47.6% vs. 69.2%), grade 3/4 haematological AEs (15.9% vs. 49.3%), and grade 4 haematological AEs (2.1% vs. 19.1%) were lower in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 27.5% of patients in the pooled XELOX group compared with 58.6% of patients in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group, and grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 7.0% of patients in the pooled XELOX group compared with 43.8% of patients in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group.
- o Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.9% of patients in the pooled XELOX group compared with 4.8% of patients in the pooled FOLFOX-4 group.
- Consistent with this, infections were less common in the XELOX group: all grade (32.2% vs 45%) and grade 3/4 (7% vs. 10.5%).
- Thrombocytopenia (laboratory grade 3/4 abnormalities) was more common in the XELOX group (8.2% vs. 4.3%).
- The incidence of grade 3/4 increased bilirubin was higher in the XELOX group (3.7% vs 1.2%); however, this was not accompanied by increased ALAT or ASAT.
- The incidence of neurosensory toxicity was similar between the FOLFOX-4 and XELOX groups for all AEs and grade 3/4 AEs.
- All grade and grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic AEs were lower in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group (8.1% vs. 12.9% and 3.8% vs. 6.3%).
- Cardiac AEs had a lower incidence in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group (all grades: 4.1% vs. 6.2%, grade 3/4: 0.9% vs. 1.4%).
- Overall, grade 3/4 gastrointestinal disorders were more common in the XELOX group (32.7% vs. 25.4%), mainly due to diarrhoea (20.2% vs. 11.2%)
- Stomatitis was lower in the XELOX group (21.4% vs. 37.3%), as was grade 3/4 stomatitis (1.2% vs. 2.0%).
- All grade PPE was higher in the XELOX group (30.2%) compared to the FOLFOX-4 group (10.2%), as was grade 3 PPE (6.1% vs. 1.2%).

Deaths within 28 days of last dose of study medication were higher in the XELOX group (5.6% vs. 3.1%), as were deaths within 28 days of the last dose of study medication that were not due to progressive disease (4.4% vs. 2.8%); the percentage of all related deaths and related deaths within 28 days of the last dose of study medication was similar between treatment groups (2.4% vs. 2.2% and 2.1% vs. 1.7%).

## Chemotherapy + BV / Chemotherapy + P Comparisons

Overall, tolerability was roughly comparable in both treatment groups. The following key findings were observed:

- The incidence of grade 3/4 AEs was higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms than in the chemotherapy + P arms (80.0% vs. 74.8%).
- AEs of special interest to chemotherapy, as predefined in the protocol, were seen in a similar proportion of patients in the chemotherapy +BV and chemotherapy + P arms, with the following exceptions:
- o The incidence of PPE was increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms (grade 3: 7.1% vs. 3.4%), essentially in the XELOX arms only.
- o The incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms (grade 3/4: 32.4% vs. 27.1%), due to higher incidences in a number of different events (e.g., diarrhoea, vomiting, and stomatitis) in the BV groups.
- o The incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac events (including cardiac arterial thromboembolic events) was increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared with the chemotherapy + P arms (all grades: 7.8% vs. 5.2%; grade 3/4: 3.5% vs. 0.4%, respectively). The increase was seen in both treatment subgroups (FOLFOX-4 2.9% vs. 0.3%; XELOX 4.0% vs. 0.6%, respectively).
- The incidences of AEs of special interest defined for BV were the following:
- o The incidence of bleeding (all grades of various types) was higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared with chemotherapy + P (30.5% vs. 25.9%); the majority of events were grade 1/2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Thromboembolic events were increased in the chemotherapy + BV arms vs. the chemotherapy + P arms, respectively:
-  Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events: 12 patients (1.7%) vs. 7 (1.0%).
-  Grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events: 54 patients (7.8%) vs. 33 (4.9%).
- o Hypertension was higher in the chemotherapy + BV arms compared with chemotherapy + P (grade 3/4: 3.7% vs. 1.2%, respectively).
- o Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal perforations, proteinuria, and wound healing complications were all uncommon.
- A higher proportion of patients were discontinued from study treatment for AEs in the BV treatment arms (approximately 31% vs. 21%) mainly due to chemotherapy related toxicity; 21% of the patients in the BV treatment arms versus 15% in the placebo arms discontinued therapy due to grade 3/4 AEs. 5% of the patients in the BV treatment arms and 2% in the placebo arms had the study treatment discontinued due to AEs of special interest to BV.

Thirty (4.3%) patients in the chemotherapy + BV arms and 15 (2.2%) patients in the chemotherapy + P arms died due to causes other than PD. The incidence of treatment-related deaths was similar in the chemotherapy + BV arms and chemotherapy + P arms (2.0% [14 patients] and 1.5% [10 patients], respectively).

The 4 arm comparison did not reveal a safety pattern different from the chemotherapy + BV vs. chemotherapy + P comparisons.

Methods

The design of trial NO16967 is essentially similar to the first part of trial NO169662. I.e., trial NO16967 is a randomised controlled, open label phase III trial comparing XELOX and FOLFOX (without co-administration of placebo or Bevacizumab). The following are the relevant differences compared to the design of trial NO169662:

- a) Trial NO16967 is a trial in a second line population. An inclusion criterion was explicitly patients with inoperable mCRC, who had failed prior treatment with Irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimide regimen as first-line therapy for their metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This criteria was further specified as follows:

Patients whose disease had recurred or progressed during or within 6 months of completion of first-line therapy with the combination of Irinotecan and 5-FU/LV, or patients who stopped first-line irinotecan/5-FU/LV combination therapy due to excessive toxicity within the first 8 weeks, as judged by the treating physician. First line irinotecan + 5-FU/LV included the following:

- Irinotecan + 5-FU/LV
- Irinotecan + 5-FU (if infusional 5-FU)
- Irinotecan + 5-FU/LV + concomitant (not sequential) targeted biological agent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- b) Primary treatment phase was limited to 24 weeks (in place of 48 weeks), or 8 cycles (arm A = XELOX) and 12 cycles (arm B = FOLFOX), respectively.
- c) At least equivalence of arm A to arm B was concluded if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the hazard ratio did not exceed 1.30. In trial NO169662 the upper limit was 1.25, and the CI considered was the 97.5% CI.
- d) An additional eligible population (EPP) was not defined. The definition of the PPP of trial NO169662 resembles that of trial NO16967.

## Results

A total of 627 patients from 87 centres in 19 countries were enrolled into study NO16967, 313 and 314 to the XELODA and FOLFOX arm, respectively. Also centres and countries are similar to trial NO169662, i.e. trial NO16967 is a multi-centre, international trial. Distribution of patients was well balanced as regards to the stratification (see Table 6), demographic baseline (see Table 7) as well as tumour (data not shown) factors.

During the primary treatment phase, a similar percentage of XELOX- and FOLFOX-4-treated patients were withdrawn (68% and 69%, respectively, see Table 8).

- 23% of XELOX patients and 16% of FOLFOX-4 patients withdrew for safety reasons. The difference in rate was due primarily to withdrawals for adverse events,(64 patients in the XELOX group vs. 42 patients in the FOLFOX-4 group).
- 45% of patients in the XELOX treatment group and 54% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 treatment group withdrew for non-safety reasons. The difference in rate was due primarily to withdrawals for insufficient therapeutic response, i.e., disease progression (143 patients in the FOLFOX-4 group vs. 117 patients in the XELOX group).

## Results: Primary Endpoint: non-inferiority PFS

The primary objective of this study was met. Non-inferiority of XELOX compared with FOLFOX-4 in terms of PFS in the PPP was demonstrated with a HR of 1.03 and a 95% CI ranging from 0.87 to 1.24 (Table 9). The upper limit of the 95% CI was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.30. Super-imposable Kaplan-Meier curves (see Figure 6) supported non-inferiority. Results in the ITT population were consistent with those in the PPP. A non-inferiority analysis using tumour assessments by the IRC was supportive of the primary non-inferiority analysis (HR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.17 in the PPP).

Analyses of PFS using the on-treatment approach provided the following results: HR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47 in the PPP; HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37 in the ITT population.

## Results: Secondary Endpoints Overall Survival (OS)

Although the study was not designed to demonstrate non-inferior OS, the result are at least supportive for such a conclusion: For the PPP, the HR was 1.07 and the 95% CI was 0.88 to 1.31 (Table 35). The HR for death (XELOX vs FOLFOX-4) in the ITT population was 1.03, and the 95% CI was 0.87 to 1.23.

## Best Overall Response

## Investigators' Assessments.

In the PPP, best overall response based on investigators' assessments was similar for the 2 treatment groups (FOLFOX-4 = 20.2%, XELOX = 23.1%). As in the PPP, best overall response in the ITT was similar for the 2 treatment groups (FOLFOX-4 = 17.5%, XELOX = 20.1%) although slightly smaller compared to the PPP.

## IRC's assessment

In the PPP, the best overall response by IRC assessment was similar for the 2 treatment groups (FOLFOX-4 = 13.9%, XELOX = 17.5%). As in the PPP, results were similar for the 2 treatment groups (FOLFOX-4 = 12.4%, XELOX = 15.3%) in the ITT population.

## Time to Response

Time to response was similar for the 2 treatment groups, with most of the responses (over 70%) occurring after week 6 and prior to week 19.

## Duration of Response

Because of the small numbers of responses, duration of response was not analyzed in the PPP. Duration of response ranged widely and tended to be shorter in the XELOX group (169 days) than in the FOLFOX-4 group (190 days).

## Time to Treatment Failure

The 2 treatment groups were similar in time to treatment failure: 122 and 125 days for FOLFOX and XELOX respectively.

## Safety

In trial NO16967 treatment duration was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 groups: The median number of cycles during the primary study treatment phase was 6 (18 weeks) in the XELOX group and 8.5 (17 weeks) in the FOLFOX-4 group; the median duration in days was 120 days in the XELOX group and 119 days in the FOLFOX-4 group. The median cumulative doses of bolus 5-FU and 5-FU infusion were 10449.0 mg and 15917.0 mg, respectively. The median cumulative dose of capecitabine was 238000.0 mg. Median oxaliplatin cumulative doses were similar between treatment groups (1133.7 and 1160.4 mg respectively). The median total (cumulative) dose intensity of each treatment component was high, close to 100%, indicating that patients staying on treatment generally

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received the planned doses, with few or no dose reductions. Of note, the applicant analysed the effect of dose modification on efficacy in terms of PFS in patients who modified their capecitabine or 5-FU doses through dose interruptions, dose reductions and dose delays compared to those who did not modify their doses was performed. The analysis of the impact of dose modification on efficacy shows that dose modifications are not associated with decreased efficacy with respect to PFS (rather, the contrary effect might be seen, i.e., PFS is slightly longer in patients with dose modifications compared to patients without).

Overall, tolerability was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 treatment groups. The key findings are as follows:

- There was a similar incidence of adverse events (related and all), serious adverse events (related and all), withdrawals during the primary treatment phase, and deaths (related, all, up to 28 days after last dose, and within 60 days of treatment start).
- o Deaths up to 28 days after the last dose of study medication that were not due to disease progression were slightly higher in the FOLFOX-4 group (2.9% vs. 1.3%)
- o Withdrawals due to adverse events in the primary treatment phase were higher in the XELOX treatment group (20.6% vs. 13.6%)
- A lower incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in the XELOX group compared to the FOLFOX-4 group (60.1% vs. 72.4%). The incidence of grade 4 events was also lower in the XELOX group compared to the FOLFOX-4 group (4.8% vs. 22.7%).
- The incidence of all haematological adverse events (30.5% vs. 57.1%), grade 3/4 haematological adverse events (10.0% vs. 40.6%), and grade 4 haematological adverse events (1.3% vs. 15.3%) were lower in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group.
- o Neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 18.0% of patients in the XELOX group compared with 48.4% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 group, and grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia occurred in 4.5% of patients in the XELOX group compared with 35.1% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 group.
- o Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.3% of patients in the XELOX group compared with 3.6% of patients in the FOLFOX-4 group.
- Infections were less common in the XELOX group: all grade (22.8% vs 33.8%) and grade 3/4 (4.2% vs. 6.2%).
- All grade and grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic adverse events were slightly lower in the XELOX group compared with the FOLFOX-4 group (4.2% vs. 7.5% and 1.9% vs. 4.2%), while arterial thromboembolic events were similar between the 2 groups (all grade: 1.6% XELOX, 0.6% FOLFOX-4; grade 3/4: 1.0% XELOX, 0.3% FOLFOX-4)
- Cardiac adverse events had a lower incidence in the FOLFOX-4 group compared with the XELOX group (2.6% vs. 4.2%), but the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac events was the same in each treatment group (0.6%).
- Overall, grade 3/4 gastrointestinal disorders were more common in the XELOX group (32.8% vs. 19.8%), mainly due to grade 3/4 diarrhoea (19.9% vs. 4.9%). All grade diarrhoea was also more common in the XELOX treatment group (56.9% vs. 48.7%).
- Stomatitis was lower in the XELOX group (13.5% vs. 30.2%).
- The incidence of neurosensory toxicity was similar between the XELOX and FOLFOX-4 groups for all grade (71.4% vs. 73.1%, respectively) and grade 3/4 adverse events (8.7% vs. 8.4%, respectively).
- All grade PPE was higher in the XELOX group (22.5%) compared to the FOLFOX-4 group (5.8%), as was grade 3 PPE (3.5% vs. 0.6%).
- Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities:
- o Low WBC was more common in the FOLFOX-4 group compared with the XELOX group (15.6% vs. 0.6%), as was low neutrophil count (39.6% vs. 5.5%).
- o The incidence of increased bilirubin was low and similar between the treatment groups (2.6% XELOX and 1.9% FOLFOX-4), as were increased ALAT (0.6% XELOX and 0.3% FOLFOX-4) and increased ASAT (1.0% XELOX and 0.6% FOLFOX-4).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following the Positive Opinion for Advanced Gastric Cancer on 22 February 2007, Roche committed to  provide  by  end  April  2007  a  proposed  analysis  plan  for  a  Meta-analysis  of  the  large  database represented  by  the  studies  that  are  currently  described  in  the  SPC  as  well  as  the  additional  studies (NO16966; NO16967; NO16968) for factors causing Hand Foot Syndrome (HFS) and other  major [S]AEs, and for correlation of these [S]AEs with efficacy . It was agreed in this time that the results of the  meta-analysis,  including  studies  NO16966  and  NO16967  would  need  to  be  submitted  with Responses to Request for Supplementary Information for mCRC Type II Variation Application. This  commitment  was  enforced  and  further  précised  within  a  pre-submission  meeting  with  the Rapporteur on March 2, 2007.

For safety data, a pooled analysis of trials NO16966 and NO16967 is available.

## 3.3 Overall discussion on Clinical safety

As presented, the safety data for XELOX (+/-BV) do no suggest a safety profile relevantly different from FOLFOX  (+/-BV) else than the known differences between capecitabine and 5-FU monotherapeutic safety profiles. Clinical safety of FOLFOX is well established, and exchange of 5-FU by capecitabine does not add any relevant safety problem. The differences in patterns can be described that the myelotoxicity of FOLFOX is replaced by diarrhoea, and PPE by XELOX. The neurotoxicity of Oxaliplatin is unaffected by this exchange.

For  a  more  specific  summary  of  safety  of  XELOX  (and  capecitabine)  the  result  of  the  already announced meta-analysis should be awaited.

No specific risk management actions are planned for this indication. This is based upon the fact that the safety profile exhibited during the clinical trials covered by this application does not differ in any way from the well-established safety profile of capecitabine in CRC. A summary of the known identified safety concerns, along with the PhV proposed activities and proposed risk minimization activities is provided in the table below:

## 1. 4. OVERALL CONCLUSION AND Benefit-risk assessment

Results of trials NO169662 and NO16967, investigating the same schedule in the same tumour at first and second-line treatment, are rather consistent as regards to efficacy and safety. Prognosis/efficacy in terms of OS, PPS, and BOR differ as expected. As both trials (at least the first part of trial NO169662) could have been performed also as a single but stratified (according to the line of treatment), there is no objection against a combined analysis of both trials.

In terms of efficacy, XELOX proved to be non-inferior to FOLFOX both in a first and a second line population. The sensitivity analyses did not consistently endorse the robustness of this conclusion in the first line population in terms of the primary endpoint PFS. In both pivotal Phase III trials NO16966 and  NO16967  non-inferiority  in  terms  of  PFS  (primary)  and  OS  (secondary  endpoint)  has  been demonstrated. e.g., in the (by the CHMP requested ) pooled analysis of both trials HR and 95%-CI for PFS and OS (PPP, surgery not censored) were 1.00 [0.88; 1.14] and 1.01 [0.87; 1.17].

The CHMP discussed concerns related to  incongruent result of investigators and IRC assessment in terms  of  PFS  in  966.  It  seems  that  IRC  but  not  investigators  assessment  likely  biased  -  as  already shown with the original submission by the MAH/applicant and with Responses to LoQ. Non-inferior OS supporting PFS assessment of investigators but not IRC!

There were more 'PFS' events on treatment with XELOX vs. FOLFOX in 966 and 967, however, since Xeloda is administered as an (oral) continuous 14 day schedule (but not 5-FU and Oxaliplatin, i.e. once every 3 weeks) this is an expected result and a phenomenon already observed in prior MAAtrials large 95%-CI in 966. HR, however, nearly precisely 1. At least in first line treatment the noninferiority  (which  has  been  demonstrated)  result  is  not  so  robust  to  further  sensitivity  analysis.  The CHMP    discussed  this  not  fully  convincing  robustness  insofar  as  this  is  the  first  time  that  oral capecitabine is not compared with bolus 5-FU, but (at least in part) with continuously infused 5-FU. In general, continuous 5-FU infusion is considered as more efficacious but less convenient than bolus 5FU.  The lack of robustness of the non-inferiority conclusion in comparisons with infusional 5-FU is addressed in section 5.1 of the SPC.

As  non-inferiority  of  capecitabine  and  5-FU  monotherapy  has  already  been  proven  in  the  same indication,  it  appears  that  5-FU  in  general  can  be  replaced  by  capecitabine  while  not  affecting  the efficacy profile but changing the safety pattern.

The  safety  profile  of  XELOX  is  different  from  FOLFOX.  It  is,  however,  overall  not  worse.  The overall higher frequency of grade III/IV AEs for FOLFOX should not be over-interpreted (in favour of XELOX)  as  they  were  mainly  due  to  haematological  AEs.  In  addition,  PPE  grade  is  higher  with XELOX.

In  a  combination  therapy  the  advantage  of  the  oral  administration  of  capecitabine  becomes  a  less relevant favourable aspect than in monotherapy as the combination partner is already administered i.v. In  conclusion  safety  of  XELOX  and  FOLFOX  overall  'similar/comparable'  although  with  some differences in the pattern. Overall, the risk-benefit relationship of capecitabine in mCRC is acceptable and  comparable  to  5-FU.  Therefore,  a  general  indication  of  Xeloda  'in  the  treatment  of  metastatic colorectal cancer' is supported.

The MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the local representations of Estonia and Finland in the Package Leaflet.

## II. CONCLUSION

On 13 December 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
