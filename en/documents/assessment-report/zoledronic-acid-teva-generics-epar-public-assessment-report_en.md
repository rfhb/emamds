## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Teva Generics B.V submitted on 7 June 2013 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zoledronic acid Teva Generics, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 - 'Generic of a Centrally authorised product'. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 18 October 2012.

The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product for which a Marketing Authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The applicant applied for the following indications: Treatment of osteoporosis · in post-menopausal women · in adult men at increased risk of fracture, including those with recent low-trauma hip fracture. Treatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy · in post-menopausal women · in adult men at increased risk of fracture. Treatment of Paget's disease of the bone in adults. The legal basis for this application refers to: Generic application (Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC).

## 1.3. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

The Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP was:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rapporteur: Bengt Ljungberg

- The application was received by the EMA on 7 June 2013.
- The procedure started on 26 June 2013.
- The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 13 September 2013.
- During the PRAC meeting on 10 October 2013, the PRAC adopted an RMP Advice.
- During the meeting on 24 October 2013, the CHMP agreed on the consolidated List of Questions to be sent to the applicant. The final consolidated List of Questions was sent to the applicant on 24 October 2013.
- The applicant submitted the responses to the CHMP consolidated List of Questions on 15 November 2013.

· The Rapporteur circulated the Assessment Report on the applicant's responses to the List of Questions to all CHMP members on 20 December 2013. · During the PRAC meeting on 08 January 2014, the PRAC adopted an RMP Advice. · During the meeting on 23 January 2014, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation to Zoledronic acid Teva Generics. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction Zoledronic Acid Teva Generics is a generic medicinal product containing the active substance zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). The reference medicinal product is Aclasta 5 mg solution for infusion. Both the qualitative and quantitative composition of the generic product is identical to the reference product. Both products are administered intravenously as an infusion. Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone. Zoledronic acid treatment rapidly reduces the rate of bone turnover. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The positive effect of zoledronic acid on various types of bone fractures, bone mineral density, bone histology, bone turnover markers, standing height and days of disability was demonstrated in patients with osteoporosis. In Paget's disease, bone of normal quality was found in responding patients after treatment with zoledronic acid.

The safety and efficacy profile of zoledronic acid has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR of the reference product Aclasta. In addition, there is long-term post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Aclasta, a summary of the clinical data of zoledronic acid has been provided and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted with Zoledronic acid Teva Generics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1), bioequivalence studies are not required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product. As this is the case with Zoledronic Acid Teva Generics, a bioequivalence study is not required.

The proposed indications are:

Treatment of osteoporosis

- in post-menopausal women
- in adult men

at increased risk of fracture including those with recent low-trauma hip fracture

Treatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy

## Manufacture

The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure.

The structure of zoledronic acid was confirmed by IR, MS, 13 C-NMR and  1 H-NMR.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

## Specification

As there is no monograph of zoledronic acid in the Ph. Eur., the applicant developed their own specifications and test methods for the quality control. Control tests include description, identity by FTIR and HPLC, assay and impurities by HPLC, residual solvents by GC, polymorphism by XRD, pH of the solution, heavy metals, loss on drying, microbial purity and endotoxins.

The acceptance criteria for impurities, including limits for organic impurities, inorganic impurities and residual solvents, are defined. The limits were evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. No genotoxic impurities were detected in the batches of the active substance. No solvents are carried over from early steps of the synthesis.

The limits set for specification parameters are acceptable and in line with batch results, stability studies and CHMP/ICH guidelines. Analytical methods used are sufficiently described and fully validated in line with the CHMP/ICH requirements.

Results of analysis of three batches of the active substance were provided. Compliance with the specification was demonstrated.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Stability

Stability data on 10 batches of the active substance up to 60 months of storage at 25 °C / 60% relative humidity (RH) and on 6 batches for 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH were provided. Compliance with specification has been confirmed at both conditions. Following parameters were tested during stability studies: description, identity, impurities and assay by HPLC, polymorphism by XRD, loss on drying and microbial purity. No negative trends were observed.

The stability data support the proposed retest period 60 months when stored in amber glass container with teflon liner and a white polypropylene cap as immediate packaging, inserted into an aluminium laminated bag.

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

## Pharmaceutical development

The aim of the development work was to develop a solution for infusion, equivalent to the reference medicinal product Aclasta.

Qualitative composition of the product is the same as composition of the reference product, with mannitol as a tonicity agent, sodium citrate as a buffering agent and water for injections as a solvent. All excipients are of compendial quality.

The formulation development focused on manufacturing conditions (effect of pH, oxygen and temperature sensitivity, order of addition of excipients), suitability of filters, sterilisation method, photostability, compatibility with the manufacturing equipment and compatibility with the primary packaging.

As the generic product is an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the reference product, a bioequivalence study is not required. The primary packaging is either a 100 ml multilayer polyolefin/styrene-ethylene-butylene (SEB) bag with SFC polypropylene infusion port closed with rubber stopper and snap cap or a 100 ml Cyclic Olefin Polymer (COP) plastic bottle, fitted with a chlorobutyl/butyl rubber stopper and aluminium cap fitted with violet plastic flip off disc. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Adventitious agents No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the finished product. Therefore, there is no risk of BSE/TSE transmission via this product. Manufacture of the product The manufacturing process of the finished product consists of 5 steps - preparation of the bulk solution, sterile filtration, end point filtration/filling, terminal sterilisation and inspection/packaging. The terminal sterilisation is done by autoclaving. The critical steps/parameters in the manufacturing process are environmental monitoring, bulk solution preparation, sterile filtration, end point filtration/filling and terminal sterilisation. Appropriate in-process controls are in place after each step. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Validation of the manufacturing process has been performed on commercial scale batches. Holding times at each manufacturing step were defined and validated. All results comply with specification.

## Product specification

The specification of the finished product includes standard testing parameters typical for this kind of dosage form. The finished product is tested for description, identification, clarity and colour of solution, visible and sub-visible particles, pH, osmolality, extractable volume, assay, related substances (any impurity, total impurities), sterility and bacterial endotoxins. A weight loss test is also introduced as the containers (plastic bottles and bags) are semi-permeable. The UPLC method

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

used for identification, assay and related substances has been appropriately validated. All other test methods except the weight loss test are compendial.

Possible degradation products were discussed. During the development, manufacture of validation batches and the 6-months stability period (accelerated, intermediate and long-term conditions) these impurities were not detected. The forced degradation study for the analytical method also supports the assumption that these impurities are not likely to be present in the drug product and therefore are not specified.

Batch analysis data for six batches were provided. All results comply with specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data on 2 commercial scale batches of finished product from the proposed manufacturer stored under long term conditions for up to 24 months at 25 ºC / 40% RH, for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 25% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Accelerated studies for plastic bags and bottles were performed at reduced relative humidity (25%) in order to assess possible weight loss due to use of semi-permeable containers. The batches of finished product were identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in both types of primary packaging proposed for marketing, as well as in glass vials. During the stability studies, increase in sub-visible particles was observed in the glass vials which were therefore withdrawn from the application. Samples were tested for appearance, clarity of solution, visible particles, colour of solution, osmolality, extractable volume, pH, assay, related substances, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and particulate contamination. Tests were performed according to the specification and using the analytical procedures presented in the dossier. In addition, a test for weight loss (NMT 5% of filling mass) was performed for the plastic vials and bags. For the finished product in plastic bags, all stability results complied with specification and no trends/changes were observed. For the plastic bottles however, an out of specification result after 24 months stored under long-term conditions was noted. Therefore, the shelf-life was reduced to 18 months, and the SmPC updated accordingly. This product is a duplicate of Zoledronic acid Teva Pharma EMEA/H/C/002437 for which stability studies were on-going. The company therefore provided a commitment to reduce its shelf-life from 24 to 18 months within 3 months of this opinion. Photostability testing was performed according to the relevant ICH/CHMP guideline. The studies demonstrate that the product is not light sensitive in either of the proposed packaging types. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

The in-use shelf-life, supported by a study, is 24 hours at 2-8 °C. Compatibility with the infusion sets was tested and found to be acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

Not applicable.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

2.3.1. Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Zoledronic acid Teva Generics manufactured by Teva Generic B.V. is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all zoledronic acid containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

## User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. The applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. There are no bioequivalence studies submitted with this application which is acceptable according to the 'Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence' (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1), as the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product. A positive benefit/risk balance, comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 4.
