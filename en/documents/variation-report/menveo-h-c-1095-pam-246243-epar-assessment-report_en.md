## 1. Introduction

On 17 January 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Menveo and Bexsero, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

Menveo (MenACWY vaccine) is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease.

Bexsero is indicated for active immunization of individuals 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that MENB REC 2ND GEN-045, study V72\\_79: Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GSK Meningococcal Group B Vaccine Bexsero (GSK3536829A) when Administered Concomitantly with GSK Meningococcal MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine Menveo (GSK3536820A) to Healthy Subjects 16-18 Years of Age, is a stand-alone study.

Study V72\\_79 had not been conducted according to an agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Coadministration of Menveo with Bexsero is approved in the EU [Menveo SmPC, 2024; Bexsero SmPC, 2017], based on information obtained in infants aged 3 to 13 months. However, no data was available on the concomitant use of Bexsero and Menveo in adolescents. GSK was requested by US Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to assess the concomitant use of Bexsero with a second dose of Menveo in individuals 16 years through 18 years of age, as a post-marketing commitment safety and immunogenicity study. The results of this study are presented in the clinical study report (CSR) of study V72-79.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Both Menveo and Bexsero are commercially available. The planned dosing schedule for each study intervention is summarized in Table 1 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Laterality is defined due to multiple vaccinations at different visits; non-dominant arm is the preferred arm for injection, when applicable. In case it is not possible to administer the vaccine in the non-dominant arm, an injection in the dominant arm may be performed.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

· Study V72\\_79: Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GSK Meningococcal Group B Vaccine Bexsero (GSK3536829A) when Administered Concomitantly with GSK Meningococcal MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine Menveo (GSK3536820A) to Healthy Subjects 16-18 Years of Age

The submitted clinical study report (CSR) presents all of the study endpoints, except for the secondary endpoint related to immune response for A, C, W and Y serogroups using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay.

## Assessor's comments

MenACWY and MenB are administered as a single dose of 0.5 mL. Composition and vaccination regimen used in the study is similar to composition and posology described in the SmPC for Menveo and Bexsero respectively.

The volume to be administered for vaccines is 0.5 mL whereas the volume to be administered for placebo is 0.65 mL. It is not understood why different volumes were chosen. However, considering that a different placebo volume will not have an impact on study outcomes, and given that the unblinded personnel responsible for preparing and/or delivering injections were not involved in the analysis, this issue is not further pursued.

## Objective(s)

## Primary immunogenicity objectives:

- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to MenB given concomitantly with MenACWY to healthy subjects 16-18 years of age compared to MenB administered alone, as measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) against N. meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains M14459 (fHbp), 96217 (NadA), NZ98/254 (PorA) and M07-0241084* (NHBA), at one month after the second vaccination with MenB. * As indicated in the Protocol, the NHBA indicator strain M07-0241084 was changed to M13520 during the study before clinical testing started.
- o Criterion: Non-inferiority was demonstrated if for each of the four serogroup B test strains, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the between-group ratio of human Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) GMTs (MenB with MenACWY versus MenB alone) was &gt;0.5.
- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to MenACWY given concomitantly with MenB to healthy subjects 16-18 years of age compared to MenACWY administered alone, as measured by hSBA GMTs against each of the N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y, at one month after the (study) vaccination with MenACWY.

- o Criterion: Non-inferiority was demonstrated if for each of the four serogroups A, C, W and Y, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the between-group ratio of hSBA GMTs (MenB with MenACWY versus MenACWY alone) was &gt;0.5.

## Secondary immunogenicity objectives:

- -To assess the non-inferiority of the responses to MenACWY when given concomitantly with MenB to healthy subjects 16-18 years of age compared to MenACWY administered alone as measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)* Geometric Mean Concentration (GMCs) against each of the serogroups A, C, W and Y, at one month after the (study) vaccination with MenACWY. * ELISA was replaced with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay
- o Criterion: Non-inferiority was demonstrated if for each of the four A, C, W and Y strains, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the between-group ratio of ECL GMCs (MenACWY with MenB versus MenACWY alone) was &gt;0.5.
- -To assess the immune response to MenB in healthy subjects 16-18 years of age against N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains M14459 (fHbp), 96217 (NadA), NZ98/254  (PorA) and M13520* (NHBA), at one month after the first and the second vaccination with MenB.
- -To assess the immune response to MenACWY in healthy subjects 16-18 years of age against each of the serogroups A, C, W and Y, at one month after the (study) vaccination with MenACWY.

## Assessor's comments

Results regarding the secondary objective of the immune response as measured by ECL are not available. This is not an issue given that the value of the additional information this assessment would provide is questioned as the ECL assay will measure all IgGs and not focus on functional antibodies.

The primary immunogenicity objectives of GMT ratio are appropriate for the purpose of this study since it is a continuous outcome and likely more sensitive to small differences than the dichotomized responder analysis (% with hSBA &gt;LLOQ). However, the non-inferiority margin is very wide, with the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the between-group ratio of concomitant versus sequential administration being &gt;0.5. A non-inferiority margin of 0.67 would have been preferred.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary immunogenicity endpoints:

- -Co-primary endpoints for Group MenB+MenACWY and Group MenB are the hSBA GMTs for MenB against each of the four serogroup B test strains (M14459, 96217, NZ98/254 and M13520) at one month after the second vaccination with MenB (Visit 4, Month 3).
- -Co-primary endpoints for Group MenB+MenACWY and Group MenACWY are the hSBA GMTs against each of the four serogroups A, C, W and Y with MenACWY at one month after the study vaccination of MenACWY (Visit 2, Month 1).

## Secondary immunogenicity endpoints

- -The immune response to MenACWY when administered with/without MenB at one month after the first vaccination (Visit 2, Month 1; Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY) will be assessed for the serogroups A, C, W and Y as ECL GMCs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The immune response to MenB when administered with/without MenACWY was evaluated by measuring bactericidal activity against N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254 and M13520* in both MenB+MenACWY and MenB Groups as following:
- o GMTs at one month after first and second vaccination with MenB and Geometric Mean Ratio (GMRs) at one month after the first (Visit 2, Month 1) and the second (Visit 4, Month 3) MenB vaccination compared to the baseline at Visit 1, Day 1/Month 0.
- o The percentage of subjects with hSBA titre s ≥Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) for each and all serogroup B test strains, one month after the first (Visit 2, Month 1) and second (Visit 4, Month 3) vaccination.
- o The percentage of subjects with fourfold increase in hSBA titres relative to baseline (Visit 1, Day 1/Month 0) is defined as:
-  For a pre-vaccination titre &lt; limit of detection (LOD), a post-vaccination titre (Visit 2, Month 1 and Visit 4, Month 3) of ≥ fourfold the LOD or ≥ LLOQ, whichever is greater,
-  For a pre-vaccination titre ≥LOD but &lt;LLOQ, a post -vaccination titre (Visit 2, Month 1 and Visit 4, Month 3) of at least fourfold the LLOQ,
-  For a pre-vaccination titre ≥ LLOQ, a postvaccination titre (Visit 2, Month 1 and Visit 4, Month 3) of at least fourfold the prevaccination titre (for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenB).
- o The ratio of GMTs (MenB when administered with MenACWY [Group MenB+MenACWY] versus MenB when administered alone [Group MenB]), one month after the first vaccination (Visit 2, Month 1).
- -The immune response to MenACWY when administered with/without MenB at baseline (i.e. prevaccination, Visit 1, Day 1/Month 0) and at one month after the first vaccination (Visit 2, Month 1; Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY) will be assessed for the serogroups A, C, W and Y as:
- o The percentage of subjects with hSBA titre s ≥LLOQ, for each serogroup.
- o GMRs at one month after first vaccination compared to baseline
- o The percentage of subjects with four-fold increase in hSBA titres relative to baseline (Visit 1, Day 1/Month 0) is defined as:
-  For a pre-vaccination titre &lt; LOD, a postvaccination titre (Visit 2, Month 1) of ≥ fourfold the LOD or ≥ LLOQ, whichever is greater,
-  For a pre-vaccination titre ≥LOD but &lt;LLOQ, a post -vaccination titre (Visit 2, Month 1) of at least fourfold the LLOQ,
-  For a pre-vaccination titre ≥ LLOQ, a postvaccination titre (Visit 2, Month 1) of at least fourfold the pre-vaccination titre (for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY).

## Sample size

The target sample size is 750 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity (250 subjects per study group). Evaluable subjects mean all subjects included in the set for the primary statistical analysis. Considering

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that approximately 20% of the enrolled subjects might withdraw or not be evaluable for immunogenicity, the target sample size to be enrolled is 945 subjects (315 subjects per study group). These sample sizes  were calculated based on the standard deviations from corresponding treatments in the mentioned studies, the non-inferiority margin of 0.5 and the expected ratio GMR of the GMTs (or GMCs) of 0.9.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Subjects will be randomised in the source data base for internet randomization system (SBIR) system to one of the 3 parallel treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. The randomisation algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting for centre.

Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. By observer-blind, it is meant that during the course of the study, the vaccines recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety and reactogenicity) will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will be done by qualified healthcare professional who will not participate in any of the study clinical evaluations.

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis sets

For purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined:

| Analysis Set       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Exposed            | All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment. The allocation in a group is done in function of the administered treatment.                                                                  |
| Full Analysis      | All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment and have post-vaccination immunogenicity data                                                                                                  |
| Per Protocol (PPS) | All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment to which they are randomised and have post-vaccination data (Full Analysis Set) minus subjects with protocol deviations that lead to exclusion |

## Analysis of immunogenicity

The primary analysis will be based on the Per Protocol Set of immunogenicity for the primary and secondary (non-inferiority) immunogenicity objective. If, in any study group, the percentage of enrolled or vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the per-protocol set for analysis of immunogenicity is 5% or more, a second analysis based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be performed to complement the per protocol analysis. Supportive analyses using the FAS will also be performed for the primary immunogenicity endpoints.

Completed = number of participants who completed the last study visit/contact

Withdrawn = number of participants who did not complete their last visit/contact

N = number of participants; n/% = number / percentage of participants in a given category

## Assessor's comments

The participant flow is comparable for all three groups, with withdrawal being low (in total ~6%). Of the randomised participants who were withdrawn, 'lost to follow-up' was listed as the most prominent reason for withdrawal followed by 'consent withdrawal not due to a (S)AE' in all three groups.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted at 52 centres in 2 countries: 48 centres in the United States (US), and 4 in Italy. Study period was between 25 August 2020 (first participant first visit) and 21 November 2023 (Last participant last visit). Database lock date: 24 September 2024.

## Baseline data

Demographic and other baseline characteristics are presented in Table 4 .

The mean age of subjects who participated in this study was 16.4 (SD 0.7) years old. Overall, 48.47% of participants in the study were females (n=457). Most of the participants in the MenB+MenACWY group (89.0%-97.7%) and the MenB group (85.7%-97.1%) had baseline titre &lt;LLOQ across serogroup B strains). A majority of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group (52.6%-73.5%) and the MenACWY group (53.8%-74.4%) had baseline titre &lt;LLOQ across serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

* In the MenACWY group, response against serogroup B strains was not tested and in the Men B group, response against serogroups A, C, W, and Y was not tested.

Age is calculated based on participants first vaccination date.

The LLOQs for serogroup B indicator strains fHbp (M14459), NadA (96217), NHBA (M13520) and PorA (NZ98/254) are 5, 14, 6, and 6, respectively.

The LLOQs for serogroups A, C, W, and Y are 12, 8, 8, and 10, respectively.

## Assessor's comments

The baseline data appears well balanced between the vaccine groups.

## Number analysed

A total of 938 (99.3%) participants were included in the Exposed Set, 919 (98%) participants were included in the FAS and 896 (97.5%) participants were included in the PPS.

At least one important protocol deviation leading to elimination was reported in 93 (9.8%) participants. The most common important protocol deviations were due to, out of window treatment administration (25 [2.6%]) and out of window assessment (23 [2.4%]; Table 5 ).

## Assessor's comments

The number of participants in each analysis set is comparable between treatment groups. Protocol deviations leading to elimination were reported in approximately 10% of participants in each treatment group. No differences between treatment groups were identified.

## Efficacy results

## Primary immunogenicity analysis

Non-inferiority was demonstrated for each of the 4 serogroup B indicator strains, as the LL of the 2sided 95% CI of the between-group ratio of hSBA GMTs (MenB with MenACWY versus MenB alone) at one month after the second vaccination with MenB (Day 91) was 0.77 (M14459 [fHbp]), 0.75 (96217 [NadA]), 0.76 (M13520 [NHBA]), and 0.73 (NZ98/254 [PorA]) that was above the predefined noninferiority criterion of LL of 95% CI &gt; 0.5 ( Table 6 ).

The ratio of GMTs (MenB+MenACWY/MenB) and the corresponding Cl is constructed by exponentiating the mean difference and the confidence limits in log10 (titer), using ANOVA with study centreincluded as an independent variable.

Non-lnferiority criterion: Non-inferiority willbe demonstrated if for each of the four serogroup B test strains, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the between-group ratioofhSBAGMTs(rMenB+OMVNZwithMenACWYversusrMenB+OMVNZalone)is&gt;0.5.

Non-inferiority was demonstrated for serogroups A, C, W, and Y, as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI of the between-group ratio of hSBA GMTs (MenB with MenACWY versus MenACWY alone) at one month after the vaccination with MenACWY (Day 31) was 0.78 (Men A), 0.86 (Men C), 0.82 (Men W), and 0.84 (MenY), that was above the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of LL of 95% CI &gt; 0.5 (Table 7)

Bold = non-inferiority criterion met

The ratio of GMTs (MenB+MenACWY/MenACWY) and the corresponding Cl is constructed by exponentiating the mean diference and the confidence limits in log10 (titer), using ANoVAwithstudycentreincludedasanindependentvariable.

Non-lnferiority criterion:Non-inferiority willbe demonstrated if for each of the four serogroups A,C, W and Y,the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the betweengroup ratio of hSBA GMTs (rMenB+OMV NZ with MenACWY versus MenACWY alone) is &gt;0.5.

Sensitivity analyses (to include possible imbalance in the baseline titre among groups) of adjusted hSBA GMT and between-group GMT ratios as well as analyses using the FAS showed similar results.

n/% = number / percentage of participants with titer within the specified range

95% CI = 95% confidence interval; LL = Lower Limit; UL = Upper Limit

The percentages of subjects with hSBA titres &gt;= LLOQ and the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% Cls based on Clopper-Pearson method will be calculated for each study group at each timepoint. Comparison is done using the difference in percentages (MenB+MenACWY-MenB).

The LLOQs for serogroup B indicator strains fHbp (M14459), NadA (96217), NHBA (M13520) and PorA (NZ98/254) are 5, 14, 6, and 6, respectively.

The percentages of subjects with hSBA titres &gt;= LLOQ and the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% Cls based on Clopper-Pearson method willbe calculated for each study group at each timepoint. Comparison is done using the difference in percentages (MenB+MenACWY-MenACWY).

The LLOQs for serogroups A, C, W, and Y are 12, 8, 8, and 10, respectively.

## Assessor's comments

The study met the pre-specified non-inferiority margins of 0.5 for the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the between group ratio of GMTs for all 4 MenB strains and all serogroups. The more conservative non-inferiority margin of 0.67 would also have been met for all comparisons.

Overall, no notable differences are observed in the induced immune response when Bexsero or Menveo are given alone or concomitantly.

It is noted that slight differences in the number of participants with available results for the GMR compared to participants with a 4-fold rise in hSBA titre exist. It is not understood where the differences in these numbers come from as all participants for whom GMR could be determined would be able to attribute to number of participants with a 4-fold rise. However, as overall difference in numbers of participants attributing to results is small (up to maximally n=3), it is not expected to influence overall results. Therefore this is not further pursued.

## Safety results

Analysis of safety was performed on the Exposed Set.

A total of 929 (99.0%) participants received at least 1 dose MenB vaccine, 919 (98.0%) received at least 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine, and 927 (98.8%) received at least 1 dose of Placebo. Two doses of MenB vaccine were administered in 901 (96.1%) participants, with 302 (97.4%) participants, 298 (96.8%) participants and 301 (94.1%) participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, MenB group and MenACWY group, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- At Visit 1 (Day 1), all of the participants in the Exposed Set received the vaccine/placebo as assigned.
- At Visit 3 (Day 61), 302 (97.4%) participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 298 (96.8%) in the MenB group, and 311 (97.2%) in the MenACWY group received MenB vaccine. In addition, 1 participant in the MenB group received MenACWY vaccine.
- At Visit 4 (Day 91), 301 (94.1%) participants in the MenACWY group received MenB vaccine, 288 (93.5%) in the MenB group received MenACWY vaccine, and 299 (96.5%) in the MenB+MenACWY group received Placebo. In addition, 1 participant in the MenACWY group received Placebo.

The safety follow-up period was 6 months after the last vaccination for participants who did not reach Day 271 (Month 9) at the time of Protocol Amendment 7 (N=673); for rest of the participants (N=265), the safety follow-up period was 12 months after the last vaccination.

## Solicited AEs

During the 7-day follow-up period after any vaccination, solicited events were reported in 88.1%94.8% of participants across study groups ( Table 10 ).

The first onset of the solicited systemic events in majority of participants was reported from Day 1 through Day 3 following any injection across groups and the mean duration was ≤3.4 days for any solicited systemic event across groups.

## Assessor's comments

As expected, the vast majority of participants experience a solicited AE in all treatment groups. There was no notable difference in solicited local or systemic events when Bexsero or Menveo was given alone or concomitantly.

## Unsolicited AEs

During the 30-day post-vaccination period after Visit 1:

- The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by SOC was infections and infestations (5.5% of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 5.8% in the MenB group, and 4.1% in the MenACWY group).
- The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by PT was oropharyngeal pain (2.3% of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group and 1.6% each in the MenB group and the MenACWY group).
- Related unsolicited AEs were infrequently reported, see Table 11.

During the 30-day post-vaccination period after Visit 3:

- The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by SOC was infections and infestations (6.3% of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 6% in the MenB group, and 6.8% in the MenACWY group).
- The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by PT was nasopharyngitis (1.7% of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 0.3% in the MenB group, and 2.3% in the MenACWY group).
- Related unsolicited AEs were infrequently reported, see Table 11.

During the 30-day post-vaccination period after Visit 4:

- The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by SOC was infections and infestations (5% of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 6.3% in the MenB group, and 7.3% in the MenACWY group).
- The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by PT was nasopharyngitis (1% of participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 0.7% in the MenB group, and 1.7% in the MenACWY group).
- Related unsolicited AEs were infrequently reported, see Table 11.

## Assessor's comments

There was no notable difference in unsolicited events when Bexsero or Menveo was given alone or concomitantly. Unsolicited AEs considered related to study vaccines were reported by &lt;3% of participants in all treatment groups after any vaccination. All unsolicited AEs considered related to the vaccines are already included in the respective SmPC's and/or reported by only 1 participant.

## Serious adverse events, deaths and other significant events

No deaths or AESIs (arthritis or potential immune mediated diseases) were reported in the study.

During 0-12 months follow-up, SAEs were reported in 2 participants in the MenB+MenACWY group, 4 in the MenB group, and 7 in the MenACWY group (Table 12).

None of the SAEs reported during the study were related to the study interventions, as assessed by the investigator.

## Assessor's comments

The frequency of occurrence of SAEs is low, &lt;2.5%, in all treatment groups. The Applicant states that none of the SAEs are related, which could not be assessed as narratives were not provided. The Applicant is encouraged to always include the narratives of the SAEs in future CSR submissions, to enable assessment of relatedness.

## Discontinuations

During the study period, 1 participant in the MenACWY group reported AE leading to withdrawal (pain in extremity; not related to the study intervention) during the 30-day period after the vaccination at Visit 1. The AE of pain in extremity was also reported as SAE due to hospitalization that was resolved after 7 days of onset.

## Assessor's comments

One participant discontinued the study due to an (S)AE. This SAE (pain in extremity) was stated not to be related to study intervention.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study V72\\_79 was conducted to assess concomitant administration of Bexsero (MenB vaccine) and Menveo (MenACWY vaccine) in an adolescent population. Concomitant administration of Menveo with Bexsero is approved in the EU [Menveo SmPC, 2024; Bexsero SmPC, 2017], based on information obtained in infants aged 3 to 13 months. However, no data was available on the concomitant use of Bexsero and Menveo in adolescents. GSK was requested by US CBER to assess the concomitant use of Bexsero with a second dose of Menveo in individuals 16 years through 18 years of age, as a post marketing commitment safety and immunogenicity study.

Immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of MenB and MenACWY vaccines compared to sequential administration of these vaccines was evaluated by serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBAs), using indicator strains representing 4 MenB strains and serogroups A, C, W and

Y. The primary immunogenicity objectives of GMT ratios (concomitant/sequential) are appropriate for the purpose of this study since it is a continuous outcome and likely more sensitive to small differences than the dichotomized responder analysis (% with hSBA &gt;LLOQ).

The study met the pre-specified non-inferiority margins of 0.5 for the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the between group ratio of GMTs for all 4 MenB strains and all serogroups. This non-inferiority margin is considered very broad, however, as the results show that the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI were all ≥ 0.73 (ranging from 0.73 to 0.86) for all MenB strains and all serogroups, which is reassuring.

A substantial increase in hSBA titres were observed after the complete 2-dose MenB primary series. In the concomitant group GMRs were comparable to those in the MenB alone group. After completion of the 2-dose primary series, the point estimate of the percentage of participants achieving hSBA titres ≥LLOQ for all 4 MenB strains was 72.2% (95% CI 66.4, 77.4) in the concomitant group versus 74.8% (95% CI: 69.1, 79.9) in the MenB only group. Although it is acknowledged that the LL of the 95% CI of the difference in percentage is slighty &gt;10% (-10.09), it should be noted that the study was not powered on this dichotomized responder analysis. In addition, an hSBA titre &gt;1:4 is considered protective and for all 4 strains LLOQ was at least 1:6, and therefore considered conservative.

As expected after a booster dose of MenACWY, the GMTs increased substantially and GMRs were high, ranging from 130 to 324 in the concomitant group vs 132 to 300 in the MenACWY group. This was also reflected in the percentage of participants achieving hSBA titre ≥LLOQ, which ranged from 99.0% to 100% in the concomitant group and 99.3% to 100% in the MenACWY group for all 4 strains. No difference between the concomitant group and the MenACWY alone group were observed.

During the current study no new safety signals were observed. No notable differences were observed when Bexsero or Menveo were given alone or concomitantly. The most frequently reported solicited AEs were pain, headache and fatigue in all treatment groups. The profile of solicited AEs is in line with the SmPCs for MenB and MenACWY vaccine. Unsolicited AEs considered related to study vaccination were reported by &lt;3% of participants in all treatment groups after any vaccination. All unsolicited AEs considered related to the vaccines were reported by only 1 participant and/or already included in the SmPCs of the commercial products. No deaths or AESI were reported during the study. Approximately 2.5% of subjects reported at least one SAE. Narratives of the SAEs were not provided, which hampers assessment of relatedness.

Overall, the results indicate that concomitant administration did not substantially impact the immune response or the safety profile in the adolescent population.

The MAH considers no changes to the current SmPC of Bexero and Menveo are necessary. This is agreed.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In conclusion, in the current study concomitant administration of MenB and MenACWY vaccines generated an immune response in adolescents which was generally comparable to the immune response generated when the vaccines were administered alone. No new safety signals were reported.
