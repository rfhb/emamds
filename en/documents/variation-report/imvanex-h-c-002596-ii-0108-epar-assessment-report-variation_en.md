## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bavarian Nordic A/S submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 August 2024 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include treatment of adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age for Imvanex based on interim results from study DMID 22-0020. This is a Phase 2 randomized open label multisite trial to inform Public Health strategies involving the use of MVA-BN vaccine for mpox. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.4.

The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0284/2023 on the agreement of a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0284/2023 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

## Smallpox

Smallpox virus (Variola virus) is a member of the family Poxviridae belonging to the subfamily Chordopoxviridae and genus Orthopoxvirus . Vaccinia virus contains a large linear double-stranded DNA genome amounting to approximately 190,000 base pairs and encoding more than 200 proteins. Viral particles are typically brick shaped and measure ~300 x 230 nm. Virions released through the cell membrane are enveloped but most virions remain cell-associated and are released by cellular disruption that leaves them without an envelope. Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are infectious.

Smallpox was eradicated (declaration 1981; last known case in 1977) as a result of the WHO global campaign.

## Monkeypox (Mpox)

Mpox is a viral zoonosis caused by the mpox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus family. It was first identified in 1958 and the first cases of mpox in humans were reported in the 1970s in the Central African region. Since then, mpox in humans has been reported repeatedly throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, including West Africa and Central Africa, with rising frequency in recent years.

In endemic countries, incidences of mpox virus infections in paediatric age groups are higher than in adult age groups, which might correlate with the lack of vaccine coverage as compared to older populations. However, in the last decades, the age of humans having mpox cases has gradually increased, probably in part due to growing proportions of the population without vaccination coverage, as smallpox was eradicated.

In May-2022, a multi-country mpox clade II outbreak spread to previously non-endemic countries, following reports of a number of cases across several Member States not linked to countries where the disease is endemic. The outbreak widened globally, and WHO declared mpox a PHEIC for the first time, in July 2022. Less than a year later, in May 2023, noting significant progress having been made in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

controlling the outbreak, the WHO removed the PHEIC status; but urged governments, health authorities and impacted communities to remain vigilant.

On 15 August 2024, Sweden became the first country outside the African continent to confirm mpox clade Ib in an individual with travel history to central Africa. The confirmation of the case came just one day after WHO declared mpox a PHEIC for the second time in 2 years, following an upsurge in new and concerning cases in the DRC and several neighbouring countries, including the emergence of a new strain, clade Ib, which appears to be more severe than clade II.

The clinical course of mpox is similar to smallpox, although milder and with a substantially lower-case fatality rate. After infection, there is an incubation period of roughly 1-2 weeks. Shortly after an initial febrile prodrome, potentially alongside with headache and fatigue, a rash will develop in many patients, as well as lymphadenopathy in cervical, inguinal or maxillary regions. Fever is frequently observed around the time of rash onset. The distinctive pox lesions begin to develop simultaneously and evolve together on any given part of the body, and the evolution of lesions progresses have been described through four stages, as first macular, later papular, then vesicular or pustular, scabbing over and resolving. The illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks. The severity of illness can depend upon the initial health of the individual, the route of exposure, and the strain of the infecting virus (West African vs. Central African virus genetic groups, or clades). West African mpox is associated with milder disease, fewer deaths, and limited human-to-human transmission. Human infections with the Central African mpox virus clade are typically more severe compared to those with the West African virus clade and have a higher mortality. Person-to-person spread is well-documented for Central African mpox virus.

People who live with or have close contact (including sexual contact) with someone who has mpox, or who has regular contact with animals who could be infected, are most at risk of infection. Newborn infants, young children and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of more serious disease.

## Other orthopoxviruses

In laboratories working with replicating orthopoxviruses such as vaccinia, accidental exposure of laboratory personnel is an occupational health risk. Cases of needle-stick injuries or similar accidents leading to local infections with replicating vaccinia have repeatedly been reported. In addition, there are rare case reports of other orthopoxvirus transmissions, such as human cowpox infections, mostly from pet rodents or cats of questionable origin. Previous smallpox vaccination decades ago was shown to lead to a milder clinical course in one of the reported cases.

## State the claimed therapeutic indication

In the context of the currently ongoing mpox outbreak and in view of the need to prevent mpox in paediatric age groups, interim data have been presented to support an extension of the indication of Imvanex to individuals from 12 years of age.

Interim immunogenicity and safety data from a clinical study sponsored by the US DMID of the NIH evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of MVA-BN in adolescents 12-17 years of age have become available and support the administration of MVA-BN in this age group.

Following the finalisation of the study in Oct-2024, the MAH will submit by 30-May-2025 the final CSR together with the updated RMP to further characterise the safety information of Imvanex in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Management

Control of the outbreaks primarily relies on public health measures including surveillance, contacttracing, isolation and care of patients.

Symptomatic treatment of orthopoxvirus infections includes close supervision of the patient and fluid replacement. Antibiotics are restricted to patients with bacterial superinfection. For specific treatment, tecovirimat is the only medicinal product approved in the EU for the treatment of smallpox, mpox and cowpox in adults and children with body weight at least 13 kg. Tecovirimat works by interfering with a protein called VP37 that is found on the surface of orthopoxviruses. By interacting with this protein, the medicine prevents the viruses from reproducing normally, slowing down the spread of infection. This medicinal product was approved based on testing in animal models using other orthopoxviruses than smallpox only.

In the EU, Imvanex is currently approved for active immunisation against smallpox, mpox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults.

## 2.1.2. About the product

Imvanex is a live, highly attenuated, non-replicating viral vaccine for protection against smallpox, mpox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults. The vaccine is suspension for injection. One dose (0.5 mL) contains MVA-BN live virus no less than 5 x 107 infectious unit.

Imvanex is manufactured based on the manufacturer's proprietary strain of the orthopoxvirus MVA-BN that is grown in chicken embryo fibroblast cells, harvested, concentrated, and purified.

Imvanex was approved under exceptional circumstances in the EU on 31 July 2013 for active immunisation against smallpox in adults. On 22 July 2022, an extension of indication to include active immunisation against mpox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults was approved.

The primary vaccination schedule consists of two doses of the vaccine administered subcutaneously at interval of no less than 28 days, whereas a single dose of 0.5 mL is considered for booster vaccination whenever necessary in individuals previously vaccinated against smallpox. For immunocompromised patients, two booster doses separated by 28 days or longer should be given.

## Methods to evaluate immunogenicity

In view of their demonstrated role in protection against a lethal mpox challenge in animals immunised with a live attenuated vaccinia vaccine, anti-vaccinia neutralising antibodies were proposed as a correlate of protection (Edghill-Smith, 2005). The measured clinical response in terms of anti-vaccinia neutralising antibodies by a validated PRNT, together with animal studies, formed the basis for the approval of MVA-BN as smallpox and mpox vaccine.

Therefore, the assessment of MVA-BN for immunisation of adolescents was based on the direct comparison of the PRNT response induced by the vaccine in this population with the immune response measured in adults, using the same PRNT as in the initial MAA.

Blood is collected for the evaluation of immunogenicity at Day 1, Day 29, Day 43, Day 210 and Day 394. The interim analysis includes immunogenicity data at Study Day 1, Day 29 (28 days Post Dose 1) and Day 43 (14 days Post Dose 2).

## Objectives/endpoints

The primary immunogenicity objective of study Stage 2 was:

- To determine if peak humoral immune responses in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years following administration of a 2-dose 1 x 10 8  Inf.U. (corresponding to no less than 5 x 107 Inf.U.) MVABN regimen administered SC are non-inferior to the response in adults ages 18 to 50 years who received the licensed 2-dose SC regimen of 1 x 10 8  Inf.U. MVA-BN. The associated endpoint was vaccinia virus specific PRNT GMT at Day 43.

The main secondary immunogenicity objectives of study Stage 2 were:

- To evaluate humoral immune responses following receipt of the 2-dose SC regimen of 1 x 10 8 Inf.U MVA-BN in adolescents compared to adults on each study day. The associated endpoint for the interim analysis was vaccinia virus specific PRNT GMT at Day 29 and Day 43.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To evaluate seroconversion between adolescent and adult study arms. The associated endpoint for the interim analysis was vaccinia virus specific seroconversion rate by PRNT at Day 29 and Day 43.

The humoral response in terms of Monkeypox virus neutralizing antibodies was assessed under an exploratory objective:

- To evaluate humoral immune responses of the 2-dose SC regimen of 1 x 10 8  Inf.U. MVA-BN to monkeypox virus in adolescents compared to adults. The associated endpoint was Monkeypox virus specific PRNT GMT at Day 43.

## Immunogenicity assays

Serum samples for assessment of neutralising antibody responses after vaccination with MVA-BN as measured by the BN VV-WR strain PRNT were collected prior to receiving the first vaccination on Day 1, and on Days 29, 43, 210, and 394. This assay was performed as previously described (Pittman, 2019) and is the assay used in the initial MAA of MVA-BN. This assay is validated.

Serum samples collected prior to receiving the first vaccination on Day 1 and on Day 43 were assessed for neutralising antibody responses using a mpox virus specific PRNT. This assay was conducted by Battelle Biomedical Research Center and uses an mpox clade 2b virus (hMPXV/USA/MA001/2022, ATCC/BEI Resources) and should be considered optimized but not fully validated. Since this assay is still in development, it was only included as an exploratory endpoint.

## Immunogenicity analysis cohort

For this interim analysis, the analysis of immunogenicity was based on the mITT population, which includes all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of vaccine and contributed pre- and at least one post-vaccination venous blood sample for immunogenicity testing for which results were reported. Two (&lt;1%) adolescents did not contribute any post-vaccination blood samples with immunogenicity results and were excluded from the mITT population. Overall, 313 adolescents and all 211 adults satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the mITT population. Of these participants, 304 adolescents and 208 adults completed the Day 43 visit and contributed a venous blood sample.

## Statistical methods

The following hypotheses relating to antibody responses were assessed in the interim analysis:

- Primary Hypothesis: At Day 43 the humoral immune response of the MVA-BN SC (standard dose regimen) in adolescents will be non-inferior to the standard MVA-BN SC regimen in adults, as assessed by PRNT GMT.
- Secondary Hypothesis: The humoral immune response of the MVA-BN SC regimen in adolescents, as assessed by PRNT GMT, will be similar to the MVA-BN SC regimen in adults at all study days.
- Exploratory Hypothesis: The humoral immune response of the MVA-BN SC regimen in adolescents, as assessed by monkeypox virus specific PRNT GMT, will be similar to the MVA-BN SC regimen in adults at Day 1 and 43.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Seroconversion was defined depending on baseline measurements at Day 1 (pre-vaccination). If baseline was positive, i.e. ≥ LLOD, a ≥ 2 -fold rise from baseline indicated a positive seroconversion result. If baseline was negative, i.e. &lt; LLOD, a subsequent m seroconversion result.

easurement ≥ LLOD indicated a positive GMTs of antibodies, GMT ratios (GMTRs, defined as ratio of GMT in adolescents to GMT in adults), GMFRs, and percentage of participants achieving seroconversion were calculated to help assess the humoral immune response in adolescents compared to adults. Corresponding 95% CIs for each assessment were also calculated. The 95% CIs for GMTs and GMFRs were calculated using Student's tdistribution, the 95% CIs for GMTRs were calculated using Welch-Satterthwaite t-test, and the 95% CIs for seroconversion rates were calculated using Clopper-Pearson methodology. Additionally, a NI test with an unequal variance and two-sample t-test statistic was performed to obtain a p-value for Day 43 (expected peak antibody response) and actual participant peak response day (Post Dose 1). NI was defined by a significant p-value and a GMTR 95% CI lower bound ≥ 0.67 (i.e., the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference of the log10 titer means ≥ -0.174). Arm 3 from Stage 1 and Arm 4 from Stage 2 were combined as the comparator group for the primary analyses. Arm 3 participants were then excluded for sensitivity analyses, to qualitatively assess whether there were any substantial differences between adult participants enrolled in each stage; however, it was not anticipated for the inclusion/exclusion of Arm 3 to affect the results.

## Results

## Vaccinia virus specific response at Day 43

As assessed by the vaccinia virus-specific PRNT, adolescents were found to have a humoral immune response that was non-inferior to adults on Day 43, the expected peak response day (GMTR: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.95); p&lt;0.001) (see table 4).

Based on non-overlapping 95% CIs, the GMT in adolescents was greater than the GMT in adults on Day 43 (Adolescent GMT: 470.3 [95% CI: 422.3, 523.8]; Adult GMT: 293.2 [95% CI: 249.8, 344.2]).

## Vaccinia virus specific response at all timepoints

As assessed by the vaccinia virus-specific PRNT, adolescents had similar baseline antibody titers at Day 1 and a similar humoral immune response on Day 29 compared to adults. The GMTR at Day 29 was 1.15 versus adults with 95%CI including 1 (0.93, 1.42) (see table 5).

When considering the day of peak response (i.e. time of highest GMT at any time point after Dose 1) the immune response in adolescents was also non-inferior to that of adults (GMTR: 1.53 (1.25, 1.86); p&lt;0.001) (see Table 5). The GMTR at peak Day (1.53) was similar to the GMTR at Day 43 (1.60) (see Table 4).

## Mpox virus specific response

At Day 43, 14, days after Dose 2, adolescents (GMT: 9.8 [95% CI: 9.6, 10.0]) had similar immune responses to adults (GMT: 10.0 [95% CI: 9.6, 10.4]) for mpox virus PRNT (see table 7). However, the majority of immune responses were below the LLOD of the assay, and most study participants did not show seroconversion for mpox-specific PRNT (see table 8). The PRNT assay used to measure mpox-specific neutralizing antibodies, although optimized, is not considered fully validated.

## 2.4.1. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The overall demographics for the purpose of the study is acceptable. The PRNT response of antivaccinia neutralising antibodies induced by MVA-BN in non-human primate animal models challenged with mpox formed the basis for the approval of MVA-BN as mpox vaccine. Therefore, direct comparison of anti-vaccinia neutralising antibodies in adults versus adolescents in order to infer effectiveness is acceptable in this procedure.

The seroconversion rates in terms of vaccinia virus-specific neutralizing antibodies observed in this study in adolescents and adults at 14 days post Dose 2 were in the range of those reported earlier at this timepoint in vaccinia-naïve healthy adults. Previously estimated seroconversion rates by PRNT in healthy adults, range 77.2- 99.8% 14 days post Dose 2 compared with 97.6% in adults and 99% in adolescents in the DMID study.

Although no response was detected in this study in terms of mpox-specific neutralizing antibodies, both in adolescent and in adults, the PRNT that was used is not fully validated. Of note, MVA-BN was shown protective against mpox in the 2022 mpox outbreak with effectiveness estimates ranging 6690% for a 2-dose regimen, based on consistent data from several effectiveness studies in the systematic literature review conducted by BN (i.e. Payne et al. 2022; Bertran et al. 2023; Brousseau et al. 2023; Dalton et al. 2023; Deputy et al. 2023; Fontán-Vela et al. 2023; Montero Morales et al. 2023a; Ramchandani et al. 2023; Rosenberg et al. 2023; Schildhauer et al. 2023) as already reflected in the SmPC section 5.1.

## 2.4.2. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In adolescents, MVA-BN elicited a high vaccinia virus-specific neutralizing immune response that was non-inferior to that mounted by adults, with GMTs at Day 14 post Dose 2 that were higher than in adults. Given the correlation between the immune response and protective effectiveness, it may be inferred that MVA-BN will provide at least similar protection in adolescents than in adults against disease.

The vaccinia virus-specific PRNT GMT in adolescents was greater than the GMT in adults on Day 43 (Adolescent GMT: 470.3 [95% CI: 422.3, 523.8]; Adult GMT: 293.2 [95% CI: 249.8, 344.2]). Confidence intervals do not overlap. Non-inferiority of vaccination with MVA-BN in adolescents versus adults was demonstrated. GMP values and seroconversion rates at different timepoints after vaccination with MVA-BN are greater in the adolescent population than in the adult population.

Given the high and non-inferior result to adults' immune response mounted by adolescents in the validated vaccinia virus-specific PRNT assay, which is identical to that used for initial MAA, the protective efficacy of MVA-BN in adolescents may be inferred.

The following post-authorisation measure (REC) is considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

While PRNT values against vaccinia virus are acceptable for this procedure to infer effectiveness from a healthy adult population to other populations it is highly recommended to develop PRNT assays against mpox, both clade 1 and clade 2. Values from these assays could inform on potential differences in the cross-protection of MVA-BN against mpox viruses. Additionally, or alternatively other assays should be explored for their use, e.g. a binding assay.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Clinical safety has been presented in the clinical overview and in the interim report, comparing the safety profile of adolescents and adults. The submitted interim data package includes safety data reported through Study Day 210 (180 days Post Dose 2). At the time of the submission, study DMID 22-0020 is still ongoing. Data up to Study Day 57 are clean. Data after Study Day 57 are as reported. No raw data is available. Further, long-term data are yet open. However, no specific risk beyond the known safety-profile of similar vaccines has been identified based on the available safety data. The complete data package including the final CSR and the updated RMP is expected to be submitted by 30-May-2025.

## Patient exposure

As of the data cut-off date, the study was fully enrolled with a total of 526 participants: 315 adolescents and 211 adults (76 adults from Stage 1 [Arm 3] and 135 adults from Stage 2 [Arm 4]). All enrolled participants completed their first dose and 99% completed their second dose.

## Adverse events

Reactogenicity was measured from the time of each study vaccination through 7 days after each study vaccination by the occurrence of solicited AEs, including systemic and injection site (local) events. Systemic AEs included fever, chills, nausea, headache, fatigue, change in appetite, myalgia, and arthralgia. Local AEs included pain at the injection site, erythema/redness, induration/swelling, and pruritis at the injection site.

Unsolicited, non-serious AEs were collected from the time of each study vaccination through approximately 28 days after each study vaccination. MAAEs, UPs and AESIs were collected from the time of the first study vaccination through approximately 181 days after the last study vaccination.

In view of historical reports of cardiac AEs during the 2002-2004 smallpox vaccination campaign of military personnel and civilian first responders conducted in the US with 2 vaccines (Dryvax and ACAM2000) (Cassimatis, 2004), cardiac-related signs or symptoms were monitored as AESIs during the clinical development of MVA-BN. Based on MVA-BN Phase 3 safety results, there were no prespecified AESIs in Stage 1 of the clinical study conducted in adults. In study Stage 2, which involves adolescent participants, monitoring for protocol specified AESI is part of the study as less is known about the safety profile in this population. In addition, an exclusion criterion for adolescents and adults with relevant cardiac history that could place them at risk was added in Stage 2. For study Stage 2, a protocol specified AESI is defined as a case of myocarditis or pericarditis; AESIs are to be collected from Day 1 through 210.

Cardiac AESIs were monitored for MVA-BN. In 22 studies, cardiac AESIs were reported to occur in 1.3% (95/7,093) of MVA-BN recipients and in 0.2% (3/1,206) of placebo recipients who were smallpox vaccine naïve. The higher proportion of MVA-BN recipients who experienced cardiac AESIs was driven by cases of asymptomatic postvaccination elevation of troponin I, the clinical significance of which is unknown.

SAEs are collected from time of first study vaccination through end of study. The MAAE, UP, AESI, and SAE reporting periods are still ongoing at the time of this interim analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All AEs or SAEs were assessed for severity, according to the FDA toxicity grading scale (FDA, 2007). For AEs not included in the protocol-defined grading scale, specific scale used to assess severity is defined.

## Results

## Solicited Adverse Events

The overall frequency of solicited systemic AEs after either vaccination was similar in adolescents (74%) and adults (73%). Likewise, the overall frequency of solicited local AEs after either vaccination was similar in adolescents (88%) and adults (91%).

The most frequently reported systemic AE was fatigue (52% and 56% in adolescents and adults, respectively), followed by headache (50% and 49%) and myalgia (40% and 38%). The most frequently reported local AE was pain at injection site (74% and 81% in adolescents and adults, respectively), followed by erythema/redness (61% in adolescents and 66% in adults).

In both age groups, frequencies of individual solicited systemic and local AEs were similar after Dose 1 and after Dose 2.

## Unsolicited Adverse Events

Among adolescents, 64% (201 out of 315) experienced at least one unsolicited AE, compared to 70% of adults (147 out of 211).

At least one related unsolicited AE was reported by 49 % of adolescents (154 out of 315) and 59% of adults (125 out of 315). The majority of related unsolicited AEs were mild (Grade 1) and there were no related, severe (Grade 3) unsolicited AEs.

In adolescents, within 28 days post either dose, the majority of reported unsolicited AEs judged as related to study vaccination were represented by injection site conditions (193 events in 140 out of 315 participants or 44%).

There were 17 events (in 17 participants) of injection site nodules and 13 events (in 13 participants) of injection site discoloration that were associated with Dose 1 but not observed until Post Dose 2. When considering either vaccination, there were 131 events injection site nodule in 117/315 participants or 37%, and 56 events injection site discoloration in 52/315 participants or 17%.

In adults, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs judged as related to study vaccination were also injection site conditions (212 events in 122 out of 211 participants or 58%). The most common PT for both doses was injection site nodule (Post Dose 1: 96 events in 96/211 participants or 45%; Post Dose 2: 52 events in 50/211 participants or 24%). There were 10 events (in 10 participants) of injection site nodules and 11 events (in 11 participants) of injection site discoloration that were associated with Dose 1 but not observed until Post Dose 2. When considering either vaccination, there were 148 events of injection site nodule in 112/211 participants or 53% and 61 events of injection site discoloration in 46/122 participants or 22%.

Other related unsolicited AEs were reported by ≤ 1% of adolescents.

Adolescents reported AEs of dizziness judged as related to study vaccination more frequently than adults (9 events in 8 out of 315 or 3% of adolescent participants; no dizziness events reported from adult participants). Seven events were associated with Dose 1, and 2 events were associated with Dose 2. Seven of the nine events occurred on the day of vaccination or the following day. None of these events resulted in syncopal episodes, and none required medical intervention or lead to discontinuation of study product.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No SAEs have been reported in the adolescent age-group (for comparison: 2 out of 211 in the adult age-group).

34 Adolescents (11%) experienced at least one medically attended AE compared to 19 (9%) adults.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

AEs in 2 adolescents were leading to discontinuation. No further information available.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria meet current standards. Of note, for Stage 2, adolescent or adult participant who had a history of myocarditis/pericarditis or a history of structural congenital heart defect/cardiac dysrhythmia with increased risk to the participant, are excluded. Myocarditis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Pericarditis and associated symptoms are reflected in the protocol as AESIs). Reason is an associated moderate risk of myo-/pericarditis for ACAM2000, a second-generation smallpox vaccine, derived from a clone of Dryvax, purified, and produced using modern cell culture technology, currently approved in several non-EU countries for active immunisation against smallpox disease. Further, for the firstgeneration smallpox-vaccine (Dryvax), being used during the 2002-2004 smallpox vaccination campaign to protect military personnel and civilian first-responders, there were high rates of pericarditis and myocarditis reported among those vaccinated with Dryvax. Similarly, high rates were detected after receipt of ACAM2000.

The available subject-number (315 adolescents) is too low for addressing rare risks, e.g. cardiovascular risks as identified with other smallpox-vaccines in the past. Cardiovascular risk is yet addressed in the RMP and will be followed, respectively.

The overall Summary of AEs (Table 9) presents a similar safety profile on a high level of comparison for adults and adolescents. Of note, no SAEs have been reported.

The majority of AEs refers to local and systemic solicited Events. The presented comparison of respective AEs in adolescents and adults is similar with no major differences. Regarding Injection site reactions, an overall high number of 'any local symptom' (88/91% adolescents/adults) has been presented as expected. However, Table 11  'Related Unsolicited AEs' reflects even more administration site conditions (covering Injection site discolouration, haemorrhage, macule, nodule, rash, and warmth). These should be further analysed as soon as final CSR is available.

Safety profile will be further characterised when the final CSR is submitted since the study is still ongoing. Nervous system disorders, cardiac disorders and other relevant medical conditions are awaited to be addressed within the final CSR. Further, Gastrointestinal disorders should be presented, comparatively (adolescents versus adults) with the final CSR submission.

As a result, an additional SOB regarding the ongoing study DMID 22-0020 is requested. Final CSR should be provided by 30-May-2025.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The available clinical safety has been presented in the clinical overview, comparing the safety profile of adolescents and adults. Respective study DMID 22-0020 is still ongoing and the presented data are interim data. Data up to Study Day 57 are clean. Data after Study Day 57 are as reported. However, no specific risk beyond the known safety-profile of similar vaccines has been identified.

The following measure (SOB) is considered necessary to address issues related to safety:

In order to further characterise the safety information of Imvanex in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age, the applicant should submit by 30-May-2025 the final clinical study report of study DMID 220020:

- -A Phase 2 Randomised, Open-Label, Multisite Trial to Inform Public Health Strategies Involving the Use of MVA-BN Vaccine for mpox.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Update of the Product information

The CHMP adopted a new indication (section 4.1) and the updated indication is now as follows:

'Active immunisation against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in individuals 12 years of age and older adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1)

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.'

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 have also been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template.

Annex II is updated to refer to the new specific obligation.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 2.6.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

After smallpox has been eradicated, mpox has become the most significant orthopoxvirus that causes infection and disease in humans. The clinical course of mpox is similar to smallpox, although milder and with a significantly lower-case fatality rate. Mpox is endemic in Western and Central Africa.

In May-2022, a multi-country mpox clade II outbreak spread to previously several non-endemic countries. The outbreak widened globally, and in July 2022, WHO declared mpox a PHEIC for the first time. In May 2023, significant progress was made in controlling the outbreak and the PHEIC status was removed.

On 15 August 2024, Sweden became the first country outside the African continent to confirm mpox clade I in an individual with travel history to central Africa. The confirmation of the case came just one day after WHO declared mpox a PHEIC for the second time in 2 years, following an upsurge in new and concerning cases in the DRC and several neighbouring countries, including the emergence of a new strain, clade Ib, which appears to be more severe than clade II.

Other related orthopoxviruses that are known to cause human infection and disease include cowpox and replicating vaccinia virus strains. The orthopoxviruses as such are generally less virulent, relative to smallpox and mpox viruses, and disease (pox lesions) caused by such orthopoxviruses may be less frequent and shows less spread across the body.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

In the EU, Imvanex is a vaccine approved to protect against smallpox (2013) and mpox and disease caused by the vaccinia virus (2022) in adults. Currently, there is no vaccine licensed specifically for patients below 18 years of age.

In relation to specific treatment, tecovirimat is the only medicinal product currently approved in the EU for the treatment of smallpox, mpox and cowpox in adults and children with body weight at least 13 kg. Tecovirimat is an inhibitor of a viral protein relevant for release of virus particles from host cells and it has been authorised based on PK modeling and testing in animal models using other orthopoxviruses than smallpox only.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

To support the current EoI, the MAH submitted interim results of the ongoing Study DMID 22-0020. This study is an open label, comparative, multicentre immunogenicity and safety study conducted in the US. The primary immunogenicity objective of study Stage 2 was to determine if peak humoral immune responses in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years following MVA-BN regimen administered SC is non-inferior to the response in adults ages 18 to 50 years. The associated endpoint was vaccinia virus specific PRNT GMT at Day 43. This interim analysis was performed based on data up to cut-off date, 22 February 2024, which includes immunogenicity data up to Study Day 43 (14 days Post Dose 2) and safety data reported through Study Day 210 (180 days Post Dose 2).

Data up to Study Day 57 are clean. Data after Study Day 57 are as reported. The MAH is requested to submit by 30-May-2025 the final CSR of study DMID 22-0020.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

In adolescents 12-17 years of age, MVA-BN elicited a high vaccinia virus-specific neutralizing immune response that was non-inferior to that mounted by adults, with GMTs at Day 14 post Dose 2 that were higher than in adults. Given the correlation between the immune response and protective effectiveness, it is inferred that MVA-BN will provide at least similar protection in adolescents than in adults against disease.

The seroconversion rates in terms of vaccinia virus-specific neutralizing antibodies observed in this study in adolescents and adults at 14 days post Dose 2 were in the range of those reported earlier at this timepoint in vaccinia-naïve healthy adults. Previously estimated seroconversion rates by PRNT in healthy adults, range 77.2- 99.8% 14 days post Dose 2 compared with 97.6% in adults and 99% in adolescents in the DMID study.

Clinical safety has been presented in the clinical overview, comparing the safety profile of adolescents and adults. No specific risks beyond the known safety-profile of similar vaccines has been identified.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

While PRNT values against vaccinia virus are acceptable for this procedure to infer effectiveness from a healthy adult population to other populations it is highly recommended to better characterize mpoxspecific response developing PRNT assays against mpox, both clade 1 and clade 2. Values from these assays could inform on potential differences in the cross-protection of MVA-BN against mpox viruses. Additionally, or alternatively other assays should be explored for their use, e.g. a binding assay.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Respective study DMID 22-0020 is still ongoing and the presented data are interim data. No specific risk beyond the known safety-profile of similar vaccines has been identified.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The presented comparison of respective AEs in adolescents and adults appears similar with no major differences (see tables 9 and 10). Regarding Injection site reactions, an overall high number of 'any local symptom' (88/91% adolescents/adults) has been presented as expected. However, there are more administration site reactions (covering skin discolouration, haemorrhage, macule, nodule, rash, and warmth). Taken together, there are no major risks identified to date.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Regarding Injection site reactions, further analyses are expected as soon as final data are available. Safety profile of Imvanex in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age will be further characterised when the final CSR as well as the RMP are submitted by 30 May 2025 since the study is still ongoing and further data cleaning is expected. Nervous system disorders, cardiac disorders and other relevant medical conditions are awaited to be addressed within the final CSR. Further, gastrointestinal disorders should be presented, comparatively (adolescents versus adults) for further discussion as soon as final data are available.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

In adolescents 12-17 years of age, MVA-BN elicited a vaccinia virus-specific neutralizing immune response that was non-inferior to that mounted by adults. Given the correlation between the immune response and protective effectiveness, it may be inferred that MVA-BN will provide at least similar protection in adolescents than in adults against disease.

Regarding unfavourable effects, Imvanex is found well-tolerated in healthy 12-17 years of age patients according to the interim data from the currently ongoing study DMID 22-0020 with a mainly similar safety-profile in adolescents as in adults. According to the current database, the most frequent injection site reaction was injection site pain (&gt;70%), and the most frequent systemic adverse reactions were fatigue (&gt; 50%) and headache (50%). However, data after Study Day 57 are as reported in the interim report. Since the study is still ongoing, safety profile will be further characterised when the final CSR is submitted.

Given the current PHEIC as declared by WHO, it is considered that the identified safety uncertainties of Imvanex in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age can be addressed post-authorisation, through the submission of the final CSR for the ongoing study DMID 22-0020 (SOB).

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Taking into account the neutralizing immune response that was non-inferior to that mounted by adults and that the overall safety profile of adolescents is comparable to the adults, the benefit risk profile of Imvanex for prevention of smallpox, mpox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in individuals 12 to 17 years of age, is considered favourable.

Therefore, approval of Imvanex extension of indication to adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age is recommended.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall benefit-risk of Imvanex is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends, by consensus, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |

Extension of indication to include active immunisation of adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Imvanex based on interim results from study DMID 22-0020. This is a Phase 2 randomised open label multicentre trial to inform Public Health strategies involving the use of MVA-BN vaccine for mpox. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC and Annex II.E are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.4.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and the Package Leaflet.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB are recommended.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan PIP P/0284/2023 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
