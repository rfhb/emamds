Cases of liver disorder including cases with fatal outcome on different uses of cholic acid were reported. Although conclusive causality cannot be established for the retrieved hepatotoxicity cases due to the patients pre-existing liver impairment and overall medical history, the role of Cholic acid in liver function deterioration could not be excluded in any of these cases. Considering the safety information for the approved use is rather limited a strengthened warning was included in the product information that treatment with cholic acid in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment should be given under close monitoring and, for all patients, should be stopped if abnormal hepatocellular function does not improve within 3 months of the initiation of treatment. The update of the product information affects sections 4.4 and 4.2 (for a cross reference to 4.4) of the SmPC. The package leaflet was updated accordingly. |
