## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Melanoma is the sixth and seventh most common malignancy in men and women, respectively: in Europe in 2012, the incidence was 39.6 cases /100.000 men and 42.5 cases /100.000 women, the mortality was approximately 8.8 cases/100.000 in males and 6.9 cases/100.000 in females, with median age at diagnosis of 59 years 1 .

There are several types of melanoma such as superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo malignant melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma and nodular melanoma amongst others. The clinical appearance of melanoma is characterised by the ABCD rule where A=Asymmetry, B=Border, C=Colour, D=Diameter and the evolution in size, colour and depth of the lesion. Typical features of melanoma lesions are asymmetry of the lesion, irregular borders, variability in colour, diameter of 5 mm and more, growth of nodules.  The pathological staging of melanoma tumours is based on the AJCC staging and classification system, which includes sentinel node staging 2 . The AJCC staging provides information on the thickness of the lesions (Breslow), information on the mitotic rate and ulceration, number of lymph nodes involved  and regression or progression of the lesion to locoregional sites (subcutaneous invasion, lymph nodes) or distant lesions with or without the presence of elevated LDH (Table 1)  3 . The clinical staging of melanoma patients is primarily based on the physical examination, imaging tests and biopsies looking at the location and size the primary tumour, degree of lymph node involvement, and presence and location of metastases 4 . The clinical staging can be divided into several groups: Stage 0, Stage I (A,B), Stage II (A,B,C), Stage III (A,B, C) and Stage IV depending on the pathological findings of the tumour characteristics (Table 2). Where Stage I and II is limited primarily at the site of the primary tumour, Stage III involves dissemination to regional lymph nodes and Stage IV includes distant disease where M1a defines metastases distant from the skin, subcutaneous or nodal, M1b metastases to the lung and M1c metastases to all other visceral sites or distant metastases to any site combined with an elevated serum LDH (Table 1).

About 90% of melanomas are diagnosed as primary tumours without any evidence of metastasis and the tumour-specific 10-year-survival for such tumours is 75-85% 5 . The 10-year-survival for patients with micrometastasis in the regional lymph nodes is 30-70%, 30-50% for patients with satellite (defined as up to 2 cm from the primary tumour) and in-transit (located in the skin between 2 cm from the site of the primary tumour and the first draining lymph node) metastases and 20-40% for those with clinically apparent regional lymph node metastases. Distant metastases have a median survival in untreated patients of only 6-9 months, although there is considerable variation 6 .

Whenever a suspicious skin lesion is removed, a histological examination is performed to investigate the pathologic characteristics and other features such as growth phase and level of invasion. Surgical removal is indicated in case of localised and locoregional disease with, in certain cases, radiotherapy and IFN gamma 7 . For systemic metastatic disease (stage IV) surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy, are indicated. The currently approved systemic treatment options include:

- ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 approved to treat previously untreated adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma; it has shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with the gp100 vaccine (10.1 versus 6.4 months; HR: 0.66; p= 0.003).
- nivolumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults; the median OS reported was &gt;14 versus 10.84 (HR=0.46;(95% CI: 0.31, 0.69; p=0.000085) for dacarbazine.
- pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 humanised monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults; it has shown a median PFS of 5.5 months (HR= 0.58; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.72; p&lt;0.00001) and 4.1 (HR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.72; p&lt;0.00001) versus 2.8 compared to ipilimumab.
- chemotherapy with dacarbazine (DTIC), used in EU countries for many years as standard first line treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. It has shown response rates ranging from 11% to 25% with 3 to 6 months of duration and a median survival time from 4.5 to 6 months 8,   9   , 10, 11 .

For melanoma tumours that have been screened and tested positive for the BRAF V600 mutation, systemic treatment options include:

- vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, approved for adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, which has shown a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.9 vs 1.6 months, respectively (HR 0.38, 95%CI: 0.32-0.46, p&lt;0.0001) and  median OS 13.6 vs 9.7 months (HR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, p&lt;0.0001) compared with DTIC.
- dabrafenib, a BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation; it has shown a median PFS of 6.9 vs 2.7 months compared

Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy that is derived from HSV-1. Talimogene laherparepvec has been modified to replicate within tumours and to produce the immune stimulatory protein human GM-CSF. Talimogene laherparepvec causes the death of tumour cells and the release of tumour-derived antigens. It is thought that together with GM-CSF, it will promote a systemic antitumour immune response and an effector T-cell response. Mice that had complete regression of their primary tumours following treatment were resistant to subsequent tumour rechallenge (section 5.1 of the SmPC).

The modifications to talimogene laherparepvec from HSV-1 include deletion of ICP34.5 and ICP47. Whereas anti-viral immune responses defend normal cells following infection by talimogene laherparepvec, tumours have been shown to be susceptible to injury and cell death from ICP34.5deficient HSV-1 viruses, including talimogene laherparepvec. Deletion of ICP47 prevents downregulation of antigen presentation molecules and increases the expression of HSV US11 gene, thereby enhancing viral replication in tumour cells (section 5.1 of the SmPC).

In addition, the coding sequence for human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF), has been inserted in place of ICP34.5.  GM-CSF is a cytokine involved in the stimulation of immune responses through its effect on antigen-presenting cells. GM-CSF can activate dendritic cells to increase antigen presentation and can potentiate both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses 12 , 13,   14 . The activation of the adaptive immune system following tumour cell lysis is thought to contribute to local and systemic immune-mediated tumour destruction of distant tumours and possibly lead to the development of immunological memory and long term control of tumour growth through immune surveillance (Figure 1).  Moreover, at the time when the clinical trials for talimogene laherparepvec were being designed, results from a single-arm phase 2 study suggested that overall and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly prolonged (compared with matched historical controls) in subjects who received post-surgical treatment with GM-CSF, and that this treatment was well-tolerated 15,   16 .

The  applicant  applied  for  the  following  indication:  'Talimogene  laherparepvec  is  indicated  for  the treatment of adults with melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (see section 5.1)'.

The final proposed indication is as follows:

Imlygic is indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (Stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease (see section 4.4 and 5.1).

Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec should be initiated and supervised by a qualified physician experienced in the treatment of cancer.

## Posology (SmPC section 4.2)

Imlygic is provided in single use vials of 1 mL each in two different concentrations:

- 10 6  (1 million) PFU/mL - For initial dose only.
- 10 8  (100 million) PFU/mL - For all subsequent doses.

The total injection volume for each treatment visit should be up to a maximum of 4 mL. The initial recommended dose is up to a maximum of 4 mL of Imlygic at a concentration of 10 6  (1 million) PFU/mL. Subsequent doses should be administered up to 4 mL of Imlygic at a concentration of 10 8  (100 million) PFU/mL.

The recommended dosing schedule for Imlygic is shown in table 1 in the SmPC section 4.2.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from the wild-type HSV-1 genome. It is an attenuated non-integrating HSV-1 that has been modified to efficiently replicate within tumours and to produce the immune stimulatory protein GM-CSF.

The therapeutic strategy of talimogene laherparepvec intralesional administration is to produce a direct oncolytic effect by replication of the modified virus in cancer cells, resulting in their lysis and local release of potential tumour antigens, and to promote a systemic anti-tumour immune response enhanced by the local expression of human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (hGMCSF) to promote antigen presentation.

Talimogene laherparepvec drug product is presented as a sterile, preservative-free solution for intralesional injection, formulated at a nominal concentration of either 10 6  PFU/mL or 10 8  PFU/mL. The drug product is supplied at a deliverable volume of 1.0 mL in single use vials to be stored, transported and supplied frozen at -80°C ± 10°C.

The 10 6  PFU/mL presentation is intended as an initial dose to be administered once to the patient, enabling HSV seroconversion prior to subsequent dosing. The 10 8  PFU/mL dose is administered subsequently for the remaining duration of treatment. The product is administered by intralesional injection into cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions. A dose up to a maximum of 4 mL is recommended for either presentation.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

## General information

The general information on nomenclature, structure and general properties is considered sufficient.

Talimogene laherparepvec was generated by modifying the wild type HSV-1 genome (new isolate JS1) in two regions. The nature of the modifications and the resulting phenotypic changes that bring about the therapeutic effects of talimogene laherparepvec are as follows:

- Functional deletion of the ICP34.5 gene enabling suppression of virus replication in normal tissue.
- Deletion of the ICP47 gene enabling up-regulation of the US11 gene, resulting in increased replication of ICP34.5 deleted HSV, without reducing tumour selectivity.
- Deletion of ICP47 gene ensuring display of cytoplasmic antigens on MHC Class I molecules enabling immunosurveillance by CD8+ T-cells.
- Insertion of the human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) expression cassette into the ICP34.5 loci, causing production and release of biologically active hGM-CSF stimulating a systemic cytotoxic immune response against tumour cells at distal locations.

Each hGM-CSF expression cassette consists of the major immediate early promoter from cytomegalovirus (CMV), the cDNA encoding hGM-CSF and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (pA). A schematic representation of the talimogene laherparepvec genome is presented below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Figure 2: Schematic representation of talimogene laherparepvec genome

<!-- image -->

The talimogene laherparepvec genome is shown with the positions of the ICP34.5 and ICP47 deletions marked as △34.5 and △47, respectively. The genome is composed of a unique long region (UL) flanked by long repeats (RL) and a unique short region (Us) flanked by short repeats (Rs). The site of the hGM-CSF cassette insertion is shown in pink and expanded to show the composition of the hGM-CSF expression cassette; the CMV promoter, hGM-CSF cDNA and a pA signal.

## Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

## Manufacturer

The sites participating in the manufacture, testing, and storage of active substance and their responsibilities were listed in the dossier and GMP certificates were provided.

## Description of manufacturing process and process controls

The talimogene laherparepvec active substance manufacturing process has been sufficiently described including information on manufacturing steps, operating parameters and in process controls. Adequate information on batch formula and batch size was submitted as well as flow charts (Figure 3).

In summary, the active substance manufacturing process includes cell expansion, virus infection and production (in roller bottles), harvest, recovery, and purification stages. The purification process consists of endonuclease digestion, clarification by filtration, ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF), two chromatography steps (IEX, SEC) and a final sterile filtration to produce the active substance. No additional filtration occurs beyond this step in drug product manufacture. The sterile filtration step therefore provides the terminal sterile filtration for the drug product.

The scale of the active substance manufacturing process is defined by the expected volume of a single bulk harvest produced by pooling the supernatants from the production roller bottles at the end of virus production, which is nominally 40 L. A single bulk harvest is purified to produce a single lot of active substance.

## Control of materials

The Applicant provides adequate information on the raw materials used in the manufacturing of talimogene laherparepvec.

Standard cloning techniques were applied to construct the plasmids used to: 1) functionally delete the two copies of the ICP34.5 gene and to insert the hGM-CSF gene into the ICP34.5 loci, and 2) to delete the ICP47 gene. Correct structure of the plasmids was confirmed by restriction digest analysis or by DNA sequencing. The cloning steps are described in the dossier to a sufficient level of detail.

The JS1/34.5-/47-/hGM-CSF talimogene laherparepvec recombinant virus was initially constructed in BHK cells through a series of transfections and homologous recombinations. The cell line was subsequently changed to Vero cells. The steps involved in the generation of the final talimogene laherparepvec virus are described in sufficient detail. Also the characterisation of the virus is adequately addressed.

For commercial production of talimogene laherparepvec, the Applicant utilises three working cell banks (WCB) originating from two different master cell banks (MCB Lot 2003-0049 (initial MCB produced at BioReliance); MCB Lot 5000-00001 which both derive from the same parental WHO Vero cell bank. Both the new and the old MCBs and WCVs have been adequately characterised and qualified in accordance with the recommendation given in ICH Q5D and ICH Q5A(R1) guidelines, as well as relevant Ph. Eur. monographs and general texts. Comparative characterisation results demonstrate that the properties of the new and old cell banks are fundamentally similar. During commercial production the oldest manufactured lot will be used until inventory is exhausted. Therefore, the approach with the multiple cell banks can be accepted, although not fully in line with the general expectations for a two-tiered cell banking system.

## Control of critical steps and intermediates

The manufacturing process is controlled through critical and key operating parameters (input parameters) and critical and key in-process controls (IPC, output performance parameters). Although this classification is not in line with ICH terminology, it was considered acceptable for the control strategy of this particular product. Based on process understanding and product quality considerations, testing for process impurities, safety related and microbial control and for process consistency has been established.

## Process validation

The talimogene laherparepvec commercial active substance manufacturing process (Process C) was validated at the BioVex Inc., Woburn facility (AWM) by demonstrating that the process when executed within defined operating parameter ranges, is robust, performs consistently and meets pre-established performance parameter acceptance criteria.

## Manufacturing process development

During the development of talimogene laherparepvec, three main manufacturing processes have been used. These manufacturing processes are designated Process A, B and C. Only three Process A batches were produced. These batches were used for non-clinical toxicology studies, as well as for an early phase I study. Process B material was applied in additional non-clinical toxicology studies and phase II clinical studies. Commercial talimogene laherparepvec will be produced using Process C which is the same manufacturing process as used for manufacture of Phase III material.

Comparability between batches manufactured using the different manufacturing processes has been adequately demonstrated.  This control approach can be supported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Characterisation

For characterisation of talimogene laherparepvec, the Applicant has considered viral structure (size, density, purity by SEC), genomic sequence, protein and glycan content, as well as biological characteristics. The studies are considered relevant and adequately conducted.

## Specification

The test methods and acceptance criteria used to assure the quality of talimogene laherparepvec active substance were listed in the application dossier.

An assessment of the appropriate placement for testing has been conducted by the Applicant. Based on this assessment, certain tests, such as the tests for process-related impurities and safety tests, have been moved upstream to be included as critical in-process controls with associated rejection limits. Although a conventional strategy is not applied, overall the control strategy is considered acceptable.

## Analytical methods

Summaries for each of the analytical procedures used to test each lot of active substance against the commercial specification are provided. Satisfactory method validation summaries are given.

## Batch analysis

Batch analyses data from 36 GMP bulk harvest and active substance lots manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facility and in support of the clinical program, that were used to establish specification acceptance criteria or used as reference standard, are presented and reveal lot to lot consistency.

## Reference materials

The description of the qualification of present and future reference standards is adequate and includes the relevant tests.

## Stability

Due to the practically continuous manufacturing process, storage of the active substance has been validated as an inprocess hold time (≤13 days at 5±3°C). Consequently, no stability data for the active substance is included in dossier.

## Comparability exercise for Active Substance

As described above in the section on Manufacturing process development three primary manufacturing processes have been used for production of talimogene laherparepvec during product development. For the change from Process A to Process B, results of comparability assessment were submitted at the time of the original clinical trial application but were not included in the original MA submission. These comparability data were, however, submitted upon request. The analytical comparability between Process B and Process C, as well as between Process C pre- and post-facility and equipment modifications are adequately addressed and comparability between batches manufactured using the different manufacturing processes has been demonstrated.

## New Active Substance Status - Quality Aspects

Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic) is an oncolytic immunotherapy derived from the wild-type herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) genome (newly isolated strain JS1; ECAAC Accession Number 01010209). It is an attenuated non-integrating HSV-1 that has been modified to efficiently replicate within tumours and to produce the immune stimulatory protein GM-CSF.

Talimogene laherparepvec can be considered as a new active substance in the European Union as it has not previously been authorised as a medical product in this region or any of its Member States.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

processed by diluting with diluent buffer in an aseptic dilution step to a target concentration in order to achieve a nominal drug product potency of 10 6  PFU/mL or 10 8  PFU/mL after product thaw. The resulting drug product formulated bulk is aseptically filled into vials, and the vials are sealed with a stopper and cap. The drug product vials undergo visual inspection and primary labelling before being frozen using a controlled rate freezing process. The finished medicinal product is stored frozen at 80°C ± 10°C. Data supporting the applicability of the ranges/limits established for operating parameters have been provided.

## Process validation

The manufacturing process for both drug product presentations has been validated at the commercial manufacturing site according to an approved protocol with predefined acceptance criteria. All lots also met the release specification requirements. Furthermore, the fill weight checks performed confirmed consistency in the filling volume of the validation lots.

## Control of excipients

All excipient comply with Ph. Eur requirements and are widely used in pharmaceutical formulations.

## Product specification

The test methods and acceptance criteria used for control and release of talimogene laherparepvec drug product are listed in the application dossier.

The proposed release testing of talimogene laherparepvec drug product is considered adequate.

In order to test for potency, three separate measurements are used. These are together evaluating the key biological functions of the virus; infection of the target cells, hGM-CSF production and hGM-CSF biological activity.

The quality of the drug product is controlled by assessing the infectious particles to viral protein ratio. As a correlation between total viral protein and total viral particles has been established, the total viral protein is considered a suitable surrogate for total viral particles. Therefore the infectious particle to total particle ratio is also covered by assessing the infectious particles to viral protein ratio.

As a release control, the Applicant is testing for visible particles in accordance with Ph. Eur 2.9.20.

## Analytical methods

Analytical methods used for drug product batch release are sufficiently described and their validity has been confirmed.

## Batch analysis

Batch analysis data for drug product lots used during clinical development and lots manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site are provided. The 59 drug product lots filled (from 36 active substance lots) include 43 at 10 8  PFU/mL nominal dose, and 16 at 10 6  PFU/mL nominal dose lots. Batch data reveal lot to lot consistency.

## Reference materials

The characterisation and qualification of the current reference standard BP1104HA, as well as the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

testing and qualification program established for future reference standards, is adequate.

## Container closure system

The container closure system consists of a 2 mL 13 mm cyclic olefin polymer (COP) plastic resin vial, a 13 mm elastomeric stopper with a fluoropolymer laminated plug and a cross-linked silicon top, and an aluminium seal with a flip-off dust cover. All product contact container closure components are manufactured to comply with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and European Pharmacopoeia (PhEur) requirements.

## Stability of the product

The provided stability data support the claimed shelf life in the SmPC.

For assessing drug product stability, the Applicant has conducted real time, real-condition stability studies using a large number of drug product batches produced with the commercial manufacturing). The data set includes 42 lots of 10 8  PFU/mL and 16 lots of 10 6  PFU/mL, with stability data available for 48 months from seven primary lots of 10 8  PFU/mL drug product and three primary lots for the 10 6 PFU/mL drug product. The stability indicating properties of the assays used in the studies have been adequately addressed. Based on the results from the real-time, real-condition studies, the recommended long-term storage condition of -80°C for 48 months is considered acceptable.

In addition to the real time, real-condition stability studies, the Applicant has provided limited stability data from studies conducted under accelerated and stressed storage conditions, as well as from light exposure, thaw temperature and 5°C post thaw storage studies. As expected, decreased stability was seen for samples stored at evaluated temperatures, with faster degradation of 10 6  PFU/mL batches compared to 10 8  PFU/mL batches. Based on the thaw temperature studies and the 5°C post long-term storage studies, the Applicant has established the thawing and in use stability conditions as following 'thawing drug product at room temperature for a maximum of 30 minutes followed by storage at 5°C for up 48 hours for 10 8  PFU/mL drug product and up to 12 hours for 10 6  PFU/mL drug product strengths'. This is considered acceptable.

The post-approval stability program and commitment are considered adequate. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

## Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product

Active substance and drug product process, analytical, non-clinical and clinical comparability data has been submitted. An assessment of drug product, including stability evaluations was performed for each comparability exercise and comparability was shown, also between the commercial and clinical trial formulations.

## Adventitious agents

## Non-viral adventitious agents

The talimogene laherparepvec manufacturing process incorporates control measures to prevent contamination and maintain microbial control. Assessments were performed by Amgen on all raw materials used to produce talimogene laherparepvec, from the working cell banks and working virus seed stocks (WVSS) through the final drug product, to determine if any of the raw materials are of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

animal origin or have product contact with materials of animal origin. An assessment of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) risk was conducted by the Applicant according to the principles in the Note for Guidance on Minimizing the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMA/410/01). Based on the assessment, the TSE risk associated with talimogene laherparepvec was determined to be negligible.

## Viral adventitious agents

Due to the intrinsic properties of the talimogene laherparepvec virus, viral clearance steps that are typically applied in the purification process of a biologic would inactivate or remove the desired product. Thus, the approach to viral safety in the talimogene laherparepvec manufacturing process is based on multiple layers of risk mitigation, including rigorous control of raw and starting materials, use of a cell substrate (Vero) with a proven safety profile, appropriate cGMP procedures and facility design features, extensive viral testing of cell banks, virus seed stocks, end of production cells and viruses at the limit of manufacturing age, and viral testing at strategic points in the manufacturing process. This multilayered approach minimizes the risk of viral contamination to provide assurance of safety.

As requested, the Applicant has removed the in vivo test for viral contaminants performed at the viral harvest stage. Based on a risk assessment, the Applicant will maintain the existing in vitro assay for viral contaminants performed on each production lot. This approach is endorsed.

In conclusion, the adventitious agents safety evaluation has been properly addressed and adequately presented.

## GMO

The GMO, talimogene laherparepvec (JS1/ICP34.5-/ICP47-/hGM-CSF), is a disabled recombinant herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1). Talimogene laherparepvec was generated by modifying the wild type HSV-1 genome (new isolate JS1) to functionally delete both copies of ICP34.5 and the ICP47 gene from the viral backbone and to insert an expression cassette encoding the human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) gene in both ICP34.5 regions. (See Environmental Risk Assessment ).

## Post approval change management protocol

As part of the MA application for Imlygic, Amgen has submitted a post-approval change management protocol (PACMP). The purpose of the PACMP is to scale up the cell build process for talimogene laherparepvec. Following approval of the marketing authorisation and the PACMP, the changes described in the protocol will be introduced through a type IB variation application procedure.

The proposed changes have been adequately presented and discussed. The minor revisions and/or clarifications requested have been agreed by the Applicant, the final updated PACMP will be submitted with the eCTD closing sequence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The documentation in the quality dossier gives an adequate description of the characterisation, manufacture and control of the active substance and drug product. The information provided demonstrates consistent batch-to-batch production of Imlygic achieving a well-defined quality for the active substance and the drug product. The adventitious agents safety evaluation has been properly addressed and the non-viral and viral safety of the product is considered demonstrated.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of Imlygic is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects as described above.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CAT recommends two points for further investigation.

The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the recommendation(s) for future quality development as described above.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology programs have included studies designed to evaluate the mechanism of action, biodistribution and shedding, general safety of talimogene laherparepvec following single and repeat administration, and effects on embryo-foetal development. In vivo pharmacodynamics studies were performed in nude (xenograft studies) or immunocompetent (syngeneic studies) BALB/c mice.  A mouse surrogate HSV-1 vector encoding the murine GM-CSF (OncoVEX mGM-CSF ; JS1/34.5-/47-/mGM-CSF) was developed and used for the in vivo mouse studies because of the inability of human GM-CSF to bind to mouse GM-CSF receptor. Such studies include the analysis of anti-tumour effect of OncoVEX mGM-CSF  on mice previously exposed to wild type HSV-1. Nonclinical pharmacokinetic evaluation included studies addressing biodistribution, viral shedding, and replication of talimogene laherparepvec. The nonclinical toxicology studies consisted of general toxicity studies up to 12 weeks in mice and an embryo-foetal development study in mice. Additional single dose studies were also conducted in rats and dogs. Pivotal repeat-dose toxicology, biodistribution, and embryo-foetal development studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

In vitro

Assessment of the in vitro lysis of human tumour cells by OncoVEX GM-CSF  ( talimogene laherparepvec) using a CPE (cell pathological effect) assay (Studies 4648-00035, 4648-00055)

The lytic effect of talimogene laherparepvec was assessed in a range of human tumour cell lines (melanoma , colorectal, breast, brain, pharynx, prostate, and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines). Cells were infected with talimogene laherparepvec at MOI 0.1 and 1 and lytic effect (% of cell death) and analysed at 24 and 48 hours by differential cell count using trypan blue staining. The single incubation time (24 h or 48 h), for each cell line with the greatest range of % cell death, was selected for the analysis of secreted hGM-CSF and measured by ELISA.  The results are presented in Table 3 and showed dose- and time dependent response. Melanoma cell line (SK-MEL-28) was highly susceptible to infection with talimogene laherparepvec, resulting in 48% and 89 % cell death at MOI of 0.1 and 1, respectively after 24 hours of infection, and 84 % and 100% cell death at MOI 0.1 and 1, respectively after 48 hours of infection.  After 24 hours of infection, melanoma cell line (SK-MEL-28) secreted hGMCSF 69 ng/mL and 140 mg/mL at MOI of 0.1 and 1, respectively.

Cellular mediated immune response in A20 tumour bearing mice treated with JS1/34.5-/47- (Study 4648-00071)

Measurement of CT26-specific cytotoxic T- lymphocytes after intra-tumoral injection of mouse surrogate into CT26 tumour bearing female BALB/c mice (Study R20130079)

These studies investigated the T cell immune response in mice bearing A20 tumors treated with JS1/34.5-/47- (OncoVEX backbone). Immune-response was measured ex vivo by the T-lymphocyte activation as a response to IFN Ɣ release and by development of specific cytotoxic T-cells using cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assay (CTL). The IFN Ɣ release was stimulated most notably in splenocytes isolated from the mice treated with mouse surrogate and incubated with A20 tumour cells (Figure 3). The stimulation of IFN Ɣ release was seen at the earliest time point tested (3 days) and remained high during the study duration (up to 7 days). Moderate levels of IFN Ɣ release was detected at 5 days in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

splenocytes isolated from the JS1/34.5-/47- treated mice as a specific response to the A20 tumour cells. Splenocytes were incubated with A20 tumour cells (+A20) or without (-A20).

In vivo

Efficacy of Talimogene Laherparepvec in the B16F10- muNectin1 Melanoma Syngeneic Tumour Model in Female C57BL/6 Mice ( Study R20150003 )

Tumours were initiated by SC implantation of 1 x 10 5  B16F10/mNectin-1 tumour cells into the right flank of C57BL/6 mice.  After 10 days, animals (n=10) received 3 intratumoural doses of 5 x 10 6  PFU (50 µ L) of talimogene laherparepvec (or other viral constructs or vehicle) on days 10, 13, and 16. The animals in the control group received intratumoral injection of formulation buffer. One group of mice (n=10) received only one dose of talimogene laherparepvec at day 10 post tumour implantation.

Intratumoral administration of a single dose and 3 doses of talimogene laherparepvec produced statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) anti-tumour effect in the mouse syngeneic melanoma model (Figure 4).

## Anti-tumour efficacy of Imlygic in immunosuppressed mice

Assessment of the safety and anti-tumour efficacy in immunosuppressed BALB/c mice bearing A20 induced tumours (Study 4648-00011 )

This study evaluated the effect of induced immunosuppression on talimogene laherparepvec efficacy. A20 tumour bearing mice were given cyclosporin (50 mg/kg) from 2 days before first dose of talimogene laherparepvec (or hGM-CSF deficient talimogene laherparepvec) throughout the study. Control animals were terminated at day 18 due to tumour burden. The talimogene laherparepvec treated mice were terminated on day 27. One animal was found dead in the JS1/34.5-/47- (hGM-CSF

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

deficient talimogene laherparepvec) group at week 4. Death was thought to be due to peritonitis, possibly caused by i.p. administration of cyclosporin.

With immunosuppression the tumour diameters were significantly smaller in the talimogene laherparepvec (or GM-CSF deficient talimogene laherparepvec) groups as compared to the control at day 14 and 18 (Figure 7 p&lt;0.0001). Significant levels of serum HSV antibodies were seen in treated animals on day 27. Antibody levels were similar in the talimogene laherparepvec and hGM-CSF deficient talimogene laherparepvec treated groups.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

## Biodistribution

The distribution and persistence of talimogene laherparepvec at the site of administration as well as in blood and all other tissues were evaluated based on qPCR results from the biodistribution studies conducted in naïve or tumour-bearing BALB/c mice following single or multiple subcutaneous, intravenous and intratumoral dosing (Table 5) and in addition, viral shedding was evaluated in tumourbearing BALB/c mice (Study 115857). The study designs of biodistribution studies in mice are summarised in the Table 5.

OncoVEX GM-CSF :  Single  Dose  Biodistribution  Study  in  the  Mouse  with  an  84-Day  Observation  Period (study 4648-00030)

In mice who received a single IV administration of 0.6x10 7  PFU talimogene laherparepvec, viral DNA was detected in all samples collected from the site of administration (tail vein) at 24 hours post dose, but declined to 67% of samples testing positive at 14 days post dose, and 50% of samples testing positive at 28 days post dose. Viral DNA was not detected in any samples from the site of administration at 56 days post dose (Table 6). Viral DNA was detected in at least 1 sample from all of the tissues tested throughout the study. However, the majority of positive samples came from the site of administration (tail vein), blood, or organs with high blood perfusion (heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and spleen). Of the mice who received a single SC administration of 0.6x10 7  PFU talimogene laherparepvec, all tissues tested negative at 24 hours post dose with the exception of the injection site which tested positive in all animals.

OncoVEX GM-CSF : Repeat Dose Toxicity and QPCR Biodistribution Study in the Mouse Followed by a 24hour, 28 or 56-Day Observation Period (Study 4648-00027)

The biodistribution arm of study was designed to examine the tissue distribution and duration of talimogene laherparepvec in BALB/c mice. After multiple SC administrations of 1x10 7  PFU talimogene laherparepvec, all tissues tested did not have detectable viral DNA at 24 hours after the last dose, with the exception of the injection site in 5 of 6 animals and the blood of 2 of 6 animals (Table 7). At 29 days after the final dose (Day 42), only injection site and blood samples were tested ; one blood sample was below the LLOQ (&lt;6.4 copies/0.1 µg extracted DNA).

Across the nonclinical program, quantifiable levels of talimogene laherparepvec DNA in brain, assessed by quantitative PCR analysis, was observed in three samples collected at least 14 days after initiation of dosing. In Study 4648-00028, one animal dosed with talimogene laherparepvec (1x10 7  PFU, as 5 weekly intravenous doses) had quantifiable DNA in brain (Day 84, 2,427 copies/μg DNA). In Study 115857, two animals dosed with talimogene laherparepvec (1x10 5  PFU, as 3 intratumoral doses every third day) had quantifiable DNA in brain (Day 58: 13,325 copies/μg DNA; Day 91: 635 copies/μg DNA). In Study 115857, talimogene laherparepvec was studied following multiple intratumoral administrations and samples from brain and shedding tissues were analyzed through 84 days after dosing; analyses of eyes and gonads samples were curtailed after earlier results demonstrated no evidence indicating biodistribution to these tissues. Through up to 3 months post-dose, low copies of virus were detected only in liver, lymph node and spleen, indicating active immune surveillance and clearance of virus; no virus was detected in other tissues except one positive brain sample. No positive result was seen in ovaries or testes 7 days after dosing. Specific assessments of trigeminal ganglia (or other peripheral nerves) were not included in this study

## Viral shedding

Viral shedding in BALB/c mice was measured by a plaque assay (Study 4648-00010). Viral shedding of talimogene laherparepvec in excreta (urine and feces) and shedding tissues (lachrymal glands, nasal mucosa, and salivary glands) were evaluated based on qPCR results from the biodistribution studies conducted in naïve or tumour-bearing BALB/c mice (Studies 4648-00030, 4648-00027, 4648-00028, and 115857).

Following a single IV or SC administration of 0.6x10 7  PFU talimogene laherparepvec to naïve BALB/c mice (Study 4648-00030), urine samples were collected at 0 to 18 hours post dose from 10 mice (4M, 6F) in the IV dose group and from 9 mice (4M, 5F) in the SC dose group for analysis of viral DNA by qPCR. Of the urine samples from IV dosed animals one sample tested positive, five were marginally positive, and four samples were negative for viral DNA (Table 8). Of the urine samples from SC dosed animals two male and one female urine samples tested negative for viral DNA, and two male and 4 female urine samples were marginally positive.

Following multiple SC doses of 1x10 7  PFU talimogene laherparepvec to BALB/c mice (Study 464800028), at 24 hours post dose, 8/10 urine samples were negative and 2 samples were below the assay limit of quantification.  At 4 weeks post dose, all urine samples were negative. As the 4-week urine samples were negative, samples collected at 12 weeks post dose were not analysed.

Following three intratumoral injections of talimogene laherparepvec (Study 115857), viral DNA in urine samples could not be determined due to sample inhibition during qPCR analysis.

Following intraprostatic administration to dogs talimogene laherparepvec was not detected in urine at any time points (study 4648-00032).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Viral shedding was studied following three intratumoral injections of talimogene laherparepvec at 1x10 5  or 5x10 5  PFU/mouse/dose in A20-bearing BALB/c mice (Study 115857). Shedding tissues (lachrymal glands, nasal mucosa, and salivary glands) or excreta (urine and feces) samples were collected and evaluated on Day 8, 14 and 91 (ie, 24 hours, 7 days, and 84 days post last dose). Among shedding tissues or excreta, viral DNA was not detected in samples collected from lachrymal glands, nasal mucosa or feces. One animal was identified with a positive qPCR signal in salivary glands at 42 days post last dose.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

Information on the acute tolerability of talimogene laherparepvec was obtained from short-term studies evaluating repeated-dose administration under clinically-relevant conditions. These studies include evaluation of intra-tumoral injection in tumour-bearing animals to assess tolerability under conditions allowing viral replication as anticipated in patients, and SC and IV injection in tumour-free mice to inform the safety of talimogene laherparepvec under conditions that are similar to the planned clinical dosing route in a study unconfounded by the presence of a tumour.

## Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity studies with talimogene laherparepvec were not conducted.

## Repeat dose toxicity

Exploratory and GLP-compliant repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted in Balb/c mice with up to 12 weekly doses.

## Genotoxicity

No genotoxicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion).

## Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). However, the applicant provided a review of published literature of epidemiology studies evaluating the potential of an association of HSV-1 and human cancers.

## Epidemiology of HSV-1 infection and cancer risk in human populations

Searches of PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health), most recently updated during the week of November 2, 2013, conducted using the search terms 'HSV-1' or 'herpes simplex virus', 'cancer', and 'epidemiology' identified 24 articles. These articles were reviewed to establish their relevance and to identify any additional studies that may describe the cancer risk in humans from HSV-1 infection.  The resulting relevant literature is summarized in Table 12.

## Reproduction and developmental toxicity

The potential for reproductive or developmental toxicity of talimogene laherparepvec was evaluated in an embryo-foetal toxicity study conducted in the mouse.

The applicant did not submit prenatal and postnatal development studies or in juvenile animals (see non-clinical discussion).

## Embryo-foetal development

## Talimogene  Laherparepvec:  Intravenous  Embryo-Foetal  Development  Study  in  the  BALB/cAnNCrI Mouse (Study 117250)

This GLP-compliant embryo-foetal development study was conducted to evaluate the effect of talimogene laherparepvec on embryo-foetal development in mice, and to assess the placental transfer of talimogene laherparepvec. Pregnant mice (N=35/group) received control article, 1x10 5 , 1x10 6  and 1x10 7  PFU/mouse talimogene laherparepvec intravenously on Gestation Days (GD) 6, 9, 12, and 15. Additional satellite animals (N=6/group) were used for assessment of viral DNA content in maternal and foetal blood by qPCR.

There were no talimogene laherparepvec-related mortalities at any dose. All mice survived to scheduled euthanasia, with the exception of two mice treated with 10 6  PFU/mouse (GD9 and GD11), and one mouse treated with 10 7  PFU/dose (GD15), who died as a result of a suspected dosing error or accidental injury. There were no talimogene laherparepvec-related maternal clinical signs or macroscopic observations at any dose. No effects on maternal body weight were observed among mice treated with 10 5  PFU/mouse or 10 6  PFU/mouse. Among mice treated with 10 7  PFU/mouse, a transient decrease in maternal body weight was found on GD6 to 7 and GD9 to 10, resulting in statistically decreased body weight compared to controls on GD7, 8 and 10. Body weights quickly recovered after the first two doses, and no differences in body weights were identified in the high dose group through the rest of the study.

There were no effects on maternal food consumption or gravid uterine weights at any dose.

Pregnancy was confirmed in 21, 15, 18 and 15 mice of the control, 10 5 , 10 6  and 10 7  PFU/mouse groups, respectively. There were no talimogene laherparepvec-related effects on ovarian or uterine parameters. The litter averages for corpora lutea, implantations, the percentage of preimplantation loss, litter sizes, live fetuses, early and late resorptions, foetal body weights, the percentage of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

postimplantation loss, the percentage of resorbed conceptuses, and the percentage of live male fetuses were comparable among all groups.

Talimogene laherparepvec did not increase the incidence of foetal external, visceral or skeletal malformations or variations.

## Placental transfer

Study 117250 was conducted to evaluate the effects of talimogene laherparepvec on pregnancy and embryo-foetal development in BALB/c AnNCrl mice and to assess placental transfer of talimogene laherparepvec. Pregnant BALB/c mice were treated with control, 1x10 5  PFU/dose, 1x10 6  PFU/dose, or 1x10 7  PFU/dose talimogene laherparepvec via lateral tail vein injection on gestation days 6, 9, 12, and 15. Maternal and pooled foetal blood samples were collected on gestation day 18.

Viral DNA was detected in the blood of all dams treated with talimogene laherparepvec, and a dosedependent increase in mean viral DNA concentrations was observed across treatment groups (~7.2 x10 4 , 6.5x10 5  and 4.7x10 6 viral copies/μg genomic DNA in the 1x1 0 5 , 1x10 6  and 1x10 7  PFU/mouse dose groups, respectively).

Viral DNA concentrations were below the assay limit of detection in pooled foetal blood samples from the 1x10 5  and 1x10 6  PFU/mouse dose groups, and in 3/4 samples from the 1x10 7  PFU/mouse dose group. Viral DNA was found in one pooled foetal blood sample from the high dose group (1x10 7 PFU/mouse) at very low concentrations (~44 viral copies/μg genomic DNA), representing less than 0.001% of the concurrent maternal blood viral DNA concentration (~5.4x10 6 viral copies/μg genomic DNA).

## Other toxicity studies

## Immunogenicity

No  studies  evaluated  the  immunogenicity  of  human  GM-CSF  encoded  by  talimogene  laherparepvec (see non-clinical discussion).

## Immunotoxicity

No studies evaluated the immunotoxicity of talimogene laherparepvec (see non-clinical discussion).

## The Effect of Acyclovir on Replication of OncoVEX GM-CSF  (Study 4648-00024)

The sensitivity of talimogene laherparepvec and its parental strain, JS1, to acyclovir, a standard-ofcare anti-viral therapeutic used to treat HSV-1 infection was assessed in an in vitro plaque reduction assay using Vero cells. Talimogene laherparepvec and JS1 parental strain had similar sensitivity towards acyclovir, with an average concentration of drug required to produce 50% inhibition of viral cytopathic effect or plaque formation (IC50) of 0.24 and 0.31 µg/mL, respectively.  The in vitro sensitivity of wild-type HSV-1 viruses towards acyclovir has been reported to range from 0.02 to 0.7 µg/mL, and is lower than the plasma levels achieved clinically after a 1 hour infusion of 10 mg/kg acyclovir (range from 14.1 to 44.1 µg/mL).

Talimogene Laherparepvec: Tolerability and Anti-Tumour Effects on Human Colorectal Carcinoma (HT29) Tumours in CB17 SCID and BALB/c Nude Mice (Study 118737)

This  study evaluated  the  tolerability  and  anti-tumour  activity  of  talimogene  laherparepvec  following repeated intratumoral  injection  in  HT-29  tumours  implanted  into CB17  SCID  (lacking  both  T  and  B cells) and BALB/c nude mice (athymic mice).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HT-29 human colorectal carcinomas were initiated in 30 female CB17 SCID mice and 18 female BALB/c nude mice by SC injection of 5x10 6  cells into the right flank of each animal. After tumour volumes reached approximately 100 mm 3  talimogene laherparepvec (5x10 6  PFU) was administered as three intratumoral injections every third day to BALB/c nude mice and SCID mice (9-10/group). Mice were monitored for clinical signs and body weight. Select animals underwent necropsy and collected tissues were examined microscopically.

Intratumoral injection of talimogene laherparepvec resulted in regression of HT-29 human colorectal carcinomas implanted in both CB17 SCID and BALB/c nude mice. In CB17 SCID mice treated with talimogene laherparepvec  there were adverse clinical signs, including body weight loss, hypoactivity, and poor response to stimuli on day 17. Between days 18 and 21, all SCID mice treated with talimogene laherparepvec were found dead or euthanized.

Macroscopic observations of the talimogene laherparepvec-treated SCID mice were thin, flaccid, fluiddistended intestines, principally involving the ileum, cecum and large bowel. Several mice had ulcerated skin overlying the flank tumours. There was minimal to marked myenteric neuron necrosis and/or intranuclear viral inclusion bodies, presumed to be HSV-1, in the distal small and large intestines (5/6 mice). The viral inclusion bodies and necrosis in enteric neurons in the distal small and large intestines was presumed to have led to myenteric nervous system dysfunction and impaired peristalsis, consistent with weight loss and the appearance of flaccid/fluid filled gut loops. Moderate to marked necrosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in the skin overlying the tumour in 4/5 mice and this correlated with the presence of skin ulcers observed at necropsy. Mild skin ulcers with intranuclear inclusion bodies were also observed in the dorsal skin of 3/5 mice and perineal skin of 2/3 mice. Additional lesions included mild, focal neuronal intranuclear inclusion bodies in the brain (1/7 mice); moderate necrosis and intranuclear inclusion bodies in the pineal gland (1/7 mice); mild to marked foci of necrosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the adrenal gland (5/5 mice); minimal to mild foci of necrosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies in pancreatic Islet of Langerhans (2/5 mice); and minimal to moderate foci of retinal necrosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies and mild to moderate endophthalmitis (2/4 mice). No intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in other organs examined. These histopathology findings were attributed to treatment with talimogene laherparepvec.

BALB/c nude mice tolerated treatment with talimogene laherparepvec, with no evidence of adverse clinical signs or altered body weight changes, and were euthanized on day 32; mice from this cohort were not submitted for necropsy.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The environmental risk assessment was performed in accordance with Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and following the precautionary principle using the methodology set down in Commission Decision 2002/623/EC, and EMA guidelines on environmental risk assessments for medicinal products consisting of, or containing GMOs (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/473191/2006) and on scientific requirements for the environmental risk assessment of gene therapy medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/GTWP/125491/2006).

HSV-1 is a human pathogen, as such the risk for environmental spreading to the other species is considered negligible. The transmission of talimogene laherparepvec to an unintended human recipient and establishment of latency/ re-activation was considered a potential risk. In the worst case scenario, it is assumed that talimogene laherparepvec is able to spread in the environment, infect an unintended human recipient and establishment of latency/ re-activation and may also infect immunocompromised individuals. The tropism and infection capability of talimogene laherparepvec is not considered be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

different to the wild type HSV1. However, after the infection the replication capability, neurovirulence potential, pathogenicity and potential to establish latency is attenuated compared to the wild type HSV-1.  Talimogene laherparepvec is estimated to be 1:100 - 1:10 000 -fold less neurovirulent and pathogenic than the wild type HSV-1. The modifications facilitate replication in tumours compared to normal cells.

The most likely individuals who may be at risk from inadvertent transmission would be healthcare workers involved in the administration of talimogene laherparepvec and patient care, others involved in caring for the patient, which may include washing affected areas and changing dressings and the close contacts of the treated individual. The likelihood of transmission to occur at the site of talimogene laherparepvec administration. The likelihood of transmission is limited by the use as a prescription only medicine for the treatment of adults with melanoma in accordance with its approved product labelling,  administered by a healthcare professional in an oncology treatment setting, which have the appropriate facilities to handle GMO's. Outside the host, talimogene laherparepvec is not surviving long periods of time and is relatively rapidly inactivated. The potential for exposure from the environment at the site of administration is considered negligible.

The most likely mechanism of exposure during administration is estimated to be accidental exposures, such  as  needle-stick  injuries  to  the  healthcare  personnel.  The  potential  for  exposure  from  the environment at the site of administration is considered negligible.

The magnitude of consequences and the likelihood for exposure during administration and following administration in immunocompetent individuals is considered low. The magnitude of consequences of talimogene laherparepvec transmission to immune-compromised and pregnant individuals is considered moderate to high.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The pharmacology studies evaluated the anti-tumour response of talimogene laherparepvec in various human and murine tumour cells models in vitro and in vivo in mouse tumour models carrying subcutaneous tumours of human or of mouse origin. Most of the tumour cells tested were susceptible for talimogene laherparepvec infection, including melanoma cells, which resulted in a potent direct cytotoxic effect in vitro . In vivo, intratumoural injection of talimogene laherparepvec resulted in a direct, anti-tumour effect i.e. significant tumour regression and clearance of tumours at the injected site as well as a systemic anti-tumour response where regression and clearance of the non-injected contralateral tumours in the immunocompetent mouse was observed. The direct and systemic antitumour effects were dose dependent, with the greatest anti-tumour effect seen with the highest dose (three doses of 5 x 10 6 ). Tumour regrowth occurred in some of the in vivo studies after the delivery of talimogene laherparepvec was ceased. The B16F10- muNectin1 melanoma syngeneic tumour model showed that talimogene laherparepvec delivered the anti-tumour efficiency in a melanoma in vivo model. The enhanced systemic anti-tumour effect was obtained with the addition of the GM-CSF cassette compared to infection of the tumours with a vector lacking the GM-CSF gene.

The nonclinical pharmacokinetic evaluation focused mainly on addressing biodistribution, viral shedding, and replication of talimogene laherparepvec as traditional pharmacokinetic studies are not relevant for oncolytic viruses such as talimogene laherparepvec. Biodistribution of talimogene laherparepvec was evaluated following subcutaneous, intravenous and intratumoural administration in naïve and tumour-bearing mice. The biodistribution was most extensive after intravenous dosing, followed by intratumoural and subcutaneous dosing. Highest contents of viral DNA were detected in the injection site (tumour or subcutaneous site in the flank of the animal), blood and organs and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tissues with high blood perfusion such as heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and spleen. Generally, the viral DNA was cleared rapidly possibly due to an anti-HSV antibody response, but presence of viral DNA was detected in some tissues after a prolonged time up to 84 days after the last dose suggesting persistence and possible replication of virus. Viral DNA was detected in low number of samples in the brain, testes, ovaries, duodenum, liver, lung, lymph node and spleen. The evaluation of viral DNA presence in the brain and in the trigeminal ganglia was performed primarily at early time points, and as a result, no conclusion can be drawn on the possible persistence of talimogene laherparepvec in the nervous system. Although no evidence of the presence of viral DNA in the brain has been shown in clinical studies, this is considered a potential safety concern (symptomatic talimogene laherparepvec infection in non-tumour tissue in treated patients) and has been included in the RMP. There is a warning that has been included in the SmPC in section 4.4. Furthermore, a post-authorisation prospective cohort study of patients treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical practice to characterise the risk of herpetic illness among patients, close contacts, and healthcare providers will be conducted. The risk will also be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. In addition, viral DNA was also detected in lumbar and cervical spinal cord after injection of talimogene laherparepvec in the prostate in dogs. These results indicate that even though ICP34.5 has been removed from the viral genome, the virus still has some affinity for nervous system tissue.

At doses up to 4 x 10 8  PFU/kg or 10 7  PFU/dose (60-fold over the highest proposed clinical dose), single or repeated doses of talimogene laherparepvec administered by SC, IV, or intratumoural injection were well tolerated in immunocompetent mice, rats, and dogs. No neuropathology or adverse neurological effects were observed. In an in vivo study of intracerebral injection, talimogene laherparepvec was 10,000-fold less neurovirulent as compared to the wild-type HSV-1 dose that results in death 50% of the time in mice (smPC section 5.3).

Biodistribution of talimogene laherparepvec after intratumoral administration was evaluated in A20 tumour-bearing BALB/c mice following three doses of 1x10 5  PFU, or 5x10 5  PFU. Viral DNA was detected in 90% and 100% of tumour samples collected at 24 hours post dose in the low and high dose groups, respectively. The number of tumour samples positive for viral DNA declined at subsequent sampling time points. Viral DNA was not detectable in any samples collected between 50 and 70 days post last dose, while coming up again at 84 days post last dose in approximately 15% and 25% of tumour samples from the low and high dose groups, respectively.

Viral shedding was addressed by evaluation of talimogene laherparepvec excretion to urine and faeces, and to the shedding tissues lachrymal gland, salivary gland and nasal mucosa. The data suggest that viral excretion to urine or faeces is very low, and likewise, viral shedding to lachrymal glands, nasal mucosa and salivary glands is low. One salivary gland sample tested positive at 28-42 days time point. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that the risk of shedding and transmission to third parties is small.

Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted. This is acceptable considering the mode of action for talimogene laherparepvec.

The toxicology program included evaluation of safety of talimogene laherparepvec following repeated subcutaneous dosing for up to 12 weeks in the BALB/c mouse, tolerability of talimogene laherparepvec in tumour bearing mice, and embryo-foetal developmental toxicity in the BALB/c mice. One study (4648-00026) was considered a failed study and it was subsequently repeated (4648-00027). Pivotal repeat-dose toxicology, biodistribution, and embryo-foetal development studies were performed in accordance with the GLP regulations. The toxicity data were collected following a single and repeated subcutaneous and intratumoural administrations of talimogene laherparepvec to naïve or tumourbearing mice. Talimogene laherparepvec was well tolerated after intratumoral injection up to a dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

level of 5x10 6  PFU in tumour-bearing animals under conditions allowing viral replication as anticipated in patients, as well as after subcutaneous administration in tumour-free mice up to a dose level of 10 7 PFU. Signs of systemic toxicity were not observed. Generally, the findings that were observed were reversible. Deaths of mice that were reported in the toxicology studies were determined not to be related to treatment with talimogene laherparepvec. In accordance with ICH S6(R1) guideline, genotoxicity studies were not conducted. Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically-modified HSV-1 virus, which is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that forms stable, circular episomes and does not integrate with host DNA.  Review of the published literature showed no evidence that HSV-1 viruses interact with host DNA or cause genotoxicity or mutagenesis. The genotoxic potential of talimogene laherparepvec has not been evaluated in longterm animal or human studies. Because wild-type HSV-1 does not integrate into the host genome, the risk of insertional mutagenesis with talimogene laherparepvec is negligible (SmPC section 5.3). In accordance with the ICH S9 guideline, no carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. The carcinogenic potential for an HSV-1-based therapy was evaluated by review of the available epidemiological data. In addition, because talimogene laherparepvec is genetically modified so as to reduce efficient replication in normal cells, any inherent risk of carcinogenesis associated with treatment is anticipated to be reduced as compared to wild-type HSV-1. Given the extensive human exposure to HSV-1, and in view of the mechanism of action of talimogene laherparepvec, it is considered highly unlikely that talimogene laherparepvec will induce tumour development or proliferation. The carcinogenic potential of talimogene laherparepvec has not been evaluated in longterm animal or human studies. However, available data for talimogene laherparepvec and wild-type HSV-1 do not indicate a carcinogenic risk in humans (SmPC section 5.3). No significant adverse effects on maternal functions or on the foetus were observed in the embryofoetal developmental toxicity study conducted in mice. Viral DNA was detected in foetal blood representing less than 0.001% of the concurrent maternal blood viral DNA concentration suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec is capable of crossing the placental barrier. Placental transfer was evaluated in an embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study. Viral DNA was detected in one pooled foetal blood sample from the high dose group (1x10 7  PFU) at low concentrations representing less than 0.001% of the concurrent maternal blood viral DNA concentration. These data suggest that talimogene laherparepvec is capable of crossing the placental barrier. A warning on the risk of placental transfer in pregnant women has been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. There were no impacts to male or female reproductive tissues following treatment of adult mice at doses up to 4 x 10 8  PFU/kg (60-fold higher, on a PFU/kg basis, compared to the maximum clinical dose). No effects on embryo-foetal development were observed when talimogene laherparepvec was administered during organogenesis to pregnant mice at doses up to 4 x 10 8  (400 million) PFU/kg (60-fold higher, on a PFU/kg basis, compared to the maximum clinical dose). Negligible amounts (&lt; 0.001% of maternal blood levels) of talimogene laherparepvec DNA were found in foetal blood (SmPC section 5.3). Various local injection site reactions consistent with local irritation and development of an immune response from the repeated subcutaneous injections, such as cellulitis and inflammation, fasciitis and fibrosis, dermatitis and myositis/myopathy were observed. Across these studies, local injection site reactions were either absent at the end of the recovery period, or demonstrated resolution or healing.

The tolerability of repeated intratumoral injections of talimogene laherparepvec was evaluated in two immunocompromised mice strains, the BALB/c nude mice and the SCID mice. Talimogene laherparepvec was injected into various xenograft tumours at doses up to 2 x 10 8  PFU/kg (30-fold over

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the highest proposed clinical dose) in immunodeficient mice (nude and SCID). Lethal systemic viral infection was observed in up to 20% of nude mice (primarily deficient in T lymphocyte function) and 100% of SCID mice (devoid of both T and B lymphocytes). Across studies, fatal disseminated viral infection was observed in 14% of nude mice following treatment with talimogene laherparepvec at doses that are 10 to 100-fold higher than those that result in 100% lethality with wild-type HSV-1 (SmPC section 5.3).  Talimogene laherparepvec infected cells were sensitive to acyclovir treatment. Based on the non-clinical data, disseminated herpetic infection in severely immunocompromised individuals (those with any severe congenital or acquired cellular and/or humoral immune deficiency) has been identified as an important identified risk in the RMP. Severely immunocompromised patients are contraindicated in the SmPC (SmPC section 4.3).

The assessment of the ERA concluded that the most likely mechanism of exposure of talimogene laherparepvec in the environment would be accidental exposures, such as needle-stick injuries to the healthcare personnel, during the administration of the product. The transmission of talimogene laherparepvec from patient to close contacts or HCPs via direct contact with injected lesions or body fluids resulting in symptomatic infection (primary or reactivation) has been identified as an important potential risk. The proposed Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) will communicate the risks of shedding and transmission to the prescribing physicians (section 4.4, 4.8 and 6.6). In addition, there will also be educational materials to communicate risk and precautions to HCP and patients as part of the RMP. The handling of the product is also adequately described in the SmPC (section 6.6) where there is a recommendation to follow local institutional guidelines for handling and administration, personal protective equipment, accidental spills and waste disposal.

- To  wear  protective  gown  or  laboratory  coat,  safety  glasses  or  face  shield  and  gloves  while preparing or administering Imlygic. Cover any exposed wounds before administering. Avoid contact with skin, eyes or mucous membranes.
- After administration, change gloves prior to applying occlusive dressings to injected lesions. Wipe the exterior of occlusive dressing with an alcohol wipe. It is recommended to keep injection sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings at all times, if possible.  To minimize the risk of viral transmission, patients should keep their injection site covered for at least 8 days from the last treatment or longer if the injection site is weeping or oozing.   Advise patients to apply dressing as instructed by the healthcare professional and to replace the dressing if it falls off.
- To dispose of all materials that have come in contact with Imlygic (e.g. vial, syringe, needle, any cotton or gauze) in accordance with local institutional procedures.

## Accidental exposure

- In the event of an accidental occupational exposure to Imlygic (e.g. through a splash to the eyes or mucous membranes) during preparation or administration, flush with clean water for at least 15 minutes. In the event of exposure to broken skin or needle stick, clean the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and/or disinfectant.
- To treat all Imlygic spills with a virucidal agent and absorbent materials.
- To advise patients to place used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag as they may be potentially contaminated, and to dispose of the bag in household waste.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  medicine  contains  genetically  modified  organisms.    Unused  medicine  must  be  disposed  of  in compliance with the institutional guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate.

The potential for exposure from the environment at the site of administration is considered negligible. Thus, the overall risk posed by talimogene laherparepvec for human health (to the unintended recipient) and for the environment is considered low.

The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non clinical aspects as described above.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for the marketing authorisation application for talimogene laherparepvec, were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects.

The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

No traditional pharmacokinetic studies were performed with talimogene laherparepvec. The clinical pharmacology program was focused on the assessment of the viral clearance of talimogene laherparepvec by analysing the biodistribution in the blood and urine, and viral shedding of the infectious virus (from the surface of injected tumour(s) and the exterior occlusive dressing).

## Absorption

The applicant did not submit absorption studies (see clinical pharmacology discussion).

## Distribution

The biodistribution in the blood and urine was studied in clinical studies 001/01 (as one of the primary objectives), 002/03 (one of the secondary objective), 005/04 (one of the primary safety objective) and in additional supportive clinical studies in patients with other cancer than melanoma (Study 004/04 and 005/04). The viral shedding from the surface of the injected tumours and dressings were assessed in clinical studies 001/01, 004/04 and 002/03 (changed during the study by the amendment that only herpetic lesions were swabbed). The 'reactive' swabs (from herpes labialis or other non-injected lesions that arose during treatment, that were suspected to be herpetic in origin, and from injected

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tumours that were oozing and weeping) were collected (in addition the above-mentioned studies) in the clinical study 005/05.

## Study 001/01

This study was a first-in-human (FIH), 2-part, open-label evaluation of three dose levels of talimogene laherparepvec in subjects with at least one cutaneous or subcutaneous tumour of histologically proven breast adenocarcinoma, melanoma of the skin, or epithelial cancer of the head and neck, gastrointestinal (including pancreatic) cancer and vulval tumours refractory to conventional chemotherapy or for which no better therapy existed (N=30). The assessment of the biodistribution of the virus was one of the primary objectives.

In part 1, talimogene laherparepvec DNA was present in the blood and urine samples as follows: 3 (2.6%) of 117 blood samples were positive for talimogene laherparepvec DNA. Two seronegative subjects had blood samples positive at 1 or more time points and 2 different seronegative subjects had urine samples positive for virus DNA. Virus DNA was detected in the blood/urine samples between 8 hours and 1 week after administration. The number of virus genome copies was low in positive blood and urine samples; &lt; 6.4 to 310 copies/0.1 µg DNA from blood, and &lt; 6.4 to 47 copies/5 µl extracted urine.  In part 2, talimogene laherparepvec DNA was only detected in blood samples after the higher doses (i.e. after 2 nd  and 3 rd  dose at dose level of 10 8  PFU/ml). Sixteen (i.e. 4.7%) of 340 blood samples were positive. Seven subjects had positive blood samples at 1 or more timepoints. The number of virus genome copies varied from 15 to 310 copies/0.1 µg DNA. No virus DNA was detected after 8 hours from administration indicating that the virus was cleared from the blood quickly. No talimogene laherparepvec DNA was found in the urine.

## Study 002/03

This was a phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and biodistribution of talimogene laherparepvec in patients with histologically proven Stage IIIC or IV melanoma that was not eligible for curative surgery. Of the 50 enrolled subjects, 46 and 49 subjects had samples collected for the detection of viral DNA in the blood and urine, respectively. 13 of 46 (28.3%) subjects had any positive blood samples and 10 of 49 (20.4%) subjects had positive urine samples.

## Positive qPCR samples in pre dose samples.

Five subjects (12%; all seropositive) had positive blood samples and 2 of these had detectable viral levels above the limit of quantitation (ALQ &gt; 51.2 copies/1 µg DNA; 141 and 182 copies/1 µg DNA, respectively). Six subjects had positive urine samples (13%; 56, 106, 87, 53, 80, and 94 copies/reaction). Three of the subjects were seronegative and 3 subjects were seropositive at baseline.

## Positive qPCR samples after the 1 st  injection

Four subjects had 1 positive blood sample (one had viral DNA 1197 copies/1 µg DNA at 48 hours and 3 had viral DNA levels &lt; 51.2 copies/1 µg = BLQ) collected between 1 and 48 hours after the 1 st injection. One of these subjects was seronegative at baseline. One subject had positive urine sample at 24 h after the first injection. One subject had positive blood sample at 4 hours post dose and positive urine samples at pre dose (80 copies/reaction), 1, 4, 24, and 48 h post dose. Only the pre dose sample was ALQ. Three seropositive subjects had multiple positive blood samples. Only 1 pre dose sample was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ALQ (182 copies/ 1 µg DNA), all other had viral DNA levels BLQ. Three (2 seropositive and 1 seronegative) had multiple positive urine samples. One subject had 106 copies/reaction at pre dose, 129 copies/reaction at 24 h and 51.36 copies/reaction at 48 h after the 1 st  injection. Another subject had 6 positive samples; 4 of them having viral DNA ALQ (at pre dose: 87 copies/reaction, at 1 h: 62 copies/reaction, at 4 h: 82 copies/reaction, and at 48 h: 117 copies/reaction) after the 1 st  injection. The 2 positive samples were BLQ. One subject had 53 copies/reaction at pre dose and 1 positive sample BLQ at 48 h after the 1 st  injection. Two seropositive subjects had both positive blood and urine samples at multiple timepoints. One subject had positive blood samples at pre dose (BLQ), at 1 h (338 copies/1 µg DNA), at 4 h (124 copies/1 µg DNA), at 6 h (233 copies/1 µg DNA), at 24 h (BLQ) and at 48 h (114 copies/1 µg DNA) after the first injection. This subject had also positive urine samples at pre dose (56 copies/reaction), at 1 h (250 copies/reaction), at 4 h (2702 copies/reaction), at 6 h (203 copies/reaction), at 24 h (BLQ), and at 48 h (BLQ) after the first injection. Another subject had positive blood samples at pre dose (141 copies/1 µg DNA), at 1 h (BLQ), at 24 h (BLQ), and at 48 h (225 copies/1 µg DNA) and positive urine samples at 1 h (BLQ), and at 24 h (59 copies/reaction) after the first injection.

## Positive qPCR samples after the 1 st  and subsequent injections

Two subjects had positive blood and urine samples after the 1 st  and after subsequent injections One subject who received 10 8  PFU/ml instead of 10 6  PFU/ml as the first dose had the positive samples as follows:

-  1 st  injection- positive blood samples at 4 h (BLQ), at 6 h (BLQ), and at 48 h (75 copies/1 µg DNA) and one positive urine sample between 1 and 48 hours ( 76 copies/reaction).
-  2 nd  injection- positive blood samples at 1 h (268 copies/1 µg DNA), at 4 h (BLQ), and at 6 h (BLQ).
-  3 rd  injection- positive blood samples at 1 h (BLQ), at 4 h (BLQ), and at 6 h (BLQ).
-  4 th  injection- positive blood samples at 1 h (BLQ) and positive urine samples at pre dose (55 copies/reaction), at 4 h (BLQ) and at 24 h (BLQ).

## Another subject had the following positive samples:

-  1 st  injection- positive urine samples at 1 h (BLQ) and at 48 h (BLQ).
-  2 nd  injection- positive blood samples at pre dose (BLQ), at 1 h (111 copies/1 µg DNA), at 4 h (81 copies/1 µg DNA), and 6 h (BLQ) and positive urine sample at 1 h (BLQ).
-  3 rd  injection- positive urine sample (186 copies/reaction) taken at the timepoint which was not recorded and it was not known if this was before or after dose 3.

## Positive qPCR samples after subsequent doses only

One seropositive subject had 2 positive blood samples at 1 h (173 copies/1 µg DNA) and at 4 h (86 copies/1 µg DNA) after the 2 nd  injection and at 1 hour (88 copies/1 µg DNA) after the 3 rd  injection.

## Positive samples at injections with no subsequent testing

Six subjects had positive qPCR samples after the 1 st  injection and subsequent testing was not done since these subjects were dosed after the Amendment 4 (subsequent testing was removed).

Eleven subjects did not have subsequent testing dose even though positive results were found at the previous injection (after the 1 st  injection for all, with the exception of 1 subject).

## Study 005/04 (supportive study in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer)

Seventeen subjects provided 130 blood samples and 16 subjects provided 111 urine samples. 5 subjects (29%) had positive blood samples and 7 subjects (44%) had positive urine samples. No

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

samples were positive before the first injection of talimogene laherparepvec. On week 0 (after the 1 st administration), 4 of 17 subjects had positive blood sample results and 2 of 16 subjects had positive urine sample results. Three subjects had blood sample positive at 2 hours after the injection (&lt; 12.8 copies/0.1 µg DNA, &lt; 20.5 copies/0.1 µg DNA and &lt; 25.6 copies/0.1 µg DNA) and 1 subject had blood sample positive at 24 hours after the injection (&lt;14.6 copies/DNA). Two subjects had 2 positive urine samples each (2 and 24 hours [&lt; 51.2 copies/reaction at both timepoints] and 12 and 24 hours [52.7 copies/reaction and &lt; 51.2 copies/reaction], respectively). The positive blood and urine samples were observed after doses of 10 5  or 10 6  PFU/ml. On week 3 (after the 2 nd  administration), 1 of 11 subjects had a positive blood sample 2 hours after the injection (dose 10 6  PFU/ml; &lt; 11.4 copies/0.1 µg DNA) and 2 of 11 subjects had positive urine samples 2 hours after the injection (a dose of 10 6  PFU/ml for one subject and 10 7  PFU/ml for another subject, &lt; 51.2 copies/reaction for both subjects). On weeks 6 and 9, no positive blood or urine samples were determined. One subject who received extended treatment had positive urine samples after 5 th  and 6 th  injections (weeks 12 and 15, respectively). The amount of virus detected was &lt; 51.2 copies/0.1 µg DNA for both urine samples.

## Shedding

## Study 001/01

Altogether 4 (13%)/30 subjects had swabs that were positive for the virus at the tumour site. One subject (in part 1, seronegative at baseline, first dose 10 7  PFU/ml) tested positive for the virus on 6 occasions between week 1: day 4 and week 2: day 6. The highest level of virus detected was &gt; 600 PFU/swab at week 2: day 4. Another subject (in part 1, seronegative at baseline, first dose 10 7 PFU/ml) had virus detected in tumour swabs on 7 occasions between week 1: day 4 and week 2: day 3. The highest level of virus detected was &gt; 600 PFU/swab at week 1: day 4 and 5. In addition, one subject in part 1 (seropositive at baseline, first dose 10 8  PFU/ml) and one subject in part 2 (seronegative at baseline, first dose 10 6  PFU/ml) had 1 occasion each. For the subject in part 1, the tumour swab at week 2: day 1 contained approx. 24 PFU/swab of virus and for the subject in part 2, the virus swab contained approx. 7.5 PFU/swab and the swab taken vesicle above the infected lesion contained approx. 2.5 PFU/swab. The positive samples were further tested to distinguish between talimogene laherparepvec and WT HSV. The virus detected in 3 of swab samples was talimogene laherparepvec. The identity of the 4 th  sample could not be confirmed due to the low levels of virus in the original swab. None of the swabs taken from the exterior of the dressing tested positive for live virus. No subject who had a starting dose of 10 6  PFU/ml had virus detected on the surface of tumours and viral shedding was not detected from any subject more than 2 weeks after dosing.

In the swabs taken for 4 subjects from other sites that the injected tumour (i.e. from an ulcer/tumour on the lower lip, from above sternum and left of injection site, from a cold score on the lip and on the cheek and a sample of breast aspirate) no virus was detected. Six subjects had non-injected lesions that were suspected to be herpetic. The swabs were taken from the lesions and analysed to determine if talimogene laherparepvec was present: five subjects had negative results and one subject, who had a lesion above the injected tumour, had positive result. Additional swabs were taken of this lesion and all swabs were negative for the presence of the virus.

## Study 002/03

Only one subject had a positive viral plaque assay 24 hours after the first dose, but not at subsequent time points. A swab that was taken from a cold sore in a subject with oral herpes showed that the causative agent was WT HSV-1, not talimogene laherparepvec.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three subjects had lesions that were suspected to be herpetic. Swabs of the lesions from 2 subjects were negative for virus. For the third subject (a history of developing cold sores) the swab taking of the cold sore indicated that the virus was WT HSV, not talimogene laherparepvec.

## Study 004/04 (supportive study in patients with locally  advanced epithelial  cancer  of  the  head  and neck)

Three (18%) of 17 subjects had virus detected by swab analysis of the injection site following talimogene laherparepvec administration: One subject in cohort 2 at visit 0 (24 and 96 h postinjection), one subject in cohort 4 at visit 6 (48 hours post-injection) and end of study (24 hours post injection) and one subject in cohort 4 at visit 3 (24 hours post injection). Swabs taken from the dressings were negative for the presence of virus for all subjects at all timepoints.

## Study 005/05

A total of 18 reactive swabs in 12 subjects were collected. Eleven of swabs were taken from a tumour that had been previously injected with talimogene laherparepvec, 4 swabs were taken from uninjected melanoma lesions, and 3 swabs were taken on other sites or site was unknown. All 18 samples tested were negative for live HSV in a plaque assay.

## Ongoing clinical study in patients with melanoma (20120324)

The clinical study (20120324) in melanoma subjects is ongoing. Preliminary data (n =20 subjects) showed that talimogene laherparepvec DNA was detected in 36% samples of blood and 2% samples of urine. The proportion of samples with detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA in blood and urine was highest during the second cycle. 17% of samples from occlusive dressing tested positive for talimogene laherparepvec DNA but none tested positive for presence of infective virus. Among samples of oral mucosa, only one sample had detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA however the test for infectious virus was negative.

## hGM-CSF

In 001/01 Study the hGM-CSF expression was measurable in the FNAs of injected tumours from 11 of the 13 samples tested. The level of hGM-CSF mRNA at the dose level of 10 7  PFU/ml was approx. &gt; 1000-fold higher than that at the dose level of 10 6  PFU/ml. The amount of hGM-CSF mRNA at the dose levels of 10 7  PFU/ml and 10 8  PFU/Ml was similar. Seronegative subjects expressed hGM-CSF more than seropositive subjects. The hGM-CSF levels were below the limit of detection (15.4 pg/ml) of the ELISA assay in all serum samples. Three samples could not be analysed due to insufficient plasma sample availability.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically modified and replication-competent HSV-1 virus. Therefore, its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution are driven by the site of intralesional injection, tumourselective replication and release from tumour tissue (SmPC section 5.2). Therefore, it is acceptable that no pharmacokinetic studies using talimogene laherparepvec have been conducted in the overall patient population and in special populations. No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of talimogene laherparepvec. However, no adjustment in dosage is necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment (SmPC section 4.2).

Cellular uptake of talimogene laherparepvec occurs through HSV-1 receptors on tumours and nontumour cells following local injection into tumours. As talimogene laherparepvec is injected and replicates intratumourally, bioavailability and systemic concentration of talimogene laherparepvec are not predictive of drug substance activity and therefore have not been evaluated (SmPC section 5.2).

Talimogene laherparepvec is cleared through general host-defence mechanisms (e.g. autophagy, adaptive immune responses). Talimogene laherparepvec is degraded by typical endogenous protein and DNA catabolic pathways. As with other wild-type HSV-1 infections, a latent pool of talimogene laherparepvec DNA may persist in neuronal cell bodies innervating the injection sites; therefore, the occurrence of latent infection with talimogene laherparepvec cannot be excluded (SmPC section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Biodistribution, viral replication and viral shedding were studied for the PK analyses. The studied doses of talimogene laherparepvec varied from 10 4  to 10 8  PFU/ml in the clinical studies and maximum total volumes/intratumoural injections/each administration were from 4 ml to 8 ml. No adjustment of the dose is required in patients ≥ 65 years old (SmPC section 5.1). The method of administration is described in the SmPC section 4.2.

Talimogene laherparepvec DNA was quantified with a highly sensitive and specific qPCR assay which may not correlate with viral infectivity risk. Talimogene laherparepvec was also quantified in selected patient samples in clinical studies using viral infectivity assays at the injection sites and in some cases of potential herpetic lesions (SmPC section 5.2).

There were low copy numbers of the viral DNA detected in blood (30% of subjects) and urine (20% of subjects) samples across the studies from 1 h to 1 week after intralesional injection. Blood and urine samples were negative by 2 weeks post-injection in those subjects for whom additional samples were available. Some evidence of a relationship between the detection of viral DNA in the blood and urine and HSV-1 serostatus was found in studies 001/01 and 005/04.The seronegative subjects who received doses higher than 10 6  PFU/ml were more likely to have viral DNA in the blood and urine than the seropositive subjects. The hGM-CSF mRNA expression was greater with the higher doses of talimogene laherparepvec i.e. 10 7  PFU/ml and 10 8  PFU/ml than with the dose of 10 6  PFU/ml. In addition, seronegative subjects appeared to express hGM-CSF more than seropositive subjects. Few patients had swabs that were positive for viral DNA at the tumour site and all swabs taken from the exterior of the dressing were negative across all studies. The longest time that talimogene laherparepvec DNA was detected in the injection site swabs was 2 weeks post-injection.  Very limited data exist on shedding and biodistribution for talimogene laherparepvec after the intratumoural injection with the highest dose (i.e. 10 8  PFU/ml) and maximum volume (i.e. 4 ml/tumour).  Thus, it was not possible to assess the correlation between distribution and virus shedding on the basis of the available data. Therefore, a post-authorisation study 20120324, which is a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the biodistribution and shedding of talimogene laherparepvec in subjects with unresected, stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma will provide further data and has been included in the RMP as missing information (see RMP). The biodistribution and shedding of intralesionally administered talimogene laherparepvec are being investigated in a melanoma study. Interim results from 30 patients show that talimogene laherparepvec DNA was detected at transient and low concentrations in blood in 90% of patients and in urine in 20% of patients in the study. The proportion of patients with detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA in blood and urine was highest during the second cycle. Talimogene laherparepvec DNA was detected in samples from injected lesions in approximately 90% of patients. However, only 14% of patients tested positive for infective virus by TCID50 assay, all within 1 week after treatment administration. Live virus has not been detected from the exterior of occlusive dressing or in samples obtained from oro-labial region (SmPC section 5.3).

In the phase 3 melanoma clinical study, adverse events in the HSV infection category were reported in 5.5% (n=16) patients in the talimogene laherparepvec group in the phase 3 melanoma clinical study versus 1.6% (n = 2) in the GM-CSF group. 14 cases were reported as oral herpes and 1 case each was reported as herpes simplex and herpetic keratitis in the talimogene laherparepvec group. The symptomatic talimogene laherparepvec infection in non-tumour tissue has been included as an important potential risk in the RMP.

Symptomatic herpetic infection could also occur due to latency and reactivation of talimogene laherparepvec or wild-type HSV-1 in patients. Clinical data investigating whether talimogene laherparepvec after being injected intratumorally could also distribute to the site of natural HSV-1 infection (mucosal tissues and neuronal sensory ganglia that innervate the infected dermatome) and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

establish infection, latency and reactivation has been included as an important potential risk. The long term safety will be investigated as part of study 20120139, a registry study to evaluate the survival and long-term safety of subjects with melanoma who previously received talimogene laherparepvec. Co-infection with talimogene laherparepvec and wild-type HSV-1 could potentially occur in patients; infection by talimogene laherparepvec or a febrile response due to talimogene laherparepvec infection could also stimulate the reactivation of latent HSV-1 in patients.

Since GM-CSF is being expressed at relative high levels in the context of an ongoing HSV-1 infection, the risk of braking tolerance to GM-CSF should be considered. As there are a rather large sequence homology between GM-CSF and G-CSF there is even a hypothetical (albeit unlikely) risk of crossreactivity of anti GM-CSF antibodies with G-CSF should they arise. Patients treated with talimogene laherparepvec may use GM-CSF or G-CSF therapy at some later stage. Neutralizing GM-CSF antibodies have been described following GM-CSF therapy with Sargramostim or Molgramostim and may reduce effect such treatment. Talimogene Laherparepvec-mediated anti-GM-CSF Antibody Response is therefore considered an important potential risk in the RMP based on theoretical concerns as this event has not been reported in clinical trials.

The risk of recombination of talimogene laherparepvec with wild-type HSV-1 is also a theoretical risk which has not been investigated and has been included in the RMP as missing information.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The pharmacology studies for the biodistribution and shedding of talimogene laherparepvec is considered adequate and acceptable for the authorisation of talimogene laherparepvec in the proposed indication in adult patients with melanoma.

The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as described above.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

Study 001-01 was a phase 1, open-label, ascending-dose study of talimogene laherparepvec to evaluate single doses of 10 6  PFU/mL, 10 7  PFU/mL, and 10 8  PFU/mL (up to 4 mL) in 30 subjects with various solid tumours, including melanoma (part 1 of the study). Subjects who were HSV seronegative at study entry experienced more adverse events, consisting primarily of flu-like symptoms, than subjects who were HSV seropositive at study entry, particularly if given 10 7  PFU/mL (seronegative subjects were not given a first dose of 10 8  PFU/mL during the study as a result). Overall, all 11 (100%) seronegative subjects experienced an adverse event as did 18/19 (95%) seropositive subjects, with the following percentages for seronegative and seropositive subjects, respectively: pyrexia 10/11 subjects (91%) and 9/19 subjects (47%), anorexia 45% and 11%, vomiting 45% and 5%, injection site reactions 27% and 16%, lethargy 36% and 5%, influenza like illness 27% and 5%, headache and dyspnea 27% and 11%. However, these symptoms were mitigated in part 2 of the study using a dosing regimen that included an initial lower dose of 10 6  PFU/mL in all subjects followed by subsequent doses of 10 8  PFU/mL, regardless of HSV serostatus. Thus, an initial talimogene laherparepvec dose of 10 6  PFU/mL followed by subsequent doses of 10 8  PFU/mL was selected for the phase 2 and 3 studies.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomized to receive either talimogene laherparepvec or GM-CSF in a 2:1 allocation. Talimogene laherparepvec

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each treatment cycle of talimogene laherparepvec was defined as a treatment administered on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. However, Cycle 1 was a 35-day cycle since the second injection was to occur on Day 22 instead of Day 15. The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec was at a concentration of 10 6  PFU/mL. Subsequent doses were at a concentration of 10 8  PFU/mL. If any injected lesion(s) progressed, the injection frequency was increased to once per week for 4 weeks into the progressing lesion(s) only. Up to three sets of four accelerated injections were given as long as after each set of four accelerated injections clinically relevant disease progression didn't occur and there was still residual tumour to inject.

All reasonably injectable lesions (cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal disease, injected with or without ultrasound guidance) were injected up to the maximum dosing volume available on an individual dosing occasion, the largest injectable tumour on each dosing occasion being dosed first.

The dose (volume) delivered to the tumour(s) was dependent on the size of the tumour nodule(s) and was determined according to the following algorithm: up to 0.1 mL for tumours up to 0.5 cm longest dimension; up to 0.5 mL for tumours of 0.5 to 1.5 cm longest dimension; up to 1.0 mL for tumours of 1.5 to 2.5 cm longest dimension; up to 2.0 mL for tumours of 2.5 to 5 cm longest dimension; up to 4.0 mL for tumours &gt;5 cm longest diameter. There was no minimum size for a tumour mass to be eligible for injection. In order to enrol patients with lesions larger than 10 cm in longest diameter, or with a total cumulative tumour burden in excess of 20 cm based on the sum of the longest diameters of individual lesions, prior approval was obtained from the Medical Monitor. The maximum volume injected into any individual lesion was 4 mL. The maximum dose on any one treatment day was to be 4 mL.

Previously uninjected lesions were to be injected if the initially injected lesions reduce in size such that there is a residual volume of talimogene laherparepvec available for injection. New lesions, newly measurable lesions and newly documented lesions which appeared during the course of the study which are injectable were also to be injected.

Dosing with talimogene laherparepvec was to be continued until: Complete remission was obtained (disappearance of all disease); all injectable tumours have disappeared; PDr (clinically relevant disease progression) after 24 weeks on study; twelve months on therapy was reached without any response up to that time; intolerable toxicity occurred defined as the need to stop study therapy due to treatment related adverse events; the investigator believed that it was in the best interest of the patient to stop investigational therapy or be given other therapy; the patient withdraws consent.

Patients who were in response at 12 months (PR or CR) should not have had an end of treatment visit until 18 months or PD (PDn, PDr, PDcns), whichever was the earlier. Patients who developed a new injectable lesion(s) within 12 months from the start date of treatment, but after all other injectable lesions have responded such that they were no longer injectable were eligible to restart treatment with talimogene laherparepvec.

No patient was to be dosed on more than 45 injection days, allowing for up to 18 months of dosing and the increased frequency of dosing if injected lesions progress.

## GM-CSF

GM-CSF was administered SC at a dose of 125 µg/m 2 /day. The first dose was administered at the study centre to monitor for any first-dose reactions (eg, flushing, faintness, dizziness, or weakness). GM-CSF was administered daily for 14 days followed by a 14-day rest period; this constituted one treatment cycle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The GM-CSF dose was reduced by 50% if the following occurred: ANC exceeded 20,000 cells/mm 3   (if this level persisted despite the 50% dose reduction, GM-CSF was to be discontinued); platelet count exceeded 500,000/mm 3  (if this level persisted despite the 50% dose reduction, GM-CSF was to be discontinued); if these hematologic values decreased to levels below those indicated for 2 consecutive measurements, then the GM-CSF dose could be increased to 25% below the subject's original calculated dose for the remainder of the study.

Dosing with GM-CSF would continue until: PDr after 24 weeks on study (as defined in the protocol); twelve months on therapy is reached without any response up to that time; intolerable toxicity occurs defined as the need to stop study therapy due to treatment related adverse events; the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the patient to stop investigational therapy or be given other therapy; the patient withdraws consent.

## Prior or concomitant Therapies

Supportive therapy for the subject's cancer that was ongoing at the initiation of study treatment was permitted during the study. Other medications or supportive therapies were permitted at the investigator's discretion, except other investigational drugs, concurrent anti-tumour therapies other than radiation therapy required for palliation, oral or systemic steroids (with the exception of those used during treatment for central nervous system disease) and anti-herpetic drugs (other than in topically administered &gt; 20 cm from a talimogene laherparepvec injection site).

## Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec compared to subcutaneously (SC) administered GM-CSF in patients with unresectable stage IIIB, IIIC and IV melanoma.

The primary objective was to evaluate the durable response rate (DRR).

The key secondary objectives included:

- to evaluate OS
- to analyse response onset
- to evaluate time to treatment failure
- to estimate duration of response
- to evaluate best response and disease burden.

The exploratory objectives were: to assess reported Quality of Life; to analyse the impact that having a response to therapy (ie, achieving a CR or PR) and a durable response to therapy (durable response rate, DRR) has on survival; analysis of treatment effects based on BRAF mutation status (if the information would be available).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the durable response rate (DRR), defined as the rate of objective response (complete or partial response, defined by modified World Health Organization criteria as shown in Table 14 and Table 15) lasting continuously for 6 or more months until clinically relevant decline in PS or subsequent therapy is needed, and beginning at any point within 12 months of initiating therapy. For the first 24 weeks, treatment was to continue despite increases in tumour burden or appearance of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

new lesions, unless clinical deterioration or subsequent therapy was required (PDr). An independent Endpoints Assessment Committee (EAC) confirmed response status for the purpose of primary efficacy analysis. The EAC's final conclusions with respect to response prevailed over those of Investigators. Additional analyses were performed using the investigator's assessments.

| Complete response (CR)   | Disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumour (both measurable and non-measurable but evaluable disease including any new tumours which might have appeared). Any residual cutaneous or sub-cutaneous masses must be documented by representative biopsy to not contain viable tumour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Partial response (PR)    | Achieving a 50% or greater reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumours at the time of assessment as compared to the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumours at baseline. If any new tumours have appeared, the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters of these must have reduced by 50% or more from when first documented. Any residual cutaneous or sub-cutaneous masses which must be tumour free for the patient to meet the criteria for PR must be documented as such by representative biopsy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Stable disease (SD)      | Neither sufficient overall tumour shrinkage to qualify for response (PR or CR) nor sufficient tumour increase to qualify for PD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Progressive disease (PD) | A >25% increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumours since baseline, or the unequivocal appearance of a new tumour since the last response assessment time point. There are three types of PD defined in this protocol: Non-clinically relevant progressive disease (PDn): PD in patients who do not suffer a decline in performance status and/or in the opinion of the investigator do not require alternative therapy. Patients showing PDn will be allowed to continue study treatment. Clinically relevant progressive disease (PDr): PD that is associated with a decline in performance status and/or in the opinion of the investigator the patient requires alternative therapy. Patients with PDr will be allowed to remain on study until 24 weeks of therapy unless, in the opinion of the investigator, other treatment is warranted. CNS progressive disease (PDcns): Progression in the central nervous system (brain) |

| Category                                | Definition                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complete Response (CR)                  | • Disappearance of all non-measurable but evaluable tumours.                 |
| Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) | • Persistence of one or more non-measurable but evaluable tumour(s).         |
| Progressive Disease (PD)                | • Unequivocal appearance of one or more non-measurable but evaluable tumour. |

The key secondary endpoints included the following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause (subjects were to be followed for OS for at least 36 months from the date the last patient was randomized or until the last study subject had died, whichever was earlier);
- objective response rate (ORR), defined as the best overall response observed across all time points (complete and partial response, defined by modified World Health Organization criteria);
- time to response defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented evidence of response;
- duration of response, defined as the longest individual period from entering response (PR or CR) to the first documented evidence of the subject no longer meeting the criteria for being in response (progressive disease PDr) or the subject's death, whichever is earlier;
- time to treatment failure (TTF), calculated from baseline until the first PDr (ie, progressive disease associated with a reduction in performance status) where there was no response achieved after the PDr.

Exploratory endpoints included: the Quality of Life assessed with a standardized instrument, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - biologic response modifier (FACT-BRM, subjects were required to complete the questionnaire on Day 1 of each treatment cycle and at the EOT visit before they undergo any treatment-related study procedures including administration of investigational product); impact of durable response on survival; influence of BRAF mutation status.

## Sample size

The study was multi-national and initially planned to be conducted in approximately 85 clinical study centres and was expected to randomize approximately 430 patients to provide 360 evaluable patients (240 talimogene laherparepvec, 120 GM-CSF).

It was assumed that the DRR in the control arm would be &lt;10%. Using the intended sample size of 360 evaluable patients randomized 2:1 (talimogene laherparepvec: control), if a 3% response rate was achieved for the control arm, an increase to 13% in the talimogene laherparepvec arm would be able to be detected, and if an 8% response rate was achieved for the control arm, an increase to 21% in the talimogene laherparepvec arm would be able to be detected. These are both at 90% power for a two-sided test with 5% Type I error.

## Randomisation

The randomization was a 2:1 allocation for talimogene laherparepvec versus GM-CSF, accordingly. Prior to randomization, patients were stratified on the basis of known prognostic factors: site of first recurrence (in transit vs. lymph node vs. visceral); liver metastases (yes vs. no); stage of disease (stage IIIB/C vs. stage IV M1a vs. stage IV M1b vs. stage IV M1c); prior nonsurgical melanoma treatment other than adjuvant therapy (no vs. yes and recurrence &lt;1 year from primary diagnosis vs. yes and recurrence &gt;1 year from primary diagnosis).

The Stage IV M1c patients were stratified and balanced across the two treatments groups and capped such that the percentage of Stage IV M1c patients in each treatment arm was to be no more than 40% of the total in that arm.

## Blinding (masking)

Study 005/05 was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

The primary analysis of the primary endpoint and all response-based endpoints was to occur when no further subjects had the possibility of meeting the criteria for durable response or all subjects had reached 18 months after their first dose (whichever was earlier). Overall survival was a secondary endpoint, and was to be tested if statistical significance was demonstrated for DRR. The primary analysis of OS was to occur after 290 deaths had occurred, or at the time of the primary analysis of DRR, whichever was later. If less than 290 deaths had occurred at the time of the primary analysis of DRR, an interim analysis of OS was to be performed. A non-inferential analysis of OS at 3 years from the last subject's randomization was also to be performed.

Comparisons between treatment arms were performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population for the primary analysis (Table 16). Comparisons using the per-protocol population (or other clinically meaningful populations as noted) were performed as a sensitivity analysis.

| Per-protocol Population                           | received at least 2 cycles of therapy and completed the assessment after 8 weeks (and at other time of termination for those who stay on study past 8 weeks), unless taken off therapy due to progression or due to safety issues before two cycles have been received |

The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using a two-sided unadjusted Fisher Exact test to determine whether talimogene laherparepvec improves the DRR relative to Control. The multivariate statistical analyses (secondary analyses including a logistic regression model) were tested for treatment effect while controlling for the potentially important prognostic factors (see results).

Study success was defined as the rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference when comparing talimogene laherparepvec vs. control at the interim or at the primary DRR analysis using the two-sided Fisher's Exact test for which the pvalue is ≤ 0.0488 (0.05 -0.0001*2-0.0005*2).

Two formal interim analyses were planned to assess aspects of both efficacy and safety. A Bonferroni alpha allocation was used for significance testing, for an overall 1-sided test of alpha = 0.025.

The first formal interim analysis was planned after the first 75 subjects had been on study for 9 months. This analysis assessed efficacy on the basis of both response rate (CR and PR) and DRR (CR and/or PR maintained for at least 6 months). This analysis also assessed safety. Interim data were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tabulated as of 10 September 2010. The DMC recommended that the study be allowed to continue since no safety concerns were raised, and the futility boundaries had not been crossed.

The second formal interim analysis was planned after all subjects were randomized and had been on study for at least 9 months from randomization. In addition, at least 42 durable responders were to have been identified by the EAC. Because a sufficient number of EAC assessments were not completed until less than 1 month before the cutoff date for the primary analysis, and the safety data had been recently reviewed, the DMC agreed to remove the second interim analysis. The SAP was amended to remove this interim analysis.

In addition, a planned interim safety analysis was performed by the DMC after the first 20 subjects who received 8 doses of talimogene laherparepvec in the phase 3 melanoma study to compare the safety profile of talimogene laherparepvec administered in Study 005/05 with that administered in Study 002/03. The DMC conducted a review of the treatment-emergent adverse events from these studies and in March 2010 concluded that the safety profile was generally similar to that observed in Study 002/03. The DMC recommended for the study to continue under the current protocol.

a One subject was randomized three times. This subject is decided to be removed from ITT population and per protocol population. This subject will be included in the safety population based on the treatment received.

Page 1 of 1

ITT population includes all subjects who have been randomized to receive study treatment. EAC Evaluable Subjects includes all subjects who have been reviewed by EAC. These subjects have responded (PR/CR) or have been on therapy for 9 months without response according to investigators' judgment. Subjects are analyzed according to the treatment arms they were randomized. Safety Population is defined as randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment.

The per protocol population is defined as all subjects who are randomized, eligible and treated, received at least 2 cycles of therapy and completed the assessment after 8 weeks, unless taken off therapy due to progression or due to safety issues before twocycles have been received. subjects with major protocol deviation will be excluded from this population.

## Outcomes and estimation

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Durable Response Rate (DRR)

Results in term of DRR per EAC (primary endpoint) and Investigator assessment are shown in Table 22. The minimum follow-up time, calculated from the date of the last randomization to the data cut-off date (21 Dec 2012), was 17.1 months.

Additional analyses on OS were performed by imputing the 5 patients with potential informative censoring. An updated analysis showed a HR=0.82 (95%CI 0.65, 1.05, p=0.1158) in the ITT population and a HR=0.61 (95%CI 0.43, 0.86, p=0.0039) for the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further analyses showed that for the ITT population, the HR=0.85 (95% CI 0.66, 1.08, p=0.1780) was shown for inputing on the date that patients were censored and HR=0.85 (95% CI 0.67, 1.09, p=0.1999) for inputing when the censoring time was moved to the data cut-off date (31 st  March 2014). For the patients in stage IIIB,IIIC and IVM1a, a HR=0.63 (95%CI 0.45, 0.88, p=0.0070) and HR=0.64 (95%CI 0.45, 0.89, p=0.0086) was observed, respectively. A similar trend was observed for ≥2 lines vs 1 st line.

DCO, data cut-off date (31-Mar-2014). A Includes all patients, include the remaining 5 with potential informative censoring. One of the 5 updates included an event prior to the analysis data cut-off, therefore there are 291 events in the ITT population. B All 5 patients had an event imputed on the date they were censored, resulting in 296 event in the ITT population.  Prior to analysis, events and censoring times after the 290th event were censored on the date of the 290th event to be consistent with the planned primary analysis after 290 events.   C All 5 patients had their censoring time moved to the DCO date.  Prior to analysis, events and censoring times after the 290th event were censored on the date of the 290th event.

## Time to treatment failure

The time to treatment failure was calculated from randomisation until the first clinically relevant disease progression (PDr) where there was no response achieved after the progression, or until death if no such progression occurs. Subjects who did not have clinically relevant progression or did not die were censored at the time of their last tumour assessment. Subjects who withdrew from treatment due to a clinically unacceptable toxicity were not considered as an event in the analysis. In the ITT population, 59.6% patients in the GM-GSF group and 55.3% of subjects in the talimogene laherparepvec group experienced treatment failure. The Kaplan-Meier plot of the time to treatment failure is provided on Figure 11.

## Exploratory Analysis: Patient-reported Outcomes

The treatment estimate (95% Cl) of the average change on trial outcome index (TOI) across all time points was -2.43 (-3.98, -0.87); p = 0.002. The difference was to be considered clinically meaningful if a decrease or increase of at least 5 points in TOI from baseline would be reported.

## Exploratory Analysis: association between response and Overall Survival

Analyses were performed to explore the association between durable response and OS among subjects randomized to each separate treatment arm. Results are reported in Table 26.

The hazard and hazard ratio estimates are obtained from the Cox Proportional Hazard Model. A hazard ratio &lt; 1.0 indicates a lower average death rate and a longer overall survival for durable responders. 95% Cl Calculated from Cox regression model.

Subjects that have not been recorded as dead are included ss censored.

Cl: Confidence Interval.

For time-dependent covariate cox model: Overall survival (Os) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.

For landmark analysis : Os is defined as the time from the landmark time to the date of death from any cause.

ITT population includes all subjects who have been randomized to receive study treatment. Subjects will be analyzed using the randomized treatment.

Durable responders are defined as subjecis with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) maintained continuously for at least 6 months (183 days) from when an objective response was first observed and initiating at any point within 12 months of starting therapy. Subjects who are off study before the fixed time are excluded from the analysis.

Similar analyses were conducted for the association between overall objective response and OS and results were generally similar to those for durable response (data not shown).

## Exploratory Analysis: Incidence of Lesion Response

Among 2116 evaluable baseline or new individual lesions directly injected with talimogene laherparepvec, 1361 (64.3%) decreased in size by ≥ 50% and 995 (47.0%) completely resolved. A similar pattern was observed separately for baseline and new non-injected lesions (non-visceral and visceral).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of 981 evaluable non-injected nonvisceral lesions 331 (33.7%) decreased in size by ≥ 50%, the majority of which (212 [21.6%]) completely resolved. Of 177 evaluable visceral lesions, 27 (15.3%) decreased in size by ≥ 50%, the majority of which (16 [9.0%]) completely resolved.

There were 50 subjects in the Systemic Effects Analysis Set with 471 evaluable lesions that met the criteria for DR per investigator assessment, including 55 non-injected non-visceral lesions in 13 subjects.

Within this response category, 47 (85.5%) non-injected non-visceral lesions existing prior to the onset of DR decreased in size by ≥ 50%, including 45 lesions (81.8%) that completely resolved. All visceral lesions (n = 4 lesions in 3 subjects) existing prior to the onset of durable response in these subjects completely resolved. Similarly, there were 72 subjects with 745 evaluable lesions who met the criteria for OR per investigator assessment, including 65 non-injected, non-visceral lesions in 18 subjects.

Within this response category, 54 (83.1%) non-injected non-visceral lesions existing prior to the onset of OR decreased in size by ≥ 50%, including 50 lesions (76.9%) that completely resolved. Among 7 visceral lesions existing prior to the onset of OR in 6 subjects, 6 lesions (85.7%) completely resolved.

A reduction in size of ≥ 50% in at least 1 injected lesion, at least 1 non -injected / non visceral lesion, and at least 1 visceral lesion was seen in 75%, 52%, and 27% of subjects, respectively. For subjects in the DR and OR response subgroups as defined in the 005/05 Primary Analysis CSR, the proportion of subjects who experienced reductions in size of at least 1 evaluable lesion of each type was higher than the 'A ll Subjects' group; more than 75% of subjects experienced a decrease of ≥ 50% in size of at least 1 evaluable lesion of any type, including visceral lesions.

There were 220 subjects evaluable for overall lesion-type burden including 56 (25.5%) who met the criteria for DR per investigator, and 85 (38.6%) who met the criteria for OR per investigator. Of these 220 subjects, 78 subjects (35.5%) had a ≥ 50% reduction in the total burden of all lesions.

Of the 79 subjects evaluable for overall lesion-type burden who had non-injected non-visceral disease, 27 subjects (34.2%) had a ≥ 50% reduction in the total burden of those non -injected non-visceral lesions. Of the 71 subjects evaluable for overall lesion-type burden who had with baseline or new visceral disease, there were 11 subjects (15.5%) with an OR, (including 2 subjects with CR and 6 subjects [8.5%] who met the criteria for DR). Eight subjects (11.3%) had a ≥ 50% reduction in the total burden of visceral lesions, of whom 6 had visceral disease at baseline.

Of the 56 subjects evaluable for overall lesion-type burden who had a durable response per investigator, 13 subjects (16.7%) had at least 1 non-injected non-visceral lesion at baseline and 5 subjects (7.9%) had at least 1 visceral lesion at baseline. Of the 85 subjects evaluable for overall lesion-type burden who had an objective response per investigator, 20 subjects (25.6%) had noninjected non-visceral lesions at baseline and 9 subjects (14.3%) had visceral lesions at baseline.

ITTpopulation includes all subjectswho have beenrandomized toreceive study treatment.Subjectswill be analyzed usingtherandomizedtreatment.

Durable responserate（DRR)is defined as the percent of subjects with completeresponse (CR)or partialresponse (PR)maintained continuously forat least6months(183 days)from whenanobjectiveresponsewas first observed and initiating at any point within 12months of starting therapy.Thisreflects all new sites of disease as wellasall disease sites identified at baseline.NE=notestimable.

The confidence intervalis calculated using Wilson's score method with continuity correction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In exploratory quantitative interaction tests, the magnitude of the estimated treatment effect on durable response was statistically significantly different across the 4 disease stage categories (p &lt; 0.0001) or between the 2 grouped stage categories (p &lt; 0.0001). The difference in effect on durable response was also statistically significantly different by line of therapy (p = 0.0002).

Treatment effect heterogeneity was examined using qualitative and quantitative treatment-bycovariate interaction tests. In an exploratory analysis, OS was analyzed for the ITT population at the time of the OS primary analysis within subgroups defined by randomization stratification factors and key covariates (clinically relevant subgroups defined by prognostic covariates displayed in Figure 13).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although line of therapy was predictive, there was a strong correlation between line of therapy and disease stage, with a lower proportion of patients with stage IVM1b-c disease (33%) in the first-line population compared to the second-line or greater population (52%) (Chi-square p &lt; 0.0001). Line of therapy was not retained as an independent predictor for durable response in a multivariate analysis considering disease stage (p = 0.0763). In addition, in an analysis of subjects with earlier stage disease (stage IIIB/C and stage IVM1a) receiving ≥ second -line therapy, talimogene laherparepvec was associated with an improvement in DRR (17% vs 2%) and objective response (28% vs 2%) relative to GM-CSF.

In an additional post-hoc landmark analysis, an association was observed between the achievement of a durable response and improvement in quality of life based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Biologic Response Modifier [FACT-BRM]), including the Trial Outcome Index (a composite of FACT-BRM subscale endpoints). In subjects with stage IIIB/C and stage IVM1a disease, achievement of a durable response per EAC was also associated with an improvement in the Trial Outcome Index (odds ratio 2.763; 95% CI: 1.018,7.797).

A further analysis was conducted to evaluate clinical outcomes in subjects who had a durable response per EAC. Of the 51 subjects with a durable response, all had a CR or PR per EAC ongoing at the time of the primary analysis. In addition, most subjects were still alive at the time of the most recent contact date (49 subjects were still alive after 3 years) and did not require subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy during the follow-up period. In addition, long-term benefit was observed for subjects with a complete response in Study 005/05.  In post-hoc landmark analyses of subjects receiving talimogene laherparepvec who had a complete response per investigator assessment, the probability of still being in complete response was 84% at 12 months, 75% at 24 months, and 72% at 36 months.

## Post-hoc Analyses

## Time to Subsequent Anticancer Therapy Use

When the analysis was limited to ipilimumab, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or trametinib (Figure 14) or ipilimumab only (Figure 15), the median time to subsequent therapy was shorter in the GM-CSF arm in subjects with earlier stages of disease, no prior treatment, and lower than the median amount of total tumour burden.

## Progression free survival (PFS)

A post-hoc analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) was performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. In this analysis, PFS was defined as the time from randomization until first progressive disease (PD) per investigator assessment (using modified World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) or death, whichever was earlier. As PD was not assessed by the Endpoint Assessment Committee (EAC) for all subjects, PFS per EAC could not be derived for the ITT population.

A similar analysis was conducted in the subgroups of subjects with non-visceral disease (stage IIIBC/IVM1a) (Figure 17) and visceral disease (stage IVM1b-c) (Figure 18).

## Overall Survival (OS)

Analyses show an improvement with talimogene laherparepvec compared to GM-CSF for patients without visceral disease (stage IIIB-B, IVM1a) of 24% in DRR, 38% in ORR (Table 28) , and a HR for OS of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.80) in subjects with stage IIIB/C and IVM1a disease and 1.07 (0.75, 1.52) in subjects with IVM1b-c disease (Figure 19).

## Sensitivity analyses

IVM1b-c

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To evaluate potential bias in DRR arising from differences in early treatment discontinuation, a posthoc sensitivity analysis was conducted. In this analysis, the number of durable responses for subjects who discontinued early was imputed based on the DRR for those subjects who did not discontinue early.  A subgroup of subjects not reviewed by the EAC was defined as potentially having 'discontinued early' (DE); these subjects ended the treatment phase without evidence of clinically relevant disease progression as shown in Table 29 and 30.

## Talimogene laherparepvec systemic effect on new visceral metastases

The talimogene laherparepvec systemic effects on prevention or delay of micrometastasis to develop into new metastases was investigated.  This was achieved by exploring whether talimogene laherparepvec decreased the risk of developing new visceral (including brain and bone) metastases in subjects without visceral disease at baseline (ie subjects with Stages IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a melanoma at baseline) in Study 005/05 by comparing visceral metastasis-free survival (VMFS) in subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec (n=152) vs subjects treated with GM-CSF (n=73).  VMFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the appearance of first visceral lesion(s).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among subjects without visceral lesions at baseline approximately 14% in both groups developed visceral metastases at disease progression during tumour response assessments in Study 005/05 (Table 31), although median follow up for subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec was 55% longer than subjects treated with GM-CSF: 33.4 (interquartile range, 17.6, 41.9) months vs 21.5 (12.7, 38.7) months (P=0.0052, Wilcoxon rank sum test).

The Kaplan-Meier plots of VMFS and Cox proportional hazards model that were used to estimate the effect of talimogene laherparepvec vs GM-CSF on VMFS are shown in Figure 20.  Subjects who did not develop visceral lesions were censored at the date of their last tumour response assessment. The unadjusted HR for VMFS of subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec vs GM-CSF was 0.47 (0.22, 1.00), P = 0.051 (descriptive).

## Quality of Life

The quality of life was assessed by the FACT-BRM questionnaire. The TOI is a 27-item measure that is the sum of the domains for physical and functional well-being and the BRM subscale scores of the FACT-BRM.

A summary of the mean TOI by treatment arm and by cycle is described below (Figure 21).

Notes

Stratification factors: site of first recurrence (in transit vs. lymph node vs. visceral); liver metastases (yes vs. no); stage of disease (stage IIIB/C vs. stage IV M1a vs. stage IV M1b vs. stage IV M1c); prior nonsurgical melanoma treatment other than adjuvant therapy (no vs. yes and recurrence &lt;1 year from primary diagnosis vs. yes and recurrence &gt;1 year from primary diagnosis)

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

An analysis was performed to compare the substage covariate chosen for the randomisation of the phase III 005/05 study.  The result of the post-hoc analysis is shown in Table 33.

## Supportive studies

Study 002/03

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was a phase 2, open label, single arm study in 50 subjects with unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma. The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in terms of tumour response rates (primary endpoint: overall response rate). Secondary efficacy objectives were to assess the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in terms of time to response, median survival time (OS), and time to progression.

Subjects received 8 doses of talimogene laherparepvec over a 15-week period. Talimogene laherparepvec was administered at an initial dose of 10 6  plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL, injected into 1 or more skin or subcutaneous tumours (up to 4 mL total). Subsequent doses began at least 3 weeks after the first dose and consisted of talimogene laherparepvec 10 8  PFU/mL (up to 4 mL total) every 2 weeks. If indications of biological activity were observed after the initial 8 doses (stable disease or better, inflammatory response in an uninjected tumour, and/or injection site reaction), treatment could be continued for an additional 16 doses unless the investigator determined that another therapy was appropriate. Treatment continued until 1 of the following occurred: complete response (CR), disappearance of all injectable tumours, symptomatic disease progression requiring alternative therapy, or the maximum treatment period was achieved.

Per investigator assessment, the best overall response rate (best response observed across all time points) was 28%, including 8 subjects (16%) with a CR and 6 subjects (12%) with a partial response (PR).. Eight subjects (16%) had stable disease per investigator assessment at the time they discontinued from the study.

Median overall survival (defined as the number of months from the date of the first dose to the date of death or the date that the subject was last known to be alive) was 14.7 months (95% CI: 10.3, NE). The percentage of subjects still alive was 57% at month 12 and 41% at months 24 and 36.

## Study 005/05-E

This was an extension protocol (Study 005/05) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended use treatment with talimogene laherparepvec or GM-CSF for eligible melanoma patients. Subjects enrolled in Study 005/05 who did not have clinically relevant disease progression at the end of the study, who had received the maximum number of injections of talimogene laherparepvec or GM-CSF allowed under the protocol (up to 18 months of treatment), and in whom further treatment was warranted (in the opinion of the investigator and the Sponsor's medical monitor), or those for whom new lesion(s) appeared within 12 months after previous resolution of all disease while on Study 005/05, had the option to be enrolled into extension Study 005/05-E. In Study 005/05-E, talimogene laherparepvec or GM-CSF administration and disease assessments continued according to the Study 005/05 protocol guidelines for an additional 12 months.

Total of 30 subjects (3 in the GM-CSF group and 27 in the talimogene laherparepvec group) received treatment through Study 005/05-E. As of the cut-off date (29 March 2013) 3 subjects (all receiving talimogene laherparepvec) were continuing to receive treatment, 10 subjects (2 GM-CSF, 8 talimogene laherparepvec) completed the maximum duration allowed in this study without PR or CR, 6 subjects (all talimogene laherparepvec) discontinued after no injectable disease, 6 subjects (1 GM-CSF, 5 talimogene laherparepvec) discontinued after progressive disease, 2 subjects (both talimogene laherparepvec) died, 1 subject (talimogene laherparepvec) discontinued due to an adverse event, 1 subject (talimogene laherparepvec) withdrew consent, and 1 subject (talimogene laherparepvec) was withdrawn by the treating physician's decision.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The applicant submitted an application for the indication of treatment of adults with melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic. To support the indication, the applicant submitted study 005/05, a randomized (ratio 2:1), controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study designed which compared treatment with talimogene laherparepvec to subcutaneously administered GM-CSF in subjects with unresectable stage IIIB through stage IV M1c melanoma. In general, the study was well conducted and no major issues were raised as to the conduct or the validity of the data. The treatment arms were well-balanced in terms of baseline characteristics.

The CAT expressed some concerns over the comparator, GM-CSF, that it may not have been the most appropriate comparator for this patient population with advanced disease. However, the CAT, in line with the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP), acknowledged that at the time the study was initiated, the number of possible and available active treatment options was limited where dacarbazine and high dose IL-2 were the main treatments of choice. The proposed comparator was accepted as part of the scientific advice before the study was initiated. In addition, as talimogene laherparepvec contains the GM-CSF gene insert, this arm would serve as an important control to investigate whether GM-CSF could be responsible for the efficacy observed. Taking into account these arguments, the CAT was of the opinion that the trial had been designed appropriately given the context in which it was being conducted. Thus the use of GM-CSF as the comparator in the Study 005/05 is considered acceptable.

The CAT discussed the validity of using DRR as the primary endpoint for the pivotal trials as opposed to using other more robust endpoints such as PFS or OS, as proposed by the CHMP in their Scientific Advice in 2008 and 2013. The CAT expressed concerns that using a new non-validated endpoint, there could be potential sources of bias that could have been introduced during the conduct or the analyses of the data. Nonetheless CAT concluded that DRR is an acceptable endpoint in this setting as it captures a relevant clinical effect of the treatment. One issue that was raised was that the EAC reviewed data for all subjects with a response per investigator and not all subjects (those without response as per investigator) were reviewed by the EAC. Subjects who could not have achieved a response lasting ≥ 6 months based on their duration of treatment were not required to be reviewed . The applicant provided further analyses that demonstrated that no additional durable responders were identified by the EAC in the talimogene laherparepvec arm and only one patient was identified in the GM-CSF among investigator non-responders. This data was reassuring that no bias was introduced from the EAC review.

Another potential source of bias which concerned the CAT was early treatment discontinuation, which could have potentially disproportionately affected the OS results in favour of the talimogene laherparepvec arm if patients in the GM-CSF arm were to discontinue early. Progressive disease was the most frequently reported reason for treatment discontinuation in both the talimogene laherparepvec arm (78.3%) and the GM-CSF arm (72.3%) during the first 6 months. The applicant submitted a sensitivity analysis which clarified that the patients who discontinued early did not affect the observed treatment difference.

The number of subjects with major protocol deviations was higher in the talimogene laherparepvec group (12.2% vs. 3.5% the GM-CSF group) and with missing confirmatory scans being the most common protocol deviation (6.1% vs. 0.7%, correspondingly). The Applicant has provided an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

additional analysis of durable response. The imputation of subjects with major protocol deviations (including missing confirmatory scans) did not have a major effect on DRR.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary efficacy endpoint, DRR, was met in the primary efficacy analysis; talimogene laherparepvec resulted in a statistically significant improvement in DRR compared with GM-CSF (16.3% vs. 2.1%). The magnitude of the effect was considered clinical relevant. Overall survival was a secondary endpoint and the study does not provide enough statistical power to show a statistically significant difference for this endpoint. A trend in increased OS was observed in the talimogene laherparepvec arm, with median OS of 23.3 months in the talimogene laherparepvec treated group and 18.9 months in the GM-CSF treated group (HR 0.79; 95% CI 2.7-29.2; p-value 0.0511).

Overall response rate (PR + CR) was higher in the talimogene laherparepvec group, with 10.8% of subjects reaching CR (0.7% in the GM-CSF group).

The median time to lesion response was shortest for lesions that were directly injected (21.1 weeks), followed  by non-injected  non-visceral  lesions  (44.1 weeks) and visceral  lesions  (110.4 weeks).  This finding is consistent with initiation of a delayed regional and systemic anti-tumour immune response to talimogene laherparepvec and supports the proposed mechanism of action in melanoma.

A subgroup analysis of DRR and ORR indicated that the observed efficacy was most pronounced in stage IIIb-c/IVM1a patients, in particular in the untreated patients (first-line setting). There were very little effect observed in stage IVM1b and IVM1c patients. The applicant submitted further post-hoc analyses to show that there was co-linearity in the multivariate analysis for line of therapy and stage of disease. Thus, it was not possible to distinguish whether the clinical benefit observed was derived from patients having had no prior treatment or from the patients in the early stages of the disease. The CAT also highlighted that the current pre-treated melanoma population will be different that the pre-treated population when the study was conducted as new approved therapies are available and the standard of care has evolved since then. Thus, the CAT acknowledged that restricting the indication to only untreated patients would not be justified (See SmPC section 4.4). Therefore, the patient population was restricted based on stage of disease to patients that have unresectable disease and no visceral metastases, hence excluding patients with stage IVM1b and IVM1c advanced metastatic disease. The CAT expressed some concern that the data of post-hoc subgroup analyses in a single study has not been confirmed in a confirmatory study. However, it was acknowledged that the applicant has discussed the credibility of the subgroup analyses and that it followed the EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013 Guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials) with  robust statistical analyses based on pre-specification of covariate, replication across studies (study 005/05 and 002/03), consistency across endpoints, statistical significance of treatment-bycovariate interaction and biological plausibility of the observed effect.

Secondary analyses and exploratory subgroup analyses of overall survival indicate differences between the survival distributions of the talimogene laherparepvec group compared to the GM-CSF group, in particular after excluding patients with stage IVM1b and IVM1c. Based on the totality of the data and analyses presented, a trend in OS favouring talimogene laherparepvec was seen supporting a clinical benefit for patients in early stage patients.

The exploratory analyses of overall survival are adequately reflected in the SmPC, section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The exploratory data on the incidence of lesion response indicated that talimogene laherparepvec could potentially  have  a  systemic  effect  and  decrease  and  even  prevent  micrometastases/new  lesions. However, the data presented are still preliminary and not definitive conclusions can be drawn.

The CAT expressed some concern over the potential delay in next-line treatment in patients that were defined as non-responders, given that there are currently other treatments approved for the same patient population eg ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab. This has been identified as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be evaluated from current clinical trials that are ongoing (see PhV post-authorisation studies) and the literature.  Preliminary results from a study where patients were treated with talimogene laherparepvec prior to receiving ipilimumab showed that response to ipilimumab was not affected by talimogene laherparepvec (data not shown) 17 .  Thus, it appears that subsequent therapies should not be affected by treatment with talimogene laherparepvec. The loss of efficacy in patients treated with systemic acyclovir to manage complications has also been identified as an important potential risk which will be managed in the RMP by ongoing clinical trials and the literature. Long-term efficacy has been identified as missing information in the RMP and study 20120139, a registry study to evaluate the survival and long-term safety of subjects with melanoma who previously received talimogene laherparepvec.

The safety and efficacy of Imlygic in paediatric patients has not been established. No data are available. The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Imlygic in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (SmPC section 5.1, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Additional expert consultation

Following a CAT request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 10 th  September 2015 to provide advice on the list of questions adopted by the CAT at its July 2015 meeting. On 9 th  October 2015 a Scientific Advisory Group was convened to assess the need to revise the answers to the list of questions following receipt of further information on the statistical analysis of the overall survival.

## FINAL SAG ANSWERS

## An updated survival with additional events has been submitted. In light of this analysis, should any of the answers from the SAG meeting of 10 September be revised?

The SAG considered the updated analysis and agreed that in the light of the data presented (including the updated analysis), there is a need to clarify that although in exploratory subgroup analyses talimogene laherparepvec appeared to be associated with an effect on OS in the stage IIIB-C/IVM1a, this effect was not based on robust statistical evidence and should require collateral confirmation. Accordingly, the answers from the SAG meeting of 10 September have revised as described below.

It would be useful to reflect the overall survival data in the overall population and in the subgroup in the product information (preferably using Kaplan-Meier curves) and to clearly state that the subgroup results are exploratory only and that on the basis of the current evidence, it has not been established that talimogene laherparepvec is associated with an effect on overall survival in the target subgroup.

## 1. Is the improvement in the primary endpoint, DRR (16.3% vs. 2.1 in the primary analysis population and 25.2% vs. 1.2 in the stage IIIB-C/IVM1a population) of clinical relevance when seen in light of the results of the analysis of OS and the favourable safety profile of the product?

The improvement in the primary endpoint, DRR in the overall population was 16.3% vs 2.1% for talimogene laherparepvec and GM-CSF, respectively.  In post-hoc subgroup analyses, stage IIIB, IIIC

17  Puzanov et al, ASCO 2014, Abstract #9029

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and IV M1a population showed an improvement in DRR of 25.2% in talimogene laherparepvec treated patients compared to 1.2% for GM-CSF treat patients.

In the overall population, the overall survival HR (95% C.I) was 0.79 (0.62, 1.00), p=0.051. In the exploratory analysis in the target subgroup of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a, the overall survival HR was: 0.57 (0.40-0.80). In an updated analysis in the overall population (including events that had been censored in earlier analyses for 5 patients), the overall survival HR was 0.82 (0.65,1.05), p=0.116. In the target subgroup (stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a), the updated HR was 0.61 (0.43, 0.86).

Many SAG members found the effect clinically relevant for the primary endpoint of DRR, although being an unconventional endpoint. However, if the aim of the study was to achieve loco-regional antitumour response in soft tissue disease, then there were concerns about the suboptimal GM-CSF control arm. Although talimogene laherparepvec was clearly associated with an effect on DRR, it is doubtful that the observed DRR  of 16% (or about 25% in exploratory subgroup analyses) is of clinical value considering the available loco-regional treatment options, such as combination chemotherapy (the response rate associated with combination chemotherapy in patients with soft tissue disease is in the range of 30%-40% 18,19,20,21 ), or electro-chemotherapy and the new immunotherapies all of which are known to be associated with high and durable response rate in soft tissue disease. There is also uncertainty about the efficacy in terms of neighbouring soft tissue lesions that have not been injected with talimogene laherparepvec (further analyses may help clarify this point), as the there is a limit to the number of lesions that can be treated in terms of total volume administered. This and the complexity of talimogene laherparepvec administration may further reduce the value of talimogene laherparepvec as a possible loco-regional treatment of melanoma.

Although there appeared to be an effect on overall survival in the subgroup of patients with Stage IIIBIVM1a disease, overall survival was a secondary endpoint and the effect was based on exploratory subgroup analyses, after the analysis in the full analysis set was not statistically significant, and without a pre-specified strategy for multiplicity adjustment. The notable changes in statistical significance based on the inclusion of a few more events (updated analysis) add to the uncertainty of this exploratory finding. Thus, the apparent association between treatment with talimogene laherparepvec and overall survival cannot be considered statistically convincing. Furthermore collateral reproducibility from other studies was lacking and the phase II data did not provide support for this finding. In terms of biological rationale, a decreasing effect for the more advanced stages has been consistently observed with other immunotherapies, and could provide indirect support. However, the claimed mechanism of action in terms of the systemic immunological effect has not been fully elucidated (and the lack of a clear effect in visceral lesions would suggest a modest effect), which adds uncertainty about the validity of the findings of the exploratory subgroup analysis of overall survival.

In summary, considering all evidence, it cannot be concluded that an effect on overall survival has been established for talimogene laherparepvec in the overall population and there still uncertainties in the subgroup including stages IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a. To determine the existence of a relevant effect on overall survival, direct comparison with effective first-line systemic therapy currently available (e.g., anti-PD-1 or ipilimumab) would be necessary. Although talimogene laherparepvec is associated with an effect on DRR, the existence of other therapeutic options with rigorously established effect on overall survival needs to be taken into account when evaluating the best treatment option for patients.

Concerning the line of therapy, there are practically no data about the effect of talimogene laherparepvec after current effective immunotherapy (given as adjuvant treatment or as treatment for metastatic disease). Thus, the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in the second-line setting is essentially unknown and cannot easily be assumed based on pharmacological grounds. In the present study, however, the effect in first line revealed a HR of 0.36 (95% COI…) while in second line the HR was 0.93, (95% COI…). Thus no convincing effect was observed for talimogene laherparepvec used as second-line treatment following the standard first line treatments that were conventional at the time

the study was conducted and the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec can only be considered established in the first-line treatment of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a melanoma. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal sequence of new agents in the treatment of advanced melanoma.

In conclusion, talimogene laherparepvec was associated with an effect on DRR; in view of the acceptable toxicity profile, the benefits of talimogene laherparepvec are considered to outweigh its risks in the first-line treatment of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a melanoma. However, given the effective systemic treatment options that have become available, it is difficult to define a priori a patient population for whom talimogene laherparepvec might be the optimal treatment option.

2. The Applicant proposes a restricted indication to only include stage IIIB/C and IVM1a subgroups. The SAG Oncology is asked to discuss whether data as a whole and the subgroup analyses support a restricted indication, and whether additional ways to identify true responders/patients who benefit from talimogene laherparepvec could be identified.

The efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec has only been established in the first-line treatment of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a melanoma (see answer to question No. 1).

Unfortunately, no comprehensive biomarker data have been submitted to allow exploration of important prognostic or predictive biomarkers. A number of studies are being planned aiming to explore a multitude of possible biomarkers, which is encouraged. Concerns were expressed about the size of the studies that are possibly too small to have sufficient power to identify important biomarkers amongst the multitude of possible biomarkers, and the need to be selective about the biomarkers to be explored taking into account state-of-the art knowledge.

3. Are there concerns related to treating certain patients with talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy through the pseudoprogression/progression prior to response, and possible postponement of other available therapies?

There are concerns that using talimogene laherparepvec in first-line therapy of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a melanoma will delay the use of therapies with an established effect on overall survival in terms of preventing metastatic disease, especially visceral or brain disease and result in a detriment in overall survival. In the case of talimogene laherparepvec, the fact that treatment is recommended beyond progression adds to this concern. Direct comparison with effective currently available first-line systemic therapy is lacking.

At present, it is not possible to give clear guidance about patient or disease characteristics that would allow selecting patients for whom Imlygic might be the optimal treatment option (see also answers to questions 1 and 3). In the absence of evidence-based recommendations, the use of talimogene laherparepvec in first-line therapy of patients with stage IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a melanoma will require careful consideration of the available systemic treatment options and their associated benefits, risks and uncertainties, and the risk of delaying systemic therapies with an established survival benefit. From a patient perspective, this in depth discussion about the benefits, risks and uncertainties of different treatments will be critical in order to determine the preferred treatment option.

There is also a risk that in clinical practice, treatment compliance with talimogene laherparepvec after progression will be poor compared to the clinical trial in view of the possibility to switch to other effective treatment options. This could reduce the effectiveness of treatment with Imlygic.

4. The new proposed indication excludes patients with visceral disease. The SAG oncology is asked if there are situations where Imlygic might be beneficial also for these patients despite limited evidence of a systemic effect on visceral disease.

Based on available data, the efficacy in the treatment of patients with stage IV M1b and M1c has not been established (see answer to question No. 1). It is recommended to reflect the target population using the correct AJCC melanoma staging and classification explicitly in the indication avoiding the term 'visceral', which does not include other metastatic disease (e.g., to the bone, or brain) that should also be excluded from the target indication.

5. Given other available treatments, and with particular consideration of the potential for 'loss of chance' by delaying other therapeutic alternatives, in what situations does the SAG consider that use of Imlygic might be appropriate.

As for any new treatment, there is potential loss of chance in terms of other establish treatments that are  indicated  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  melanoma.  Comparative  data  with  currently  available effective systemic treatments are needed to rule out any detriment (see answers to questions 1 and 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The pivotal study 005/05 met its primary endpoint and provided satisfactory evidence that talimogene laherparepvec demonstrated a clinically relevant benefit in patients with unresectable melanoma without visceral disease. The primary endpoint, DRR, was considered appropriate for this type of new agent targeting the tumour as well as the immune system. Therefore, the CAT considered that the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in adult patients with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (Stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease (see section SmPC 4.4 and 5.1) had been demonstrated.

Without having specific validated biomarkers, the challenge remains in trying to identify the limited number of patients who respond to talimogene laherparepvec with a durable response. In order to further define this population it might be considered relevant to generate further efficacy data in the post-authorisation phase in order to monitor the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression. The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to efficacy:

- The MAH should submit the preliminary results of Study 20120325 (a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial to evaluate the correlation between objective response rate and baseline intratumoral CD8+T-lymphocyte density in subjects with unresected stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma treated with talimogene laherparepvec), by 31st December 2018.
- To submit the preliminary results from Study 20110266 (a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial assessing the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec neoadjuvant treatment plus surgery vs surgery alone for resectable stage IIIB to IVM1a melanoma).
- To provide preliminary efficacy results from the phase III part of the Study 20110265 (a multicenter trial evaluating the combination of talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab).

The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The clinical safety of talimogene laherparepvec has been addressed with three defined safety sets.

- Primary Melanoma Analysis Set , n=419, 1 pivotal, open-label, active-controlled (GM-CSF) phase III trial in unresectable stage IIIB, IIIC, and IV melanoma (Study 005/05): n=292 subjects exposed to talimogene laherparepvec in multiple doses of 10 6  (initial dose only) and 10 8  PFU/mL for a median treatment duration of 23.0 weeks (range: 0.1 to 78.9 weeks); n=127 subjects exposed to GM-CSF for a median treatment duration of  for 10 weeks (range 0.6 to 72 weeks) weeks.

Dose reduction is defined as 40% decrease of the daily prescribed dose from previous daily prescribed dose.

Safety Population is defined as randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment.

## Adverse events

A treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) was defined as any adverse event that occurred after administration of the first dose of study drug and through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or any event that was present at baseline and continued after the first dose of study treatment but worsened in intensity. An overview on the overall subject incidence of treatment emergent AEs for the Primary Melanoma Analysis Set (Study 005/05) is provided in Table 39.

a  Treatment-related adverse event refers to treatment-emergent adverse events that have possible or probable relation to study treatment as determined by investigator.

The listings of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and their frequency estimations in Section 4.8 of the proposed  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  are  based  on  the  crude  incidence  data  available  for treatment-emergent adverse events as indicated above. According to the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (September 2009), the frequency of adverse reactions should represent crude incidence rates (and not differences or relative risks calculated against placebo or other comparator). The methodology for the ADR table below includes the following:

- ADRs  are  defined  as  preferred  terms  (PTs)  with ≥ 2%  difference  in  subject  incidence  in  the talimogene laherparepvec arm compared to the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) arm in Study 005-05, and
- Biological plausibility likely to be related to talimogene laherparepvec.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Events with &lt; 2% difference were included if terms were similar to other terms defined as ADRs and met biological plausibility criterion.
- Events were excluded if all cases were more likely to be related to an alternative etiology.
- In addition, other adverse events were included in the SmPC (Section 4.8) even if they did not meet the 2% threshold, but based on temporal association, seriousness and possible relatedness (eg,  plasmacytoma,  airway  obstructive  disorder,  immune  mediated  adverse  event)  following medical review.

Treatment Emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term are reported in Table 40.

The majority (70-90%) of the events chills, pyrexia, and influenza-like illness resolved within 72 hours. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in severity: more specifically, 63% were grade I-II and 36% were grade ≥3 in severity.

The subject incidence of treatment-related adverse events with a worst grade of 3 was 10.3% (n = 30) for the talimogene laherparepvec group and 4.7% (n = 6) for the GM-CSF group. Treatment-related adverse events with a worst grade of 3 that were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects in the talimogene laherparepvec group were fatigue (1.0% [n=3] talimogene laherparepvec, 0% GM-CSF), cellulitis (1.4% [n=4], 0%), and tumour pain (1.0% [n=3], 0%). All these are identified as ADRs associated with the use of talimogene laherparepvec.

The subject incidence of adverse events with a worst grade of 4 was 4.5% (n = 13) for the talimogene laherparepvec group and 3.1% (n = 4) for the GM-CSF group. The subject incidence of treatmentrelated adverse events with a worst grade of 4 was 1.0% (n = 3) for the talimogene laherparepvec group and 0.0% for GM-CSF group. The grade 4 treatment-related adverse events in the talimogene laherparepvec group were plasmacytoma, glomerulonephritis, and obstructive airways disorder. These events have been identified as ADRs associated with the use of talimogene laherparepvec.

The most commonly reported Grade ≥3 AEs are reported in Table 41.

N = Number of subjects in the analysis set

Page 2 of 2

Primary Melanoma Analysis Set is defined as all randomized subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment.

The incidence rates in this table reflect only the number of cases/events that were reported with preferred association. The cases/events identified in this table were medically reviewed to determine if they met the caise definition in order to provide a true ascertainment of the subject incidence of the event shown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Six patients in the talimogene laherparepvec-group and two in the GM-CSF-group had immunemediated events compatible with autoimmune aetiology; included two cases of glomerulonephritis and two cases of vasculitis as well as a pneumonitis and an exacerbation of psoriasis. Hypersensitivity reactions (53 vs. 25 cases) and vitiligo (15 vs 2 cases) were excluded from this analysis. Rash was the most common hypersensitivity in both treatment group, 8.9% in the talimogene laherparepvec-group. One patient in the talimogene laherparepvec-group developed bronchial asthma during the treatment. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported in the Primary Melanoma Analysis Set. The exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates for hypersensitivity were driven by the PT 'Rash' and the PT 'dermatitis'.

Fever, elevated white blood cell count, bacteraemia or sepsis, and hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics were reported in 5 of the 7 cases of cellulitis in the talimogene laherparepvec group. Cellulitis developed after one to multiple doses, and 5 of the events (all in the talimogene laherparepvec group) were considered to be possibly related to study treatment. None of the serious cellulitis events resulted in study treatment discontinuation; study treatment was delayed for one subject.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious adverse events

An overview of the treatment-emergent serious adverse events with ≥1 % incidence is reported in Table 43. No serious adverse events with at least 5% frequency were reported in either of the treatment groups.

The subject incidence of all treatment-related serious adverse events was 6.5% (n = 19) in the talimogene laherparepvec group and 0% in the GM-CSF group. The 2 most common treatment-related serious adverse events were cellulitis (1.7% [n = 5] talimogene laherparepvec, 0% GM-CSF) and pyrexia (1.4% [n = 4], 0%).

The subject incidence of serious adverse events was 28.0% in the talimogene laherparepvec group for subjects who were seropositive at baseline and 25.5% for subjects who were seronegative at baseline.

## Deaths

Fatal adverse events were reported for 23 subjects receiving talimogene laherparepvec during the study treatment periods. There were nine fatal events among subjects receiving talimogene laherparepvec that were classified as disease progression, all from the melanoma studies. From these, seven (7/9) have occurred during the first three months after the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec, and two out of these seven cases (2/7) after the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec. None of the events have been considered to be related to study drug (studies 005/05 and 002/03).

## Other significant events - viral shedding and transmission

The most comprehensive set of samples (ie, in terms of the number of time points tested) was obtained from Study 001/01 and the pivotal Study 005/05 did not include any shedding data outside the reactive swabs nor were they collected systematically. In the 20120324 study (A Phase 2, Multicenter, Single-arm Trial to Evaluate the Biodistribution and Shedding of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Subjects With Unresected, Stage IIIB to IVM1c Melanoma), talimogene laherparepvec was not detectable in blood, urine, injected lesion and occlusive dressing at day 30 post treatment (Table 44).

N = Number of subjects in the analysis set; n = Number of subjects with non-missing data at the time point of interest; SD = sample standard deviation; Q1 = first quartile; Q3 = third quartile . Safety Population is defined as randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment.

In Study 005/05, at baseline, 251 subjects (59.9%) were seropositive, 143 subjects were seronegative (34.1%), and 13 subjects (3.1%) had unknown HSV-1 antibody status. Of the 98 subjects who were HSV-1 seronegative at baseline in the talimogene laherparepvec group, definitive post-treatment results were obtained for 85 subjects, 77 of whom seroconverted (3 subjects remained seronegative with results at cycle 3, and 5 subjects remained seronegative with results at cycle 6). No post-baseline HSV-1 serostatus was collected for the GM-CSF group.

## Post marketing experience

Talimogene laherparepvec was not marketed at the time of assessment of the marketing authorisation application.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The most common treatment emergent adverse events with talimogene laherparepvec were fatigue, chills, pyrexia, nausea, influenza like illness and injection site pain. All these treatment-emergent AEs had a crude incidence of &gt; 25% among those exposed to talimogene laherparepvec in the Primary Melanoma Analysis Set. Almost all subjects (90%) experienced what was determined as 'flu-like symptoms'. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in severity.

There were two cases of cerebral hemorrhage in subjects with a history of brain metastases. The potential association of these two events with talimogene laherparepvec can neither be confirmed nor rejected at this stage. As cerebral metastases were applied as trial exclusion criteria for study 005/05, the SmPC section 4.4 has been updated to indicate that there is limited experience with the use of the product in patients with active brain metastases and therefore caution should be exercised when treating such patients.

Cellulitis at the injection site, impaired wound healing and injection site reactions are relevant adverse drug reactions associated with exposure to talimogene laherparepvec and have been included in the RMP as important safety concerns. The local reactions at the injection site may reflect local tumour lysis whereas no signs for AEs reflecting systemic tumour lysis were identified. Herpes simplex virus infection was reported in 5.5% of subjects in the talimogene laherparepvec group and 1.6% of subjects in the GM-CSF group.  Most  was oral herpes while no testing of wild type versus vaccine strain was performed.

In the pivotal clinical trial (study 1), events of cellulitis did not lead to permanent discontinuation of Imlygic treatment. Careful wound care and infection precautions are recommended, particularly if tissue necrosis results in open wounds (SmPC section 4.8).

Necrosis or ulceration of tumour tissue may occur following Imlygic treatment. Cellulitis and systemic bacterial infection have been reported. Careful wound care and infection precautions are recommended, particularly if tissue necrosis results in open wounds (SmPC section 4.4).

In clinical studies, impaired healing at the injection site has been reported. Imlygic may increase the risk of impaired healing in patients with underlying risk factors (e.g. previous radiation at the injection site or lesions in poorly vascularised areas) (SmPC section 4.4).

Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic before continuing treatment if persistent infection or delayed healing develops (SmPC section 4.4).

Plasmacytoma is considered as an important identified risk.  In clinical trials, one case of plasmacytoma at injection site was observed in a patient who was found to have multiple myeloma (SmPC section 4.8).

Plasmacytoma has been reported in proximity to the injection site after administration of Imlygic. Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic in patients with multiple myeloma or in whom plasmacytoma develops during treatment (SmPC section 4.4).

One subject in the talimogene laherparepvec treatment group experienced a serious event of obstructive airway disorder, which resolved. This event was serious and grade 4 in severity and has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been included in the RMP as an important identified risk . Obstructive airway disorder has been reported following Imlygic treatment. Use caution when injecting lesions close to major airways (SmPC section 4.4).

In the phase 3 melanoma clinical study, the subject incidence of adverse events of deep vein thrombosis was 2.1% (n = 6) in the talimogene laherparepvec group (95% CI: 0.8, 4.4). In Study 005/05, 6 subjects (2.1%) treated with talimogene laherparepvec reported the adverse event of deep vein thrombosis. Of these, 3 adverse events were nonserious and 3 adverse events were serious. DVT has been identified as an important identified risk (SmPC section 4.8).

In all melanoma studies immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 1.7% (n=5) in subjects receiving talimogene laherparepvec versus 0.8% (n=1) subjects receiving GM-CSF group.  Thus immune-mediated adverse events have been identified as important identified risks. In clinical studies, immune-mediated events including as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, pneumonitis, worsening psoriasis, and vitiligo have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic. Vitiligo was reported in 5.1% of subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec.Immune-mediated events reported in the pivotal clinical study included one case each of worsening psoriasis in a patient with a prior history of psoriasis, one case of pneumonitis in a patient with a prior history of  autoimmune disease, one case of vasculitis, and one case of glomerulonephritis with an etiology of toxic/analgesic nephropathy. Permanent discontinuation of Imlygic treatment was reported in the patient who developed glomerulonephritis. The HCP should consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic before initiating treatment in patients who have underlying autoimmune disease or before continuing treatment in patients who develop immune-mediated events (SmPC section 4.4).

The safety data base is small in terms of the level and duration of exposure. This is considered acceptable based on the available data on quality and non-clinical issues indicating a minimal risk for clinically relevant latent infections with talimogene laherparepvec, low virulence in immunocompetent subjects as well as the non-integrating nature of talimogene laherparepvec. However, immunocompetent patients receiving talimogene laherparepvec could later become immunocompromised and, at least in theory, susceptible for disseminated herpetic infection induced by a latent infection with talimogene laherparepvec. Thus, the uncertainties in the clinical safety data support the post approval safety monitoring. A registration study will be set to monitor the long term safety of patients that have received talimogene laherparepvec (see RMP).

Whether patients who are not severely immunocompromised (those with conditions limited to T cell dysfunction such as HIV, AIDS, or patients with common variable immunodeficiency or those who require chronic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive agents) may be at increased risk of disseminated herpectic infection has not been established. The potential risk of disseminated herpetic infection and the potential benefits of treatment should be considered before administering talimogene laherparepvec to immunocompromised patients (such as those with HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, lymphoma, common variable immunodeficiency, or those who require chronic high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive agents). The SmPC 4.4 states to consider the potential risks and potential benefits of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec before administering to immunocompromised patients (such as those with HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, lymphoma, common variable immunodeficiency or those who require chronic, high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive agents). The SmPC section 4.3 contains a contra-indication in patients who are severely immunocompromised (e.g. patients with severe congenital or acquired cellular and/or humoral immune deficiency).  It is also contraindicated to administer talimogene laherparepvec in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to talimogene laherparepvec or any of its excipients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In clinical studies, herpetic infections (including cold sores and herpes keratitis) have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic. Symptoms of a local or systemic infection possibly related to Imlygic are anticipated to be similar to symptoms caused by wild-type HSV-1 infections (SmPC section 4.4).

90% of patients treated with Imlygic experienced influenza-like symptoms. Pyrexia, chills, and influenza like illness, which can occur any time during Imlygic treatment, generally resolved within 72 hours. These events were reported more frequently within the period of the first 6 treatments, particularly in patients who were HSV-1 negative at baseline (SmPC section 4.8).

Individuals with wild-type HSV-1 infection are known to be at a lifelong risk for symptomatic herpetic infection due to reactivation of latent wild-type HSV-1. Symptomatic herpetic infection due to possible reactivation of Imlygic should be considered (SmPC section 4.4).

Patients who develop herpetic infections should be advised to follow standard hygienic practices to prevent viral transmission (SmPC section 4.4).

Talimogene laherparepvec is sensitive to acyclovir. Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment before administering acyclovir or other anti-viral agents indicated for management of herpetic infection. These agents may interfere with the effectiveness of Imlygic if administered systemically or topically directly to the injection site (SmPC section 4.4).

Patients who were HSV-1 seronegative at baseline were reported to have a greater incidence of pyrexia, chills, and influenza-like illness compared with those who were HSV-1 seropositive at baseline, especially within the period of the first 6 treatments (see section 4.8).

Combination with other therapies like chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents. Immunosuppression  can  lead  to  immunodeficiency  and  put  that  patient  at  risk  of  HSV  herpetic infection. Thus this has been identified as an important potential risk (SmPC section 4.4).

Talimogene laherparepvec is intended only be used as prescribed medicine, the supply and traceability of talimogene laherparepvec is to be controlled and monitored. Talimogene laherparepvec is intended only be distributed to qualified centres, which have restricted access and appropriate facilities to handle GMO's, and adequately trained and experienced HCPs (see Annex II of the SmPC).

## Accidental exposure to Imlygic (SmPC section 4.4)

Accidental exposure may lead to transmission of Imlygic and herpetic infection. Healthcare professionals and close contacts (e.g. household members, caregivers, sex partners or persons sharing the same bed) should avoid direct contact with injected lesions or body fluids of treated patients during the entirety of the treatment period and up to 30 days after the last treatment administration (see section 6.6). Accidental needle stick and splash-back have been reported in healthcare providers during preparation and administration of Imlygic.

Close contacts who are pregnant or immunocompromised should not change the patient's dressing or clean their injection site. Pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals should not be exposed to potentially contaminated materials.

Ensure that patients are able to comply with the requirement to cover injection sites with occlusive dressings (see section 6.6). Patients should also be advised to avoid touching or scratching injection sites as this could lead to inadvertent transfer of Imlygic to other areas of their body or to their close contacts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although it is not known if Imlygic could be transmitted through sexual contact, it is known that wildtype HSV-1 can be transmitted through sexual contact. Patients should be advised to use a latex condom during sexual contact to prevent possible transmission of Imlygic. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment with Imlygic (see section 4.6).

Caregivers should be advised to wear protective gloves when assisting patients in applying or changing occlusive  dressings  and  to  observe  safety  precautions  for  disposal  of  used  dressings  and  cleaning materials (see sections 4.2 and 6.6).

In the event of an accidental exposure to Imlygic, exposed individuals should be advised to clean the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and/or a disinfectant. If signs or symptoms of herpetic infection develop, they should contact their healthcare professional. Talimogene laherparepvec is sensitive to acyclovir.

Proximity of close contacts and HCPs to lesions in treated patients in the absence of effective barriers may result in unintentional exposure to talimogene laherparepvec. Exposure may occur via direct contact with injected lesions or via contact with body fluids. A clinical study is in progress to inform whether talimogene laherparepvec is present in lorolabial and anogenital secretions of treated patients (RMP). The biodistribution and shedding of intralesionally administered talimogene laherparepvec are being investigated in a dedicated study (20120324) (see clinical pharmacology discussion).

Communication of risks and precautions are provided in the SPC and PIL to minimise the risk of transmission to an unintended individuals (including the accidental exposure). A description of the main symptoms of wild type HSV-1 infection, with instructions to inform a medical professional should the patient or a close contact of the patient display symptoms. Instructions for the management of such an infection are included in the SmPC section 6.6. In addition to SPC and PIL, educational materials addressed to the HCP and patients will also communicate risks and precautions to physicians and patients.

A Physician Education Booklet is provided to inform HCPs about important risks associated with talimogene laherparepvec (disseminated herpetic infection in severely immunocompromised individuals, potential harm to the fetus or neonate in pregnancy, herpetic infection in talimogene laherparepvec -treated patients, and accidental exposure of close contacts and HCPs to talimogene laherparepvec).

Patient Safety Brochures are provided to prescribing physicians for distribution to patients receiving talimogene laherparepvec, including information patients can share with family, caregivers, and close contacts, and information on the risks of transmission of talimogene laherparepvec, herpetic infection, and serious infection in immunocompromised individuals.

Patient Alert Cards are provided to prescribing physicians for distribution to patients receiving talimogene laherparepvec.

There is a lack of data from special groups, such as pregnant and lactating women and patients with brain  metastases.  These  have  been  identified  as  missing  information  and  will  be  monitored  using routine  minimisations  measures  (SmPC)  and  with  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  (managed distribution program, educational material, and a patient alert card). A pregnancy surveillance program will be implemented

There is no data on patients with renal or hepatic impairment, cardiac impairment, ethnic origin, bone metastases,  cerebral  metastases,  patients  with  more  than  3  visceral  lesions,  ocular  melanoma,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mucosal  melanoma,  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  lesions  greater  than  3  cm  and  patients below the age of 40 years. These will be monitored through PSURs.

Imlygic contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine (SmPC section 4.4).

Each 4 mL dose of Imlygic contains approximately 30 mg (1.3 mmol) sodium.  To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet (SmPC section 4.4).

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file (SmPC section 4.4).

No interaction studies have been conducted with Imlygic. Acyclovir and other anti-viral agents may interfere with the effectiveness of Imlygic if administered systemically or topically directly to the injection site. Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment before administering acyclovir or other anti-viral agents indicated for management of herpetic infection (SmPC section 4.5).

## Transmission of Imlygic via sexual contact (SmPC section 4.6)

All patients should be advised to use a latex condom during sexual contact to prevent possible transmission of Imlygic (see section 4.4).

## Contraception (SmPC section 4.6)

Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment with Imlygic.

## Pregnancy (SmPC section 4.6)

Adequate and well controlled studies with talimogene laherparepvec have not been conducted in pregnant women. No effects on embryo-foetal development have been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of talimogene laherparepvec during pregnancy.

If a pregnant woman has an infection with wild type HSV-1 (primary or reactivation), there is potential for the virus to cross the placental barrier, and also a risk of transmission during birth due to viral shedding. Infections with wild-type HSV-1 have been associated with serious adverse effects, including multi-organ failure and death, if a foetus or neonate contracts the wild type herpes infection. While there are no clinical data to date on talimogene laherparepvec infections in pregnant women, there could be a risk to the foetus or neonate if talimogene laherparepvec were to act in the same manner .

Transplacental metastases of malignant melanoma can occur. Because talimogene laherparepvec is designed to enter and replicate in the tumour tissue, there could be a risk of foetal exposure to talimogene laherparepvec from tumour tissue that has crossed the placenta.

If Imlygic is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Imlygic, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazards to the foetus and/or neonate.

## Breast-feeding (SmPC section 4.6)

It is unknown whether talimogene laherparepvec is transferred into human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Imlygic therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fertility (SmPC section 4.6)

No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of talimogene laherparepvec on fertility (nonclinical data are discussed in section 5.3).

Talimogene laherparepvec may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as dizziness and confusional state (see section 4.8), patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain that talimogene laherparepvec does not adversely affect them.

There is no clinical experience with overdose with Imlygic. Doses up to 4 mL at a concentration of 108 PFU/mL every 2 weeks have been administered in clinical trials with no evidence of dose limiting toxicity. The maximum dose of Imlygic that can be safely administered has not been determined. In the event of a suspected overdose or inadvertent intravenous administration, the patient should be treated symptomatically, e.g. with acyclovir or other anti-viral agents (see section 4.4) and supportive measures instituted as required.

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Although the safety database for talimogene laherparepvec is limited and knowledge on long-term safety is missing, the ADRs reported for patients being treated with talimogene laherparepvec appear to be acceptable as most are low grade and manageable. The risk of transmission of talimogene laherparepvec from patient to close contacts or HCPs via direct contact with injected lesions or body fluids resulting in symptomatic infection (primary or reactivation) has been identified as a potential risk. The applicant has included as additional risk minimisation activities educational material for the HCP and the patient to inform about the risk associated with talimogene laherparepvec. The patient alert cards will advise the patient of the risks of talimogene laherparepvec including the risk of transmission of talimogene laherparepvec, signs and symptoms of herpetic infections and on the use of talimogene laherparepvec in pregnancy. The controlled distribution programme is aimed to manage the product supply chain and to ensure that cold storage requirements are observed and to control the distribution of IMLYGIC to qualified centres and up to the patients.

The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The primary analysis of the phase III study 005/05 talimogene laherparepvec resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, Durable Response Rate (DRR), compared with GMCSF (16.3% vs. 2.1%), with unadjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 8.9 (2.7, 29.2), p &lt; 0.0001. Overall survival was a secondary endpoint and the study does not provide enough statistical power to show a statistically significant difference for this endpoint. A trend in increased OS was observed in the talimogene laherparepvec arm, with median OS of 23.3 months in the talimogene laherparepvec treated group and 18.9 months in the GM-CSF treated group (HR 0.79; 95% CI 2.7-29.2; p-value 0.0511).

The analyses of all but one of the secondary endpoints (including ORR, disease burden, TTF, duration of response and response interval) favoured treatment with talimogene laherparepvec over GM-CSF. Time to response onset was fairly similar in the two arms.

Lesion-level response analyses indicated a loco-regional and systemic effect for talimogene laherparepvec. Nearly two-thirds of injected lesions and one-third of non-injected/non-visceral lesions decreased in size by ≥ 50%; and approximately 15% of non -injected/visceral lesions decreased in size by ≥50%. Overall subject -level responses were seen in subjects with non-injected/non-visceral lesions as well as in subjects with non-injected/visceral lesions.

In an analysis grouping disease stages consistent with the presence or absence of visceral disease, the durable response rates (DRR) for talimogene laherparepvec and GM-CSF were 25.2% vs 1.2% in subjects with Stage IIIB-C/IVM1a disease and 5.3% vs 3.6% in subjects with Stage IVM1b-c disease, respectively. For subjects with Stage IIIB-C/IVM1a disease, consistent results were observed also for the objective response rate (40.5% vs. 2.3% GM-CSF, [CR 16.6% vs. 0% GM-CSF]) and overall survival (OS), were a 19.6-month increase in favour of the talimogene laherparepvec arm was found (41.1 vs 21.5 months). Therefore, the indication has been restricted to patients without visceral disease.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Secondary and subgroup analyses of overall survival indicate differences between the survival distributions of the talimogene laherparepvec group compared to the GM-CSF group, in particular after excluding late stage patients. A trend in OS favouring talimogene laherparepvec was observed, however due to the exploratory nature of these analyses the magnitude of the OS gain cannot be concluded on.

There were no samples taken to assess against validated biomarkers that could be predictive of response. Thus, the CAT has imposed three conditions to the marketing authorisation (see below Recommendations section) to further study the role of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec, and to identify patient subgroups that benefit from talimogene laherparepvec.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety of Imlygic was evaluated in 295 patients (N=436, 295 Imlygic, 141 GM-CSF) in the pivotal study that received at least 1 dose of study treatment (see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure to Imlygic was 23 weeks (5.3 months). Twenty six (26) patients were exposed to Imlygic for at least one year.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions ( ≥ 25%) in Imlygic-treated patients were fatigue (50.3%), chills (48.6%), pyrexia (42.8%), nausea (35.6%), influenza-like illness (30.5%), and injection site pain (27.7%). Overall, ninety eight per cent (98%) of these adverse reactions reported were mild or moderate in severity. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse reaction was cellulitis at the injection site (2.1%), however plasmocytoma has also been reported at the injection site but at a much lower frequency (see section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). Almost all subjects (90%) in the pivotal trial experienced what was determined as 'flu-like symptoms' and the risk for such symptoms during the initial treatment cycles was especially elevated among subjects with negative serological HSV-status at baseline. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in severity (63% grade I-II, 36% grade ≥3 in severity) .

There is a risk for disseminated herpetic infection in severely immunocompromised individuals (those with any severe congenital or acquired cellular and/or humoral immune deficiency).The SmPC already contains a contraindication in section 4.3 for patients who are severely immunocompromised (e.g. patients with severe congenital or acquired cellular and/or humoral immune deficiency) and a warning for immunocompromised patients (such as those with HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, lymphoma, common variable immunodeficiency, or who require chronic high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive agents).  It is expected that the risk of transmission of talimogene laherparepvec is low and that the risk of an outbreak with talimogene laherparepvec is also negligible if the appropriate measures for disposing of the dressings are followed to prevent shedding of viruses from the tumour into the environment. Therefore, there is a warning in the SmPC section 4.4 on the accidental exposure of HCP to talimogene laherparepvec.

Obstructive airway disorders have been identified as an important identified risk. A warning has been included in the SmPC section 4.4 to use caution when injecting lesions close to the airways.

In clinical studies, immune-mediated events including as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, pneumonitis, worsening psoriasis, and vitiligo have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic. Immunemediated adverse reactions has been identified an important identified risk in the RMP and will be managed by recommendations in the SmPC and will be monitored through the registry study 20120139.

Deep vein thrombosis is a common ADR (SmPC section 4.8) with talimogene laherparepvec and has been identified as an important identified risk in the RMP and will be monitored through the registry study 20120139.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The number of subjects with melanoma exposed to talimogene laherparepvec for at least 1 year is 42. The majority (N=26) of these patients were enrolled in the pivotal trial forming the basis of the safety data. Thus, there is a lack of safety data for long-term exposure to talimogene laherparepvec. The cases of vitiligo demonstrate the ability of talimogene laherparepvec to induce an autoimmune reaction to normal melanocytes and against normal cells overall. In the absence of the knowledge of the target

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigens, it is difficult to predict the spectrum of autoimmunity associated with talimogene laherparepvec treatment. Thus, there was a potential signal for other immune mediated events which will be monitored through PSURs.

The totality of the available evidence, i.e. the characteristics of the GMO, the pharmacological data as well as the safety data, indicates that the risk for shedding and transmission of talimogene laherparepvec to third parties is small and reduced with appropriately used occlusive dressings on the injected sites. However, the clinical data available to date is considered of limited value for firm conclusions on the extent and duration of risk for transmission with talimogene laherparepvec. However appropriate recommendations on the length of time required to minimize the risk of transmission are included in the SmPC. Further information on viral shedding will be obtained from Study 20120324, a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the biodistribution and shedding of talimogene laherparepvec in subjects with unresected, stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma, which is part of the RMP.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Talimogene laherparepvec represents a novel therapeutic concept, an oncolytic virus, among anticancer therapies.  Within the rapidly evolving standard-of-care of the regionally or distantly metastatic melanoma, the unmet medical need for new treatment approaches is acknowledged. Nevertheless, even in the context of novel treatment strategies and first-in-class products, certain principles of efficacy will remain: an anti-cancer medicinal product should demonstrate a true patient benefit, preferably in terms of improved survival, attenuation of disease progression and thereby an alleviation of the symptoms caused by the disease. There is no previous experience of DRR as a primary end point in the regulatory context or within the oncology community, and its clinical value remains to be fully established. It is acknowledged though that a durable response, as well as improved local disease control itself may be a clinical benefit for the patient as it may delay onset or worsening of symptoms and need for further treatment.  There are data indicating that there is some consistency between the effects observed from DRR and exploratory subgroup analyses of OS. Although it is acknowledged that the data derive from post-hoc analyses of a single pivotal trial they provide supportive evidence for restricting the indication on the basis of the higher DRR observed in adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease.

The pronounced effect in the subgroup of patients with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no visceral disease is considered biologically plausible, based on the wellknown correlation between tumour burden and response to immune therapy, as well as the method of action of talimogene laherparepvec.

In the oncology setting, treatment by talimogene laherparepvec is relatively well-tolerated. The identified safety profile is considered to be compatible with a systemic effect induced by talimogene laherparepvec and activation of the immune system. The other serious or severe unfavourable effects identified for talimogene laherparepvec are considered to be manageable, since the sensitivity of talimogene laherparepvec to acyclovir offers the opportunity to counterbalance any symptoms of viral infection should they be intolerable or a serious risk to the patient.

## Benefit-risk balance

Based on the results of the pivotal trial 005/05, the benefits of talimogene laherparepvec in the treatment of Imlygic is indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regionally or distantly metastatic (Stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease (see section 4.4 and 5.1), melanoma patients outweighed the adverse events. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance for talimogene laherparepvec in the proposed indication is positive.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

During the last few years, several new treatment options have been made available for advanced melanoma patients. This fist-in-class oncolytic virus which targets both the tumour as well as potentiating the immune system for long term immune surveillance is a novel therapy which will add value to the existing therapies. The safety data collected in study 005/05 did not reveal any major safety issues with talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy in melanoma patients, which is an advantage over other systemic therapies which have a higher toxicity and less tolerability.

Although talimogene laherparepvec is associated with an effect on DRR, it cannot be concluded that an effect on overall survival has been established for talimogene laherparepvec in the overall population and there are still uncertainties in the subgroup including stages IIIB, IIIC and IV M1a. A trend in OS favouring talimogene laherparepvec was observed, however due to the exploratory nature of these analyses the magnitude of the OS gain cannot be concluded on.

During the last few years, several new treatment options have been made available for use as the first- and second-line therapy for melanoma patients. In the present and future landscape of therapies for melanoma, the concept of oncolytic immune therapy may however find its place; yet a comprehensive biomarker programme and future studies are expected to help to identify and define the patient population that would respond best to talimogene laherparepvec.

The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above.

## APPENDIX 1 Divergent Position

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## DIVERGENT POSITION

The application is not approvable since too many uncertainties relating to efficacy and safety still remain. The clinical relevance of the effect of Imlygic in the studied patient population (OS HR 79%, 95%CI 0.62-1.00) is unclear and based only a single pivotal trial in the first line setting. Only in a not intended exploratory subgroup analysis (Stage IIIB-IVM1a) an effect on overall survival was observed. The effect of Imlygic on overall survival in this post-hoc selected population cannot be considered convincingly demonstrated. Furthermore, the effect of treatment with Imlygic before or in combination on available effective systemic treatment options in this subgroup is unclear and could even be detrimental.  Finally, the potential risk of postponement of currently available, probably more effective treatments for patients is considered unacceptable.
