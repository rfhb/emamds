## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Problem statement

Riltrava Aerosphere 5 micrograms/7.2 micrograms/160 micrograms pressurised inhalation, suspension is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC.  For this application reference is made to Trixeo Aerosphere (EMEA/H/C/004983) including all indications, pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations, authorised and granted in the EU. Accordingly, the MAH of the reference product has provided consent to allow access to Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for Riltrava Aerosphere consists only of Module 1 information.

Riltrava Aerosphere is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist or combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).

## 2.2. Type of Application and aspects on development

Scientific advice was given by the CHMP on the 18 th  of December 2014 (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2928/1/2014/III)  for Trixeo Aerosphere with a follow up clarification on the 5 th  of August 2015.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Scientific advice pertained to the following non-clinical and clinical aspects:

- Requirements for inhaled toxicology studies with the components (alone and in combination) to support clinical studies of up to 12 weeks in duration. Proposed nonclinical inhaled toxicology programme, including 3-month dog studies for BGF MDI, BFF MDI, and BD MDI, to support clinical studies of greater than 12 weeks in duration. Acceptability of the proposed nonclinical development programme to support MA of BGF MDI.
- Selection of the budesonide dose in BGF MDI for Phase III studies based upon systemic PK comparability relative to Symbicort TBH (Study PT010002). Proposed two studies; a large 1-year exacerbation study (PT010005) and a single 6-month lung function and symptom study (PT010006) to support a claim on 'exacerbation benefit as well as positive effects on lung function and symptom benefits'. Proposal that, if systemic exposure to budesonide administered through the BFF MDI is shown to be equivalent to or lower than that when administered through Symbicort TBH, then the safety profile of budesonide from Symbicort TBH can be extrapolated to BFF MDI and BGF MDI without the need to conduct further HPA axis, bone mineral density, and ophthalmological assessments. Acceptability to enrol patients with more severe COPD, based on history of COPD exacerbations into the study investigating COPD exacerbations in order to be able to demonstrate a difference between treatments. Endpoint selection in the Lung Function Trial. Sufficiency of proposed studies to characterize drug-drug interaction potential of the combination product vs individual components. Strategy to assess effect on QTc interval.

## 2.3. Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Trixeo Aerosphere application, the quality data in support of the Riltrava Aerosphere application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Trixeo Aerosphere dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.4. Non-clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Trixeo Aerosphere application, the non-clinical data in support of the Riltrava Aerosphere application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Trixeo Aerosphere dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.4.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Budesonide PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. However, considering that budesonide is classified as endocrine active a tailored Phase II assessment was performed on this basis. In a tailored Phase II assessment budesonide was not readily biodegradable but did not significantly absorb to solids during sewage treatment and is expected to pass into the aquatic environment. The water-sediment transformation study demonstrated budesonide not to be persistent and no bioaccumulation was seen in the fish bioconcentration assay. Therefore, budesonide does not fulfil the classification of a PBT substance.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of Riltrava Aerosphere to the environment.

The applicant commits to perform the following studies as follow-up measures:

A fish full life-cycle test is outstanding to address the potential for chronic effects of budesonide to fish. The Applicant indicated that a new fish full life-cycle study for budesonide will be performed and submitted as a post-authorisation measure for Trixeo Aerosphere.

## 2.4.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The provided nonclinical package is sufficient to support the MAA for Riltrava Aerosphere

## 2.5. Clinical aspects

Riltrava Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate dihydrate, glycopyrronium and budesonide) 5 micrograms/ 7.2 micrograms/160 micrograms pressurised inhalation, suspension is submitted as an informed consent application of Trixeo Aerosphere (EU/1/20/1498/001-003;  EMEA/H/C/004983)  under Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The present application cross-refers to the up-to-date clinical data of the original dossier of Trixeo Aerosphere, which has been assessed and authorised. Therefore, the clinical data in support of Riltrava Aerosphere MAA are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of Trixeo Aerosphere dossier, which have been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No new clinical data has been submitted.

## 2.6. Risk Management Plan

The RMP is in line with the approved EU-RMP version 1.2 of the cross-referred medicinal product Trixeo Aerosphere, 160/7.2/5.0 μg that was approved as part of the initial marketing authorisation application of Trixeo Aerosphere.

## 2.6.1. Safety concerns

## Summary of safety concerns

| Important identified risks   | None   |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Important potential risks    | None   |
| Missing information          | None   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6.2. Pharmacovigilance plan

As there are no safety concerns, no routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reaction reporting and signal detection or additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned.

## 2.6.3. Risk minimisation measures

As there are no important potential risks and no important identified risks or missing information, no risk minimisation measures are implemented.

## 2.6.4. Conclusion

The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## 2.7.1. Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.7.2. Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.8. Product information

The proposed product information for Riltrava is aligned with the latest approved version of the product information of the cross-referred product Trixeo Aerosphere.

## 2.8.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

As the Patient Information Leaflet for Riltrava is identical (with the exception of the product name) to that of the reference product, the user testing of the Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product can be taken to apply equally to Riltrava.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

The benefit-risk balance for Riltrava Aerosphere is considered positive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Riltrava Aerosphere is favourable in the following indication:

Riltrava Aerosphere is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist or combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

## Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation
