Furthermore, some (minor) changes to sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC are updated. Additionally and in line with the innovator's texts, section 5.2 has been updated to reflect the different sub-headings indicated in the current version of the QRD template, subsequently the contents of this section have been placed under the appropriate sub- headings. The information under 'Biotransformation' is currently approved for Ribavirin Teva; it is therefore not considered new information. In addition the following changes are implemented: • Section 4.2 of the SmPC - the subheadings are aligned |
