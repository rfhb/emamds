## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for olaparib, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Regarding the safety issue 'erythema nodosum', 13 cases were supportive of a correlation with olaparib, among which one case was strongly supportive with two episodes of erythema nodosum and positive rechallenge. A literature review reported three cases of erythema nodosum with causal association. Based on the review of the data, a causal relationship between olaparib and the occurrence of erythema n odosum is at least a reasonable possibility, therefore 'Erythema nodosum' should be included as a new adverse drug reaction (ADR) in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The frequency was determined as 'rare' based on clinical trials.

Regarding the signal of 'angioedema', there were overall 21 distinct cases supportive of a causal association between olaparib and angioedema. Twelve cases out of 21 (57%) were considered serious. A positive dechallenge was reported in more than 70% of the cases (15/21). A positive rechallenge was observed in 6 cases. Considering clinical features (swelling accompanied by urticaria and itching), short time to onset (TTO) and positive outcome following treatment with antihistamines and/or coritcosteroids, the cases observed were suggestive of a histamine-mediated reaction and consistent with angioedema as a manifestation of Type I hypersensitivity reaction. Based on the review of the cases reported, there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship for olaparib and the occurrence of 'angioedema'. Therefore, this event should be added to the list of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency 'uncommon'.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for olaparib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing olaparib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
