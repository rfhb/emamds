## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Oromucosal solution Clear, colourless to yellowish solution pH 2.9 to 3.7

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in infants from 3 months to adults.

BUCCOLAM must  only  be  used  by  parents/carers  where  the  patient  has  been  diagnosed  to  have epilepsy.

For infants between 3-6 months of age treatment should be in a hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available. See section 4.2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Standard doses are indicated below:

| Age range                      | Dose   | Label colour   |
|--------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| 3 to 6 months hospital setting | 2.5 mg | Yellow         |
| > 6 months to < 1 year         | 2.5 mg | Yellow         |
| 1 year to < 5 years            | 5 mg   | Blue           |
| 5 years to < 10 years          | 7.5 mg | Purple         |
| 10 years to adults             | 10 mg  | Orange         |

Carers should only administer a single dose of midazolam. If the seizure has not stopped within 10 minutes after administration of midazolam, emergency medical assistance must be sought and the empty syringe given to the healthcare professional to provide information on the dose received by the patient.

A second or repeat dose when seizures re-occur after an initial response should not be given without prior medical advice (see section 5.2).

For  patients  at  increased  risk  of  respiratory  depression  from  benzodiazepines,  administration  of BUCCOLAM under healthcare professional supervision should be considered prior to starting treatment with BUCCOLAM. This administration may be performed in the absence of a seizure.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required, however, BUCCOLAM should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure as elimination of midazolam may be delayed and the effects prolonged. (see section 4.4)

## Hepatic impairment

Hepatic impairment reduces the clearance of midazolam with a subsequent increase in terminal halflife.  Therefore,  the  clinical  effects  may  be  stronger  and  prolonged,  hence  careful  monitoring  of  the clinical effects and vital signs is recommended following administration of midazolam in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).

BUCCOLAM is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of midazolam in children aged 0 to 3 months has not been established. No data are available.

## Elderly

The elderly are more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. In patients from 60 years and in elderly patients BUCCOLAM should be used with caution.

## Method of administration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BUCCOLAM is for oromucosal use. The full amount of solution should be inserted slowly into the space  between  the  gum  and  the  cheek.  Laryngo-tracheal  insertion  should  be  avoided  to  prevent accidental  aspiration  of  the  solution.  If  necessary  (for  larger  volumes  and/or  smaller  patients), approximately half the dose should be given slowly into one side of the mouth, then the other half given slowly into the other side.

For detailed instructions on how to administer the medicinal product, see section 6.6.

## Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

No needle, intravenous tubing or any other device for parenteral administration should be attached to the oral syringe.

BUCCOLAM is not for intravenous use.

The oral syringe cap should be removed before use to avoid risk of choking.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance, benzodiazepines or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 Myasthenia gravis

Severe respiratory insufficiency

Sleep apnoea syndrome

Severe hepatic impairment

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Special caution should be exercised when administering midazolam to high-risk patients:

- adults over 60 years of age
- chronically ill or debilitated patients, e.g.
- patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency
- patients with chronic renal failure, impaired hepatic function or with impaired cardiac function
- paediatric patients with cardiovascular instability.

These high-risk patients may require lower dosages.

## Respiratory insufficiency

Midazolam  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  chronic  respiratory  insufficiency  because midazolam may further depress respiration.

## Paediatric patients aged 3 to 6 months

Given the higher metabolite to parent drug ratio in younger children, a delayed respiratory depression as a result of high active metabolite concentrations in the 3-6 months age group cannot be excluded. Therefore, the use of BUCCOLAM in the 3-6 month age group should be limited for use only under the supervision  of  a  health  care  professional  where  resuscitation  equipment  is  available  and  where respiratory function can be monitored and equipment for respiratory assistance, if needed, is available.

## Altered elimination of midazolam

Midazolam should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure, impaired hepatic or cardiac function. Midazolam may accumulate in patients with chronic renal failure or impaired hepatic function whilst in patients with impaired cardiac function it may cause decreased clearance of midazolam.

## Concomitant use with other benzodiazepines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Debilitated patients are more prone to the central nervous system (CNS) effects of benzodiazepines and, therefore, lower doses may be required.

## Medical history of alcohol or drug abuse

Midazolam should be avoided in patients with a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse.

## Amnesia

Midazolam may cause anterograde amnesia.

## Excipients

Sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per oral syringe, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Midazolam  is  metabolized  by  CYP3A4.  Inhibitors  and  inducers  of  CYP3A4  have  the  potential  to respectively  increase  and  decrease  the  plasma  concentrations  and,  subsequently,  the  effects  of midazolam thus requiring dose adjustments accordingly. Pharmacokinetic interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are more pronounced for oral as compared to oromucosal or parenteral midazolam as CYP3A4  enzymes  are  also  present  in  the  upper  gastro-intestinal  tract.  After  oromucosal administration, only systemic clearance will be affected. After a single dose of oromucosal midazolam, the  consequence  on  the  maximal  clinical  effect  due  to  CYP3A4  inhibition  will  be  minor  while  the duration of effect may be prolonged. Hence, a careful monitoring of the clinical effects and vital signs is recommended during the use of midazolam with a CYP3A4 inhibitor even after a single dose.

## Anaesthetics and narcotic analgesics

Fentanyl may reduce midazolam clearance.

## Antiepileptics

Co-administration  with  midazolam  may  cause  enhanced  sedation  or  respiratory  or  cardiovascular depression.    Midazolam  may  interact  with  other  hepatically  metabolised  medicinal  products,  e.g. phenytoin, causing potentiation.

## Calcium-channel blockers

Diltiazem  and  verapamil  have  been  shown  to  reduce  the  clearance  of  midazolam  and  other benzodiazepines and may potentiate their actions.

## Ulcer-healing medicinal products

Cimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole have been shown to reduce the clearance of midazolam and other benzodiazepines and may potentiate their actions.

## Xanthines

Metabolism of midazolam and other benzodiazepines is accelerated by xanthines.

## Dopaminergic medicinal products

Midazolam may cause inhibition of levodopa.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Muscle relaxants

E.g. baclofen. Midazolam may cause potentiation of muscle relaxants, with increased CNS depressant effects.

## Nabilone

Co-administration  with  midazolam  may  cause  enhanced  sedation  or  respiratory  and  cardiovascular depression.

## Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4

Medicinal  product  interactions  following  oromucosal  administration  of  midazolam  are  likely  to  be similar to those observed after intravenous midazolam rather than oral administration.

## Food

Grapefruit juice reduces the clearance of midazolam and potentiates its action.

## Azole antifungals

Ketoconazole  increased  the  plasma  concentrations  of  intravenous  midazolam  by  5-fold  while  the terminal half-life increased by about 3-fold.

Voriconazole increased the exposure of intravenous midazolam by 3-fold whereas its elimination halflife increased by about 3-fold.

Fluconazole and itraconazole both increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by 2 to 3-fold associated with an increase in terminal half-life by 2.4-fold for itraconazole and 1.5-fold for fluconazole.

Posaconazole increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 2-fold.

## Macrolide antibiotics

Erythromycin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 1.6 to 2 -fold associated with an increase of the terminal half-life of midazolam by 1.5 to 1.8-fold.

Clarithromycin  increased  the  plasma  concentrations  of  intravenous  midazolam  by  up  to  2.5-fold associated with an increase in terminal half-life by 1.5 to 2-fold.

## HIV Protease inhibitors

Co-administration  with  protease  inhibitors  (e.g.  Saquinavir  and  other  HIV  protease  inhibitors)  may cause a large increase in the concentration of midazolam. Upon co-administration with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam increased by 5.4-fold, associated with a similar increase in terminal half-life.

## Calcium-channel blockers

A single dose of diltiazem increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 25% and the terminal half-life was prolonged by 43%.

## Various medicinal products

Atorvastatin showed a 1.4-fold increase in plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam compared to control group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicinal products that induce CYP3A4

## Rifampicin

7 days of 600 mg once daily decreased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 60%. The terminal half-life decreased by about 50-60%.

## Herbs

St  John's  Wort  decreased  plasma  concentrations  of  midazolam  by  about  20-40%  associated  with  a decrease in terminal half life of about 15-17%.  Depending on the specific St John's Wort extract, the CYP3A4-inducing effect may vary.

## Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI)

The  co-administration  of  midazolam  with  other  sedative/hypnotic  medicinal  products  and  CNS depressants, including alcohol, is likely to result in enhanced sedation and respiratory depression.

Examples  include  opiate  derivatives  (used  as  analgesics,  antitussives  or  substitutive  treatments), antipsychotics, other benzodiazepines used as anxiolytics or hypnotics, barbiturates, propofol, ketamine, etomidate; sedative antidepressants, non-recent H1-antihistamines and centrally acting antihypertensive medicinal products.

Alcohol (including alcohol-containing medicinal products may markedly enhance the sedative effect of midazolam. Alcohol intake should be strongly avoided in case of midazolam administration (see section 4.4).

Midazolam decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalation anaesthetics.

The effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors may be larger in infants since part of the oromucosal dose is probably swallowed and absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of midazolam in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate a teratogenic effect with respect to reproductive toxicity, but foetotoxicity has been observed in humans as with other benzodiazepines. No data on exposed pregnancies are available for the first two trimesters of pregnancy.

The administration of high doses of midazolam in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour has been reported to produce maternal or foetal adverse reactions (risk of aspiration of fluids and stomach contents during labour in the mother, irregularities in the foetal heart rate, hypotonia, poor suckling, hypothermia and respiratory depression in the new-born infant).

Midazolam may be used during pregnancy if clearly necessary. The risk for new-born infants should be taken into account in the event of administration of midazolam in the third trimester of pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Midazolam is excreted in low quantities (0.6%) in human milk. As a result it may not be necessary to stop breast feeding following a single dose of midazolam.

## Fertility

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Animal studies did not show an impairment of fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Midazolam has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Sedation, amnesia, impaired attention and impaired muscular function may adversely affect the ability to drive, ride a bicycle or use machines. After receiving midazolam, the patient should be warned not to drive a vehicle or operate a machine until completely recovered.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Published clinical studies show that oromucosal midazolam was administered to approximately 443 children and 224 adults with seizures. Respiratory depression occurs at a rate of up to 5%, although this is a known complication of convulsive seizures as well as being related to midazolam use. One episode of pruritus was possibly attributed to the use of buccal midazolam.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The  table  below  lists  the  adverse  reactions  reported  to  occur  when  oromucosal  midazolam  was administered in clinical studies and postmarketing experience.

The frequency of adverse reactions is classified as follows:

Common:

≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10

Uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100

## Description of selected adverse reactions

An increased risk for falls and fractures has been recorded in elderly benzodiazepine users.

Life-threatening incidents are more likely to occur in those with pre-existing respiratory insufficiency or impaired cardiac function, particularly when a high dosage is administered (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Midazolam overdose can present a threat to life if the patient has pre-existing respiratory or cardiac insufficiency, or when combined with other CNS depressants (including alcohol).

Overdose of benzodiazepines is usually manifested by degrees of central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild cases, symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion and lethargy,  in  more  serious  cases,  symptoms  may  include  ataxia,  hypotonia,  hypotension,  respiratory depression, rarely coma and very rarely death.

## Management

In the management of overdose with any medicinal product, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.

Following overdose with oral midazolam, vomiting should be induced (within one hour) if the patient is conscious or gastric lavage undertaken with the airway protected if the patient is unconscious. If there is  no  advantage  in  emptying  the  stomach,  activated charcoal  should  be  given  to  reduce  absorption. Special attention should be paid to respiratory and cardiovascular functions in intensive care.

Flumazenil may be useful as an antidote.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, benzodiazepine derivatives ATC code: N05CD08.

## Mechanism of action

Midazolam is a derivative of the imidazobenzodiazepine group. The free base is a lipophilic substance with low solubility in water. The basic nitrogen in position 2 of the imidazobenzodiazepine ring system

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enables midazolam to form the hydrochloride salt with acids. These produce a stable solution suitable for oromucosal administration.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The pharmacological action of midazolam is characterized by short duration because of rapid metabolic transformation. Midazolam has an anticonvulsant effect. It also exerts a sedative and sleep-inducing effect of pronounced intensity, and an anxiolytic and a muscle-relaxant effect.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In four rectal diazepam controlled studies and one study versus intravenous diazepam, in a total of 688 children, cessation of visible signs of seizures within 10 minutes was observed in 65% to 78% of children receiving  oromucosal  midazolam.  Additionally,  in  two  of  the  studies,  cessation  of  visible  signs  of seizures within 10 minutes without recurrence within one hour after administration was observed in 56% to  70%  of  children.  The  frequency  and  severity  of  adverse  drug  reactions  reported  for  oromucosal midazolam during published clinical trials were similar to the adverse drug reactions reported in the comparative group using rectal diazepam.

The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  waived  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with BUCCOLAM in the subset of the paediatric population &lt; 3months old, on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for these paediatric patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Simulated pharmacokinetic parameters for the recommended posology in children aged 3 months to less than 18 years, based on a population pharmacokinetic study, as well as pharmacokinetic parameters for the recommended posology in adults, based on a bioavailability study in healthy adult subjects, are provided in tabulated format below.

| Dose   | Age             | Parameter                  |   Mean |   SD |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------|--------|------|
| 2.5 mg | 3m < 1 yr       | AUC 0-inf (ng.h/ml)        |    168 |   98 |
| 2.5 mg | 3m < 1 yr       | C max (ng/ml)              |    104 |   46 |
| 5 mg   | 1 yr < 5 yrs    | AUC 0-inf (ng.h/ml)        |    242 |  116 |
| 5 mg   | 1 yr < 5 yrs    | C max (ng/ml)              |    148 |   62 |
| 7.5 mg | 5 yrs <10 yrs   | AUC 0-inf (ng.h/ml)        |    254 |  136 |
| 7.5 mg | 5 yrs <10 yrs   | C max (ng/ml)              |    140 |   60 |
| 10 mg  | 10 yrs < 18 yrs | AUC 0-inf (ng.h/ml)        |    189 |   96 |
| 10 mg  | 10 yrs < 18 yrs | C max (ng/ml)              |     87 |   44 |
| 10 mg  | > 18 yrs        | AUC 0-inf (ng.h/ml) (n=22) |    259 |   62 |
| 10 mg  | > 18 yrs        | C max (ng/ml) (n=22)       |     71 |   29 |

Simulated pharmacokinetic parameters for the recommended posology in adults (not elderly, not obese), based on a pharmacokinetic study, suggested that the dose of 10 mg in all adults lead to similar exposure to that of all pediatrics age groups at their corresponding therapeutic doses.

## Absorption

After  oromucosal administration midazolam is absorbed rapidly. Maximum plasma concentration is reached  within  30  minutes.  The  absolute  bioavailability  of  oromucosal  midazolam  is  about  75%  in adults. The bioavailability of oromucosal midazolam has been estimated at 87% in children with severe malaria and convulsions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Midazolam is  highly  lipophilic  and  distributes  extensively.  The  steady  state  volume  of  distribution following oromucosal administration is estimated to be 5.3 l/kg.

Approximately 96-98% of midazolam is bound to plasma proteins. The major fraction of plasma protein binding is due to albumin. There is a slow and insignificant passage of midazolam into the cerebrospinal fluid. In humans, midazolam has been shown to cross the placenta slowly and to enter foetal circulation. Small quantities of midazolam are found in human milk.

## Biotransformation

Midazolam is almost entirely eliminated by biotransformation.  The fraction of the dose extracted by the liver has been estimated to be 30-60%.  Midazolam is hydroxylated by the cytochrome P4503A4 isozyme  and  the  major  urinary  and  plasma  metabolite  is  alpha-hydroxy-midazolam.    Following oromucosal administration the area under the curve ratio for alpha-hydroxy midazolam to midazolam is 0.46 in children and 0.28 in adults.

In a population pharmacokinetic study, the metabolite levels are shown to be higher in younger than older paediatric patients and thus likely to be of more importance in children than in adults.

## Elimination

Plasma clearance of midazolam in children following oromucosal administration is 30 ml/kg/min. The initial and terminal elimination half-lives are 27 and 204 minutes, respectively.  Midazolam is excreted mainly by the renal route (60-80% of the injected dose) and recovered as glucuroconjugated alphahydroxy-midazolam. Less than 1% of the dose is recovered in urine as unchanged medicinal product.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Elderly

Exposure to midazolam after oromucosal administration to adults between 60 and 70 years of age is similar to young adults. Exposure in older adults after oromucosal administration is unknown but may increase because after intravenous administration the elimination half-life may be prolonged up to four times.

## Obese

The mean half life of midazolam after oromucosal administration to adults with a BMI between 30 and 34 is similar to adults with a BMI between 25 and 30 (8.4 versus 5.5 hours). The half life in adults with BMI above 34 is unknown but may increase because after intravenous administration the mean half-life is  greater  in  obese  than  in  non-obese  patients  (5.9  versus  2.3  hours).  This  is  due  to  an  increase  of approximately 50% in the volume of distribution corrected for total body weight. The clearance is not significantly different in obese and non-obese patients.

## Hepatic impairment

The elimination half-life in cirrhotic patients may be longer and the clearance lower as compared to those in healthy volunteers (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

The elimination half-life in patients with chronic renal failure is similar to that in healthy volunteers.

The elimination half-life of midazolam is prolonged up to six times in the critically ill.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiac insufficiency

The elimination half-life is longer in patients with congestive heart failure compared with that in healthy subjects (see section 4.4).

## Exposure following a second dose in the same seizure episode

Simulated exposure data show that the overall AUC approximately doubles when a second dose is administered at 10, 30 and 60 minutes following the first dose. A second dose at 10 minutes results in a significant  increase  in  mean  Cmax  of  between  1.7  to  1.9  fold.  At  30  and  60  minutes,  significant elimination  of  midazolam  has  already  occurred  and  therefore  the  increase  in  mean  Cmax  is  less pronounced; 1.3 to 1.6 and 1.2 to 1.5 fold respectively. (see section 4.2).

## Race

Clinical studies have included patients from Japanese and non-Japanese groups, and no differences in the pharmacokinetic profile have been identified on exposure to Buccolam.

No dose adjustment is warranted.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In a rat fertility study, animals dosed up to ten times the clinical dose, no adverse effects on fertility were observed.

There are no other preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to that already included in other sections of the SmPC.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully, before you start giving this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as those of the patient for whom this medicine has been prescribed.
- If you see any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What BUCCOLAM is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you give BUCCOLAM
3. How to give BUCCOLAM
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store BUCCOLAM
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What BUCCOLAM is and what it is used for

BUCCOLAM contains a medicine called midazolam. Midazolam belongs to a group of medicines known as benzodiazepines.

BUCCOLAM is used to stop a sudden, prolonged, convulsive, seizure in infants from 3 months to adults.

In infants from 3 months to less than 6 months it should only be used in a hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available.

This medicine must only be used by parents/carers where the patient has been diagnosed to have epilepsy.

## 2. What you need to know before you give BUCCOLAM

## Do not give BUCCOLAM if the patient has:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- An allergy to midazolam, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- A disease of the nerves and muscles causing muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis)
- Severe difficulty breathing at rest (BUCCOLAM can make breathing difficulties worse)
- An illness causing frequent interruption of breathing during sleep (sleep apnoea syndrome)
- Severe liver problems.

## Warnings and precautions

## Children:

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving BUCCOLAM if the patient has:

- A kidney, liver or heart condition
- A lung condition that causes difficulty breathing on a regular basis.

## Adults:

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given BUCCOLAM if:

- You are over 60 years of age.
- You have a long-term illness (such as breathing problems or kidney, liver or heart problems).
- You are debilitated (have an illness that makes you feel very weak, run down and short of energy).

This medicine may cause people to forget what happened after they have been given it. Patients should be observed carefully after being given the medicine.

This medicine should be avoided in patients with a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse.

Life threatening incidents are more likely in patients with breathing difficulties or heart problems, especially when higher doses of BUCCOLAM are given.

Children younger than 3 months: BUCCOLAM should not be given to children younger than 3 months since there is not enough information in this age group.

Elderly: The elderly are more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines.

If you are not sure if any of the above applies to the patient, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before giving this medicine.

## Other medicines and BUCCOLAM

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the patient is taking, or has recently taken, or might take any other medicines. If you have any doubt about whether any medicine the patient is taking may affect the use of BUCCOLAM, please speak to your doctor or pharmacist.

This is extremely important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines involved.

The effects of BUCCOLAM may be intensified by medicines such as:

- antiepileptics, (for treating epilepsy) e.g. phenytoin
- antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin
- antifungals, e.g. ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, pozaconazole
- anti-ulcer medicines, e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole
- medicines used to treat blood pressure, e.g. diltiazem, verapamil
- some medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS, e.g. saquinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combination
- narcotic analgesics (very strong pain killers), e.g. fentanyl
- medicines used to reduce fat in the blood, e.g. atorvastatin
- medicines used to treat nausea, e.g. nabilone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- hypnotics (sleep inducing medicines)
- sedative antidepressants (medicines used to treat depression that make you sleepy)
- sedatives (medicines that relax you)
- anaesthetics (for pain relief)
- antihistamines (to treat allergies).

The effects of BUCCOLAM may be reduced by medicines such as:

- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis)
- xanthines (used to treat asthma)
- St John's Wort (a herbal medicine). This should be avoided in patients taking BUCCOLAM.

BUCCOLAM may increase the effect of some muscle relaxants e.g. baclofen (causing increased drowsiness). This medicine may also stop some other medicines from working as well, e.g. levodopa (used to treat Parkinson's disease).

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about medicines the patient should avoid whilst taking BUCCOLAM.

## BUCCOLAM with food and drink

The patient must not drink alcohol while taking BUCCOLAM. Alcohol may increase the sedative effects of this medicine and make them very sleepy.

The patient must not drink grapefruit juice while taking BUCCOLAM. Grapefruit juice may increase the sedative effects of this medicine and make them very sleepy.

## Pregnancy

If the patient who will be given this medicine is pregnant or breast-feeding, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask a doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

Giving high doses of BUCCOLAM during the last 3 months of pregnancy can cause abnormal heart beat in the unborn child. Babies born after this medicine is administered during childbirth can also have poor suckling, breathing difficulties and poor muscle tone at birth.

## Breast-feeding

Tell the doctor if the patient is breast-feeding. Even though small amounts of BUCCOLAM may pass into breast milk, it may not be necessary to stop breast-feeding. The doctor will advise if the patient should breast-feed after being given this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

BUCCOLAM may make the patient sleepy, forgetful or affect their concentration and co-ordination. This may affect their performance at skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines.

After receiving this medicine, the patient should not drive a vehicle, ride a bicycle or operate a machine until they have completely recovered. Please discuss with your doctor if you need further advice.

## BUCCOLAM contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per oral syringe, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to give BUCCOLAM

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always give this medicine exactly as a doctor has told you. Check with a doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Dosage

The doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose of BUCCOLAM the patient needs, generally according to the patient age. The different doses each have a different colour, which is shown on the carton, the tube and the syringe containing the medicine.

## Depending on age, the patient will have received one of the following doses, in specifically colour labelled packaging:

3 months to less than 1 year: 2.5 mg - yellow labelled packaging

1 year to less than 5 years: 5 mg - blue labelled packaging

5 years to less than 10 years: 7.5 mg - purple labelled packaging

10 years to adults: 10 mg - orange labelled packaging

## The dose is the full contents of one oral syringe. Do not give more than one dose.

Toddlers aged from 3 months to less than 6 months should only be treated in a hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available.

## Preparing to give this medicine

If the patient is having a seizure, allow their body to move freely, do not try to restrain them. Only move them if they are in danger from, for example, deep water, fire or sharp objects.

Support the patient´s head with something soft, such as a cushion or your lap.

Check that the medicine is the correct dose for the patient, according to their age.

## How to give this medicine

Ask a doctor, pharmacist or nurse to show you how to take or administer this medicine. Always check with them if you are not sure.
