## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR signalling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion/metastasis. Cetuximab binds to the EGFR with an affinity higher than that of endogenous ligands. Cetuximab blocks binding of endogenous EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition of the function of the receptor and induces the internalisation of EGFR, which can lead to down-regulation of the receptor. Cetuximab also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR-expressing tumour cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).

Erbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):

- in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy;
- in first-line in combination with FOLFOX;
- as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are intolerant to irinotecan.

Erbitux is also indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN):

- in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease;
- in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease.

In all indications, Erbitux is administered once a week as intravenous infusion at a maximum rate of 10 mg/min. The initial dose is 400 mg/m2, and all subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg/m2.

With this variation application, the MAH proposed to further restrict the indication of Erbitux in colorectal cancer to the treatment of patients with RAS (i.e. both KRAS and NRAS) wild-type tumours. This was in follow-up to CHMP request after a similar recent restriction of the Vectibix colorectal cancer indication. Data strictly related to cetuximab in this application come from one study (OPUS) but further relevant data from studies CRYSTAL and FIRE III are expected (see further below).

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The RAS gene family has three broadly expressed members: Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog ( NRAS ), and the v-HaRAS Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene ( HRAS ). RAS ( KRAS, NRAS, HRAS ) proteins are central nodal points in these signalling pathways regulating the transmission of activation signals from the EGFR to down-stream effectors. The three different isoforms share sequence identity at all regions regulating activation state and effector functions, and high sequence similarity in most of the remaining gene. The region of variability between the isoforms, containing only 23 to 24 amino acids, is involved in membrane binding.

Mutated, activated RAS proteins can bypass inhibition of EGFR by direct activation of the downstream pathways, MAPK and AKT pathways, independent of EGFR. KRAS exon 2 mutations at codons 12 and 13 are the most frequently occurring RAS mutations in CRC (approximately 40% of subjects) and were demonstrated to be associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in subjects with mCRC. Somatic mutations beyond KRAS exon 2, including KRAS exon 3 and 4 and NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 mutations, have been documented in CRC and collectively occur in approximately 7% to 22% of wild-type KRAS exon 2 CRC cases.

In this submission, results of the RAS mutational analysis and correlation with efficacy and safety were reported for the phase II OPUS trial, investigating cetuximab plus oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) versus FOLFOX4 alone.

## GCP

The Clinical trial (OPUS) was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial (OPUS) conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3. Clinical efficacy aspects

## 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The BEAMing (Beads, Emulsions, Amplification, and Magnetics) assay was chosen for the detection of KRAS and NRAS mutations in tumour samples from patients in the OPUS study due to the limited amount of starting material (genomic DNA isolated from one tissue slide). The BEAMing Technology combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with flow cytometry to create a mutation detection platform with greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional PCR. The technology allows for detection and quantification of low prevalence mutations and permits detection of mutations in heterogeneous or poor quality samples with rare mutated clones.

The panel of KRAS and NRAS mutations analysed is presented in the following Table 1.

## 2.3.3. Discussion

With regard to the numbers of tumour samples available for RAS analysis and the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of patients in the different subgroups (by RAS status), some of the subgroups were small, e.g. the interesting new RAS mutant; nevertheless, there were no major imbalances in prognostic factors.

For tumour responses and except for the small group 'new RAS mutant', results were directionally as expected and the odds ratio seemed more favourable in the RAS wild type compared with KRAS wild type. In principle the same patterns were seen also for PFS, but PFS seemed neutral in the 'new RAS mutant' subgroup. Finally, OS results were compatible with PFS results taking into account the small sample sizes and diluting effects of post-progression survival.

Of note, all comparisons were made without protection by stratification/randomisation, i.e. baseline imbalances within subgroups were to be expected, although no major imbalances of this type were observed.

Currently available data on cetuximab formally only refer to the randomised phase II study OPUS, but the rationale based on tumour biology is strong and the conclusions are supported by data related to panitumumab.

More data by RAS status specifically related to cetuximab are expected from the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies, but the totality of data provides the evidence needed to restrict the indication as proposed by the MAH.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

As RAS mutation status refers to the tumour only, there were no good reasons to postulate differences in safety profiles related to RAS status other than from the perspective that patients with RAS wild type tumours would be treated for longer periods of time. Taking small sample sizes into account, the assumption that safety is independent of tumour RAS status was considered to be in-line with reported data.

## 2.4.1. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The latest data lock point was 30 September 2013 (the PSUR being expected by 9 December 2013).

The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.5. Risk management plan

No revised RMP was submitted in this variation. An updated RMP will be submitted when data from the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies are submitted (see discussion on clinical efficacy).

## 2.6. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this restricted indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.

Additionally, the pre-existing posology recommendation, contraindication and warning in case of KRAS mutations have been amended in accordance in sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template (version 9.0), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 2.7. Direct Healthcare Professional Communication

The CHMP considered that a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) was needed to communicate on the restriction of the colorectal cancer indication to patients with wild-type RAS tumour status, as inferior OS has been shown in patients with RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 who received Erbitux in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy versus FOLFOX alone.

The final version of this DHPC agreed by the CHMP is provided in Attachment 3 together with the communication plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH should agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities. The DHPC should be sent upon receipt of the Commission Decision with the revised SmPC with the changes highlighted to oncologists who are expected to prescribe Erbitux, chief pharmacists, and pathologists responsible for testing tumour samples from metastatic colorectal cancer patients for RAS status.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Restricting the use of cetuximab to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer carrying RAS wild type tumours improves the benefit without negatively affecting the risk.

Although cetuximab data by RAS status are only derived from the randomised phase II study OPUS, the biological rationale supporting the efficacy in patients with RAS wild type tumours only is strong and the conclusions are supported by data related to panitumumab. More data by RAS status specifically related to cetuximab are expected from the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies, but the totality of current data already provides the evidence needed to restrict the Erbitux colorectal cancer indication to the treatment of patients with RAS (i.e. KRAS and NRAS ) wild type tumours.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

- To submit the results of the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies by RAS status

## 4. Recommendations

Restriction of the indication for the treatment of colorectal cancer to patients with wild-type RAS tumours in follow-up to CHMP request

As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. In addition, relevant safety information on the use of Erbitux in patients with mutant RAS tumours is updated in accordance in sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC. Conditions are added in Annex II for submission of results of the CRYSTAL and FIRE III studies by RAS status and of an RMP update in consequence to the amended indication. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet.
