During this review swellings in the facial area have been determined as expressions of an angioedema and as a consequence 'angioedema' should be included in the SmPC as ADR of the combination naltrexone / bupropion and not only of the mono-component bupropion. There are a total of 10 cases of symptoms resembling angioedema with a reasonable assumption of a causal relationship to treatment. Therefore, the product information should be changed in a way, that angioedema is associated with the combination and not only with the mono-products.
