|           | randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lanadelumab for prevention against acute attacks of NONHISTAMINERGIC ANGIOEDEMA with Normal C1 Inhibitor (C1-INH); and CASPIAN OLE (TAK-743-3001) is an open-label study to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of lanadelumab for prevention against acute attacks of Nonhistaminergic Angioedema with Normal C1-Inhibitor (C1-INH). The RMP version 4.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes to the SmPC and the Package Leaflet.

Section 4.4 There is limited clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1 INH (see section 5.1). Patients with HAE nC1 INH having mutations that are not associated with the kallikrein kinin system (KKS) pathway are not expected to respond to TAKHZYRO. It is recommended to perform genetic testing, if available, according to the current HAE guidelines and to discontinue the treatment if clinical response is not observed (see section 4.2 and 5.1). For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.   |

| II/0022 | Update the SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 to reflect the result of study DX-2930-04 (HELP Study Extension: an open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of DX-2930 for prevention against acute attacks of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)). In addition, the MAH is taking the opportunity to include a refrigeration statement for the multi-pack pre-filled syringe in the SmPC and pre-filled syringe PIL in section 6.4. The Risk Management Plan is also updated to version 2.2 following the completion of study DX-2930-04 and according to GVP Module V Rev 2 Integrated RMP template. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 16/12/2021 | 29/09/2022 | SmPC and PL | The main scope of this variation is to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to reflect the results of Long-term safety and efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of TAKHZYRO for prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks obtained in an open-label uncontrolled HELP study extension. Safety data available from the HELP study extension are consistent with the safety data from the HELP study. A total of 212 adult and adolescent (≥ 12 years) subjects with symptomatic type I or II HAE received at least one dose of lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks in this study, including 109 subjects who entered as rollover subjects from the HELP study. Rollover subjects, regardless of randomisation group in the HELP Study, received a single dose of lanadelumab 300 mg at study entry and did not receive additional treatment until the occurrence of an HAE attack. After the first HAE attack, all subjects received open-label treatment with lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks. The study also included 103 new or non-rollover subjects (including 19 subjects from Phase1b study) who had a historical baseline attack rate of ≥1 attack per 12 w eeks. The non-rollover subjects received lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks at study entry. Subjects were allowed to initiate self administration after receiving the first 2 doses from a health care professional in clinic and completing appropriate training. The majority of subjects (173/212; 81.6%) who were treated in this study completed at least 30 months of |

The mean (SD) time in the HELP study extension was 29.6 (8.20) months. The majority of subjects self-administered lanadelumab (60.6% of 8,018 injections). There was a sustained reduction in attack rates compared to baseline during the HELP study extension, with a similar response to TAKHZYRO observed in both rollover (92.4%) and non-rollover groups (82.0%) and an overall reduction rate of 87.4%. Though the magnitude of the attack rate reduction in the HELP study limited the potential for further reductions in the HELP extension study, mean attack rates for the rollover subjects decreased further at the time of the final analysis and ranged from 0.08 to 0.26 attacks per month. In addition, the mean (SD) percentage of attack-free days was 97.7 (6.0)% and the mean (SD) duration of the attack-free period was 415.0 (346.1) days. The proportion of patients with a maximum attack-free period of 6 months or more or 12 months or more was 81.8% and 68.9%, respectively. Furthermore, section 6.4 is updated to inform patients of precautions to storage. Patients are adviced that when one pre-filled syringe from a multi-pack is removed from refrigeration, the remaining pre-filled syringes should return to the refrigerator until future use when needed.   |
