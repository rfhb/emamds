| Currently approved Indication(s)                 | Rheumatoid arthritis Enbrel in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. (Enbrel 25mg - Enbrel 50mg) Enbrel can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. (Enbrel 25mg - Enbrel 50mg) Enbrel is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. (Enbrel 25mg - Enbrel 50mg) Enbrel, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. (Enbrel 25mg - Enbrel 50mg) Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis Treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. Enbrel has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. Psoriatic arthritis Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Enbrel has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. (Enbrel 25mg - Enbrel 50mg) Ankylosing spondylitis Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. (Enbrel 25mg - Enbrel 50mg) Plaque psoriasis Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a |

Paediatric plaque psoriasis Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.   |

| Clinical | FUM134:TheMAHshouldsubmit theresultsofthe multicentre, open-label long term safety trial (study 20050111) | 6monthsafter thecompletion of the study |

The data were reviewed and no update of the Product Information is required (See PVAR circulated 21.8.2012 - see section IV).

The conclusions from the PVAR were that:

The MAH has provided the requested CSR in fulfilment of P46 FUM 134.

No change to the positive benefit:risk balance for Enbrel in paediatric plaque psoriasis nor any changes to the SmPC result from the submitted data.

The MAH is requested to provide responses to the points below.

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide response to the following points

1. It is not clear why one case of  Crohn's disease AE was considered relate to Enbrel  but the other case of Crohn's disease was not considered related and the MAH is asked to comment.
2. For the 28 subjects who are continuing treatment until they reach age 18, the MAH is requested to provide the expected date for this data and commit to providing this additional information

This report addresses the responses to the two additional clarifications requested.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Assessment of responses

## Request 1.

It is not clear why one case of Crohn's disease AE was considered relate to Enbrel but the other case of Crohn's disease was not considered related and the MAH is asked to comment.

## Response from MAH:

Relatedness of adverse events to investigational product was a determination made at the discretion of the investigator, and no information was collected on the case report form with regard to how the investigator determined relatedness. The relationship of adverse events to the investigational product was assessed by means of the question: 'Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' The following descriptions were provided in the protocol to the principle investigator to help guide the decision of whether to choose 'yes' or 'no' as a response to this question:

No = There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by investigational product.

The adverse event:

- may be judged to be due to extraneous causes such as disease or environment or toxic factors
- may be judged to be due to the subject's clinical state or other therapy being administered
- is not biologically plausible
- does not reappear or worsen when investigational product is readministered
- does not follow a temporal sequence from administration of investigational Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Yes = There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by investigational product. The adverse event:

- follows a temporal sequence from administration of investigational product
- is a known response to the investigational product based on clinical or preclinical data
- could not be explained by the known characteristics of the subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy administered to the subject
- disappears or decreases upon cessation or reduction of dose of investigational product
- reappears or worsens when investigational product is readministered

The only obvious difference in the 2 cases is that the event that was related was classified as severe whereas the event that was not related was classified as moderate in severity. Neither event was serious and both occurred in patients with a history of psoriatic arthropathy. In summary, the Sponsor/MAH does not have any specific additional information that accounts for the investigator's assignment of relatedness for the 2 cases.

## Assessment of response and conclusion

The MAH has no further information on why one case of Crohn's disease AE was considered relate to Enbrel but the other case of Crohn's disease was not considered related. Although this would have been of interest, there is no further information available and the issue will not be pursued. Issue resolved

## Request 2.

For the 28 subjects who are continuing treatment until they reach age 18, the MAH is requested to provide the expected date for this data and commit to providing this additional information.

## Response from MAH:

Of the current subjects still enrolled in study 20050111, the last subject turns 18 years old in November 2017. Assuming the last subject remains in the study until this time, the MAH commits to providing the supplemental report, containing the serious adverse event and physician global assessment data for the 28 subjects, in May 2018. The completion date could be sooner if the last subject withdraws from the study before he/she reaches 18 years of age. If so, the MAH commits to providing the supplemental report 6 months after the completion date.

## Assessment of response and conclusion

The MAH will provide the data in May 2018 or sooner.  Issue resolved

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Recommendation

The MAH has provided the requested CSR in fulfilment of P46 FUM 134.

No change to the positive benefit:risk balance for Enbrel in paediatric plaque psoriasis nor any changes to the SmPC result from the submitted data.

- Fulfilled No further action required
