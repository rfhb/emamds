## 1. Background information on the procedure

This is the assessment of the following PSUR submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list):

| Centrally authorised Medicinal products For presentations see Annex A   | Marketing Authorisation Holder   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Rienso                                                                  | Takeda Pharma A/S                |

In the post-marketing experience covered by this reporting period the most reported SOCs were 22 respiratory  disorders  (respiratory  arrest  (1),  dyspnoea  (6),  respiratory  distress  (2),  respiratory failure(1)  stridor  (1),  aspiration  (1),  embolism  (2),  oedema  (1),  throat  tightness  (1),  wheezing  (1), choking/cough  (3),  orophyrangeal  discomfort  (1)),  17  Immune  system  disorders  (anaphylactic reactions (13), anaphylactoid reactions (3), hypersensitivity (1)), 13 Cardiac disorders (cardiac arrest (3),  cardio-respiratory  arrest  (4),  atrial  fibrillation  (1),  myocardial  infarction  (1)),    Nervous  system disorders (unresponsive to stimuli (5), syncope (3), cerebral infarction (1), convulsion (1), dizziness (1)  paraesthesia  (1),  tremor  (1)),  12  Vascular  disorders  (hypotension  (7),  flushing  (3),  DVT  (1), hypertension  (1),  10  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (vomiting/diarrhoea  (5),  GIT  Pain  (1),  haemorrhage (1),  swelling  (1),  swollen  tongue  (1)),  10  General  disorders  (chest  discomfort/pain  (5),  chills  (1), burning  sensation  (1)  malaise  (1)  death  (1)).  Hypersensitivity  comprises  many  symptoms,  so  that some SAEs reported in SOCs other than immune system disorder could have been based on allergic reactions (e.g. swollen tongue, flushing or hypotension).

Rienso 2. Final assessment conclusions and actions Rienso (Ferumoxytol) is an intravenous (IV) iron preparation, a superparamagnetic iron oxide particle consisting of an iron oxide core and a polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethylether (PSC) coating designed to minimize immunological reactivity. Ferumoxytol was authorised in the US on 30 June 2009 (under the name Feraheme) and in the EU on 30 June 2012 for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Rienso is currently marketed in 9 EU countries. This is the 3 rd  PSUR for Rienso covering the period from 01 July 2013 to 31 December 2013. Exposure to ferumoxytol during the reporting period is 33963 patient-years [133,187 sold vials= 67925 g iron), whereas total exposure worldwide since IBD is 232883 patient-years [913,266 sold vials= 465766 g iron).  During  this  period  an  Article  31  referral  concerning  all  IV  iron-containing  medicinal  products authorised in the EU with the exception of Rienso (as Rienso was not authorised at the time of the start of the referral procedure) regarding the risk of hypersensitivity was completed on 13 September 2013. The referral concluded with the provision of introducing additional risk minimisation measures (update of product information and RMP, DHPC, educational material, cumulative annual reporting) and the imposition of a PASS). The MAH updated the product information of ferumoxytol in line with the outcome of the procedure on 17 January 2014. The  most  cumulatively  reported  SOCs  as  SAEs  in  the  clinical  trials  after  ferumoxytol  usage  were cardiac  disorders  (mostly  atrial  fibrillation,  congestive  heart  failure),  infections  and  infestations (different PTs), gastrointestinal disorders (GIT pain, bleeding), general disorders (chest pain), vascular disorder (hypotension) and renal disorders (acute/chronic renal failure).

## Hypersensitivity reactions and Benefit - Risk re-assessment

The MAH presented with this PSUR an updated evaluation of hypersensitivity following a request from the  PRAC  in  the  previous  PSUR.  Based  on  the  PRAC's  request,  the  MAH  conducted  and  presented standardized  searches  from  its  global  safety  database  (for  serious  and  non-serious  post-marketing reports, and serious clinical trial reports) and also from its global clinical trial database (for non-serious reports) for Anaphylactic Reaction, Hypersensitivity, Hypotension, Angioedema and Asthma/Bronchospasm.

Since the IBD (30 June 2009), there have been 491 cases of hypersensitivity (serious + non-serious, cumulative adjudicated results) reported; out of which 240 were classified as serious. There were 42 reports of fatal cases after the use of ferumoxytol (excluding cases from Investigator Initiated Trials); in 22 of the 42 cases (19 in the US, 2 in Canada and 1 Switzerland) hypersensitivity was identified as the underlying cause. Since the IBD of ferumoxytol a total of 913,266 vials of ferumoxytol have been distributed/sold.  The  calculation  of  patient  exposure  in  this  PSUR  is  based  on  the  amount  of  vials distributed/sold (single use vial containing 510 mg iron as ferumoxytol= single exposure). Considering 2000  mg  iron  per  patient  and  per  year,  the  total  patient  exposure  is  estimated  as  being  232883 patient-years [913,266 sold vials). There have been 491 cases of hypersensitivity reported (serious + non-serious, cumulative adjudicated results) and 115 reports of serious hypersensitivity cases Grade III/IV. This corresponds to 210.83 overall hypersensitivity cases per 100 000 patient-years respective 49.38 serious (III/IV) hypersensitivity cases per 100 000 patient-years. Based on the high rate of hypersensitivity reactions with fatal outcome reported in the PSUR, the MAH was requested by the PRAC within this PSUR procedure to perform a re-evaluation of the benefit risk of ferumoxytol taking into account the global age-standardized death rate for IDA (Lozano R et al. Lancet 2012;380(9859):2095-128)  or  IDA-CKD.  The  MAH  was  also  requested  as  part  of  the  request  for supplementary information to provide additional information on the fatal hypersensitivity cases from post-marketing,  to  clarify  a  possible  correlation  between  the  speed  of  administration  and  the occurrence  and  severity  of hypersensitivity reactions,  to  discuss  possible  mechanisms  of  the anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and to propose additional risk minimization measures to mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. The MAH was also requested in an oral explanation to discuss the benefit/risk balance of ferumoxytol in the approved indication taking into account the high reporting rate of fatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions and to discuss possible risk minimization measures. With  their  responses  to  the  request  for  supplementary  information,  the  MAH  provided  case  details which  reveal  that  further  to  the  22  fatal  hypersensitivity  cases  an  additional  7  fatal  reported  cases were related to hypersensitivity, which brings the total number of fatalities to 29 (the majority being reported in the US).

A total of 13 of the (initially confirmed) 22 patients (59%) with a fatal outcome had medical history of drug hypersensitivity and in 7 of these 13 patients (32% of all patients) there was a history of multiple drug allergies. For the remaining 9 patients, 3 were noted to have no known allergies, 1 was noted to have allergies to unspecified fruits, and allergy information was unknown in 5 patients. For 94 of the 218 patients (43%) with serious, nonfatal reports, drug hypersensitivity was reported in their medical history. In 49 of these 94 patients (22% of all patients), there was a history of allergy for multiple drugs. In 16 of the 218 patients, there was a history of previous allergy to IV iron products. For the remaining 124 patients (of a total of 218), 59 were noted to have no known allergies, 2 had non drug allergies, and allergy information was unknown in 63 patients. Therefore the MAH proposed to add a contraindication  for  patients  with  a  history  of  drug  allergy  as  a  way  to  mitigate  the  risk  of hypersensitivity reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  change  in  the  method  of  administration  (slower  infusion  over  15  minutes  versus  the  currently recommended bolus injection in 17 seconds) was proposed by the MAH as a risk minimisation measure for  the  risk  of  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Infusion  is  a  mode  of  administration  that  allows  close observation of the patient during and after administration. A longer duration of administration allows for recognition of prodromal signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity including severe hypotension that would  not  be  possible  with  an  IV  bolus  injection.  This  mode  of  administration  also  allows  for  the cessation of drug delivery, if needed, and appropriate intervention by the treating physician. The MAH's proposal to administer Rienso via infusion over 15 minutes is comparable to the administration time of other  IV  iron  containing  medicinal  products.  One  published  study  detailing  infusion  of  1g  of ferumoxytol over 15 minutes in 60 patients with no SAEs of hypersensitivity is supportive of infusion as a mode of administration (Auerbach 2013). In addition the MAH provided exploratory PK simulations which  evaluated  the  effect  of  decreasing  the  rate  of  infusion  on  Cmax  and  AUC.  Simulations  were performed using previously published ferumoxytol plasma PK parameters for a two-compartment open model  with  zero-order  input  and  Michaelis-Mentel  elimination  (Pai  et  al.  2010).  These  simulations indicate that the newly proposed 15 minutes infusion duration would result in a minimal decrease in Cmax and AUC compared to a 1 minute infusion when the whole 510 mg is infused. In conclusion, these PK simulations support that the efficacy of ferumoxytol would most likely remain unchanged if the entire dose is administered as a bolus or over 15 minutes. A 15 minutes infusion would also allow the possibility to interrupt the dose if hypersensitivity occurred. The  MAH  also  proposed  a  strengthened  clinical  monitoring  of  patients  (blood  pressure  and  pulse monitoring during and after the administration) which is anticipated to contribute to mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Other possible risk minimisation measures were discussed by the MAH as part of their responses to the request for supplementary information and at the second Oral Explanation at the PRAC. These consist of more stringent monitoring in the clinical setting, proposal for additional studies, strengthening of the risk  minimisation  measures,  implementation  of  educational  material,  and  cumulative  three  monthly reporting. The  MAH  provided  an  update  on  the  status  of  the 'Feasibility  Assessment  of  European  Population Databases to Estimate the Risk of Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions among Users of Intravenous Iron Compounds' (the  PASS  requested  as  part  of  the  outcome  of  the  article  31  referral  procedure  on intravenous iron containing products).The MAH also proposed to submit 3 monthly cumulative reviews on hypersensitivity reactions. The  MAH  was  also  requested  to  investigate  further  measures,  such  as  a  study  on  the  possible mechanism [IgE or non-IgE mediated] to elucidate the nature of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Ongoing  studies  in  the  extended  indication  of  all  cause  IDA  discussed  within  the  US  which  include hypersensitivity as a primary endpoint could add to the current information and the MAH proposed to submit these data when available. The  MAH  also  proposed  new  educational  materials  for  patients,  physicians  and  other  healthcare professionals and to circulate a DHPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  PRAC  agreed  to  contraindicate  ferumoxyol  in  patients  with  any  known  history  of  drug  allergy considering that in numerous reported cases patients had a history of allergic reactions. The PRAC also recommended updating the product information by removing the intravenous injection at a rate of 1 ml/sec  (30  mg/sec)  and  introducing  a  15  minutes  infusion  as  the  only  recommended  method  of administration in order to mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions as proposed by the MAH and based on the data provided by the MAH as described above. In addition the PRAC agreed, as proposed by  the  MAH,  to  include  a  warning  in  the  product  information  that  patients  should  be  carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions including monitoring of blood pressure and  pulse  during  and  30  minutes  at  least  after  administration  to  further  mitigate  the  risk  of hypersensitivity  reactions.  In  addition,  patients  should  be  in  a  reclining  or  semi/reclining  position during  and  after  administration.  Finally  a  statement  that  fatal  and  life-threatening  hypersensitivity reactions  have  been  observed  post-marketing  with  ferumoxytol  was  also  included  in  the  product information.

Finally, the risk management plan (RMP) should be revised accordingly with the next PSUR and should also  include  a  proposal  of  key  elements  for  educational  material  for  healthcare  professionals  and patients highlighting the risks and warnings on hypersensitivity reactions.

The  PRAC  recommended  that  the  prescribers  are  informed  of  the  above  changes  to  the  product information  implemented  as  part  of  this  PSUR  procedure  via  a  Dear  Healthcare  Professional Communication (DHPC). In  line  with  the  outcome  of  the  Article  31  referral  on  IV  iron  containing  medicinal  products  which concluded in June 2013 (CD issued in September 2013), the PRAC agreed to include as a condition to the Marketing Authorisation for Rienso that the MAH should conduct a Post Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) to further characterise the safety concerns on the hypersensitivity reactions. Furthermore  the  PRAC  recommended  that  the  MAH  further  investigates  the  risk  of  hypersensitivity reactions with ferumoxytol by conducting additional studies. The MAH should provide within the next PSUR  a  proposal  of  study  (draft  protocol)  to  investigate  the  mechanism  of  hypersensitivity  with ferumoxytol  and  a  synopsis  for  an  adequately  powered  study  to  further  investigate  the  risk  of hypersensitivity in EU CKD patients comparing ferumoxytol with iron sucrose. In  addition,  the  MAH  should  submit  with  each  PSUR  cumulative  reviews  of  hypersensitivity  case reports, all fatal cases and all pregnancy cases, together with usage data. The review should follow the below principles: o exposure  definition  (expressed  in  100,000  patients  treated  -  daily  dose  of  100  mg equivalents) o event  definition  (Hypersensitivity  SMQ  (narrow  scope),  Asthma/bronchospasm  SMQ (narrow scope), Anaphylactic reaction SMQ (algorithm), Hypotension Takeda MedDRA Query (TMQ), Angioedema SMQ (narrow scope)) o and use the severity classification according to Ring and Messmer classification. The MAH should also provide within the next PSUR a proposal of study (draft protocol) to measure the effectiveness of the new risk minimisation measures agreed by the PRAC as part of the present PSUR. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  baseline  efficacy  and  benefit  of  ferumoxytol  in  the  authorised  indication  (CKD-IDA)  has  not changed during this reporting period. However, the high rate of fatal outcomes due to hypersensitivity/allergic  reactions  after  ferumoxytol  usage  is  a  point  of  concern  that  warrants  the additional measures requested by the PRAC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the PRAC review of data on safety and efficacy, the changes to the product information and to  the  conditions  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation,  the  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  and undertaking to be provided by the MAH within the next PSUR as outlined above, the PRAC considers that the risk-benefit balance of ferumoxytol remains positive.

## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

Since the IBD (30 June 2009), there have been 491 cases of hypersensitivity (serious + non-serious, cumulative adjudicated results) reported; out of which 240 were classified as serious. There were 42 reports of fatal cases with ferumoxytol (excluding cases from Investigator Initiated Trials); in 22 of the 42  cases  (19  in  the  US,  2  in  Canada  and  1  Switzerland)  hypersensitivity  was  identified  as  the underlying  cause.  Since  the  IBD  of  ferumoxytol  a  total  of  913,266  vials  of  ferumoxytol  have  been distributed/sold.  The  calculation  of  patient  exposure  in  this  PSUR  is  based  on  the  amount  of  vials distributed/sold (single use vial containing 510 mg iron as ferumoxytol= single exposure). Considering 2000  mg  iron  per  patient  and  per  year,  the  total  patient  exposure  is  estimated  as  being  232883 patient-years [913,266 sold vials). There have been 491 cases of hypersensitivity reported (serious + non-serious, cumulative adjudicated results) and 115 reports of serious hypersensitivity cases Grade III/IV. This corresponds to 210.83 overall hypersensitivity cases per 100 000 patient-years respective 49.38 serious (III/IV) hypersensitivity cases per 100 000 patient-years. Further to the 22 fatal hypersensitivity cases, it was clarified by the MAH within this PSUR procedure that  an  additional  7  fatal  reported  cases  were  related  to  hypersensitivity,  which  brings  the  total number of fatalities to 29 (the majority being reported in the US). A total of 13 of the (initially confirmed) 22 patients (59%) with a fatal outcome had medical history of drug hypersensitivity and in 7 of these 13 patients (32% of all patients) there was a history of multiple drug allergies. For the remaining 9 patients, 3 were noted to have no known allergies, 1 was noted to have allergies to unspecified fruits, and allergy information was unknown in 5 patients. For 94 of the 218 patients (43%) with serious, nonfatal reports, drug hypersensitivity was reported in their medical history. In 49 of these 94 patients (22% of all patients), there was a history of allergy for multiple drugs. In 16 of the 218 patients, there was a history of previous allergy to IV iron products. For the remaining 124 patients (of a total of 218), 59 were noted to have no known allergies, 2 had non drug allergies, and allergy information was unknown in 63 patients. Therefore,  in  view  of  available  data  regarding  hypersensitivity  reactions,  the  PRAC  considered  that changes  to  the  product  information  and  to  the  conditions  of  the  marketing  authorisation  were warranted. 3. Final Recommendations Based on the PRAC review of data on safety and efficacy, the PRAC considers by majority decision that the  risk-benefit  balance  of  medicinal  products  containing  the  active  substance  ferumoxytol  remains favourable subject to the additional risk minimisation measures and conditions imposed, as well as the undertakings to be provided within the next PSUR and Risk Management Plan as detailed below; in addition recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied as follows: Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Divergent Position

The undersigned members of PRAC did not agree with the PRAC's opinion recommending that the Marketing Authorisation should be varied for Rienso.

The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows:

Whilst it is acknowledged that hypersensitivity reactions occur also with other intravenous iron containing products, the absolute number as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of Rienso (ferumoxytol) are of major concern. Cumulatively, since the granting of the marketing authorisation of ferumoxytol a total of 482 post-marketing hypersensitivity cases have been reported and nearly 50% of these cases were serious (including lifethreatening) allergic reactions (240 serious, 242 non-serious). There were in total 42 fatal cases and 29 of them were associated with hypersensitivity. Although there are well-known limitations of spontaneous reporting, these figures give raise to a serious safety concern impacting on the benefit risk balance of the product. Furthermore, the reason for the high number of cases with ferumoxytol currently remains unclear and the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The already existing routine risk minimisation measures included in SmPC and PL of Rienso did not seem to be sufficient. Therefore, to address the above mentioned concerns, further risk minimisation measures were proposed by the MAH and include a labelling update (inclusion of a new contraindication, reduction of the speed of administration), educational material as well as circulation of a further DHPC. However, there is uncertainty as to whether the risk minimisation strategy proposed would actually be able to mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and no reassurance could be given by the MAH in this regard. Any risk mitigation strategy needs to be sufficiently robust and evidence driven to prevent unnecessary harm, in particular in the context of a treatment for which there are therapeutic alternatives available to patients. Taking all these aspects into account, the benefit risk balance of Rienso is considered negative. A suspension of the marketing authorisation is recommended considering the nature of the safety concern and the level of uncertainty to protect patient safety in an area where therapeutic alternatives are available. Suspension should remain until the marketing authorisation holder can provide convincing data to identify a group of patients in whom the benefits of the medicine outweigh its risks and adequate risk minimisation measures are proposed and implemented.
