## Introduction

On 17th October 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Mircera, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

MIRCERA was first approved in the European Economic Area in 2007 for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD including adult patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis. Since then, the drug has been approved in 112 countries worldwide, and anextensive body of post-marketing experience in adults is available.

In January 2009 the PDCO and the marketing authorization holder (MAH) agreed to a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) which consisted of the following two studies:

Phase II study NH19707 with primary objectives:

- To determine the starting dose of MIRCERA in pediatric patients with CKD on hemodialysis when switching from stable maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa,
- To demonstrate changes in hemoglobin (Hb) over time in response to different intravenous (iv) doses of MIRCERA.

Phase III study NH19708 with primary objective:

- To confirm the optimal dose of MIRCERA selected in the previous exploratory dose-finding study, in a larger group of pediatric patients with CKD on dialysis and not yet on dialysis.

In July 2012, the MAH submitted a PIP modification to increase the number of patients in the phase II study in the group having a stable Hb response and to extend the completion timelines for both studies. Patient numbers were increased due to concerns that the variability in Hb was considerably higher than assumed in the original protocol sample size calculations.  The decision was also made to replace all patients who withdrew early from the study (mainly due to the high transplantation rate in paediatric patients), leading to even higher requirements in patient numbers. Timelines were extended due to the difficulty of recruiting paediatric patients with CKD on hemodialysis despite international recruitment. As such, it took 7 years with 28 sites to complete the phase II study of 64 patients; safety extension phase was also shortened because the last two patients were transplanted. Thus, the fulfilment of this PIP, as it was originally agreed in January 2009 has been difficult. In support of the current PIP modification, a systematic literature review to identify data for estimating the size of patient population eligible for participation in the planned phase III trial has been prepared. Data has been sought from different countries and age groups on the administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The calculations show that the number of CKD paediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis is limited, (approximately 1400 patients aged 5-19 years are estimated to be on peritoneal dialysis at a given time in Europe and the US).

The new proposed Phase II study NH19708 would be conducted in order to confirm the extrapolation of results for the subcutaneous administration of MIRCERA in pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis.

The above suggested study would shorten study time lines and supports the submission of a solid data set to CHMP, to support a paediatric indication for MIRCERA in the near future.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The two phase II studies, along with PK/PD modelling and simulation will be used to support a paediatric indication.

Given that study NH19707 has already generated data in paediatric patients on haemodialysis, such patients will not be included in the proposed phase II study, which will therefore enrol patients on peritoneal dialysis and patients not yet on dialysis.

## MIRCERA is available in pre-filled syringes

CHMP comments:

A specific paediatric presentation has not been developed. Pending on the finally approved dose, the riskfor dosing errors with the pre-filled syringes in children should be discussed.

## STUDY NH19707

Title: An Open-Label, Multi-Centre, Multiple Dose Study to Determine the Optimum Starting Dose of Intravenous MIRCERA for Maintenance Treatment of Anaemia in Paediatric Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Haemodialysis.

## Description

This phase II, dose-finding study was an open-label, multicentre, multiple dose study of MIRCERA administered once every 4 weeks iv for 20 weeks in paediatric CKD patients aged 5-17 years old receiving haemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetinalfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). In the core study period, after the first administration of MIRCERA, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once per week.

To find the optimum MIRCERA starting dose, the study tested two groups with different conversion factors related to their previous ESA dose.

The first 16 patients (intermediate-conversion-factor group, described as Group 1 in the protocol and clinical study report [CSR]) were enrolled and treated with MIRCERA at a starting dose based on their previous ESA dose (4 x previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 250 or 4 x previous weekly darbepoetinalfa dose [μg] / 1.1). After 16 patients had completed at least 16 weeks of treatment, a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of MIRCERA was made.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the preliminary efficacy assessment, the uncorrected 90% confidence interval (CI)for the average Hb change from baseline to weeks 14-16 was calculated. If Hb levels had been adequately controlled with balanced dose increases and decreases, no other dose group would have been started, and additional patients would have been recruited to receive the same MIRCERA dose (Figure 1). However, a high-conversion-factor group was required (described as Group 2 in the protocol).

Patients in Group 2 received MIRCERA based on a conversion factor from their previous ESA dose, double that of Group 1 (4 x previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 125 or4 x previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose [μg] / 0.55). Similarly, after 16 patients had completed the first 16 weeks of treatment, a preliminary assessment of this group was also made. Based on the same criterion for decision making (Hb change from baseline within ±1g/dL, balanced dose changes and safety considerations), the decision was taken to recruit 20 additional patients into this high conversion factor group (Group 2).

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary objectives of the study NH19707 were

- To determine the starting dose of MIRCERA in paediatric patients with CKD on haemodialysis when switching from stable maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa
- To demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different iv doses of MIRCERA

The secondary objectives of the study NH19707 were:

- To study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MIRCERA in paediatric patients
- To explore MIRCERA exposure-response relationship
- To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MIRCERA in paediatric patients
- To document long-term safety and efficacy of MIRCERA administration in paediatric patients with anaemia associated with CKD

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design

This phase II, dose-finding study was an open-label, multicentre, multiple dose study of MIRCERA administered once every 4 weeks iv for 20 weeks in paediatric patients 5-17years old with CKD receiving haemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetinalfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). In this core study period, after the first administration of MIRCERA, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week.

If the lower limit of the CI was ≥-1 g/dL, the upper limit ≤1 g/dL and the number of dose increases and decreases was approximately balanced across the patients, no other dose group would have been started, and additional patients would have been recruited to receive the same MIRCERA dose.

This condition was not met; the upper limit of the CI for average Hb change was below -1 g/dL. Based on this finding and consideration of dose changes and safety information, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) approved the initiation of a high conversion-factor group as per the study design (denominated Group 2 in the protocol). If the lower limit of the CI had been above 1 g/dL, a lower-dose group could have been initiated (figure 1).

Patients in Group 2 received MIRCERA based on a conversion factor from their previous ESA dose, double that of Group 1 (4 × previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 125 or4 × previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose [μg] / 0.55). Similarly, after 16 patients had completed the first 16 weeks of treatment, a preliminary assessment of this group was also made. Based on the same criterion for decision making (Hb change from baseline within ±1g/dL, balanced dose changes and safety considerations), the decision was taken, with the support of the DSMB, to recruit further patients into this high conversion factor group (Group 2).

Although the protocol provided for the possibility of a third dose group, this was not considered necessary. The preliminary assessment also suggested higher than expected variability in Hb; to account for this, the protocol was amended to increase the minimum size of Group 2 from 25 to 36patients. At the same time, the decision was made to replace all patients who did not complete at least 18 weeks of treatment.

?Decision to enroll additional patients taken before initial target enrolment reached.

Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-weeksafety extension period. During this period, the patients continued to receive MIRCERAonce every 4 weeks and Hb concentration measurements occurred less frequently (every 4 weeks).

The low or the high conversion-factor doses were to be considered only if the intermediate conversionfactor dose (Group 1) did not result in an adequate Hb response. After review of the data from the intermediate-conversion factor group, the DSMB recommended initiation of Group 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dose of MIRCERA was adjusted to maintain the individual patient's Hb within a target range of ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and between 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL. Baseline Hb was calculated as the mean of Hb values between week -2 and week -1.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint in this study was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline and evaluation periods. This was calculated on a per-patient basis, using an area under the curve (AUC) approach to calculate an individual's average for both the baseline and evaluation periods and taking the difference.

The baseline period was defined as all assessments between the day of first study dose and the previous 20 days. The Hb value on the day of the first dose was included in the baseline calculation as this assessment was performed before the first dose was given.

The average Hb value for each individual during the evaluation period was based on all values recorded on study days 111 to 138.

The following were assessed as secondary endpoints:

1. The number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period within ±1 g/dL of their baseline Hb
2. The number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period above, within or below the range of 10-12 g/dL
3. The incidence of RBC transfusions
4. Change in reticulocyte count (x10000 /μL) between the baseline and evaluation periods
5. The following exploratory efficacy endpoints were assessed:
1. Change in dose over time
2. Change in dose between study start and evaluation period
3. The rate of rise in Hb concentration during the titration period

MIRCERA PK parameters were derived from serum concentration versus time data obtained from blood sampling from seven time points following the third iv administration of MIRCERA at week 9. PK parameters were read directly from the serum concentration versus time profiles or were estimated from the serum concentrations by non-compartmental methods.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

Due to the nature of the study, no formal testing was planned and all tests and p-values were descriptive.

This was an exploratory study without a powered statistical group comparison. Therefore no formal sample size estimation was performed. However, to determine the optimum starting dose of iv MIRCERA, the following sample-size calculations were made as an indication.

Providing the optimum dose maintains the Hb at the baseline level and the true change from baseline was equal to zero, the number of patients sufficient to provide80% power that the 90% CI for Hb change from baseline was between -1 and +1 g/dL is:

- 16 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was &lt;1.3 g/dL
- 36 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was &lt;2.0 g/dL

Additional patients were enrolled to replace patients who did not complete at least 18 weeks of treatment, to ensure a sufficient number of evaluable patients.

At least one third of the patients in each dose group were to be in the age group of ≥5 to&lt;12 years.

## Analysis Populations

The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP.

## Intention-to-treat Population

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients enrolled in the study.

## Safety Population

All patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication and had a safety follow-up were included in the safety population.

## Completers Population

All patients in the safety population who completed at least 18 weeks of treatment (and returned for an assessment in week 19), signifying that they had at least 3 Hb assessments during the evaluation period, were included in the completers population.

## Per Protocol Population

The Per-Protocol (PP) population includes all patients included in the safety population and who had no major protocol violations as defined below.

1. Patients with less than 3 Hb values during the evaluation period
2. Patients who missed any administration of study medication at week 13 or week 17
3. Patients who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria for

-Hb

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -iron levels
4. Patients who fulfilled any of the following exclusion criteria:
- -Hemoglobinopathies
- -Haemolysis
- -Overt gastrointestinal bleeding within 8 weeks before screening or during the screening period
- -RBC transfusion within 8 weeks before screening or during the screening period

## Extension Patients Population

The Extension Patients Population is defined as all patients having signed the informed consent for the optional safety extension period.

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

For patients with no recorded Hb during the evaluation period, the primary endpoint was missing. For all outputs concerning Hb, no imputation was made for missing values and analysis performed on observed cases only; if an RBC transfusion occurred, Hb values measured in the following 3 weeks were excluded (to correct for any Hb increase caused by the transfusion); any Hb values recorded after a renal transplantation were censored.

Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In addition, baseline covariate adjusted estimates of Hb change from baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model contains the patient's baseline Hb as covariate and dependent effects for dose group, age group and previous ESA group.

The primary analysis of the study was based on the ITT population, defined as all patients enrolled.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Between July 2008 and June 2015, a total of 112 patients were screened at 28 sites in Belgium (2), France (6), Germany (5), Hungary (1), Italy (1), Poland (5), Romania (1), Spain (3), Thailand (2) and Ukraine (2).

Of the 112 screened patients, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2, following a preliminary analysis of Group 1.

The reasons for 48 screening failures were as follows (information derived from IxRS and not validated in the study database): 30 patients with pre-dialysis Hb levels outside10-12 g/dL, 4 patients with poorly controlled hypertension, 4 patients with unstable epoetin or darbepoetin alfa doses prior to screening, 3 patients with no signed ICF, 2 patients with inadequate haemodialysis, 2 patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, 1 patient with inadequate iron status, 1 patient with gastrointestinal bleeding during screening, and 1 patient with a high likelihood of withdrawal (kidney transplantation planned).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Replacement of patients not completing at least 18 weeks of treatment lead to a total of48 patients in Group 2, 12 more than the protocol specified minimum of 36.12 patients in Group 1 and 35 in Group 2 completed the evaluation period.

Thirty-seven of these completers went on to participate in the optional 1-year safety extension, and this optional safety extension was completed by 17 patients.

During the extension period, 20 patients withdrew (16 due to renal transplant, two withdrew consent and a further two, at the same centre, due to 'repair of the dialysis station').

## ITT and Safety Populations

As all enrolled patients received at least one dose of study drug and had a safety follow-up visit, the ITT population and safety population were the same. These populations comprised 16 patients in Group 1 and 48 in Group 2 (64 patients overall).

## Completers Population

The (core study period) completers population (patients completing at least 18 weeks of treatment with at least three Hb assessments during the evaluation period) comprised 12patients in Group 1 and 36 in Group 2. Note that one patient dropped out at week 19 and so is included in the completers population but did not complete the evaluation period.

The PP population comprised the patients in the completers population with the exclusion of 2 additional patients in Group 2 who were protocol violators of the inclusion criterion regarding iron levels. The PP population thus comprised 12 patients in Group 1 and 34 in Group 2.

## Baseline data

## Patient Demographics

Overall, there were 34 male patients (53%), with a higher representation in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (Table 11).

The majority of patients were Caucasian, and the mean ± SD age was 11 ± 3.2 years in Group 1 and 13 ± 3.1 years in Group 2. Younger patients (aged 5-11 years) were more strongly represented in Group 1 (56%) compared with Group 2 (33%)The mean baseline body surface area (according to the Mosteller formula) was 1.14 and 1.24 in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.

## Other Treatments

Apart from surgical and medical procedures (all patients were on haemodialysis), anticoagulants and antianemic agents the most frequently used concomitant treatments were vitamins and minerals (15 [94%] in Group 1 and 44 [92%] in Group 2), of which vitamin D supplements were the top 3 treatments; calcium compounds and regulators (9 [56%] in Group 1 and 37 [77%] in Group 2) and supplements (11 [69%] in Group 1 and 30 [63%]in Group 2), of which the most frequently used were sodium bicarbonate and carnitine.

## Efficacy results

## PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT

In the ANCOVA model of this data, with adjustment for dose group (Group 1/Group 2),age (5-11/1218 years), previous ESA treatment (darbepoetin alfa/epoetin alfa or beta)and baseline Hb AUC, the adjusted mean change in Hb AUC from baseline to evaluation period was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.32 to -

Page 1 of 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.16) for Group 1 and -0.09 (95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26)for Group 2 (Table 18). Terms from the model show no indication of a strong effect on change in Hb due to previous ESA treatment or age.

In Group 2, 19 patients had Hb 1 g/dL or more above their baseline value at week 3, 17at week 4, and 11 at week 5. The corresponding tabulations to the graphs indicate that based on the third quartile, 75% of patients were under 12.5 g/dL at week 4, and less than 1.75 g/dL from their baseline value. The maximum Hb value seen at this time was 14.7 g/dL.

## SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS

- Patients With Haemoglobin 10-12 g/dL during Evaluation and With Change from Baseline ± 1 g/dL During the evaluation period, in Group 2, 75% of patients maintained Hb values within ± 1 g/dL of baseline and 81% maintained Hb values within 10-12 g/dL (in Group 1,these figures were 58% and 75%, respectively) (Table 20). The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 69% in Group 2 and 58% in Group 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Table  20  Patients  Maintaining  Stable  Hemoglobin  During  the  Evaluation  Period:  ITT Population

<!-- image -->

- Three patients required blood transfusions during the core study period, one in Group 1 and two in Group 2.
- The reasons for transfusion were Hb decreased, procedural haemorrhage, and intracranial hematoma. The patient with intracranial hematoma died as a result of the event
- Reticulocyte Counts during the Core Study Period

In both groups, mean reticulocytes showed a cyclic variation over time, with peaks at week 2, subsequently every 4 weeks and with troughs at week 4 to 5 and subsequently every 4 weeks throughout the study but otherwise showed no overall tendency to increase or decrease

## EXPLORATORY ANALYSES

- MIRCERA Dose during the Core Study Period

A summary of the equivalent 4-weekly MIRCERA dose over time during the core study period is provided in Table 22 and these data are presented graphically in Figure 7

## Table 22 Summary of Equivalent 4-Weekly MIRCERA Dose over Time during the Core Study Period: Safety Population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Figure 7 Box Plot of Equivalent 4-Weekly MIRCERA Dose over Time during the Core Study Period: Safety Population

<!-- image -->

In Group 2, the within-patient change in the 4-weekly MIRCERA dose during the evaluation period compared to their first dose was in general small, as indicated by a median ratio of 1.0 and a mean ratio of 1.1. In the case of Group 1, this ratio was larger (median ratio, 1.6; mean ratio, 1.9).

## Conversion Factors for Previous Weekly ESA Dose during the Evaluation Period

The conversion factors for previously weekly ESA dose to equivalent weekly MIRCERA dose during the evaluation period are shown in Table 25. In Group 2, the median [IQR] conversion factors were 1.8 [1.4, 2.8] for darbepoetin alfa and 0.008 [0.005, 0.01] for epoetin alfa/beta. These are both very close to the conversion factors used to calculate the first dose (1/0.55=1.8 and 1/125=0.008 for darbepoetin and epoetins respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The graphs show an even distribution either side of the line of these initial dose conversion factors (Figure 8 and Figure 9).

## Dose Adjustments during the Core Study Period

During the core study period, dose changes occurred frequently in both conversion factor groups (77% of patients in Group 2 and 81% in Group 1 required a dose change)(Table 26). A lower proportion of patients in Group 2 compared to Group 1 required a dose increase only during the core study period (29% compared to 56%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 required no dose change (23%) compared with Group1 (19%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 had both dose decreases and increases (38%) compared with Group 1 (13%).

In terms of absolute numbers of dose changes, the mean number of dose increases and decreases was 1.69 and 0.25, respectively, in Group 1 and 1.19 and 0.73, respectively, in Group 2

Table 34 Dose Ratio between the First and Evaluation Period Equivalent 4- Weekly MIRCERA Dose by Previous ESA Treatment during the Core Study Period: Safety Population

<!-- image -->

## Sensitivity Analysis

The changes in average Hb between baseline and evaluation period in the population were similar to those reported in the ITT population.

As no imputation was made for missing values in the primary analysis, in effect, this population includes data for two less patients.

In the analysis imputing missing Hb values using the LOCF method, as originally specified in the protocol, results were also very similar to the ITT change from baseline values without imputation. Thus, in Group 1, the mean change from baseline (per patient)was -0.86 g/dL and in Group 2 -0.22 g/dL compared to -0.78 g/dL and -0.15g/dL, respectively, without imputation.

## EFFICACY EVALUATIONS DURING THE SAFETY EXTENSIONPERIOD

In Group 2, during the safety extension period, all mean Hb values remained within the10-12 g/dL range (Figure 12). In Group 1, although mean values were below this range at some time points during the core study period, in the safety extension period, mean values in this group also remained within the 10-12 g/dL.

## Safety results

The majority of patients (77%) reported at least one AE in the core study period.

- During the core-study period, serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16patients overall (25%). Two of these SAEs were considered related to MIRCERA. A further two were considered lifethreatening (intracranial hematoma leading to death and procedural hemorrhage).
- One patient died during the study from an intracranial hematoma, considered by the investigator as unrelated to the study drug. This patient was the only patient who discontinued MIRCERA dosing for safety reasons.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- During the safety extension period, in which patients were exposed to MIRCERA for up to a further 52 weeks, the overall pattern of reported AEs was consistent with that observed in the core study period. SAEs were reported in 24% of patients (none were reported as related to the study drug by the investigator). No patients discontinued treatment due to an AE.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

This study represents the primary source of data for MIRCERA use in children. The first and last patients were enrolled in July 2008 and June 2015. The fact that the study took7 years to enroll 64 patients at 28 sites in 10 countries points to the logistic challenge of recruiting pediatric patients on hemodialysis receiving stable ESA treatment. An additional challenge was the high drop-out rate due to renal transplantation (20% of patients during the core study period and 43% of patients during the safety extension period), even though patients with a high likelihood of withdrawal due to renal transplantation were to be excluded from the study.

## EXTENT OF EXPOSURE TO STUDY TREATMENT

Table 41 shows the actual number of injected MIRCERA administrations; 11 patients in Group 1 and 24 patients in Group 2 received at least 5 administrations. For patients who did not receive all doses, either they withdrew from the study or dosing was temporarily suspended because Hb continued to increase (Hb&gt; 12 g/dL) despite a first dose reduction, and not for safety reasons.

During the core study period, the median cumulative total dose of MIRCERA was 466 μgin the Group 2 and 207 μg in the Group 1. The highest single, individually injected dose was 560 μg received by patient 3504, equivalent to 11.4 μg/kg with a total cumulative dose of 1950 μg. The highest cumulative dose was 2000 μg, from patient 6603, who regularly received 450 μg or 9 μg/kg.

Throughout the entire study (including the safety extension period), the median number of administrations was 5.5 in Group 1 and 7.5 in Group 2. Four patients in Group 1 (25%) and 7 patients in Group 2 (15%) received at least 18administrations and one in Group 2 received 19.

## COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS

Overall, 49/64 patients (77%) reported at least one AE during the core study period(12/16 [75%] in Group 1 and 37/48 [77%] in Group 2) , for a full summary of all AEs during the core study period, see. The most commonly affected SOCs (with &gt; 15% of patients overall with AEs) were Infections and infestations (30/64patients overall [47%]), General disorders and administration site conditions (12/64patients [19%]), Gastrointestinal disorders (12/64 patients overall [19%]) and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]).

The individual AEs reported in more than 5% of patients overall were nasopharyngitis(9/64 patients overall [14%]), headache (9/64 [14%]), vomiting (6/64 patients [9%]),hypertension (8/64 patients overall [13%]), abdominal pain (4/64 patients overall [6%]),and bronchitis (4/64 patients overall [6%]).

Seven AEs in 5/64 patients (8%) overall (1 AE in 1 patient in Group 1 and 6 AEs in 4patients in Group 2) were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

## Safety Extension Period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the safety extension period, 27 patients (73%) experienced at least one AE (4[44%] in Group 1 and 23 [82%] in Group 2).

The most frequently reported events were Infections and infestations (17 patients overall [46%] had an AE in this SOC) and Gastrointestinal disorders (8 patients [22%]).

The most frequently reported individual AEs overall were headache (6 [16%]), hypertension (5 [14%]) and nasopharyngitis (7 [19%]).

Two patients (both in Group 2) had 2 AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: anemia and urinary tract infection.

## ADVERSE EVENTS BY INTENSITY

Overall, there were 2 life-threatening AEs and 10 severe AEs in 7/64 patients (11%), 4 of which were not classified as SAEs during the core study period. Of the remaining AEs, there were 42 moderate AEs in 26/64 patients (41%) and 81 mild AEs in 35/64 patients(55%).

The two life-threatening AEs, both occurring in patients in Group 2 and reported by the investigator as unrelated to the study medication, were intracranial hematoma and procedural hemorrhage during dialysis caused by a poorly adapted dialysate filter and leading to worsening of anemia.

The only severe AE to be reported more than once was arteriovenous fistula thrombosis(2 patients, 1 in each group). One of these cases was classified as an SAE, and both were considered related to the study drug by the investigator. The only other severe AE considered related to the study drug by the investigator were hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia.

## Safety Extension Period

Overall, there were no life-threatening AEs and 5 severe AEs reported during the safety extension period (all in patients in Group 2). These events were hypotension, hypertension, arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, arterial injury, and sleep disorder. None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

## DEATHS

One patient died during the study (in the core study period). The cause of death was reported as intracranial hematoma. The patient had experienced head trauma as a result of a domestic accident in which he stumbled over a carpet, hitting his head on a chair, apparently without any immediate symptoms or signs. Two days later he received heparin and underwent dialysis, and subsequently experienced vomiting and seizures. ACT scan revealed intracranial hematoma. A craniotomy was performed and hematoma was evacuated. Although the patient was reported as feeling well the next day, his condition deteriorated and he died 24 days after intracranial hematoma was reported(and 26 days after head trauma). The event was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug

## SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS

Overall, 16/64 patients (25%) reported a total of 25 SAEs during the core study period(4/16 [25%] in Group 1 and 12/48 [25%] in Group 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly affected SOCs (with &gt; 5% of patients overall with SAEs) were Infections and infestations (8 patients overall [13%]), General disorders and administration site conditions (4patients overall [6%]), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (4 patients overall [6%]).

SAEs reported in more than 1 patient overall included device-related infection (3patients), bronchitis (2), thrombosis in device (2), arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2), procedural hemorrhage (2), fluid overload (2), and hypertension (2).

Of  the  AEs  classified  as  serious,  two  were  considered  related  to  study  medication:  arteriovenous thrombosis and thrombosis in device.

## ADVERSE EVENTS THAT LED TO WITHDRAWAL OF STUDYTREATMENT

One patient died and did not complete study treatment during the core study period. No patients were withdrawn  from  study  treatment  due  toa  non-fatal  AE  in  either  study  period.  No  AEs  led  to  dose modification at any time during the study.

## SELECTED ADVERSE EVENTS

## Hypertension

## Core Study Period

Overall, at baseline, 32 patients (50%) had hypertension reported by the investigator as a risk factor and 37 (58%) were already receiving or had received antihypertensive and/or diuretic agents. During the core study period, 8patients (13%) had an increase in antihypertensive treatment.

Of the 8 patients with arterial hypertension reported as an AE during the core study period, 7 had preexisting hypertension at enrollment or within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, and 1 had previously received antihypertensive therapy although this patient was not reported to have hypertension at enrollment or within 12 weeks of enrollment. In 1 patient, the hypertension was reported as severe in intensity and as an SAE. The event resolved with treatment (doxazosin and carvedilol). One case of moderate hypertension was also reported as an SAE.

Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure measurements were performed in all patients during the study. Values remained close to baseline level, and no clear trend or difference between groups was apparent during the study.

## Safety Extension Period

During the safety extension period, 9 patients (24%) had an increase in antihypertensive treatment

There were 5 adverse events of hypertension reported during this period. One patient with hypertension in the safety extension period had already reported a hypertension event during the core period. In that patient, both events were considered serious and severe; an increase in antihypertensive treatment was reported after the second event.

During the extension period, two patients reported hypertension as an SAE. In both cases, the event was associated with a change in antihypertensive medication.

## Vascular Access Thrombosis

## Core Study Period

4 patients (3 in Group 2 and 1 in Group 1) reported 5events of vascular access thrombosis.

These events were coded as 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in 2 patients and 'thrombosis in device' in 2 patients (1 patient experienced 2 such events).

For the patients with 'thrombosis in device' the verbatim investigator text was 'central venous thrombosis in dialysis catheter' and 'thrombosis in extracorporeal system for hemodialysis'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All cases were classified as SAEs. For 3 of the patients, the events were considered severe, and 2 cases (one case of 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' and one case of' thrombosis in device') were considered related to study medication. In all cases, the events resolved without sequelae.

## Safety Extension Period

3 patients reported 5 events of vascular access thrombosis (different patients from those with such events during the core period). These were coded as 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in 2 cases and 'thrombosis in device' in 3 cases.

Three of these events (two reports of `thrombosis in device' in 1 patient and 1 report of `arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in another patient) were classified as SAEs. One of these events (`arteriovenous fistula thrombosis') was also a severe AE. None of these events were considered related to study medication and all resolved without sequelae.

## Anti-Erythropoietin Antibody-Induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia

No patients developed anti-drug antibodies or anti-erythropoietin antibodies during the study.

## LABORATORY PARAMETERS

## Hematology

During the core study period, median Hct remained within 15% of baseline for both groups. Median RBC count remained within 13% and 8% of baseline for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Median platelet count remained within 16% and20% of baseline for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.

Median platelet count at baseline was 221.5 x 109/L (range 182-398) and 208.0 x 109/L(range 80518) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, and decreased slightly during the core study period in both groups. There was substantial within and between-patient variability of platelets in both groups. Shift tables for platelets during the core study period are shown in. In Group 1, 1/16 patients had one or more post-baseline values below the site-specific normal range (typically 150- 400 × 109/L). None had values above normal range. In Group 2, 19/47 patients had one or more post-baseline values below normal range, of whom 6/19 already had low value sat baseline, and 4/47 patients had one or more post-baseline values above normal range, of whom 1/4 already had a high value at baseline. During the extension period, platelet values below the site-specific normal range were reported in 2 patients (29%) in Group 1 and 15 patients (60%) in Group 2. No events of bleeding were reported in any patients in association with low platelet counts. Thrombocytopenia was reported as an AE in two patients; in both cases, the event was classified as mild.

Hematocrit values during the safety extension period were similar to those in the core study period RBC counts were not determined during the safety extension period.

## 2. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The study NH19707 was designed to provide evidence on the optimal dose of Mircera in the paediatric population with anaemia of CKD, following iv administration of MIRCERA to paediatric patients on haemodialysis. The study is part of the agreed PIP but while the PIP opinion states that children aged 2 to less than 18 years should have been enrolled, this study enrolled only children aged 5 to less than 18 years old. Therefore, the Applicant at the time of the type II variation should address how dosing for these children could be generated.  Furthermore, at the time of writing this assessment report, PDCO is discussing modification 02 of the PIP in which changes in the initially planned confirmatory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study (see below) are being dealt with. The MAH does not longer intend to perform such a study but this is something that should be discussed with the PDCO as mentioned above.

Study NH19707 is also a Post-Marketing Requirement agreed in 2007 with the FDA as per the Paediatric Research Equity Act.

The NH19707 Study consists of a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study to determine the optimum starting dose of Mircera in children  aged 5-17 years old receiving haemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). The duration of study were 20 weeks, after 2 weeks of screening period, patients were given Mircera for 16 weeks of dose titration and continued 4 weeks more during the evaluation period.

Two doses have been studied based on two different conversion factors. A total of 16 patients were given MirceraIV with a starting dose based on 4x previous weekly epoetin dose (IU) /250 or 4x previous weekly darbepoetin (μg) /1.1.  In the second group a total of 16 patients received a starting Mircera dose double that of group 1, it means  4x previous weekly epoetin dose (IU)/125 or 4x previous weekly darbepoetin alfa μg/0.55.

Of the 112 screened patients, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2, following a preliminary analysis of Group 1).

Considering that the adjusted mean change in Hb from baseline to the evaluation period was  smaller in group 2 (-0.09 g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) than in the group 1 (-0.74 g/dl(95% IC -1.32 to -0.16), that the secondary variables also support a more stable  Hb level  in group 2 than in the group 1 and finally that less dose adjusted were needed in group 2, it is proposed this Group 2 conversion factor to be used as the recommended starting dose of Mircera for the maintenance treatment in children.

However a detailed assessment of the study results is anticipated at the time of the variation application to expand the indication to the paediatric population on haemodialysis. A number of aspects would require clarification before supporting the proposed posology, particularly in the youngest group of patients (5-11 years old), given the limited data available. Furthermore, long-term data with the Group 2 starting dose are limited to 21 patients. There are some methodological issues that should be explained in order to uncertain the potential impact on the validity of study results, i.e. the substitution of patients who withdrew from the study. Finally the high variability in the dose of Mircera administrated throughout the core study period in order to achieve and keep the target of Hb level does not speak in favour of the selected starting dose and further discussion is foreseen on this matter.

Given that a phase III confirmatory study initially planned is not considered feasible any longer in these paediatric populations, it is to be agreed at PDCO whether a different trial is still needed. Whatever the outcome is, the lack of confirmatory data makes it needed a more in depth discussion than the crude data presentation in order to support any changes in the SmPC.

To this aim, the complete assessment of the population PK analysis can be key supportive evidence of the proposed conversion factor and may also help to clarify some of the identified uncertainties.

Overall, the safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population does not reveal any new signal. The vast majority of adverse events are already described in the SmPC of Mircera. However the frequencies of some adverse events appear to differ in children, which may well be due to the limitations of the safety database. Nevertheless, the need to include any particular information for this population in the SmPC will be decided following a careful review of the totality of the evidence available, without any restrictions based on arbitrary cut-off points (i.e. only AEs &gt;2% or 5% of incidence).

## CONCLUSION

The Applicant has submitted the results of Study NH19707, an open-label, multidose study to determine the optimum starting dose of intravenous Mircera for the maintenance treatment of anaemia in paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis and a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Mircera in the paediatric population.

This submission has been done 6 months after the last patients achieved the last visit in accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation 1901/2006.

The study results do not change the benefit risk balance for Mircera in the currently authorised conditions for use, which is limited to the adult population. Nevertheless, both the phase II study and the population PK analysis are considered of interest to conduct a formal benefit/risk evaluation for the use of Mircerain the paediatric population on haemodialysis. However, some aspects will require a deep evaluation and clarification from the MAH before a conclusion can be drawn.

It is noted that modification M02 of the PIP is currently ongoing at PDCO with regards to the design of the remaining paediatric study in the agreed PIP opinion which is a randomized controlled, open-label, multi-centre, parallel group study to confirm the optimal starting dose of Mircera administered once a month iv or sc for the maintenance treatment of anaemia in paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis or paediatric patients on dialysis (PD and HD) who had been receiving a stable treatment with an approved erythropoiesis stimulating agent (NH19708). The MAH no longer intends to perform such a study. An alternative study design is being discussed with the PDCO for pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. The conclusions of this article 46 assessment report have no impact in this and perhaps PDCO can take some advantage of the limitations seen in study NH19707 for their discussion.

Mircera is available in pre-filled syringe with several concentration 167 µg/ml, 250µg/ml, 333µg/ml, 500µg/ml, 667µg/ml, 833µg/ml, 100µg/ml, 133µg/ml, 200 µg/ml, 400µg/ml and 600 µg/ml. It is very likely that these formulations are also valid for children, as proposed by the MAH. However, the final acceptability will depend on the final decision on the recommended starting/maintenance dose for the paediatric population at the time of the variation application assessment. The risk for dosing errors with the current pre-filled syringes in children will need to be discussed.
