## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for conestat alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing conestat alfa is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.
