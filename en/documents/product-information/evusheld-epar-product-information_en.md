## Method of administration

There are no safety and efficacy data available on repeat dosing. Due to the observed decrease in in-vitro neutralisation activity, the duration of protection of EVUSHELD for some variants is uncertain (see section 4.4 and 5.1). Treatment The recommended dose in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg is 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of cilgavimab (Table 1), administered as two separate sequential intramuscular injections. EVUSHELD should be given as soon as possible after a positive viral test for SARS-CoV-2 and within 7 days of the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 (see section 5.1). Table 1 Recommended dose Each vial contains an overfill to allow the withdrawal of 150 mg (1.5 mL). Elderly No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). Renal impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). Hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). Paediatric population No dose adjustment is required in adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg (see section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of EVUSHELD in children under 12 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For intramuscular injection.

Tixagevimab and cilgavimab must be given as two separate sequential intramuscular injections at different injection sites in two different muscles, preferably in the gluteal muscles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each carton contains two vials:

- tixagevimab solution for injection (dark grey cap);
- cilgavimab solution for injection (white cap).

For handling instructions of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of EVUSHELD (see section 4.8). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medicinal products and/or supportive therapy. Cardiovascular and/or thrombo-embolic events In the PROVENT study, more participants in the EVUSHELD arm experienced serious cardiac or thromboembolic adverse events as compared to those in the placebo arm (1.6% versus 0.9%). The majority of participants had cardiovascular risk factors and/or history of cardiovascular disease that could explain the occurrence of such events. A causal relationship between EVUSHELD and these events has not been established. The risks and benefits should be considered prior to initiating EVUSHELD in individuals at high risk for cardiovascular or thrombo-embolic events. Patients should be advised of signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular event (notably chest pain, dyspnoea, malaise, feeling lightheaded or faint) and to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur. Clinically significant bleeding disorders As with any other intramuscular injections, EVUSHELD should be given with caution to patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder. Antiviral resistance The clinical trials with EVUSHELD were conducted when Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were predominant. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may be associated with resistance to monoclonal antibodies such as tixagevimab and cilgavimab. The in-vitro neutralisation activity of EVUSHELD against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants are shown in Table 3 (see section 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients who received EVUSHELD prophylactically should be informed of the potential for breakthrough infections to occur.

The duration of protection for variants with an observed decrease in in-vitro neutralisation activity is uncertain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be instructed to promptly seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of COVID-19 occur (the most common symptoms include fever, cough, tiredness and loss of taste or smell; the most serious symptoms include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, or confusion and chest pain).

Decisions regarding the use of EVUSHELD for the treatment of COVID-19 should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, including geographical prevalence. COVID-19 vaccines Pre-exposure prophylaxis with EVUSHELD is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Excipient with known effect This medicinal product contains 0.6 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial of tixagevimab and in each vial of cilgavimab. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Pharmacokinetic interactions No human interaction studies have been performed. EVUSHELD is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions with medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely. Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling, COVID-19 vaccination following EVUSHELD administration had no clinically relevant impact on the clearance of EVUSHELD. Based on PK modelling, immunocompromised condition had no clinically relevant impact on the clearance of EVUSHELD. Pharmacodynamic interactions No human interaction studies have been performed. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no or limited data from the use of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with tixagevimab and cilgavimab (see section 5.3). In tissue cross reactivity studies with tixagevimab and cilgavimab using human foetal tissues no binding of clinical concern was detected. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placenta therefore tixagevimab and cilgavimab have the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing foetus. The potential treatment benefit or risk of placental transfer of tixagevimab and cilgavimab to the developing foetus is not known.

EVUSHELD should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether tixagevimab and cilgavimab are excreted in human milk but maternal IgG is known to be transferred to milk during the first days after birth.

<!-- image -->

As tixagevimab and cilgavimab directly target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and in view of low systemic absorption after oral ingestion of antibodies, administration of EVUSHELD whilst breastfeeding can be considered when clinically indicated. Fertility There are no data on the effects of tixagevimab and cilgavimab on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines EVUSHELD has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile A total of 4 210 adult participants have received 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab, via intramuscular injection, in the Phase III prophylaxis development program (including PROVENT). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) were injection site reactions (1.6%) and hypersensitivity (1.0%). A total of 452 non-hospitalised adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 have received 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab, via intramuscular injection, in TACKLE. The overall safety profile was similar to that reported in participants who received 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab in the prophylaxis studies. The most common adverse reaction (≥ 1%) was injection site reaction (2.4%). Tabulated list of adverse reactions The adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

## Mechanism of action

Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are two recombinant human IgG1  monoclonal antibodies, with amino acid substitutions in the Fc regions, to extend antibody half-life and to reduce antibody effector function and potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tixagevimab and cilgavimab can simultaneously bind to non-overlapping regions of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination bind to spike with equilibrium dissociation constants of KD= 2.76 pM, 13.0 pM and 13.7 pM, respectively, blocking its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus entry. Tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination blocked RBD binding to the human ACE2 receptor with IC50 values of 0.32 nM (48 ng/mL), 0.53 nM (80 ng/mL) and 0.43 nM (65 ng/mL), respectively.

Antiviral activity In a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation assay on Vero E6 cells, tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination neutralised SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) with EC50 values of 60.7 pM (9 ng/mL), 211.5 pM (32 ng/mL) and 65.9 pM (10 ng/mL), respectively. These in-vitro values correlate with in-vivo clinically effective serum concentrations of 2.2 µg/mL of EVUSHELD. Antiviral resistance SARS-CoV-2 or recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pseudovirus) were serially passaged in cell cultures in the presence of tixagevimab or cilgavimab individually, or tixagevimab and cilgavimab in combination. Escape variants were identified following passage with cilgavimab, but not with tixagevimab or tixagevimab and cilgavimab in combination. In neutralisation assays using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses harbouring individual spike substitutions identified in circulating SARS-CoV-2, variants with reduced susceptibility to tixagevimab alone included those with F486S (&gt; 600-fold) and F486V (121- to 149-fold) and variants with reduced susceptibility to cilgavimab alone included those with R346I (&gt; 200-fold), K444E (&gt; 200-fold), K444Q (&gt; 200-fold) and K444R (&gt; 200-fold). The neutralisation activity of EVUSHELD against pseudovirus and/or live virus SARS-CoV-2 variant strains are shown in Table 3. Data collection is ongoing to better understand how small reductions in activity seen in authentic SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped VLP assays may correlate with clinical outcomes.

In TACKLE, baseline visit sequencing data was available for 749 participants (382 received tixagevimab and cilgavimab, and 367 received placebo). At an allele fraction ≥ 25%, the proportion of participants infected with variants of concern or variants of interest was balanced between treatment group, including participants with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda and Mu.

ND, not determined; RBD, receptor binding domain. It is not known how pseudovirus or authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation susceptibility data correlate with clinical outcome. In PROVENT, sequencing data collected at illness visits was available for 21 participants with symptomatic COVID-19 (7 received tixagevimab and cilgavimab, and 14 received placebo). At an allele fraction ≥ 25%, the most commonly observed variants of concern or variants of interest were Alpha (5 total events; all in placebo) and Delta (7 total events; 6 in placebo and 1 in EVUSHELD), with 7 ancestral strain sequences also being observed (3 in placebo and 4 in EVUSHELD). It is possible that resistance-associated variants to tixagevimab and cilgavimab together could have cross-resistance to other monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab together retained activity against pseudoviruses harbouring individual SARS-CoV-2 spike substitutions (E484D/K/Q, F490S, Q493R, S494P, K417E/N, D420N, K444Q, V445A, Y453F, L455F, N460K/S/T, F486V, and Q493K) identified in neutralisation escape variants of other monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In PROVENT, following an intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab, at Day 8, 29, 58, 92, 183 and 366, the neutralising antibody GMTs were 19, 23, 18, 14, 6, and 3-fold greater, respectively, than the GMT measured in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients (GMT= 30.8).

The primary analysis included 5 172 participants who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative at baseline, of which 3 441 received EVUSHELD and 1 731 received placebo. EVUSHELD significantly (p-value &lt; 0.001) reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness (COVID-19) when compared to placebo (Table 4). The median follow-up time post-administration was 83 days.

In TACKLE, following a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of cilgavimab, greater than 5-fold increase neutralising antibody GMTs were observed in the EVUSHELD group through Day 169 versus the placebo group: 16-, 14-, 22-, 18- and 5.3-fold over placebo at Day 6, 15, 29, 85, and 169, respectively. Immunogenicity In PROVENT, following a single EVUSHELD dose (150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab),treatment-emergent anti-tixagevimab, anti-cilgavimab and anti-EVUSHELD antibodies were detected in 7.6% (234/3085), 11.3% (341/3024), and 13.1% (403/3086) ADA-evaluable participants who received EVUSHELD. In TACKLE, following a single EVUSHELD dose (300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab), treatment-emergent anti-tixagevimab, anti-cilgavimab and anti-EVUSHELD antibodies were detected in 7.3% (27/372), 12.7% (46/363), and 14.5% (54/373) of ADA-evaluable participants, respectively. No evidence of an association of ADA with any impact on PK or safety has been observed. Clinical efficacy Prophylaxis of COVID-19 PROVENT was a Phase III, randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying EVUSHELD for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults ≥ 18 years of age. Enrolled participants were individuals considered to be at increased risk for inadequate response to active immunisation (due to age ≥ 60 years, co-morbidity, pre-existing chronic illness, immunocompromised, or intolerant of vaccination) or at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (due to their location or circumstances at time of enrolment, for example health care workers including staff for long-term care facilities, working in high risk industrial settings or living with high density proximity, including students in dormitories and military barracks). Participants received either 150 mg of tixagevimab and 150 mg of cilgavimab or placebo, administered as two separate intramuscular injections. The study excluded participants with a history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity at screening. The baseline demographics were well balanced across the EVUSHELD and placebo arms. The median age was 57 years (with 24% of participants aged 65 years or older and 4% of participants aged 75 years or older), 46% of participants were female, 73% were White, 3% were Asian, 17% were Black/African American, and 15% were Hispanic/Latino. Of the 5 197 participants, 78% had baseline co-morbidities or characteristics associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19, including obesity (42%), diabetes (14%), cardiovascular disease (8%), cancer, including a history of cancer (7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5%), chronic kidney disease (5%), chronic liver disease (5%), immunosuppressive medications (3%) and immunosuppressive disease (&lt; 1%).

## Table 4 Incidence of COVID-19

CI = Confidence Interval, N = number of participants in analysis. a Primary endpoint, a participant was defined as a COVID-19 case if their first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurred after administration and prior to Day 183. b 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab. Efficacy was consistent across pre-defined sub-groups including age, gender, ethnicity and baseline co-morbidities or characteristics associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. Among participants who received EVUSHELD there were no severe/critical COVID-19 events (defined as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness characterised by a minimum of either pneumonia [fever, cough, tachypnoea or dyspnoea, and lung infiltrates] or hypoxemia [SpO2 &lt; 90% in room air and/or severe respiratory distress] and a WHO Clinical Progression Scale score of 5 or higher) compared to one event (0.1%) among participants who received placebo. An additional data cut-off was conducted to provide post-hoc updated safety and efficacy analyses; the median follow-up was 6.5 months for participants in both the EVUSHELD and placebo arms. The relative risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness was 83% (95% CI 66, 91), with 11/3 441 (0.3%) events in the EVUSHELD arm and 31/1 731 (1.8%) events in the placebo arm, see Figure 1). Among participants who received EVUSHELD there were no severe/critical COVID-19 events compared to five events among participants who received placebo. In exploratory analyses of all participants who received EVUSHELD or placebo, including 25 participants who were subsequently found to have been SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive at baseline, the relative risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness was 78% (95% CI 59, 88), with 14/3 460 (0.4%) events in the EVUSHELD arm and 31/1 737 (1.8%) events in the placebo arm at a median follow-up of 6.5 months.

The predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in circulation for the time period represented in Figure 1 were Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Delta. Based on the incidence of primary endpoint events, the duration of efficacy was 6 months.

## Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19

TACKLE was a Phase III, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying EVUSHELD for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The study enrolled individuals who had not received COVID-19 vaccination, who were not hospitalised for COVID-19 treatment, and who had at least 1 or more COVID-19 symptom that was at least mild in severity. Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining the sample for a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and within ≤7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Patients received standard of care treatment and either 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of cilgavimab (N= 413) or placebo (N= 421), administered as two separate intramuscular injections. Participants were stratified by time from symptom onset (≤5 days versus &gt;5 days) and risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (high risk versus low risk). Demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the treatment and placebo groups. At baseline, the median age was 46 years (with 13% of subjects aged 65 years or older), 50% of the participants were female, 62% were White, 5.6% were Asian, 4.0% were Black and 52% were Hispanic/Latino. The majority of participants (84%) were seronegative at baseline, and 90% were considered at higher risk of progressing severe COVID-19, defined as either individuals aged 65 years and older at randomisation or individuals aged &lt; 65 years and having at least one medical condition or other factor that placed them at higher risk for progression to severe COVID-19. High risk co-morbidities included: obesity (BMI ≥ 30) (43%), smoking (current or former) (40%), hypertension (28%), chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma (12%), diabetes (12%), cardiovascular disease (including history of stroke) (9%), immunocompromised state (from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immunosuppressive medicines) (5%), cancer (4%), chronic kidney disease (2%), or chronic liver disease (2%). At baseline, 88% of patients had WHO clinical progression scale of 2 and 12% had WHO clinical progression scale of 3 COVID-19, the median duration of symptoms prior to treatment was 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of either severe COVID-19 or death from any cause by Day 29, in participants who received treatment within 7 days from symptom onset and were not hospitalised at baseline. Severe COVID-19 was defined as characterised by either pneumonia (fever, cough, tachypnoea or dyspnoea, and lung infiltrates observed on chest X-ray or lung computed tomography scan) or hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90% in room air and/or severe respiratory distress) and a WHO clinical progression scale score of 5 or higher. EVUSHELD demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in severe COVID-19 or death from any cause compared to placebo (Table 5). Given the small sample size, no conclusion can be drawn regarding the efficacy in seropositive patients.

After a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab the predicted Cmax of EVUSHELD was 53.9 µg/mL (90% PI: 25.2,107.3), which was reached at a median Tmax of 19 days (90% PI: 5, 46).

Missing response data were not imputed. The relative risk reduction was 67% (95% CI of 31, 84) in non-hospitalised patients dosed within 5 days of symptom onset (p= 0.002). The results of the primary composite endpoint were driven by the incidence of severe COVID-19. Up to Day 29, 7 deaths had been reported, 3 in the EVUSHELD arm and 4 in the placebo arm. Of the 7 deaths, 2 were not COVID-19 related. Both of these were in the EVUSHELD arm and contributed to the primary composite endpoint. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with EVUSHELD in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of tixagevimab and cilgavimab are comparable, linear and dose-proportional between 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab and 1 500 mg of tixagevimab and 1 500 mg of cilgavimab following a single intravenous administration. Population PK analysis of data from healthy volunteers and patients enrolled in three Phase III studies of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in preexposure prophylaxis (PROVENT), post-exposure prophylaxis (STORMCHASER) and treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (TACKLE), as well as data from five additional Phase I and II studies, with doses ranging from 300 mg (150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab) to 600 mg (300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab) intramuscular administration and 300 mg (150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab) to 3 000 mg (1 500 mg tixagevimab and 1 500 mg cilgavimab) intravenous administration supports dose proportionality of tixagevimab, cilgavimab and EVUSHELD. Absorption Based on population PK modelling, following a single intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab the predicted median (90% prediction interval [PI]) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of EVUSHELD was 26.9 µg/mL (90% PI: 12.6, 53.7), the median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 19 days (90% PI: 5, 45). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The estimated absolute bioavailability was 67.1% for EVUSHELD, 61.5% for tixagevimab and 65.8% for cilgavimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Based on PK modelling, the central volume of distribution was 3.17 L for tixagevimab and 3.52 L for cilgavimab. The peripheral volume of distribution was 1.77 L for tixagevimab and 1.82 L for cilgavimab.

Biotransformation Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and component amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG antibodies. Elimination The clearance (CL) median (95% CI) was 0.050 (0.049, 0.052) L/day for EVUSHELD, 0.046 (0.044, 0.047) L/day for tixagevimab and 0.052 (0.049, 0.054) L/day for cilgavimab with interindividual variability of 43%, 41% and 44% respectively. The estimated population median (5 th and 95 th percentile) terminal elimination half-life was 79 (46, 101) days for EVUSHELD, 81 (49, 106) days for tixagevimab and 78 (49, 97) days for cilgavimab. Following a single intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab, the predicted median EVUSHELD serum concentration was 24.5 µg/mL (90% PI: 11.8, 44.8) on Day 29 and 6.2 µg/mL (90% PI: 1.8, 14.7) on Day 183. Following a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab, the predicted median EVUSHELD serum concentration was 49.1 µg/mL (90% PI: 23.6, 89.5) on Day 29 and 12.5 µg/mL (90% PI: 3.6, 29.3) on Day 183. There was no clinically relevant difference on the clearance of tixagevimab or cilgavimab between participants with COVID-19 enrolled in TACKLE and those enrolled in the prophylaxis studies. Special populations Renal impairment No specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are not eliminated intact in the urine, thus renal impairment is not expected to significantly affect the exposure of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Similarly, dialysis is not expected to impact the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Based on population PK analysis, there is no difference in the clearance of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in patients with renal impairment (assessed via baseline eGFR and creatinine clearance) compared to patients with normal renal function. In the population PK model there were insufficient participants with severe renal impairment to draw conclusions. Hepatic impairment No specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. The impact of hepatic impairment on the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab is expected to be low. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be catabolised by multiple tissues through proteolytic degradation into amino acids and recycling into other proteins, therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the exposure of tixagevimab and cilgavimab.

## Elderly

Of the participants in the pooled PK analysis, 17.6% (N= 871) were 65 years of age or older and 3.2% (N= 156) were 75 years of age or older. There is no clinically meaningful difference in the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in geriatric subjects (≥ 65 years) compared to younger individuals.

## 6.1 List of excipients

Paediatric population The PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in individuals &lt; 18 years old has not been evaluated. Using population PK modelling and simulation, the recommended dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in adolescents aged 12 years or older who weigh at least 40 kg as observed in adults, since adults with similar body weight have been included in the prophylaxis and treatment clinical trials. High body weight Based on population PK analysis, a decrease in EVUSHELD maximum serum concentration and concentration at 6 months was observed with increased body weight. The maximum serum concentration and concentration at 6 months in an adult weighing 108 kg (87.5 percentile) were both predicted to be approximately 24% lower than in an adult weighing 81 kg (median). Other special populations Based on a population PK analysis, sex, age, race, ethnicity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and immunocompromise had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of tissue binding and a singledose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys including assessment of safety pharmacology and local tolerance. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection The potential of tixagevimab and cilgavimab to mediate antibody-dependent viral entry was assessed in FcγRII-expressing Raji cells co-incubated with recombinant virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with antibody concentrations at a range of 6.6 nM (1 µg/mL) to 824 pM (125 ng/mL). Tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination did not mediate entry of pseudovirus into these cells. The potential for ADE was also evaluated in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 using EVUSHELD. Intravascular administration prior to virus inoculation resulted in a dose-dependent improvement in all measured outcomes (total viral RNA in the lungs or nasal mucosae, infectious virus levels in the lungs based on TCID50 measurements, and lung injury and pathology based on histology measurements). No evidence of enhancement of disease was observed at any dose evaluated, including sub-neutralizing doses down to 0.04 mg/kg. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS Medicinal product no longer authorised
