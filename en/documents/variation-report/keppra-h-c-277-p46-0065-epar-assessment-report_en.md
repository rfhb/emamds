## 1. RECOMMENDATION

Two  studies  N01280  and  N01281  were  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) No1901/2006  (Paediatric  Regulation),  as  amended,.  After  review  of  the  study  data,  the  CHMP considered that there is no impact on either the Product Information or on the benefit-risk balance of the EU authorised formulations.

## 2. INTRODUCTION

This  assessment  report  concerns  two  study  reports  submitted  under  Article  46  of  the  Paediatric Regulation. Both studies focused on the extended release (XR) formulation of Keppra, which is licensed in the US but not in the EU.

Keppra  XR  comes  in  tablets  with  strengths  of  500  and  750mg,  and  is  indicated  in  the  US  as  an adjunctive therapy in treatment of partial onset seizures in epileptic patients ≥ 16 years of age.

As this formulation is not authorised at this time in the EU, the Company only submits these studies in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. No changes on the EU Product Information will result from the study outcomes, and thus there will be no influence on the benefit-risk balance for the approved Keppra formulations.

## 3. STUDIES

## 3.1. Study N01280

## 3.1.1. Introduction

Study  N01280  was  a  Phase  III  double-blind,  historically  controlled  multicentre  trial  investigating randomised conversion to monotherapy with Keppra XR for treatment of partial onset seizures.

A total of 60 investigators in 57 centres in the USA, Mexico, Poland and Russia participated.

The study took 29 weeks to complete, including an 8 week baseline period, and 18 week evaluation period, a 1 week down titration period and a 2 weeks treatment free period prior to the final visit.

## 3.1.2. Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  assessment  of  the  efficacy  of  Keppra  XR  compared  to  a historical control in conversion to monotherapy treatment of partial onset seizures.

The secondary objective entailed assessment of the safety and tolerability of 2 doses of Keppra XR is said conversion.

Direct medical resource use and indirect cost parameters were exploratory objectives.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.3. Study Methodology

The study was double-blind, parallel, randomized, 2-arm, historical- controlled, multicenter design. A participating  subject  went  through  a  number  of  periods  during  the  study  duration:  Screening  Visit, Baseline Period (8 weeks during which time subjects remained on a stable dose of maximally 2 of their existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and maintained a seizure diary), Evaluation Period, Down-Titration Phase, and Follow-Up Visit.

Patients were randomized through a 3:1 scheme to either receive Keppra XR 2000mg/day or Keppra XR 1000mg/day.

The  Evaluation  Period  consisted  of  18  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment,  administered  in  3  phases: Titration (2 weeks during which subjects were titrated to their targeted Keppra XR dose in a doubleblind fashion), Concomitant AED Discontinuation Phase (6 weeks in which subjects were tapered and discontinued  from  their  previous  AEDs),  and  a  Monotherapy  Phase  (10  weeks  in  which  subjects remained  on  their  assigned  dosage  of  Keppra  XR  monotherapy  until  either  study  completion  or occurrence of any 1 of 4 exit criteria).

Subjects who completed the study or met protocol-defined exit criteria after the 2-week titration phase, had their dosage down-titrated and received 1000mg/day open-label Keppra XR for 1 week. Final or follow-up visit assessments were required for all subjects who were randomized to treatment.

A total of 223 subjects needed to be randomised (167 in 2000mg/day group and 56 in 1000mg/day group), assuming a 10% drop-out rate, in order to ensure that 200 total subjects were included in the EFF (efficacy analysis) population with 3:1 ratio in 2 treatment arms.

## 3.1.4. Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria

Only subjects between 12 to 75 years of age with inadequately controlled partial onset epilepsy with observable  partial  seizures  that  may  have  been  classified  as  simple,  complex  or  partial  seizures evolving to secondarily generalized seizures could participate. In addition, subjects had to have been experiencing 2 to 40 acute seizures (auras not included) per 4-week period while being maintained on at least 1, but no more than 2 standard AEDs. Subjects had to be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before screening (visit 1) of at least 1, but no more than 2 other concomitant AEDs. If taking 2 AEDs, 1  of  the  Baseline  AEDs  should  have  been  taken  at  less  than  or  equal  to  50%  of  the  minimum recommended dose.

A  history  of  status  epilepticus  in  the  6  months  preceding  randomization,  seizures  that  were uncountable due to clustering during the 8-week period prior to screening (visit 1) and during the 8week Baseline Period or taking neuroleptics and/or traditional herbal AEDs were grounds for exclusion from  participation.  Lactating  or  pregnant  women  were  also  barred  from  entry,  as  were  patients suffering from problems which could impact absorption of Keppra XR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.5. Endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  cumulative  exit  rate  at  112  days  after  the  beginning  of concomitant AED discontinuation phase. Subjects who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason  other  than  the  protocol-defined  exit  criteria  were  censored  as  of  the  last  dose  of  study medication during the combined Concomitant AED Discontinuation and Monotherapy Phases.

These four protocol-defined exit-criteria were:

1. Two-fold  increase  in  the  average  28-day  partial  seizure  frequency  (PSF)  in  any  28-day  period during the combined Concomitant AED Discontinuation and Monotherapy Phases compared to the average 28-day PSF over the Baseline Period
2. Two-fold  increase  in  the  highest  consecutive  2-day  PSF  during  the  combined  Concomitant  AED Discontinuation and Monotherapy Phases compared to the highest 2-day PSF observed during the last 56 days of the Baseline Period
3. Occurrence of a generalized seizure if none had occurred in the 6 months prior to randomization
4. An  episode  of  status  epilepticus,  a  prolongation  of  seizure  duration,  a  worsening  of  seizure frequency,  or  emergence  of  a  new  seizure  type  considered  by  the  investigator  to  require intervention

The secondary efficacy analyses were conducted on the EFF population and were meant for descriptive purposes only:

- The cumulative rate of exit and its 95% CI for 1000mg/day group was calculated and descriptively compared to the historical control exit rate as the secondary efficacy analysis.
- The  cumulative  rate  of  exit  events,  which  included  meeting  a  protocol-defined  exit  criteria, discontinuation due to AE, and discontination due to lack of efficacy, at 112 days after entering the Concomitant  AED  Discontinuation  Phase.  For  this  endpoint,  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the study during the combined AED D/C and Monotherapy Phases due to other reasons (not due to exit criteria, AE, or lack of efficacy) were censored as of the last dose of study medication during the combined periods
- The cumulative rate of exit or discontinuation events due to any reason at 112 days after entering the Concomitant AED Discontinuation Phase. For this endpoint, subjects who completed through the Final/Completion Visit (Week 26) and did not meet any pre- specified exit criterion of the study were censored at Day 112.

The exploratory endpoints were as follows:

- Average 7-day normalized PSF for the Baseline and Evaluation Periods
- Average 7-day normalized PSF by visit during the Evaluation Period
- Seizure-free days over the Evaluation Period
- The global evaluation of disease evolution using a GES assessed by the investigator at the end of the Evaluation Period
- Medical resources used over the Baseline and Evaluation Period, including healthcare provider consultations not foreseen by the protocol, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations
- Number of working or school days lost by the subject and the number of days with help from a caregiver
- Socio-professional data (driving status, employment status)

## 3.1.6. Subject Disposition

Out  of  a  total  of  303  subjects  screened,  228  were  randomized  to  treatment,  57  to  the  Keppra  XR 1000mg group and 171 to the Keppra XR 2000mg group. A total of 191 (83.8%) completed the study, defined as either completed the Final Visit (Week 26) or withdrawn because they met an exit criterion. Thirty seven (16.2%) subjects withdrew from the study; the most common reason for discontinuation was protocol violation, followed by adverse event (AE), withdrawal of consent, other, lost to follow-up, and lack of efficacy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.7. Efficacy Results

The main efficacy results are summarized in table 1:

* Keppra XR 2000mg/day predicted exit rate is significantly lower than historical control.

a. A subject may be counted under more than 1 exit criteria.

b. Exit rate and time to exit were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.

As can be seen, the exit rate at Day 112 for the Keppra XR 2000mg group was significantly lower than the historical control exit rate of 0.678. When comparing the KM (Kaplen-Meier) curves for time to exit, the Keppra XR 2000mg group had a longer time to exit when compared to the same KM curve for the historical control pseudo placebo population based on visual comparison of the slope of the curves.

In both the EFF and PP populations, the estimated rate of exit at Day 112 was significantly lower than that  of  the  historical  control.  Sensitivity  analyses  demonstrated  that  the  cumulative  exit  rate  was significantly lower than that of the historical control under each of the conditions tested.

Based on the subgroup analyses, Mexico had a markedly higher proportion of subjects meeting an exit criterion  compared  to  other  countries.  Subjects  withdrawing  from  carbamazepine  as  a  concomitant AED had a higher rate of exit.

Secondary analyses confirmed the results of the primary analyses.

## 3.1.8. Safety Results

A total of 177 subjects reported 575 TEAEs during the overall treatment period. Somnolence (21.9% of subjects)  was  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE,  followed  by  headache  (19.7%  of  subjects).  Most reported  TEAEs  were  judged  as  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Severe  TEAEs  were  reported  by  16 subjects  overall  (7.0%).  There  were  no  apparent  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the incidence of TEAEs. The AE profile was similar to that reported in the US package insert.

There was no evidence for any effect of Keppra XR treatment on laboratory parameters, vital signs, weight, ECG evaluations, physical examinations, or neurological examinations.

## 3.1.9. Conclusions

In both the EFF and PP populations, the estimated rate of exit at Day 112 (primary efficacy endpoint) was significantly lower than that of the historical control based on the original exit rate of 67.8% and the revised exit rate of 65.3%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sensitivity  analyses,  conducted  on  the  primary  endpoint  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of  the  effect  of Keppra XR 2000mg, demonstrated that the cumulative exit rate was significantly lower than that of the historical control under each of the conditions tested.

Based  on  the  subgroup  analyses,  Mexico  had  a  markedly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  (59.0%) meeting an exit criterion compared to other countries (US, 36.0%; Poland, 24.5%; Russia, 26.7%). Subjects  withdrawing  from  carbamazepine  as  a  concomitant  AED  had  a  higher  rate  of  exit.  Other subgroups did not appear to have an influence on the exit rate.

Secondary efficacy analyses confirmed the results of the primary analyses.

Keppra  XR  was  safe  and  well-tolerated  when  administered  as  monotherapy  to  subjects  with inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  epilepsy  with  observable  partial  seizures,  with  an  AE  profile similar to that reported in the package insert.

## 3.2. Study N01281

## 3.2.1. Introduction

Study N01281 was a Phase III open-label, long-term follow-up study with Keppra XR for treatment of partial-onset seizures. Forty-three investigators in 61 centres in the USA, Mexico, Poland and Russia enrolled subjects in the study.

The  study  took  6  months  to  3  years  to  complete,  depending  on  the  time  that  a  subject  completed study N01280.

## 3.2.2. Objectives

The  primary  objective  was  was  to  provide  continued  treatment  of  Keppra  XR  for  subjects  who participated  in  the  pivotal  conversion  to  monotherapy  study  (N01280)  and  to  assess  the  long-term safety of Keppra XR in patients with partial onset seizures.

There were no secondary or exploratory objectives planned.

## 3.2.3. Study Methodology

The study, an open-label multicentredesign, consisted of three distinct phases: Entry Visit, Treatment Period, and Final/Early Discontinuation Visit.

- The Entry Visit coincided with a subjects last study visit in study N01280.
- The Treatment Period consisted of all subjects receiving a daily dose of 2000mg or less, depending on the tolerability in a subject, open-label Keppra XR for at least 2 weeks. After the initial 2 weeks, the  dose  of  Keppra  XR  could  be  adjusted  if  necessary.  If  possible  Keppra  XR  monotherapy  was mainained, but addition of other AEDs was allowed if needed.
- The Final/Early Discontinuation Visit was done approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of Keppra XR.

There  were  a  total  of  190  enrolled  subjects  in  the  ITT  (Intent  To  Treat)  Population.  A  total  of  189 (99.5%)  subjects  received  treatment  and  were  included  in  the  Safety  Population.  The  same  189 (99.5%) subjects had at least 1 efficacy measurement reported, and were included in the EFF (Efficacy Analysis) population.

## 3.2.4. Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria

Subject wishing to participate had to have been randomised into the N01280 study and completed its 2-week Up-Titration Period.

Screening failures of N01280 or subjects whom discontinued from N01280 prior to the end of the 2week Up-Titration Period, or whom were taking neuroleptics and/or traditional herbal AEDs were not eligible for participation. Lactating or pregnant women were also barred from entry, as were patients suffering from problems which could impact absorption of Keppra XR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.2.5. Statistical Methods

Summary statistics  consisted  of  frequency  and  percentage  for  categorical  variables,  and  descriptive statistics.

## 3.2.6. Subject Disposition

A total of 190 subjects were enrolled in this study. Of these, 189 (99.5%) received medication. A total of 166 (87.4%) completed the study, defined as all subjects who did not discontinue.

Twenty four (12.6%) subjects withdrew from the study; the most common reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent and other reason, followed by AE and protocol violation.

## 3.2.7. Efficacy Results

Of the subjects who entered the study on Keppra XR monotherapy, 65.3% remained on Keppra XR monotherapy for at least 12 months and 47.1% remained on monotherapy at least 18 months. Two subjects even remained on Keppra XR monotherapy for at least 24 months.

Subjects who remained in the study had a reduction in seizure frequency at all study visits relative to Baseline of the N01280 study, as measured by the median 7-day PSF and the median 7-day seizure frequency based on all seizure types.

## 3.2.8. Safety Results

Keppra XR was well-tolerated when administered as long-term monotherapy or in combination with other  AEDs  in  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  seizures.  A  total  of  126  subjects (66.7%) reported 588 TEAEs. Headache (13.8% of subjects) was the most commonly reported TEAE, followed by nasopharyngitis and somnolence (7.9% for each), influenza (5.3%) and dizziness (7.4%). Most reported TEAEs were judged as mild or moderate in severity.

A total of 5 subjects (2.6%) had a TEAE that led to discontinuation. This included 2 subjects (1.1%) who became pregnant. Twenty two subjects (11.6% of the overall population) had a SAE; Convulsion (4 subjects, 2.1%) was the most common treatment-emergent SAE. There was one death (drowning) in a subject aged 18 years. This death was judged to be unrelated to the study medication. A total of 26 subjects (13.8%) experienced at least one psychiatric TEAE during the overall treatment period. Insomnia (4.8%) was the most commonly reported psychiatric TEAE, followed by depression (2.6%) and anxiety (2.1%).

Table 2 on the next page gives a summary on the TEAEs.

There was no evidence for any effect of Keppra XR treatment on laboratory parameters, vital signs, weight, ECG evaluations, physical examinations, or neurological examinations.

## 3.2.9. Conclusions

Keppra  XR  was  safe  and  well-tolerated  when  administered  as  long-term  treatment  to  subjects  with inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  epilepsy,  with  an  AE  profile  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  US package insert for Keppra XR.

Subjects in  the  study  appeared  to  have  maintenance  of  efficacy  as  evidenced  by  the  percentage  of subjects who remained on Keppra X R monotherapy for at least 12 months.

## 4. OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

The CHMP considered that the results of the two studies presented by the MAH showed that Keppra XR was effective and safe in long-term treatment of subjects with inadequately controlled partial onset epilepsy.

Nevertheless,  Keppra  XR  is  not  a  registered  formulation  in  the  EU,  therefore  no  changes  to  the approved Product Information for Keppra were proposed following the completion of these studies. The MAH considered that the standard immediate release formulations of Keppra allows for appropriate use of levetiracetam in paediatric patients in the EU. These studies were solely submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulations.

However, in case the MAH should one day consider registering the XR formulation in the EU, the CHMP noted  that  the  data  as  collected  in  both  studies  was  nowhere  near  robust  enough  to  support  an extension of the approved monotherapy indication of the currently available formulations in the EU. For that to be possible, additional studies and more data were considered to be needed.
