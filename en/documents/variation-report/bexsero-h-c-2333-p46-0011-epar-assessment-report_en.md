## Safety Objectives:

## Primary

To assess the safety and tolerability of one or two booster doses of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ administered to children starting at 40 months of age who previously received one or four doses of the same vaccine in parent study V72P6.

## Secondary

To assess the safety and tolerability of a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive children starting at 40 and 60 months of age.

## · Study design

This study was an extension of study V72P6. It was conducted as an open-label, single center study (Oxford Vaccine Group, Oxford University Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK).

## · Study population /Sample size

A maximum number of 126 subjects from parent study V72P6 were eligible to participate in this extension study. These were the subjects who successfully completed study V72P6 at the Oxford Vaccine Group study site. This number excluded V72P6 subjects from the Gloucester Vaccine Evaluation Unit, as this center did not participate in the extension study. The actual number of subjects enrolled from the parent study was 70, and all subjects were exposed to the study vaccine.

Two groups of around 50 newly recruited, naive subjects, 40 and 60 months of age, were also to be enrolled into the study: 43 subjects aged 40 months were actually enrolled and 42 were exposed to the study vaccine; 50 subjects aged 60 months were enrolled and 50 were exposed to the study vaccine. In total, 163 subjects were enrolled in this study.

Individuals eligible to be enrolled in the study were healthy 40-44 months old children:

- who participated and completed the V72P6 study (or naive subjects 40 or 60 months of age);
- for whom a parent/legal guardian had given written informed consent after the nature of the study had been explained;
- were available for all the visits scheduled in the study;
- were in good health as determined by: medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator.

## · Treatments

Subjects who completed study V72P6 at the Oxford Vaccine Group study site and who met all other enrollment criteria were eligible to participate in this extension study.

These subjects were treated as follows:

- o Group 5rMenB (referred to as Group I in protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age with rMenB vaccine in study V72P6 were vaccinated with a single booster vaccination of the same vaccine at 40 months of age.
- o Group 5rMenB+OMV (referred to as Group II in protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age with rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in Study V72P6 were vaccinated with a single booster vaccination of the same vaccine at 40 months of age.
- o Group 3rMenB (referred to as Group III in study protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated with a single dose of rMenB vaccine in Study V72P6 were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations of the same vaccine at 40 and 42 months of age.
- o Group 3rMenB+OMV (referred to as Group IV in study protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated with a single dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in study V72P6 were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations1 of the same vaccine at 40 and 42 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two additional vaccine groups, each consisting of 50 newly recruited, naive subjects, 40 and 60 months of age, were enrolled in the study. These subjects were treated as follows:

- o Group Naive\\_4042 (referred to as Group V in the protocol): Naive subjects recruited at 40 months of age were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 40 and 42 months of age.
- o Group Naive\\_6062 (referred to as Group VI in the protocol): Naive subjects recruited at 60 months of age were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 60 and 62 months of age.
- Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity Endpoints

Serum bactericidal activity was measured against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. Data was summarized by calculating hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, and percentage of subjects with four-fold increase over baseline. Antibody response to vaccine antigen 287-953 was also to be determined by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and summarized by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and four-fold rises.

Antibody persistence and booster immune responses were interpreted using data from the naive groups of children recruited at 40 and 60 months of age, as indicated below.

- o Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 40 months of age (group Naive\\_4042) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 40 months of age for groups 5rMenB, 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB, and 3rMenB+OMV.
- o Responses to the first and second catch-up vaccinations of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive subjects at 40 and 42 months of age (group Naive\\_4042) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate booster responses and, in turn, the presence of immunological memory in groups 5rMenB, 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB, and 3rMenB+OMV.
- o Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 60 months of age (group Naive\\_6062) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 60 months of age postbooster vaccination in groups 5rMenB, 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB, and 3rMenB+OMV, and post-2 dose catch-up in group Naive\\_4042.

## Safety Endpoints

All subjects who received at least one vaccination of rMenB±OMV NZ and provided some safety data postvaccination with rMenB±OMV NZ (defined as the safety population) were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. All safety analyses were descriptive.

## Local and Systemic Adverse Events

Incidences of local AEs (ie, pain, erythema, induration, swelling) and systemic AEs (ie, fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥ 38°C], change in eating habits, sleepiness, irritability, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia, headache and rash) occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and vaccine group. Additionally, the numbers of subjects who used analgesic or antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) within 7 days of study vaccination were summarized. Erythema, induration and swelling were categorized as none, 0&lt;-10 mm, 10 &lt; -25 mm, 25 &lt; -50 mm, 50 &lt; -100 mm and &gt; 100 mm. Temperature taken by the axillary route were categorized as &lt; 38°C, 38- &lt; 38.5°C, 38.5- &lt; 39°C, 39- &lt; 39.5°C, 39.5&lt; 40°C, and ≥ 40°C. All other systemic AEs were categorized as present or not present, and if present as mild, moderate or severe.

## Unsolicited Adverse Events

All unsolicited AEs that occurred during the 7 days following each study vaccination were collected. All SAEs, as well as AEs that required a medical visit and/or resulted in premature withdrawal from the study were collected throughout the study period, except for the 7 days after each vaccination with rMenB±OMV NZ in which all AEs were collected.

All reported unsolicited AEs, as well as AEs that were at least possibly related to rMenB±OMV NZ were summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. These summaries were presented by vaccine group. When an AE occurred more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine were counted. Additionally, separate summaries of AEs were generated as follows: (i) SAEs, (ii) AEs that were possibly or probably related to vaccine, and (iii) AEs that were unrelated to vaccine. Data listings of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

all AEs were provided by subject. In addition, a summary of the primary termination reasons, a listing of subjects withdrawn from the study because of an AE, and a listing of all termination reasons were presented.

## · Statistical Methods

Due to the small sample size in each vaccine group, the analyses of safety and immunogenicity were purely descriptive. As such, no statistical tests were performed. The primary analysis of the immunogenicity results were based on the modified Intention-to-treat population (MITT). All safety analyses were based on the safety population.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 163 subjects were enrolled in this extension study and 162 received at least one study vaccination. Of the 126 subjects that were eligible from the parent study 70 were enrolled in this extension study. Two groups of newly recruited, naive subjects were enrolled; a total of 43 subjects aged 40 months and 50 subjects aged 60 months.

A summary of the number of subjects who were enrolled, who completed or discontinued the study, by vaccination group, is provided in Table 10.1-1. Among enrolled subjects, a total of 23 (14%) discontinued the study. Most subjects who discontinued withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up. Three (3) subjects discontinued due to protocol violations (moved out of area) and one (1) subject discontinued due to inappropriate enrolment.

Assessor´s comment: It is noted that the number of enrolled subjects is limited and that less than half of the eligible subjects from the parent study were enrolled into this extension study. The study groups are small and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should therefore be made with caution. Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Baseline data

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar across groups, except for gender differences. A higher percentage of male subjects were enrolled in groups 5rMenB+OMV (53%) and 3rMenB+OMV (63%), while a higher percentage of females were enrolled in groups Naive\\_4042 (53%) and Naive\\_6062 (54%).

## · Efficacy results Primary endpoint.

Prior to booster vaccination at 40 months of age, GMTs and proportions of seropositive subjects in the vaccinated group had decreased to low levels approaching baseline and were comparable to those of the naïve group for all reference strains except strain 5/99. For strain 5/99 vaccinated subjects had a mean GMT of 28 (10-77) compared to 1.11 (0.9-1.36) of naive subjects, and 76% of vaccinated subjects were seropositive whereas 3% (one individual) of naïve subjects were seropositive.

Assessor´s comment: The decrease in GMTs and proportion of seropositive subjects was not unexpected and could indicate the need for a booster vaccination at 40 months of age. However, the number of subjects is very small, and confirmation is needed from larger studies.

## Secondary endpoints

- a. To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 40 months of age who previously received a single dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ at 12 months of age in parent study V72P6

At 40 months of age GMTs and the proportion of seropositive subjects had decreased to approximately baseline levels.

Assessor´s comment: During initial assessment for market authorization this vaccination regime was considered insufficient to provide relevant protection, and the persistence antibodies at 40 weeks of age is therefore regarded to be of limited interest.

- b. To characterize the bactericidal antibody response of a booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ administered at 40 months of age to children who previously received four doses of the same vaccine as infants in parent study V72P6.

One month post booster at 42 months of age or post second vaccination of naïve individuals both groups showed an increase in GMTs as well as a greater proportion of seropositive subjects indication the presence of immunological memory. The levels were comparable to those of group 5rMenB+OMV one month after the single booster dose (secondary endpoint b).

One month post second vaccination an increase in GMTs and the proportion of seropositive subjects against all strains was demonstrated compared to baseline in both groups. In naïve subjects vaccinated at 40 and 42 weeks of age the magnitude of GMTs were comparable to those 5rMenB+OMV one month after the booster dose at 40 weeks of age (secondary endpoint b) whereas levels appeared slightly lower in naïve subjects vaccinated at 60 and 62 weeks of age. The proportions of seropositive subjects one month after second vaccination were comparable to those of 5rMenB+OMV one month after the booster dose at 40 weeks of age for both groups of naïve subjects. 18 months after the second vaccination GMTs and proportions of seropositive subjects in group Naïve\\_4042 had decreased and approached the levels at baseline for all antigens except strain 5/99.

Assessor´s comments: It is noted that it appears that older children (60 months of age) had a lower response than 40 month old children. The clinical relevance of this is, however, unclear.

a.Baselinewasat40monthsof ageforsubjectsinNaive\\_4042andat60monthsof ageforsubjectsin Naive\\_6062.

Booster doses/repeated doses resulted in a substantial increase in GMCs across all groups. At 60 months of age in groups 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB+OMV and Naive\\_4042, levels of GMCs had been reduced about 10-fold but remained above baseline.

## Assessor's general comment on efficacy results:

Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from this study and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should be made with caution. During initial assessment for market authorisation it was noted that immune responses to vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ in the parent study V72P6 were lower than those of other studies, including the pivotal study V72P13. Responses presented in this extension study are also comparatively low, but considering the levels of the parent study and the limited sample size, there is not enough concern to indicate reduced immunogenicity of vaccination from the data presented here.

It is also noted that baseline values for strain M10713 in the newly recruited groups Naive\\_4042 and Naive\\_6062 are high. The analytical method for this strain was, however, subject to discussion during initial assessment, and the ELISA was also considered relevant. This issue will not be commented on further in this report.

V72\\_41 A Phase 3, Randomized, Comparative, Multicenter Observer-Blind Study Evaluating the Safety and Immunogenicity of Novartis rMenB+OMV NZ Vaccine Formulated with OMV Manufactured at Two Different Sites, in Healthy Adolescents Aged 11-17 Years.

-  Description
-  Methods
- Objectives Immunogenicity Objectives: Primary objective
- To demonstrate the equivalence of rMenB+OMV NZ lot 1 to rMenB+OMV NZ lot 2 when administered to adolescents, as measured by human serum bactericidal activity (hSBA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and as measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) against vaccine antigen 287-953, approximately 30 days after a primary vaccination course of two doses administered one month apart.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study was considered a success if, at one month following the second vaccination, the twosided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of the hSBA GMTs for each of 3 serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and the twosided 95% CI of the ratio of the ELISA GMCs against vaccine antigen 287-953 are contained within the interval (0.5, 2.0).

## Secondary objectives:

- a) To assess the immune response at one month after a primary vaccination course of two rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 and as measured by the ratio of hSBA postvaccination to prevaccination GMTs [GMR] against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254).
- b) To assess the immune response at one month after a primary vaccination course of two rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by the ratio of ELISA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMCs [GMR] against vaccine antigen 287-953.
- c) To evaluate the immune response at two weeks after a primary vaccination course of two rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by hSBA GMT, the ratio of hSBA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMTs [GMR], and the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254).
- d) To evaluate the immune response at two weeks after a primary vaccination course of two rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by ELISA GMC and the ratio of ELISA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMCs [GMR] against vaccine antigen 287-953.

Analyses related to the secondary objectives are descriptive only. There are no statistical hypotheses related to the secondary immunogenicity objectives.

## Safety Objective:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two doses of two rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine lots formulated with OMV manufactured at 2 different manufacturing sites, given one month apart, in healthy adolescents.

## · Study design

This was a Phase 3, multicenter (7 sites in Canada and 6 sites in Australia), observer-blind randomized trial in adolescents (11-17 years, inclusive). All subjects received two rMenB+OMV NZ vaccinations one month apart and were followed for a total of 2 months. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms to receive either two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine Lot 1 or 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ Lot 2. Lot 1 was formulated with OMV manufactured in Novartis Rosia facility and Lot 2 from Novartis Siena facility.

## · Study population /Sample size

Overall, 320 subjects were planned to be enrolled, with 160 subjects per lot who were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Estimating a total drop-out rate of 15%, a sample size of 135 evaluable subjects per arm were planned to be vaccinated with rMenB+OMV NZ in the groups Lot 1\\_Rosia and Lot 2\\_Siena, respectively. Assuming an underlying GMT (or GMC) ratio of 1.0 and that the results for the three strains and vaccine antigen 287-953 are independent, the overall power to demonstrate immunologic consistency is approximately 93.6%. The power to reject the null hypothesis associated with the primary immunogenicity objective is the probability that, for each strain or vaccine antigen 287-953, the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of GMTs (or GMCs) at 1 month after the second vaccination is entirely contained within the interval (0.5, 2.0).

All subjects who received at least one vaccination were to be included in the safety analyses.

Individuals eligible were to be enrolled into this study were male and female subjects:

- o 11-17 years of age inclusive who had given their written assent and whose parents or legal guardians provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment;
- o who were available for all the visits scheduled in the study (i.e., did not leave the area before the end of the study period);
- o in good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Treatments

Enrolled subjects were randomised into two groups and vaccinated with Novartis Meningococcal B Recombinant+OMV NZ vaccine (rMenB+OMV NZ);

- o Group Lot 1\\_Rosia; Lot 1 formulated with OMV manufactured in Rosia site
- o Group Lot 2\\_Siena: Lot 2 formulated with OMV manufactured in Siena site

Treatments were given twice one month apart followed by a one month long follow up period. The total study period was two months.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity endpoints

The Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA) using human serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA) was used to measure the induction of functional bactericidal antibodies directed against serogroup B meningococci following vaccination with rMenB+OMV. An Enzyme-Linked

Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was also used to measure immune response to vaccination. The primary immunogenicity variables were:

- o The ratio of the vaccine lot hSBA GMTs for each of the three serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) at one month after the second vaccination.
- o The ratio of the vaccine lot ELISA GMCs for the 287-953 vaccine antigen at one month after the second vaccination.

Equivalence of the immune response of the two lots of rMenB+OMV NZ, each formulated with OMV manufactured at a different sites, assessed at one month after the second vaccination based on the ratio of the vaccine lot hSBA GMTs for each of three serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and based on the ratio of ELISA GMCs for vaccine antigen 287-953. The equivalence interval was (0.5, 2.0). An additional blood draw in a subset of subjects at two weeks after the second dose was also collected.

Additional secondary analyses at each time point included the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5, which is above the historically defined threshold titer (1:4) that correlates to clinical protection, and the GMR to baseline at each time point.

## Safety endpoints

All subjects who received at least one vaccination of rMenB+OMV NZ and provided some safety data post vaccination were included in the safety analyses. All safety analyses were descriptive.

## Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions

Post-vaccination reactions reported from day 1 to day 7 after each vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and by vaccine group. The severity of local reactions, including injection-site erythema, induration, and swelling was categorized as none (0 mm), 1 to &lt;25 mm, 25 to &lt;50 mm, 50 to &lt;100 mm and ≥100 mm (severe local reactions). The severity of pain and systemic reactions (i.e., nausea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache and rash) occurring up to 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination was categorized as none, mild (transient with no limitation in normal daily activity), moderate (some limitation in normal daily activity), and severe (unable to perform normal daily activity). Rash was categorized as none, urticarial, and other. Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each local and systemic reaction during days 1 to 3 after vaccination were similarly summarized, as well as daily frequencies and the time of onset of the first reactions. Each local and systemic reaction was also categorized as none vs. any. Body temperature (regardless of the route of measurement) was analyzed in 0.5°C increments as follow &lt;38.0°C (no fever), 38.0-38.4°C, 38.5°C - 38.9°C, 39.0°C - 39.4°C, 39.5°C - 39.9°C, ≥40.0°C. Additionally, the number and percentage of subjects who used analgesic or antipyretic medication were summarized in addition to the number and percentage of subjects who stayed home due to a reaction.

## Other Adverse events

All reported adverse events, as well as adverse events judged as at least possibly related to study vaccine, were summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within system organ class. These summaries were presented by vaccination group. When an adverse event occurred, more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine group was counted. Additionally, three separate summaries were produced: (i) serious adverse events, (ii) adverse events that are possibly or probably related to vaccine, and (iii) adverse events that are unrelated to vaccine. Data listings of all adverse events were provided by subject. In addition, a listing of subjects withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event was presented, as well as a listing of adverse events leading to hospitalization.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Statistical Methods

The null hypothesis associated with the lot-to-lot immunogenicity objective was that for at least one strain at one month after the second vaccination, the two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of hSBA GMTs (strains H44/76, 5/99, or NZ98/254) or the two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of the ELISA GMCs (vaccine antigen 257-953) was outside the interval (0.5, 2.0).

For each of the three strains and the 287-953 vaccine antigen, lot-to-lot consistency for the 2 lots of rMenB+OMV NZ was assessed in terms of log10-transformed hSBA GMTs or log10-transformed ELISA GMCs at one month after the second vaccination.

Analyses related to the secondary objectives were descriptive only. Therefore, there were no statistical hypotheses related to the secondary immunogenicity objectives.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

Overall, 344 subjects aged 11 to 17 years were enrolled in the study. Of these, 170 were included in Lot1\\_Rosia and 174 subjects in Lot2\\_Siena. The immunogenicity per protocol population (PP) comprised of 299 subjects, 147 subjects from Lot1\\_Rosia and 152 subjects from Lot2\\_Siena. An immunogenicity subset PP population of 147 subjects (76 in Lot1\\_Rosia and 71 in Lot2\\_Siena) was analyzed at two weeks after second vaccination.

The safety population was composed of 342 subjects; 169 subjects in Lot1\\_Rosia and 173 subjects in Lot2\\_Siena. Two of the enrolled subjects (59/001/Lot1\\_Rosia and 52/023/Lot2\\_Siena) did not receive any vaccination at all, and were therefore excluded from safety analyses.

A summary of the number of subjects who were enrolled, who completed or discontinued the study, by vaccination group, is provided in table 2-2. Among enrolled subjects, a total of 6 subjects (2%) discontinued the study. Five of the six subjects who discontinued withdrew consent whereas one subject from Lot2\\_Siena reported an adverse event 'Infectious Mononucleosis' with moderate severity which led to premature withdrawal from the study.

## · Baseline data

The demographic and other baseline characteristics for the enrolled population in the Lot1\\_Rosia and Lot2\\_Siena were well matched, except for gender differences. There was a 5% difference in percentage of males (58% and 53%) and females (42% and 47%) between Lot1\\_Rosia and Lot2\\_Siena, respectively. The majority of subjects in the Lot1\\_Rosia and Lot2\\_Siena groups were White. These gender differences did not affect the lot consistency conclusions for this study.

## · Efficacy results Primary endpoint:

Assessor's comment: It is unclear how the GMT for the total population can be higher than the GMTs for each group for strain 44/76-SL at one month after the 2 nd vaccination, and lower for the total population for strain 5/99 than in each for the groups. This should be clarified.

Post-script: The company responded to the Assessor's request for clarification in August 2014. The apparent mistake is due the use of adjusted and unadjusted GMTs values for different groups in the same Table. The responses were accepted and the submission is considered fulfilled

The primary objective to demonstrate equivalence of rMenB+OMV NZ lot 1 to rMenB+OMV NZ lot 2 at one month after second vaccination was met for the 3 N. meningitidis serogroup reference strains H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254 and for the vaccine antigen 287-953. The two-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the hSBA GMTs for each of the 3 serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and the two-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the ELISA GMCs against vaccine antigen 287953 were each contained within the interval (0.5, 2.0

## Secondary endpoints:

Immune response at one month after second vaccination: Percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 and as measured by the ratio of hSBA postvaccination to pre-vaccination GMTs [GMR] against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254).

## Ratio of ELISA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMCs (GMR) against vaccine antigen 287-953.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) GMR to baseline at one month after second vaccination, against vaccine antigen 287-953, was found to be slightly higher in Lot2\\_Siena (154) when compared to Lot1\\_Rosia (115), but the GMRs for each lot had overlapping 95% CIs (Table 26).

Immune response at two weeks after second vaccination: Human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) GMT, the ratio of hSBA post-vaccination to prevaccination GMTs (GMR), and the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254).

In general, there was a decline in hSBA GMT levels and GMRs measured at one month after the second vaccination when compared to the respective titer levels and GMRs measured at two weeks after the second vaccination, for all three reference strains and for both Lot1\\_Rosia and Lot2\\_Siena.

At two weeks and one month after the second vaccination, all subjects (100%) receiving Lot1\\_Rosia and Lot2\\_Siena attained hSBA levels ≥1:5, against N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains H44/76 and 5/99. However against reference strain NZ98/254, for both lots, the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 was higher at two weeks compared to one month after vaccination (96% and 84% at 2 weeks post vaccination vs. 80% and 64% one month after vaccination, for Lot2\\_Siena and Lot1\\_Rosia, respectively.

In general, for both lots, there was a decline in ELISA GMC levels and GMRs against vaccine antigen 287-953 measured at one month after second vaccination when compared to the levels measured at two weeks after the second vaccination

Assessor´s comment: the primary objective was met and similarity between lots 1 and 2 was demonstrated. Levels of GMTs and GMCs were comparable to those of other studies. A decrease in GMTs and GMCs was demonstrated between the time points two weeks after second vaccination and one month after second vaccination. This was not unexpected. No European centers were included in the study, the lack of data from European adolescents was discussed during initial assessment, and it was concluded that the applicant should provide data on adolescent in the EU. The data presented from this study gives no reason for concern regarding immunogenicity of vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ.

## · Safety results

An overview of subjects with adverse events is provided in table 2-9 and numbers of subjects with local and systemic reactions, by vaccination, are summarized in tables 2-10 and 2-11, respectively. One subject from Lot2\\_Siena (51/013) withdrew from the study on day 34 due to an adverse event of infectious mononucleosis that started on day 14, with moderate severity and was judged as unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator

Note: The number (N) in the header is the total number of subjects at risk for systemic or other reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, percentages of subjects who reported with solicited systemic reaction appeared to be slightly higher in Lot2\\_Siena when compared to Lot1\\_Rosia. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction after any vaccination was myalgia, reported in 59% of subjects in Lot1\\_Rosia and 68% of subjects in Lot2\\_Siena. The majority of the solicited local reactions reported were of mild to moderate intensity. Severe intensity of pain was reported in 14% of subjects in Lot1\\_Rosia and 17% of subjects from Lot2\\_Siena. Fever (≥ 38°C) was an uncommon symptom, reported in 5% of subjects in Lot 1\\_Rosia and 3% of subjects in Lot 2\\_Siena.

.

Assessor's comment: Although systemic adverse reactions appeared to be more common in Lot2\\_Siena, the clinical relevance of this is unclear. Apart from this the data from the two groups were similar and the safety results presented in this study are in agreement with previously presented results. No new safety concerns are raised based on this study.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The submitted studies were intended to explore aspects of persistence of immunogenicity and safety following different vaccination schedules in children aged up to 60 months of age as well as the similarity in immunogenicity and safety profile between two lots of vaccine with OMV produced at different sites in adolescents aged 11 to 17 years. The results of the studies generally confirm what is already known regarding immunogenicity and safety of Bexsero, although there is an apparent inconsistency in the results as described in the comments above. This should be clarified. Therefore no further regulatory action regarding Bexsero is required based on the presented results.

## IV. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED

1. Study V72\\_41: There are apparent inconsistencies in tables 2-5 and 11.4.1.2-3. : It is unclear how the GMT for the total population can be higher than the GMTs for each group for strain 44/76-SL at one month after the 2 nd vaccination, and lower for the total population for strain 5/99 than in each for the groups. This should be clarified.

Post-script: The requested clarification was submitted in August 2014; the submission is considered fulfilled (see also comment at page 31 of this report).
