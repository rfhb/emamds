Medicinal product no longer authorised For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder and solvent for solution for injection. The powder is white to off-white. The solvent is a clear colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rilonacept Regeneron is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) with severe symptoms, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children aged 12 years and older. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a specialist physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of CAPS. After proper training in the correct injection technique, patients may self-inject Rilonacept Regeneron if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. Posology Adults

## Paediatric population (12 to 17 years old)

Treatment should be initiated with a loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 320 mg. Dosing should be continued with a once-weekly injection of 2.2 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 160 mg (see Table 1).  Dosing in children must be adjusted as the child grows. The patient or care giver should be advised to speak to the treating physician before adjusting the dose. The experience in children is limited. In the clinical program for CAPS, 8 adolescents aged 12-17 were treated for up to 18 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population (up to 12 years old)

No data are available on the use of Rilonacept Regeneron in children with CAPS under 12 years of age, therefore it is not recommended in this paediatric age group.

## Elderly (65 years old or older)

Available data indicate that dose modification is not required based on advanced age. However, clinical experience in patients above 65 years is limited, therefore caution is recommended (see section 5.1).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or end stage renal disease. However, clinical experience in such patients is limited.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Hepatic impairment Rilonacept Regeneron has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Method of administration Rilonacept Regeneron is for subcutaneous use only.  It is not intended for intravenous or intramuscular use. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The adult loading dose should be administered as two 2 ml subcutaneous injections (320 mg of rilonacept in total) given on the same day at different sites. The subsequent doses are administered as a 2 ml (160 mg of rilonacept) subcutaneous injection once a week. For paediatric patients, the dose is delivered as one or two (for loading dose) subcutaneous injections with a maximum single-injection volume of 2 ml. For convenience, the corresponding dose volume for weekly injection in paediatric patients is presented in Table 1 below.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to rilonacept or to any of the excipients. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Serious infections

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious, life-threatening infections have been reported uncommonly in patients taking Rilonacept Regeneron.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In an open-label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died. Rilonacept Regeneron should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection (see section 4.3) and physicians should exercise caution when administering Rilonacept Regeneron to patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections. Because Rilonacept Regeneron dampens an inflammatory response, vigilance in excluding underlying infection in unwell patients is required. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is unknown whether the use of IL-1 inhibitors like rilonacept increases the risk of reactivation of TB or of opportunistic infections.  Before starting treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron, all patients should be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis. Combinations not recommended The combination of Rilonacept Regeneron with TNF inhibitors has not been evaluated in clinical studies. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 inhibitor, in combination with a TNF inhibitor. Rilonacept Regeneron should not be used with TNF inhibitors because of increased risk of serious infections (see section 4.5). The concomitant use of Rilonacept Regeneron with other IL-1 inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). Hypersensitivity Although hypersensitivity reactions related to treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron were not seen in the initial clinical program, if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration should be stopped immediately and permanently, and appropriate therapy initiated.

The risk for severe hypersensitivity reactions, which is not uncommon for injectable proteins, cannot be excluded (see section 4.3).

## Immunogenicity

Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in 35% of patients (19 out of 55) treated for at least 6 weeks in the clinical study. There was no correlation of antibody activity with either clinical efficacy or safety.

## Neutropenia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1.5 x 10 9 /l) has been observed commonly with another medicinal product that inhibits IL-1 used in a patient population (rheumatoid arthritis) other than CAPS. Neutropenia was observed commonly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (not an approved use) who were administered Rilonacept Regeneron subcutaneously in clinical studies.  None of these patients had serious infections associated with the neutropenia. Although neutropenia was observed uncommonly in CAPS patients, the numbers studied are small. Treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia. It is recommended that neutrophil counts be assessed prior to initiating treatment, after 1 to 2 months, and periodically thereafter while receiving Rilonacept Regeneron. If a patient becomes neutropenic the ANC should be monitored closely and treatment discontinuation should be considered.

<!-- image -->

The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g. warfarin). Upon initiation of Rilonacept Regeneron, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or plasma levels should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted as needed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Malignancies The impact of treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron on the development of malignancies is not known. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including Rilonacept Regeneron, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. Vaccines Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Rilonacept Regeneron (see section 4.5). Prior to initiation of Rilonacept Regeneron therapy, adult and paediatric patients should receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. Lipid profile changes Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted (see section 4.8). Mutation in NLRP3 gene All cases in the clinical trials had a confirmed mutation in the NLRP3 gene. The efficacy was not evaluated in patients without a confirmed NLRP3 gene mutation. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. The concomitant administration of Rilonacept Regeneron with any TNF inhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.4), because an increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. The concomitant administration of Rilonacept Regeneron with other IL-1 inhibitors has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.

No data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Rilonacept Regeneron. Therefore, live vaccines should not be given

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concurrently with Rilonacept Regeneron, unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Should vaccination with live vaccines be indicated after initiation of Rilonacept Regeneron treatment, the recommendation is to wait for at least 6 weeks after the last Rilonacept Regeneron injection and before the next one (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from use of rilonacept in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted in animals and have shown no effects on fertility or foetal morphology; however a study in pregnant monkeys showed reduced levels of oestrogen (see section 5.3). The risk for the foetus/mother is unknown. Women should use effective contraceptives during treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron and for up to 6 weeks after the last dose. Women who are pregnant or who desire to become pregnant should therefore only be treated after a thorough benefit-risk evaluation.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Breast-feeding It is unknown whether rilonacept is excreted in human or animal breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Rilonacept Regeneron should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Rilonacept Regeneron therapy to the woman. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some symptoms associated with CAPS. Patients who experience vertigo during Rilonacept Regeneron treatment should wait for this to resolve completely before driving or operating machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects The majority of the related adverse events in the clinical trials were classified as injection site reactions, experienced by approximately 50% of the patients in the Phase 3 study.  Reported ISRs were generally mild to moderate in severity.  No patients withdrew from the study due to ISRs. ADRs to Rilonacept Regeneron reported during  the Phase 2/3 program in a total of 109 patients, some treated for longer than 2 years, are listed below using the following categories of frequency: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1000 to &lt;1/100). Due to the small patient population, an ADR reported in 2 or more patients is classified as 'common.'

Table 2: Adverse reactions with Rilonacept Regeneron in CAPS patients

Medicinal product no longer authorised Infections and infestations During Part A of the pivotal study (see section 5.1), the incidence of patients reporting infections and considered by the investigator as related to treatment was greater with Rilonacept Regeneron (9%) than with placebo (0%). In Part B, randomised withdrawal, the incidence of infections were similar in the Rilonacept Regeneron (0%) and the placebo patients (4%). Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. In placebo-controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 336 patients treated with rilonacept and 165 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 6.8% and 3% (0.44 per patient-exposure year and 0.19 per patient-exposure year), respectively, for rilonacept and placebo. Serious infections One patient in an open-label study of CAPS died after developing sinusitis and bacterial ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ) meningitis.

In a study in patients with adult Still's disease, one patient developed an infection in his elbow with Mycobacterium intracellulare after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection and subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria. In a study in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, one patient developed bronchitis and sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization.

## Blood and lymphatic system disorder

During the initial placebo-controlled portion of the pivotal trial, mean values increased for haemoglobin and decreased for neutrophils and platelets in the patients treated with Rilonacept Regeneron. These

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

changes were not deemed as clinically significant and were potentially due to a decrease in the chronic inflammatory state present in CAPS with an attendant decrease in acute-phase response.

## General disorders and administration site conditions

In patients with CAPS, the most common and consistently reported adverse event associated with treatment was injection-site reaction (ISR). The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, and bruising. Most ISRs lasted for one to two days. In studies of patients with CAPS, no ISRs were assessed as severe, and no patient discontinued study participation due to an ISR.

## Immunogenicity

Medicinal product no longer authorised Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with Rilonacept Regeneron in clinical studies. Nineteen of 55 patients (35%) who had received Rilonacept Regeneron for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies on at least one occasion.  Of the 19 patients, 7 tested positive at the last assessment (Week 18 or 24 of the open-label extension period), and 5 patients tested positive for neutralising antibodies on at least one occasion.  There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical efficacy or safety. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to rilonacept in specific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, sample handling, concomitant medicinal products, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Changes in lipid parameters Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Patients with CAPS treated with Rilonacept Regeneron experienced mean increases from baseline for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 19 mg/dl, 2 mg/dl, 10 mg/dl, and 57 mg/dl respectively after 6 weeks of open-label therapy. Physicians should monitor the lipid profiles of their patients (for example after 2-3 months) and consider lipid-lowering therapies as needed based upon cardiovascular risk factors and current guidelines. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. The maximum amount of product that can be safely administered has not been determined.

<!-- image -->

Intravenous administration of Rilonacept Regeneron at doses of up to 2000 mg monthly in another patient population for up to six months was generally well-tolerated. One patient in a study of osteoarthritis developed transient neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1 x 10 9 /l) after receiving a very large dose (2000 mg). Maximum weekly doses of up to 320 mg have been administered subcutaneously for up to approximately 2 years or more in a small number of patients with CAPS and up to 6 months in patients with RA in clinical studies without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.

In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC04.

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'Exceptional Circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The EMA will review any new information, which may become available every year, and this SPC will be updated as necessary.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Mechanism of action Rilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the ligand-binding domains of the extracellular portions of the human type I interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RI) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) linked in-line to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept binds to and blocks the activity of the cytokine IL-1 and binds both IL-1 β and IL-1 α , which are the primary pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Rilonacept also binds the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) but with a lower affinity than IL-1 β or IL-1 α . Pharmacodynamic effects In clinical studies, CAPS patients who have uncontrolled over-production of IL-1 β show a rapid response to therapy with rilonacept, i.e. laboratory parameters such as  C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, leukocytosis, and high platelet count rapidly returned to normal. Clinical efficacy and safety The safety and efficacy of rilonacept for the treatment of CAPS, including patients with FCAS, also known as familial cold urticaria syndrome (FCUS), and MWS was demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two parts (A and B) conducted sequentially in the same patients. The efficacy portion of the study included 47 patients, 44 of whom had a diagnosis of FCAS and 3 with a diagnosis of MWS.  Twelve additional patients enrolled during the open label extension in which efficacy data were collected, 8 adults with a diagnosis of FCAS and 4 adolescents (13-16 years old), 3 with FCAS and 1 with FCAS/MWS overlap. Four additional adolescents (12-17 years) all with a diagnosis of FCAS subsequently enrolled in the open label extension where efficacy assessments were not collected. The efficacy was not evaluated in patients without a confirmed NLRP3/CIAS1 gene mutation. Part A was a 6-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled period to evaluate rilonacept at a dose of 160 mg weekly after an initial loading dose of 320 mg. Immediately after Part A patients entered Part B which consisted of a 9-week, patient-blind period during which all patients received rilonacept 160 mg weekly, followed by a 9-week, double-blind, randomised withdrawal period in which patients were randomly assigned to either remain on rilonacept 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. Patients were then given the option to enroll in a 24-week, open-label treatment extension phase during which all patients were treated with rilonacept 160 mg weekly.

Using a daily diary questionnaire, patients rated the following five signs and symptoms of CAPS: joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue, each on a scale of 0 (none, no severity) to 10 (very severe). The study evaluated the mean symptom score using the change from baseline to the end of treatment.

The changes in mean symptom scores for the randomised parallel-group period (Part A) and the randomised withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 3. Patients treated with rilonacept

experienced an 84% reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to 13% for placebo-treated patients (p&lt; 0.0001). In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patients withdrawn to placebo compared to patients who remained on rilonacept.

Improvement in key symptom scores was noted within one day of initiation of rilonacept therapy in most patients. Patients treated with rilonacept experienced more improvement in each of the five components of the composite endpoint than placebo-treated patients.

The mean number of symptomatic 'flare' days (defined as a day in which the mean symptom score reported on the patient diary was greater than 3) during the 21-day pre-treatment baseline period and the on-treatment endpoint period, in Part A, decreased from 8.6 at baseline to 0.1 at endpoint for the group on rilonacept, compared to a change from 6.2 to 5.0 for the placebo group (p&lt;0.0001 vs. placebo).

Medicinal product no longer authorised A significantly higher proportion of patients in the rilonacept group compared to the placebo group experienced improvement from baseline in the composite score by at least 30% (96% vs. 29% of patients), by at least 50% (87% vs. 8%) and by at least 75% (70% vs. 0%) (p&lt;0.0001). In Part A and Part B, physician's and patient's global assessment of disease activity and patients' assessment of the degree of limitation of their daily activities due to their disease were significantly improved for patients treated with rilonacept compared with those on placebo. Mean levels of C reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased versus baseline for the rilonacepttreated patients, while there was no change for those on placebo. Rilonacept also led to a significant decrease in serum amyloid A (SAA) versus baseline to levels within the normal range. During the open-label extension, reductions in mean symptom scores, serum CRP, and serum SAA levels were maintained for up to one year. Table 3:  Mean Symptom Scores in Adults (age 18 and older)

Medicinal product no longer authorised 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Bioavailability of rilonacept after a subcutaneous injection is estimated to be approximately 50%. The average trough levels of rilonacept were approximately 24 µg/ml at steady state following weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 48 weeks in patients with CAPS. The steady state appeared to be reached by 6 weeks. Table 5: Rilonacept steady-state pharmacokinetic properties 1

## Special populations

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment. As with other large proteins elimination of rilonacept is expected to be via proteolytic catabolism and target mediated clearance. Consequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of rilonacept in a clinically significant way.

Results of a single-dose study in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) indicate that the rate of elimination of rilonacept was not decreased. Renal elimination of rilonacept is therefore considered to be a minor pathway for clearance. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment.

Medicinal product no longer authorised No study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, gender, or body weight on rilonacept exposure. Based on limited data obtained from the clinical study, steady-state trough concentrations were similar between male and female patients. Age (26-78 years old) and body weight (50-120 kg) did not appear to have a significant effect on trough rilonacept concentrations. The effect of race could not be assessed because only Caucasian patients participated in the clinical studies in CAPS, reflecting the epidemiology of the disease. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and repeated-dose toxicity. Animal studies were conducted to assess reproductive toxicity. In mice, a murine analogue of rilonacept had no effect on fertility. A study of embryo-foetal development was conducted with rilonacept in monkeys at doses up to approximately 4 times the human dose. Decreases in β -estradiol levels were seen in the treated groups, the significance of this finding is unknown. In a prenatal and postnatal reproductive toxicology study in which mice were dosed subcutaneously, with a murine analogue of rilonacept at doses of 20, 100 or 200 mg/kg three times per week (the highest dose is approximately 6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area), there were no treatment-related effects. Genotoxicity or long term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of rilonacept. 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients

Medicinal product no longer authorised Diluted solution From a microbiological safety point of view, the product should be used as soon as possible but within 3 hours of reconstitution, because it does not contain a preservative. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C. 6.4 Special precautions for storage Store in a refrigerator. Do not freeze. Keep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light. For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 6.5 Nature and contents of container Powder vial 20 ml clear type I glass vial with  rubber stopper and lacquered flip-off aluminium seal containing 220 mg rilonacept. Solvent vial LDPE vials containing 5 ml water for injections Each pack contains: 4 vials of powder for solution for injection 4 vials of solvent 8 disposable 3 ml syringes 8 disposable 27 gauge, ½-inch needles 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Using aseptic technique, Rilonacept Regeneron powder should be reconstituted with 2.3 ml of solvent (water for injections) prior to administration.

The 2.3 ml of solvent should be withdrawn from the solvent vial attached directly to a 3 ml syringe and then injected into the powder vial for reconstitution using the 27 gauge, ½-inch needle (to obtain a final reconstitution volume of 2.75 ml). The needle and syringe used for reconstitution with solvent should then be discarded and should not be used for subcutaneous injections. After the addition of solvent, the vial contents should be reconstituted by shaking the vial for approximately one minute and then allowing it to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sit for one minute. The resulting 80 mg/ml solution is sufficient to allow a withdrawable volume of up to 2 ml for subcutaneous administration.

The reconstituted solution is viscous, clear and colourless to pale yellow. Prior to injection, the reconstituted solution should be carefully inspected for any discolouration or particulate matter. If there is discolouration or particulate matter in the solution, the product must not be used.

## Instructions for administration

Using aseptic technique, the recommended dose volume, up to 2 ml (160 mg) of the solution, should be withdrawn with a new 27 gauge, ½-inch injection needle attached to a new 3 ml syringe for subcutaneous injection.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Sites for subcutaneous injection, such as the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, should be rotated.

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Rilonacept Regeneron is and what it is used for Rilonacept Regeneron is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with severe symptoms of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS). Rilonacept Regeneron belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin inhibitors. Rilonacept Regeneron blocks the activity of substances including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). In patients with CAPS, the body produces excessive amounts of IL-1 beta. This may lead to symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Rilonacept Regeneron leads to an improvement in these symptoms. If you have any questions about how Rilonacept Regeneron works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10. Hold the syringe and needle in your hand ready for injecting. Do not touch the needle with your hands or allow it to come into contact with any surfaces. Proceed with the injection as described in Step 6 below.

## STEP 6: Giving the injection

1. Rilonacept Regeneron is injected into the tissue directly below the layers of skin. It is not meant to go into any muscle, vein, or artery.

## Where to inject

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised Inject in a different place each time in order to keep your skin healthy. Changing injection sites helps to prevent irritation and allows the medicine to be better absorbed. Ask your doctor any questions that you have about rotating injection sites. · Do not inject into skin that is tender, red, or hard. If an area is tender or feels hardened, choose another site for injection until the tenderness or 'hardening' goes away. · Tell your doctor about any skin reactions including redness, swelling, or hardening of the skin. · Areas where you may inject Rilonacept Regeneron include the left and right sides of the abdomen, and left and right thighs. If someone else is giving you the injection, the upper arms may also be used for injection (see Figure 12): (Do not inject within a 5-cm area around the navel.)

Figure 12

2. Choose the area for the injection. Clean the area in a circular motion with a new alcohol wipe. Begin at the centre of the site and move outward. Let the alcohol air dry completely. Do not touch this area again before injecting.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Hold the syringe in one hand like you would hold a pencil.
4. With the other hand gently pinch a fold of skin around the site that you cleaned for injection.
5. Use a quick 'dart like' motion to insert the needle straight into the skin (90° angle) (see Figure 13a). Do not push down on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin. For small children or persons with little fat under the skin, you may need to hold the syringe and needle at a 45° angle (see Figure 13b).
6. After the needle is completely in the skin, let go of the skin that you are pinching.
7. With your free hand hold the syringe near its base. Gently pull back the plunger. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. Remove the needle, discard the syringe and needle. Start over with 'STEP 1: Setting up for an injection' using new supplies.

Figure 13b (Small Children, Thin Patients)

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8. If no blood appears, inject all the medicine in the syringe at a slow, steady rate, pushing the plunger all the way down. It may take up to 30 seconds to inject the entire dose.
9. Pull the needle out of the skin, and hold a piece of sterile gauze over the injection site for several seconds.
10. Do not replace the needle cover. Throw away the vials, used syringes and needles in the punctureresistant container. Do not recycle the container. Do not throw away vials, needles, or syringes in the household rubbish.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised 11. Keep the puncture-resistant container out of reach of children. When the container is about twothirds full, dispose of it as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. 12. Used alcohol wipes can be thrown away in the household rubbish.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only and is provided as a tear-off leaflet:

## Indication

Rilonacept Regeneron is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) with severe symptoms, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children aged 12 years and older.

<!-- image -->

Rilonacept Regeneron is for subcutaneous use only. It is not intended for intravenous or intramuscular use.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Posology Adults Treatment in adults should be initiated with a loading dose of 320 mg. Dosing should be continued with a once-weekly injection of 160 mg. Rilonacept Regeneron should not be given more often than once weekly. Paediatric population (12 to 17 years old) Treatment should be initiated with a loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 320 mg. Dosing should be continued with a once-weekly injection of 2.2 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 160 mg (see Table 1). Dosing in children must be adjusted as the child grows. The patient or care giver should be advised to speak to the treating physician before adjusting the dose. The experience in children is limited. In the clinical program for CAPS, 8 adolescents aged 12-17 were treated for up to 18 months. Paediatric population (up to 12 years old) No data are available on the use of Rilonacept Regeneron in children with CAPS under 12 years of age, therefore it is not recommended in this paediatric age group. Elderly (65 years old or older) Available data indicate that dose modification is not required based on advanced age. However, clinical experience in patients above 65 years is limited, therefore caution is recommended. Renal impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, or end stage renal disease. However, clinical experience in such patients is limited. Hepatic impairment Rilonacept Regeneron has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Method of administration

The adult loading dose should be administered as two 2 ml subcutaneous injections (320 mg of rilonacept in total) given on the same day at different sites.  The subsequent doses are administered as a 2 ml (160 mg of rilonacept) subcutaneous injection once a week.

For paediatric patients, the dose is delivered as one or two (for loading dose) subcutaneous injections with a maximum single-injection volume of 2 ml.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For convenience, the corresponding dose volume for weekly injection in paediatric patients is presented in Table 1 below.

<!-- image -->

Table 1:  Rilonacept Regeneron dose volume (after reconstitution) by body weight for paediatric patients, aged 12-17 years

| Weight range (kg)   |   Dose volume (ml) |

| 45.5 to 49.0        |                1.3 |
| 49.1 to 52.6        |                1.4 |
| 52.7 to 56.3        |                1.5 |
| 56.4 to 59.9        |                1.6 |
| 60.0 to 63.5        |                1.7 |
| 63.6 to 67.2        |                1.8 |
| 67.3 to 70.8        |                1.9 |
| 70.9 or greater     |                2   |

The 2.3 ml of solvent should be withdrawn from the solvent vial attached directly to a 3-ml syringe and then injected into the powder vial for reconstitution with 27-gauge, ½-inch needle (to obtain a final reconstitution volume of 2.75 ml). The needle and syringe used for reconstitution with solvent should then be discarded and should not be used for subcutaneous injections. After the addition of solvent, the vial contents should be reconstituted by shaking the vial for approximately one minute and then allowing it to sit for one minute. The resulting 80 mg/ml solution is sufficient to allow a withdrawable volume of up to 2 ml for subcutaneous administration.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Special precautions for storage Store in a refrigerator. Do not freeze. Keep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light. After reconstitution, if necessary the product may be kept at room temperature, but should be used within three hours of reconstitution because it does not contain a preservative. Reconstitution and administration instructions Instructions for reconstitution Using aseptic technique, Rilonacept Regeneron powder should be reconstituted with 2.3 ml solvent (water for injections) prior to administration.

The reconstituted solution is viscous, clear and colourless to pale yellow. Prior to injection, the reconstituted solution should be carefully inspected for any discolouration or particulate matter. If there is discolouration or particulate matter in the solution, the product must not be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Instructions for administration

Using aseptic technique, the recommended dose volume, up to 2 ml (160 mg) of the solution should be withdrawn with a new 27-gauge, ½-inch injection needle attached to a new 3-ml syringe for subcutaneous injection.

Sites for subcutaneous injection, such as the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, should be rotated. Injections should never be made at sites that are bruised, red, tender, or hard.

The initial administration of Rilonacept Regeneron by a patient or caregiver should be under the guidance of a trained healthcare professional. For subsequent self-administration by patients, appropriate instruction in proper injection technique should be provided and ability to apply that technique ascertained.
