## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Lamivudine/Zidovudine TEVA 150/300 mg, film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product containing lamivudine and Zidovudine as active substances. The product is intended for the treatment of HIV infection. For this application, the reference medicinal product is Combivir.

The film-coated tablets are packed in OPA/Alu/PVC Aluminium blisters or HDPE tablet-containers with polyethylene child resistant screw cap with induction seal.

Lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside analogues which have activity against HIV. Both medicinal products are metabolised intracellularly to their active moieties, lamivudine 5'-triphosphate (TP) and zidovudine 5'-TP respectively.  Their main modes of action are as chain terminators of viral reverse transcription. Lamivudine-TP and zidovudine-TP have selective inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in vitro; lamivudine is also active against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV. Lamivudine in combination with zidovudine exhibits synergistic anti-HIV activity against clinical isolates in cell culture. The safety and efficacy profile of lamivudine and zidovudine for the treatment of HIV infection has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR of the reference medicinal product. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of these active substances. Since this application is generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Combivir, the pivotal basis is the demonstration of bioequivalence. The indication proposed for Lamivudine/Zidovudine TEVA is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product, which is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The product is presented as scored film-coated tablets containing 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of zidovudine as active substances. Other ingredients are: Tablet core: Microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), sodium stearyl fumerate Tablet coat: Hypromellose, hypromellose, polysorbate 80, macrogol 400, titanium dioxide E171 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

## Lamivudine

The active substance lamivudine is described in the Ph. Eur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lamivudine is a white or almost white powder that is soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol and slightly soluble in ethanol. Its chemical name is 4-amino-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl]-1,3oxathiolan-5-yl]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one hydrate (5:1). Lamivudine possesses two asymmetric carbons and is expected to be optically active. Lamivudine exists in two polymorphic forms and are controlled during manufacture.

The information on the manufacturing process is provided in an ASMF. Two different manufacturing processes are presented. Lamivudine is controlled by the manufacturers according to the Ph Eur monograph with additional tests which concern technical properties of the active substance The specifications of the drug substance include appearance (Ph Eur), identification (specific optical rotation, IR, enantiomeric purity), absorbance, related substance (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), heavy metals, water content (Karl Fischer), sulphated ash, assay, residual solvents (GC), particle size, bulk density (Ph Eur) and tapped density (Ph Eur). The analytical methods and the specifications used for control of active substance are the same as in the Ph Eur monograph except loss on drying (water content instead). Batch analysis data (n=2) of the active substance is provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

The information on the two different manufacturing processes proposed is provided in an ASMF. In addition to the tests detailed in zidovudine Ph. Eur. monograph, tests for particle size distribution, density, residual solvents and microbial testing are performed. The specifications of the drug substance include appearance (Ph Eur), identification (IR), appearance of solution, specific optical rotation, related substances (TLC, HPLC), heavy metals, loss on drying, sulphated ash, assay, residual solvents (GC), particle size distribution, bulk density, tapped density and microbiological quality (Ph Eur). The analytical methods used for control of active substance are methods described in the Ph Eur. Batch analysis data (n=3) of the active substance is provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

Stability studies were carried out on 7 batches of lamivudine obtained with the two manufacturing processes applied for (4 batches and 3 batches). Up to 18 months under ICH long-term conditions (30°C/65% RH) for and 6 months under ICH accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) were provided. The stability samples were stored in a mini-size simulation of the original packing. Parameters tested during stability studies were character, identification (IR), polymorph identity (XRPD), related substances (HPLC), water content and assay. Forced degradation was studied under different stress conditions: treatment with heat, treatment with light (UV light and visible light), acidic conditions, alkaline conditions, and hydrolysis conditions. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored in the original packaging material. Zidovudine The active substance zidovudine is described in the Ph. Eur. Zidovudine is a white or brownish powder that is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in anhydrous in ethanol. Its chemical name is 1-(3-azido-2, 3-dideoxy-ß-Derythro- pentofuranosyl)-5methylpyrimidine-2, 4(1H, 3H)-dione. Zidovudine possesses one asymmetric carbon and is expected to be optically active. Zidovudine shows polymorphism. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The stability studies were carried out for zidovudine on 6 batches at long-term conditions (30°C/65% RH) for up to 48 months and at accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) for 6 months. The stability samples were stored in a mini-size simulation of the original packing. Parameters tested during

stability studies are description, identification by IR, specific optical rotation, water content, related substance by TLC and HPLC and assay. Forced degradation was studied under different stress conditions: treatment with heat, treatment with light (UV light and visible light), acidic conditions, alkaline conditions, and hydrolysis conditions. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 2,  any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored in the original packaging material.

Lamivudine-Zidovudine tablets do not contain ingredients derived from animals. TSE/BSE statements from each supplier were provided.

2.2.3. Medicinal Product Pharmaceutical Development The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain immediate-release scored tablets containing qualitatively and quantitatively the same active substance as the reference medicinal product and exhibiting the same bioavailability. Dissolution studies were performed in order to demonstrate equivalence between the reference medicinal product and the generic with regard to lamivudine and zidovudine release, and as discriminating tests in order to select suitable formulations. The choice of dissolution conditions was well demonstrated. Lamivudine and Zidovudine can be classified as a Class 3 drug according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). These active substances are characterized by a high solubility and a low permeability and in these cases the dissolution is not ratelimiting step. Different manufacturing processes for the finished product (direct compression, low shear wet granulation and fluid bed granulation) were tested. Ultimately, a dry roller compaction process was chosen. The final formulation was selected where zidovudine, microcrystalline cellulose, and half of magnesium stearate in the formula were pre-blended, roller compacted and milled prior to incorporation of the rest of the ingredients. The excipients used in the formulation are tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), sodium stearyl fumarate, and tablet coating: hypromellose, hypromellose, polysorbate 80, macrogol 400, titanium dioxide E171. All the excipients are tested according to their current Ph. Eur. specification except the colorants which are tested as per in-house methods. The excipients selected are all standard and commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. Most of them are also present in the formulation of the innovator product. Therefore they are expected to be compatible. Tablets are packaged either with OPA/Alu/PVC Aluminium blisters or HDPE tablet-containers with polyethylene child resistant screw cap with induction seal. The choice of the primary packaging was justified by stability studies. Adventitious agents Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process is a standard compaction and direct compression. The manufacturing is divided into 9 main steps: initial blending, intermediate blending I, roller compaction, milling, intermediate blending II, final blending, compression, coating and packaging.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The process validation protocol provided is satisfactory.

The manufacturing process will be validated according to this protocol on three consecutive production batches before marketing and after any major change of the process or equipment used.

## Product Specification

The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for description, identification of active substance (UPLC, TLC), identification of Opadry colorants (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), subdivision of tablets (Ph Eur), dissolution of the active substances (UPLC), assay, impurities/degradation products (UPLC), microbiological quality (Ph Eur).

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

Batch analysis results (n = 5) confirms consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicates that the process is under control. Stability of the Product Stability studies were carried out on three pilot batches of non-scored tablets packed in the intended marketing primary packaging (blisters and HDPE tablet containers) stored at ICH long-term stability conditions (25°C/60%RH) for up 18 months, and at ICH accelerated stability conditions (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. Stability studies were also carried out on three pilot batches of scored tablets in the intended marketing primary packaging (blisters and HDPE tablet containers) stored at ICH long-term stability conditions (25°C/60%RH) for up 3 months, and at ICH accelerated stability conditions (40°C/75%RH) for up 1 month. In use stability studies were performed in HPDE tablet containers stored at 25°C/60%RH for up to 6 months. The following parameters were tested: description, assay, dissolution, impurities/degradation products, and microbiological quality. Additional stability studies were provided for one pilot batch of bulk tablets stored at 15-25°C max/70%RH. In general, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 3,  any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 2.2.4.

2.3. Non-Clinical aspects The non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is based on literature searches and adequate scientific literature has been provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The nonclinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. There is thus no need for conducting tests on animals. The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that the preclinical studies reviewed from the literature and the data presented on stability and comparative impurity profile (originated from the laboratories or affiliates of TEVA Pharmaceuticals Europe) had been conducted according to GLP standards. 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment The applicant provided a suitable justification for the absence of a formal environmental risk assessment, based on the expectation that the introduction of Lamivudine/Zidovudine Teva manufactured by Teva Pharma B.V. onto the market is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all lamivudine and zidovudine containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the CHMP endorsed that the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 2.4. Clinical Aspects 2.4.1. Introduction To support the marketing authorisation the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study. Study 20092018 investigated the relative bioavailability of 150/300 mg Lamivudine/zidovudine film coated tablets (Teva Pharmaceutical Works Private Limited Company Ltd.) with that of 150/300 mg Combivir, filmcoated tablets (GlaxoSmithKline, France) following a single oral dose (1 x 150/300 mg tablet) in healthy adult subjects when administered under fasting conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A clinical overview was provided summarising the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of lamivudine and zidovudine based on a literature search; this overview was considered adequate. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference medicinal product.

No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EPW/QWP/1401/98) in its current version as well as the Questions &amp; Answers on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of particular relevance.

## GCP

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two dosing sequences AB or BA (where treatment A is test product and treatment B is reference product) under fasting conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, Kel and Thalf were estimated based on plasma lamivudine and zidovudine levels for each subject included in the data set.

 Tabular overview of clinical studies 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics This application contains a generic version of lamivudine tablets. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lamivudine and zidovudine have been demonstrated for the reference product. With the exception of bioequivalence data, this application contains no new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lamivudine and zidovudine. The Applicant's clinical overview of the clinical pharmacology is considered sufficient.  Methods Study design The study was an open label, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover study conducted under fasting conditions with a wash out period of 7 days between administrations. 150/300 mg of lamivudine/zidovudine were administered in each period with 240 ml water after an overnight of at least 10 hours fasting period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

21 blood samples were collected pre-dosing and up to 36 h post-dosing (at 0 , 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 36 hours) in each period.

Concentrations of lamivudine were measured from the samples collected over a 36-hour period after dosing in each period. Concentrations of zidovudine were measured from the samples collected over an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8-hour interval after dosing in each period (at 0, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours).

Samples were assayed for lamivudine and zidovudine.

## Study period:

March 30, 2009 to May 30, 2009.

## Test and reference products

## Test product:

-  subject 36 was dismissed from the study at Period 2 check in due to non-compliance (consumed restricted item - grapefruit).

Lamivudine/zidovudine 150/300 mg film-coated tablets (TEVA Pharm. Works Private Ltd, Hungary). Mode of administration: 1 film-coated (=150/300 mg) administered with 240 ml of room temperature potable water. Batch number: 0190109. Manufacturing date: 01/2009. Reference product: Combivir 150/300 mg, film-coated tablets (Glaxo Smith Kline, France). Mode of administration: 1 film-coated (=300 mg) administered with 240 ml of room temperature potable water. Batch number: R327048. Expiry date: 09/2009. Population(s) studied Based on historical data available to the sponsor regarding the intra-individual variability of AUC and Cmax of lamivudine and zidovudine (35%) by oral route, the number of subjects to be included in an adequately powered study was estimated to be 58. Sixty-two healthy volunteers (i.e. 58 subjects + 4 extra subjects to account for dropouts) were randomised and enrolled into the study. Fifty-eighth volunteers completed the entire study and were thus analyzed. The study population included non-smoking male and female volunteers from 18 to 55 years of age, with a BMI from 19 to 30, who were judged to be healthy based on medical history, ECG, laboratory evaluation and physical examination. Classical inclusion and exclusion criteria were followed. The outcome of the study showed that a sufficient number of subjects was included in the study. Four subjects were dismissed (subjects 7, 27, 33 and 36) without impacting the study.  subject 07 voluntarily withdrew from the study prior to Period 2 check-in for personal reasons;  subject 27 voluntarily withdrew from the study prior to Period 2 check-in due to adverse events (coughing and feeling warm);  subject 33 voluntarily withdrew from the study prior to Period 2 check-in due to adverse events (pink eye, mucus discharge and extra tearing in both eyes); Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Analytical methods

## Lamivudine

Subjects' plasma concentrations of lamivudine were measured according to a liquid chromatographic (LC) tandem mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS) method which was developed, validated and further re-validated.

## Zidovudine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects' plasma concentrations of zidovudine were measured according to a liquid chromatographic (LC) tandem mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS) method.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

The relevant bioavailability parameters of lamivudine and zidovudine were estimated.

The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax and Tmax were either observed or calculated. AUC was calculated by the trapezoidal rule. Cmax and Tmax were directly estimated from the individual concentrations: time profiles.

Statistical methods GLM ANOVA was performed on the ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.  The ANOVA model included sequence, subject tested within sequence, period and product. Non-transformed Tmax was evaluated and tested using a non parametric test. The statistical analysis was performed using SAS software. Bioequivalence criteria: 90% geometric intervals of the ratio (Test/Reference) of least square means from the ln-transformed values for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax should be within 80-125%. Tmax was tested using a null hypothesis non parametric test.  Results The results of Pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in table 1. Table 1.

Classical inclusion and exclusion criteria were followed. Sixty-two subjects were dosed in period 1 and 58 subjects were dosed in period 2. Fifty-eight completed the study. They received either one Lamivudine/Zidovudine 150/300 mg tablet or one Combivir 150/300 mg tablet with 240 ml of room temperature potable water. The design of the study is considered adequate. The sampling period of 36 hours is sufficient to characterize the plasma concentration-time profile and to ensure measurements over a period of at least 5 half-lives based on the minimum expected t½ of 5 hours. Blood samples timing is appropriate to allow an accurate measurement of Tmax. The wash-out period of 7 days is long enough to avoid any carry over effect to the second period.

 Safety data No serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of this study. None of the adverse event had a significant impact on the safety of the subjects or on the integrity of the study results. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and the CHMP endorsed that no such studies are required for this application. 2.4.4. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.4.5. Discussion and Conclusion on Clinical aspects Lamivudine/Zidovudine TEVA is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. The efficacy and safety of lamivudine/zidovudine are well characterized. This generic application contains a clinical overview of the efficacy and safety of lamivudine/zidovudine (based on PUBMED search, extended to other sources of medicinal databases) and is considered sufficient. To support the marketing authorisation of Lamivudine/Zidovudine TEVA, the Applicant has conducted a single dose (1 x 150/300mg), randomized, two-sequence, two-period, two-treatment, cross-over, bioequivalence study under fasting conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Analytical methods were well validated. The statistical methods have been adequately described and are acceptable and there are no major protocol deviations. Blood collection times were sufficient.

Moreover during evaluation the Applicant submitted additional clarifications on the analytical part of the dossier:

-  The potency of the Test product and the Reference product in the bio-study: the assay content of the test and reference batch did not differ by more than 5%, which was considered acceptable.
-  The Applicant indicated that 51 samples for lamivudine and 9 samples for zidovudine were reanalyzed in accordance with the relevant SOP. The reason for reanalysis, the original value, the repeated value, the accepted value as well as the criteria of acceptance were deemed acceptable.

The CIs of the ratio Test/reference of AUC0-t and AUC0-inf parameters fell within the normal 80-125% acceptance range. Thus based on these parameters, the bioequivalence is considered demonstrated.

## 2.6. User consultation

2.5. Pharmacovigilance PSUR The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference medicinal product. Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market. Risk Management Plan The application is based on a reference medicinal product for which no safety concerns requiring additional risk minimization activities have been identified. Routine pharmacovigilance activities according to volume 9A/ICH will be undertaken whilst the product is on the market, including careful review of individual case safety reports, literature review, signal detection procedures and generation of the required safety reports. Specific risk minimisation activities are not envisaged as the safety aspects of the product are well characterised and therefore a Risk Minimisation Plan is not required. As the application is for a generic product of a reference medicinal product with a well-known safety profile, the Applicant did not consider necessary to establish a risk management plan containing other measures than routine pharmacovigilance. The CHMP agrees. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The user testing of the package leaflet was performed. The criterion for a successful Readability Test was fulfilled. The user testing of the package leaflet is judged acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.7. Benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality data. No new nonclinical data have been presented but an acceptable summary of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of lamivudine and zidovudine has been provided. This is considered acceptable. From a clinical perspective, an appropriate summary of publicly available information regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties as well as the clinical efficacy and safety profile of lamivudine and zidovudine for the treatment of HIV infection has been presented.

The pivotal basis of this application is a bioequivalence study conducted with a single dose in fasting state against a reference product. The overall study design as well as the bioanalytical methods was acceptable for this purpose. Based on the statistical analysis of the obtained pharmacokinetic data, bioequivalence between the test and the reference product can be concluded as the 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean plasma lamivudine/zidovudine AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax of the test to reference product were within the 80-125% range. Since the applicable criteria related to the manufacturing of the product as well as the pharmacokinetic properties are fulfilled, the bioequivalence can be considered demonstrated. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered that the benefit/risk ratio of Lamivudine/Zidovudine Teva as an antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
