## II A 2. CONTAINER

The  vials  used  for  both  the  liquid  and  freeze-dried  powder  are  colourless  Type  I  glass  vials,  in compliance  with  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  requirements  (3rd  Edition  3.2.1).    The  vials  for  the freeze-dried  powder  and  the  solvent  are  closed  with  a  butyl  elastomer  stopper.  The  stopper  is  in compliance with the European Pharmacopoeia requirements (3rd Edition 3.2.9).  Both vials are sealed with an aluminium cap with a hole in it. Vials are sterilised by dry heat. Stoppers are washed and silicone coated and sterilised by steam.

## II A 3. DEVELOPMENT

The Applicant has gained experience over the years from production of glycoprotein subunit herpes viruses for use in other species and is applying these techniques to production of Eurican Herpes 205. The  freeze-drying  substrate  is  that  used  in  the  other  freeze-dried  canine  vaccines  produced  by  the Applicant and the adjuvant is used in other herpes virus vaccines.

The vaccine strain used for production is one that was isolated in the US from a litter of pups that died from CHV infection.  The vaccine is prepared as a purified sub-unit vaccine to ensure its safety in pregnant bitches.  The glycoproteins that are contained in the vaccine are considered to be the main immunogenic  proteins  of  the  virus,  especially  the  gB  glycoprotein,  and  capable  of  inducing neutralising  antibodies.    References  are  provided  in  support  of  this  view.    Related  to  this,  the Applicant justifies the use of an ELISA test to quantify the gB glycoprotein as the batch potency test and presents the rationale for the protein content used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The production process is designed to eliminate small molecules, non-specific proteins and proteins not  involved  in  protection.  The  active  substance  is  a  CHV  antigen  fraction  enriched  with  the  viral envelope glycoproteins.

This product is recommended for use immediately after reconstitution and no studies of in-use shelflife were therefore required.

## II B DESCRIPTION OF METHOD OF PREPARATION OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT

## II.B.1 FORMULATION

The method of preparation of the active ingredient was presented.  The flow chart for production of the purified glycoprotein, that for production of the freeze-dried powder and that for production of the solvent were presented.

## II.B.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE STAGES OF MANUFACTURE

## Preparation of the active substance

The CHV is grown on MDCK cells. After clarification, it is inactivated. The inactivated virus is then concentrated, purified  and  dissociated.  The  capsids  are  removed  and  the  fraction  containing glycoproteins constitutes the active ingredient.

## II.B.3 TABLE OF BLENDING DETAILS

## 1. Freeze-dried powder containing the active ingredient

The  flow  chart  for  preparation  of  the  finished  vials  from  the  glycoprotein  suspension,  a  table  of blending and a description of the process were presented.

The quantity of bulk required to give 1.0 µ g gB per 1 ml dose is calculated. The antigen is added to the preparation vessel and held, with stirring at 5 ± 3 0 C.

An  appropriate  volume  of  freeze-drying  substrate  is  mixed  with  sufficient  saline  to  make  up  the volume of the final bulk.

## 2. Solvent (adjuvant)

The aqueous phase consists of saline solution and this is added to the preparation vessel to give 0.67 ml per 1 ml volume of bulk solvent.  The oily phase is prepared to give 0.33 ml per 1 ml volume of bulk solvent.  It consists of light paraffin oil and appropriate excipient.

## II.B.4 VALIDATION STUDY RESULTS

## 1.  Inactivation kinetics

Satisfactory studies and information were provided.

## 2.  Sensitivity of the detection system

Satisfactory studies were provided.

## 3. Consistency of production

Certificates were presented which show the results from the control tests applied to three batches of CHV glycoprotein.  These batches were shown to be within the specification proposed.

## b) Components of the finished product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Information was provided on the blending of three batches of freeze-dried component from the three batches  of  active  ingredient  and  also  from  blending  three  batches  of  solvent.    The  information indicated that the blending was consistent with the method of blending described.

c) Validation data for the purification steps applied and for the dissociation and centrifugation steps Satisfactory information was submitted.  It is considered that the results presented demonstrate this reproducibility.

## II C CONTROL OF STARTING MATERIALS

## II.C.1 STARTING MATERIALS LISTED IN A PHARMACOPOEIA

A list of starting materials complying with a pharmacopoeia was given, together with information on their use(s) in production and a reference to the page in the dossier where this use is mentioned. For each substance, a copy of the relevant monograph with which the substance is said to comply and a certificate of analysis for a batch, were provided.

## II.C.2 NOT LISTED IN A PHARMACOPOEIA

## II.C.2.a Biological Origin

## A. Seed materials

A number of techniques have been used and different approaches have been taken at different times to test the seed materials for extraneous agents.

1. Madin-Darby Kidney cell line.

## Master cell seed

The canine kidney cell line (MDCK) comes from a culture of canine kidney cells established in 1958. Tests  conducted  include:  a)  General  microscopy,  b)  Bacterial  and  fungal  sterility,  c)  Mycoplasma sterility, d) Extraneous viruses, e) Identification of the species, f) Karyology and g) Tumorigenicity and Oncogenicity.

A commitment with regard to sterility testing was made.

## CELLS AT THE HIGHEST PASSAGE FOR PRODUCTION

Information  was  included,  where  relevant,  with  the  results  of  the  MCS  testing.    The  certificate  of results for the testing of the MCS + 20 was presented.  Confirmation was provided that the cells of the MCS + 20 passages and the batch of the WCS had the same microscopical appearance as the MCS.

## Working Cell Seed (WCSs)

The WCSs are tested for a range of characteristics and extraneous agents in compliance with the EU Table  of  extraneous  agents  and  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  monograph  0062,  Vaccines  for Veterinary Use.

The certificate of results for testing a batch of WCS was presented.

A commitment with regard to sterility testing was made.

## 2. Canine Herpes Virus

## Master Seed Virus

Details of the Master Seed Virus (MSV) were provided. The initial strain of canine herpesvirus type 1 was isolated from a litter of pups which died from CHV infection.

## Working Seed Virus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each batch of WSV is tested for a range of characteristics and extraneous agents. Conclusions

The tests on the MSV and the batch of the WSV have been conducted in a satisfactory manner and meet all the requirements specified in Council Directive 81/852/EEC and relevant guidelines.

## B. Substances of animal origin produced on a batch basis

All the substances of animal origin are produced on a batch basis.  They are all subjected to treatment and testing.

It  can  be  concluded  from  the  submitted  information  that  the  Applicant's  proposals  for  testing substances and treating can be accepted. Concerning BSE, it is accepted that sufficient information and  reassurances  have  been  obtained  on  the  sources.    Compliance  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human  and Veterinary Medicinal Products has been demonstrated.

The  microcarriers  used  in  production  are  made  from  a  thin  layer  of  denatured  porcine  collagen coupled  to  a  matrix  of  cross-linked  dextran.    The  pig  source  is  from  skins  of  pigs  bred  in  any European country (not just EU).  The microcarriers are sterilised.

## II.C.2.b Non-biological Origin

A list of starting materials of non-biological origin and not in a pharmacopoeia was given, together with information on their use in production and a reference to the page in the dossier where this use is mentioned.  In all cases, certificates of analysis were provided.

## II.C.2.c Media

A table with the two tissue culture media was given. The media are sterilised by filtration through a membrane of nominal porosity ≤ 0.22 µ m.

## II D CONTROL TESTS CARRIED OUT AT INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS

## 1. MDCK production cell cultures

The  test  for  sterility  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  current  requirements  of  the  European Pharmacopoeia; the appearance of the cells is also checked.

## 2. CHV glycoprotein

A flow chart showing the controls conducted was presented. The inactivated viral harvest is checked for inactivation.

An assay is carried out for the gB glycoprotein content of the finished glycoprotein solution.

## In-process controls

These include controls on the filters, recording the time and temperatures of operations, monitoring the sterilisation cycles, checking fill volumes, freeze-drying cycles, appearance of the product after capping, labelling and packing.

## II E CONTROL TESTS OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT

Information  was  presented  on  the  finished  product  tests.    The  tests  for  each  component,  the techniques involved, a brief description of each test and the limits of acceptance were listed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Freeze-dried powder of gB glycoprotein

This  is  controlled  by  checks  and  tests  on  Appearance,  pH,  Antigen  content,  Safety,  Bacterial  and fungal sterility, inactivation and residual humidity.

## Solvent

This is  controlled by checks and tests on Appearance, pH, Volume, Density, Viscosity, Safety and Bacterial and Fungal sterility.  The controls applied can be considered satisfactory.

## Batch to batch consistency

A summary of the results from the tests on 3 batches of each component, manufactured in accordance with the method described, was presented. The format of the batch protocols is in accordance with the requirements set out in the EU  guidelines  on  the  EC  administrative  batch  release for the implementation  of  Article  3.3  of  Council  Directive  90/677/EEC  (III/5372/93)  and  was  considered acceptable.

## II F STABILITY

## II.F.1 Stability of the Finished Product

## Freeze-dried powder

Results  were  presented  for  5  batches  of  the  freeze-dried  powder,  with  consecutive  batch  numbers, tested over 15 months of storage at 5 0 C ± 3 0 C.   The results presented were for tests conducted every 3 -  6  months for physico-chemical characteristics (appearance, pH and residual humidity) and antigen content.

Further stability data were provided for the freeze-dried powder consisting of data from potency test results conducted on 5 batches up to 27 months.  A shelf life of 24 months was considered justified for the vials of freeze-dried active substance.

## Solvent

Results are presented for 3 batches of the solvent, with consecutive batch numbers.

The shelf-life of the product, overall, can therefore be set at 24 months.

## II.F.2 Stability of the Reconstituted Product

No decrease in potency is expected shortly after reconstitution and the recommendation is to use the vaccine  immediately  after  reconstitution.  The  stability  of  the  components  has  been  studied.    It  has been shown that on reconstitution of older freeze-dried powders the density and viscosity are slightly increased but remain within normal limits for the solvent on its own.  The safety and efficacy of the reconstituted product was studied in the clinical studies.

## III OVERVIEW OF PART III OF THE DOSSIER: SAFETY

## III.A. INTRODUCTION

Potential safety risks from this type of product could be associated with the specific and non-specific proteins and with the adjuvant (all of which may produce inflammatory or hypersensitivity reactions). During the development of the product, the Applicant took these risks into consideration and hence the  virus  is  grown  in  medium  without  serum,  the  virus  is  inactivated,  the  antigen  is  purified  to eliminate non-specific proteins and the active ingredient consists of sub-units containing mainly the immunogenic proteins to ensure good efficacy and better safety.

Two initial laboratory studies and one further trial and a field trial have been conducted and these, supplemented by scientific arguments, have been presented to address the requirements of Council Directive 81/852/EEC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## III.B. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

All safety studies were conducted in pregnant bitches and according to the recommended vaccination regimen  except  for  the  test  in  young  dogs.  All  the  batches  of  vaccine  used  were  manufactured  in accordance  with  the  description  in  the  dossier  (except  where  excess  antigen  was  included).  The laboratory  studies  were  carried  out  under  GLP  conditions.    The  field  trial  was  conducted  in accordance with GCP.

Most  of  the  studies  have  been  conducted  in  seropositive  animals  because  of  the  difficulties  of obtaining  seronegative  bitches.  However  supporting  evidence  of  safety  from  use  in  seronegative animals  was  also  provided.    No  adverse  systemic  effects  or  adverse  effects  on  pregnancy  were observed in any of the studies.  A range of types of local reaction were seen in the different studies, due, in part at least, to the differences in the way they were conducted.  The warnings in the SPC on the  local  reactions  that  might  be  expected  after  administration  were  agreed,  on  the  basis  of  all  the information  available.      It  was  demonstrated  that  there  was  no  apparent  increase  in  reactions  after administration of four repeated administrations of a single dose.

## III. C. Laboratory studies

## III.C.1 Safety of the Administration of a Single Dose

The  objective  was  to  study  the  effect  of  the  vaccine  on  bitches  and  on  the  development  of  their foetuses  and  pups  until  8  weeks  of  age.    The  vaccine  batch  used  contained  low  quantity  of  active ingredient  per  dose  and  multiple  doses  of  the  freeze-dried  powder  were  used  so  that  a  sufficient amount of active ingredient was administered.  Twenty bitches were randomly allocated to 3 Groups. All the bitches had antibodies before vaccination.  All were primiparous.  A date of mating (D0) was calculated for each group of bitches from the dates of three successive matings.  Ten days after this presumed date of mating (D10), the 8 bitches in Group 1 and 6 in Group 2 were given large of amount gB  from  4  vials  of  freeze-dried  powder,  reconstituted  with  2  doses  of  solvent  (i.e.  just  over  a maximum dose of antigen and a double dose of adjuvant).

Six weeks later, (D52), the 7 bitches from Group 1 and 4 from Group 2 that had been shown to be pregnant, received the contents of 2 vials of freeze-dried powder reconstituted with 1 vial of solvent. Bitches in Group 2 also received another vaccine at a different site on D10.  All injections were made through an area of skin that had been clipped on the previous day.  The 8 bitches in Group 3 received no vaccinations. General clinical examinations and detailed examinations including rectal temperatures  and  the  detection  of  injection  site  reactions  were  made  on  the  day  before  injections, immediately before injections, 4-6 hours later and daily for 14 days after each injection.  Assessment of  local  reactions  included  grading  for  pain,  swelling,  local  heat  and  itching.    Body  weights  were recorded and food consumption noted.  Pregnancy diagnosis was performed 5-6 weeks after mating. After parturition, litters were monitored and pups were examined daily and weighed on day 3 and 7 and then weekly until 8 weeks of age.  Dead or sacrificed pups were post-mortemed.

Blood samples were collected on D10 and D52.  All the vaccinates had higher titres by D52.  All but one of the controls had lower titres on D52, indicating a lack of exposure to disease during the study.

No  adverse  general  clinical  signs  or  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  noted  after  vaccination  of  the bitches. Most vaccinates had a slight increase in rectal temperature in the 15 days post-vaccination. The time of maximum increase was variable; there was no significant difference between the groups and  some  animals  had  had  higher  than  normal  rectal  temperatures  before  vaccination.    It  was concluded,  therefore  that  the  increases  in  rectal  temperature  were  not  vaccine  related.    It  was  also concluded  that  there  was  no  vaccine  related  differences  in  the  body  weights  of  the  bitches  in  the groups.

CVMP/318/01 7/16 There was no adverse effect on pregnancy, whelping, perinatal mortality or development of the pups between the groups.   There  were  no  vaccine-related  findings  on  post-mortem  examination  of  dead pups.  Local reactions observed in Group 1 after the first vaccination were slight erythema in most bitches  which  persisted  in  two  animals  to  beyond  the  end  of  the  observation  period  and  there  was blackish  discolouration  in  one  case.    The  reactions  in  Group  2  were  more  pronounced  and  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reactions  in  half  the  bitches  included  scabs  which  persisted  in  2  animals  beyond  the  end  of  the observation period. The bitches in Group 2 had had a distemper/hepatitis/parvo/parainfluenza vaccine with Leptospira administered at a separate site on D10 and this may have been the reason for this greater  reaction.    The  reactions  to  the  other  vaccine  were  broadly  similar  to  those  from  Eurican Herpes 205.  The only reaction observed after the injections on D52 was slight erythema in 1 bitch in Group 1.

Post-mortem and histological examination of the injection sites were also undertaken for 6 animals in Group 1 and 3 animals in Group 2 but not until at least 85 days after the first injection.  No abnormal lesions were noted.

The Applicant's conclusions on a lack of significant effects on parameters such as weight gain and increases  in  rectal  temperatures  post-vaccination  are  acceptable.  The  data  provide  supporting evidence that there were no detectable general adverse effects on the bitches or their offspring from use of the product in immune, pregnant bitches.

## III.C.2 Safety of a Single Administration of an Overdose

The  objective  was  to  study  the  safety  of  a  repeat  administration  of  an  overdose  of  the  vaccine  in pregnant bitches.  The vaccinates were studied for signs of clinical adverse reactions and to monitor the  effects  on  their  pregnancy,  gestation  and  offspring.    The  vaccine  batch  used  in  this  study  was above maximum potency.

Twenty-seven  beagle  bitches,  were  randomly  allocated  to  2  groups  of  13  and  14  dogs.    A  date  of mating was estimated for each bitch and 10 days later (D0), the 13 bitches in Group 1 were given a double dose of freeze-dried powder, reconstituted with 2 doses of solvent.  Bitches in group 2 were given  a  placebo  vaccine  containing  freeze-dried  vaccine  stabiliser  reconstituted  with  the  adjuvant solvent.  Six weeks later, (D42), a second double dose of vaccine was administered to the bitches in Group 1 and stabiliser given to the bitches in Group 2.

On  the  3  days  before  each  vaccination,  the  animals  were  clinically  examined;  the  examination included the recording of rectal temperatures.  Only healthy bitches with rectal temperatures ≤ 39.5 0 C were included in the trial.  After each injection, the animals were monitored for 14 days to monitor the effects on general condition and for injection site reactions, and rectal temperatures were recorded for 4 days.  Parturition occurred between 3 -13 days after the second dose of vaccine in Group 1 and between  1  -19  days  after  the  second  dose  of  placebo  in  Group  2.    Parturition  was  monitored,  the number of live, dead and abnormal pups born was recorded and the pups were followed for 8 weeks. Unexpected deaths were investigated with post-mortem examination.

No increases in rectal temperature were found in any bitch. No general adverse effects were noted except depression on day 48 in 1 control animal.  Local reactions were recorded at the injection site from one or other or both vaccinations in about half the bitches in both groups.  These were described as slight and transient swellings and all persisted for less than 4 days.  They were recorded as oedema ≤ 4 cm and occurred between days 1 and 4 post-vaccination.  One dog in Group 2 had irritation at the site on D6 after the first dose.  There was no pain on injection, local hyperthermia or loss of pigment or hair at any of the injection sites.

No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to the total number  of  pups  born,  the  numbers  of  live/dead  pups,  or  the  number  weaned,  nor  between  the reproductive performance of the multiparous animals in Groups 1 and 2 and their historical data. The data  provide  evidence  of  the  general  safety  of  a  double  dose  of  the  product  when  administered  to immune,  pregnant  bitches  according  to  the  recommended  vaccination  schedule.    There  were  no detectable adverse effects on the bitches or their offspring.  The local reactions which developed after the vaccinations and administration of the adjuvant indicate that these are acceptable reactions to the adjuvant. In the overdose study, slight and transient swelling was noted.  It was considered by the Applicant that the reactions seen in these two studies were, in fact, similar reactions to the injections which contained a double dose of adjuvant in both cases.

It has been confirmed that the general and local reactions which occurred after the vaccinations of the non-pregnant bitches was the same or very similar to those reported for the pregnant bitches.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## III.C.3 Safety of the Repeated Administration of a Single Dose

- a) The  two  studies  summarised  above  are  stated  as  also  demonstrating  the  safety  of  the  repeated administration  of  a  single  dose  and  an  overdose.    It  is  accepted  that  there  was  no  evidence  in either  of  these  studies  that  two  administrations  of  the  vaccine  to  immune  animals resulted in a higher rate of local reactions after the second dose or that the vaccinations produced detectable general reactions or signs of a hypersensitivity reaction.
- b) The objective was to study the safety of a repeat administration of a single dose of the vaccine in young herpes-free dogs.  The vaccine batch used in this study contained gB above the maximum potency.  The  test  was  conducted  in  seronegative  young  dogs  because  of  the  difficulties  in obtaining seronegative bitches. It is considered that the use of these dogs would not impair the detection  of  local  or  general  adverse  reactions  or  hypersensitivity  reactions  from  multiple injections.

Fifteen beagle puppies were randomly allocated to 2 groups of 11 and 4.  Blood samples were collected  immediately  before  the  first  injection  (D0)  to  check  (by  ELISA)  that  they  were  free from antibodies to CHV.  All the puppies had been vaccinated previously with another vaccine. The 11 puppies in Group 1 were vaccinated, subcutaneously, with a single dose on days D0, D14, D28 and D42.  The control pups were left unvaccinated. The animals were examined for local reactions, general condition and rectal temperatures recorded daily from D0 until the end of the observation period on D56 as well as 4 hours after each injection.  The pups were also weighed at intervals.  The classification for general reactions and the scoring system for local reactions were presented.

The  results  for  rectal  temperatures  were  presented.  There  were  no  notable  differences  in  the average results of the two groups but there was transient hyperthermia (up to 39.8 0 C) in 6 of the vaccinates and in 2 of these this was seen on a number of occasions. Transient hyperthermia (up to 40.5 0 C) was also seen in 1 of the controls.  It was considered that this modest hyperthermia was not related to vaccination.

The  results  for  the  average  weights  in  the  groups  were  presented.  There  were  no  notable differences in the average results of the two groups but 5 vaccinates showed some weight loss - 1 between D0 and D7, 1 between D14 and D21 and 3 between D42 and D49.  There were no other associated side effects in any of these dogs. No general adverse effects were noted in any dog.

The only local reactions recorded were some swellings at the injection sites in the vaccinates. The largest reaction was a very diffuse 5 cm swelling.  One dog did not display any reaction.  Most reactions  seem  to  have  been  recorded  after  the  second  and  third  injections.    After  the  fourth injection only 1 dog had a small reaction 4 hours after vaccination.

The conclusion drawn by the Applicant was that a few local reactions were observed, probably related to the oily solvent but they remained small and were not systematically observed.

The combination of the results from this study and the results of the safety studies in pregnant bitches is considered to provide an acceptable alternative to a study of the safety of the repeated administration of the vaccine to pregnant bitches.

## III.C.4 Examination of Reproductive Performance

The study reported under III C 1 is also stated as demonstrating the absence of adverse effect of the vaccine on the reproductive performance of the vaccinated bitches. The results from these two trials plus data from two field safety and efficacy studies were assessed and the outcome presented. The comparison was based on the results from 171 vaccinated bitches and 95 placebo treated controls, of different breeds and ages and from 14 kennels with differing CHV status.  A check was made on the homogeneity between the groups, in terms of the age and size of the bitches.  There was no significant difference but differences were taken into account in the analyses of the results.  The reproduction parameters considered were rate of pregnancy, number of pups born (live and dead) and weaned.

CVMP/318/01 9/16 The  summary  data  for  the  size,  age  and  breed  of  the  animals  in  the  trial  were  presented.  The pregnancy rates of vaccinates and controls were not significantly different.  The number of foetuses was only correlated to the age and size of the bitches.  The overall number of weaned pups was not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significantly different between the two groups.  There was no correlation between vaccine potency and any of the parameters studied.  The CHV status had an effect.

The analysis confirms the conclusions reached from the two laboratory safety studies that there is no detectable adverse effect on these specific reproduction parameters when the vaccine is administered to immune pregnant bitches.

In addition to the points made above, it was stated that 15 batches had been submitted for batch safety testing in SPF dogs without noticeable adverse effects.  More than 50 bitches with no or low antibody titres  had  been  vaccinated  in  the  field  trials  without  any  adverse  effect  on  their  reproductive performance. It can be concluded that the Applicant has provided sufficient evidence of the safety of the product including safety for use in pregnant bitches even if non-immune.

## III.C.5 Examination of Immunological Functions

Satisfactory argumentation has been provided to show that there is no reason to expect the vaccine would exert an adverse effect on the immune function of the vaccinated animals.  In support, a lack of adverse  effect  noted  from  use  of  the  Applicant's  other  herpes  virus  vaccines  in  other  species  was quoted.

## III.D. FIELD STUDIES

1 .  The  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  administration  of  the  recommended  vaccination schedule in pregnant bitches.  The vaccinates were studied for signs of clinical adverse reactions and to monitor the effects on their pregnancy, gestation and offspring.  The vaccine batch used was above the maximum potency.  The control animals were given a placebo vaccination containing freeze-dried vaccine stabiliser reconstituted with the adjuvant solvent.

The  study  was  conducted  in  the  resident,  CHV  seropositive  breeding  bitches  on  two  commercial breeding kennels.  There were 52 beagles on site 2 and 15 animals of a range of pedigrees on site 1. On each site, the animals were randomly allocated to the group of vaccinates or the placebo treated group in a ratio of 2:1.

On site 1 the first injections were given between D4 and D13 after mating and pregnant animals were given  a  second  dose  of  vaccine  or  placebo  between  D47  and  D56  after  mating.    On  site  2,  the injections were given on D10 and D52.

The animals were closely monitored on the day before injection, immediately before injection, 3-5 hours after each injection and daily for 4 days after each injection, for effects on general condition, rectal temperatures and injection site reactions.  The general condition of the bitches was monitored from day 14 to 52 and day 57 to whelping.  Parturition was monitored, the number of live, dead and abnormal pups born was recorded and the pups were observed for 3-6 weeks.

Vaccination  had  no  effect  on  the  general  condition  of  the  bitches.    There  was  no  statistically significant difference on the effect on rectal temperatures between the groups.  There were no adverse

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effects  at  the  injection  sites,  except  three  of  the  vaccinated  bitches  on  site  2  developed  transient swellings after the first injection.  These first appeared on day 0, 1 or 2 post vaccination. They were scored as ≤ 4 cm and recorded as present on 4 or 5 consecutive days, after which they appear to have resolved.

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  pregnancy  rates,  duration  of  gestation,  the numbers of pups born or the number weaned.  The statistical analysis of results was presented.

This field trial was conducted in conformity with Specific requirements for the production and control of  live  and  inactivated  vaccines  for  cats  and  dogs  (III/5736/94)  and  the  requirements  of  Council Directive 81/852/EEC.  The trial can be considered as having provided sufficient evidence of a lack of detectable  adverse  effect  of  the  vaccine  when  used  under  field  conditions,  in  premises  where  the bitches were infected with or had been exposed to CHV infection.

2. The  Applicant  also  refers  to  the  data  for  the  144  bitches  vaccinated  under  field  conditions  as showing the very good safety associated with use of the recommended vaccination schedule.

## III.E. ECOTOXICITY

A first phase environmental risk assessment was presented The product does not present a risk for the environment and no second phase study is required.

## IV. OVERVIEW OF PART IV OF THE DOSSIER: EFFICACY

## IV.A INTRODUCTION

Two laboratory studies and two field trials were carried out.  In one field trial the serological response was  measured.    In  the  other,  a  study  was  made  of  the  effect  of  vaccination  on  the  reproductive performance  of  bitches  in  an  infected  kennel.    These  trials,  supplemented  by  scientific  arguments, have been presented to address the testing requirements of Council Directive 81/852/EEC.

## IV.B. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

All  efficacy  studies  were  conducted  in  pregnant  bitches  (except  for  the  dose  response  study)  and according to the recommended  vaccination  regimen.  All  the  batches  of vaccine  used  were manufactured  in  accordance  with  the  description  in  the  dossier  (except  where  less  than  the  usual amount of antigen was included).  All studies were carried out under GLP or GCP conditions.

## IV.C. LABORATORY TRIALS

## 1. Dose response study

The  objective  was  to  study  the  dose-response  effect  of  the  vaccine  in  dogs,  using  serology  as  the means of measurement.  The vaccine batch used contained gB at minimum potency.

Fourteen SPF dogs, aged 6 months were allocated to 3 groups of 4 dogs and one group of 2. On D0, dogs in Group 1 were each given 2 doses of active substance and 1 ml of solvent, Group 2 dogs were given 1 dose of active substance and 1 ml of solvent, Group 3 dogs were given half a dose of active substance and 1 ml of solvent and the two dogs in Group 4 were each given 1 ml solvent, only. The injections  were  repeated on day 42.  The vaccine doses were prepared in pools with the necessary quantities  of  adjuvant  to  give  the  necessary  ratio  of  antigen  per  1  ml  of  solvent.  Seroneutralising antibody titres at D0 were measured in log10 and ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 (mean 0.29). By 2 weeks after the second vaccination, the means in the vaccinates had risen and the controls remained low.  The mean  responses  in  the  vaccinates  had  decreased  slightly  by  D98.  A  linear  relationship  between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigen dose and serological response was established from the results obtained.  The conclusion was that a dose between 1 and 1.5 of the batch tested should provide a satisfactory choice for a minimum protective dose.

Reference was made to the titre of 0.6 log10, which was established in a study published by Huxsoll on the titre required in bitches to protect their pups.  A safety margin has been added.  From the linear relationship  of  antigen  and  serology  established,  the  Applicant  .had  defined  the  minimum  potency which has been tested further.

This  study  provides  information  on  the  antigenicity  of  the  CHV  glycoprotein.  The  dose-response effect is detectable and appears to provide a reasonable basis for choosing the minimum antigen level gB for the vaccination and challenge study.

The study was continued to observe antibody titres until day 379. A table of results was presented, with  the  mean  antibody  responses  in  the  three  groups  of  vaccinated  dogs  and  the  controls  from samples collected at day 407 and day 421 (together with the results from the earlier times of sampling, previously presented). A single booster dose had been given on day 407 and this had produced no more than a moderate response in all groups, 14 days later.

The results support the recommendation that two vaccinations during each pregnancy is preferable to ensure high titres at the time of whelping.

## 2. Vaccination-challenge study

The  objective  was  to  study  the  efficacy  of  the  vaccine  by  immunising  pregnant  bitches  to  protect passively  their  puppies  against  a  CHV  challenge.    The  vaccine  batch  used  contained  minimum quantity of gB per dose.

Sixteen pregnant SPF bitches, were used.  Approximately 10 days after the presumed date of mating, 10 bitches were vaccinated, 5 were given solvent only and 1 bitch received no injections.  A second injection  of  the  vaccine  or  solvent  was  administered  52  days  later  to  those  animals  that  were  still included in the trial.

The litters of 6 vaccinates and 6 controls were challenged at 3 days of age.  (The litters of four of the vaccinates were not challenged for various reasons, not connected with the vaccine.)  The challenge was a virulent strain of CHV, given oronasally.  Most pups were observed daily for clinical signs of disease  until  21  days  after  challenge  (D24).    One  litter  of  a  control  bitch  was  only  observed  for  2 weeks.  Post mortem examination was carried out on pups that died before D24 and on the surviving pups,  sacrificed  on  D24.    Histological  examination  was  conducted  on  samples  collected  at  postmortem  on  D24  and  on  tissues  from  some  other  pups  that  died  earlier  including  the  organs  of  1 control litter with classical CHV lesions at post-mortem which was then used as a positive control for histology.  Samples of lung and kidney were pooled and tested for viral isolation and for the presence of virus by PCR (polymerase chain reaction).  In some cases, additional tissue samples were added to the pool.

The  clinical  signs,  which  were  particularly  looked  for  after  challenge,  were  signs  of  respiratory disease  (sneezing,  discharge,  and  respiratory  distress),  diarrhoea  and  vomiting,  general  signs  of distress and illness in young pups and morbidity.  Blood samples were collected from the bitches at the time of each vaccination, at the time of challenge and at the end of the study on D24.  Surviving puppies were tested on D24 post-challenge.  The serum-neutralisation test was used to assess antibody titres.

Pups were diagnosed as succumbing to neonatal CHV infection on the basis of death associated with typical macroscopic lesions at post-mortem examination.  Isolation of virus and/or positive PCR was used for confirmation.

Post-mortem  findings  which  were  considered  to  be  typical  macroscopic  lesions  of  neonatal  CHV disease  were  described.    The  general  appearance  of  the  pup  was  often  normal,  sometimes  thin; abnormalities  including  petechiae  are  seen  in  the  liver,  spleen,  kidneys,  digestive  tract,  mesenteric ganglion  and  heart,  and  the  lungs  have  a  heterogeneous  appearance  (reddish  areas,  greyish  areas, oedema and 'watery').

CVMP/318/01 12/16 For  the  controls  the  bitches  were  seronegative  and  all  but  one  seroconverted  after  challenging  the pups.  18/29 pups died after challenge (excluding 2 deaths considered non-specific).  In 5/6 litters part or all of the litter succumbed to the infection.  Many died quickly without characteristic clinical signs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

being observed.  Pups dying between days 6 and 14 had typical macroscopic post-mortem lesions. Virus was isolated from samples from nearly all of these.  In the sixth litter, 1 pup died 1 day post challenge and this was considered a non-specific death.  The other three pups in this litter survived and although there were signs of illness and the samples collected on D24 were PCR positive they were included in the group considered protected.  The antibody levels in surviving pups were highly variable.

With regard to  the  vaccinates,  the  bitches  seroconverted  to  the  first  vaccination,  showed  a  booster effect to the second and all had high antibody titres by the time of challenging the pups.  The date of challenging the pups was not always 56 days after the first injection as the bitches whelped from 7 to 16  days  after  the  last  injection.    After  the  challenge  of  the  pups,  the  antibody  titres  of  the  bitches stayed the same in 4 and increased in 2.  No pups were diagnosed as having died of CHV infection. The 6/33 that died were considered to have died from other causes.  The antibody levels in surviving pups were highly variable.

The  indication  'Active  immunisation  of  bitches  to  prevent  mortality,  clinical  signs  and  lesions  in puppies  resulting  from  canine  herpes  virus  infections  acquired  in  the  first  few  days  of  life'  was agreed.

## 3. Duration of immunity

The vaccination regimen is designed to ensure a satisfactory neutralising antibody titre in the bitch at the time of whelping and for a few days subsequently since pups gain protection by absorbing IgG from the colostrum and milk for the first 12 - 36 hours of life.

Since the recommendation is for the vaccination regimen to be repeated each pregnancy the duration of immunity beyond whelping and the efficacy of a single booster dose has not been addressed by the Applicant. Justification has been provided for the repeat of the two dose vaccination. It was shown that there was an inadequate response in bitches given a single booster dose.

## IV.D. FIELD TRIALS

Two field trials were conducted and the results are summarised below.

1. The  objective  was  to  study  the  efficacy  of  administration  of  the  recommended  vaccination schedule in pregnant bitches.  Efficacy was assessed through monitoring the serological response to vaccination.    In  this  study,  ELISA  antibody  titres  were  measured  whereas  seroneutralisation  titres were  measured  in  the  laboratory  efficacy  studies.    A  report  was  provided  with  the  details  of  the comparison of the two methods (see below) Confirmation was provided that ELISA titres were used throughout this study. The vaccine batch used contained approximately twice the minimum potency. The  control  animals  were  given  a  placebo  vaccination  containing  freeze-dried  vaccine  stabiliser reconstituted with the adjuvant solvent.

The  study  was  conducted  in  152  bitches  in  ten  breeding  kennels  having  variable  status  for  CHV infections.  There were approximately 18 different breeds in the trial.  On each site, the animals were randomly allocated to the group of vaccinates or the placebo treated group in a ratio of 2:1. The 100 bitches  allocated  to  Group  A  and  the  52  placebo  treated  bitches  in  Group  B  were  injected  on approximately D10 and D52 post-mating.  All bitches were checked and shown to be in good general health  before each vaccination.  Non-pregnant bitches and one too close to whelping by D52 were removed from the study and no data were presented for these 25 vaccinates and 17 controls. Blood samples  were  collected  before  each  vaccination  and  within  7  days  after  whelping.    The  statistical analyses applied to the results of antibody titres were listed.

The individual titres for each dog were given by kennel then by group.  The details of the statistical analyses were also provided. Antibodies were present at variable levels at the time of first vaccination in  all  the  bitches  from  both  groups  and  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between them.  In some kennels most or all of the bitches had low antibody levels before injection.  In others there was a mixture of bitches with low and high levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Controls: The controls had average titres at the three times of sampling with no significant differences between  the  titres  at  the  various  times  of  sampling.  The  titres  of  most  bitches  stayed  the  same  or decreased and only 1 bitch in kennel B clearly seroconverted from D10 to after whelping.

Vaccinates: A significant increase in the average antibody titre had occurred after the first and second vaccinations  and  the  average  antibody  titre  was  significantly  higher  after  whelping  than  on  D10. There were three non-responders (in one case the titre had markedly decreased) and five bitches with a poor response but the majority of the bitches had increased titres after vaccination.  There does not appear  to  be  any  relationship  between  titres  at  D10  and  those  induced  by  the  vaccination  in  that bitches with low and higher titres at D10 developed high titres after whelping.

It  was  concluded  that  the  vaccine  induced  a  strong  serocoversion.    The  lack  of  response  in  the controls indicates that there was not an outbreak of CHV in the kennels that could have boosted the antibody titres in the vaccinates.

The efficacy of the vaccine has been demonstrated in a vaccination/challenge study with a vaccine at minimum potency,  administered  according  to  the  recommended  vaccination  schedule.    The  claims being made relate to protection against the disease and not to specific induction of antibody titres. It was concluded that sufficient efficacy data had been provided in support of the claims being made.

## Validation of the serological test

Ten SPF dogs, aged approximately 7 months were allocated to 2 groups of 5.  On D0, dogs in group A were each given 1 dose of a vaccine batch and Group B dogs were given 1 dose of another batch. Both were reconstituted in 1 ml of solvent.  The injections were repeated on D42.  Blood samples were collected before vaccination on D0 and on D28, D42, D56 and D70.

## Serology

Mean titres rose from D0 to D28, decreased slightly by D 42 then increased markedly to D56 and decreased slightly again by D70.  Mean ELISA titres were higher than seroneutralisation titres. On the whole, the results for the individual dogs follows the pattern of the means and there were no nonresponders.

A linear relationship was demonstrated between the titres obtained from the two assay methods. This provides sufficient  reassurance  that  the  ELISA  titres  measured  in  this  field  trial  can  be  used  as  an indicator of the immunogenicity of the vaccine and its efficacy.

2. The  objective  was  to  study  the  efficacy  of  administration  of  the  recommended  vaccination schedule in pregnant bitches. Efficacy was assessed through monitoring the reproductive performance in bitches in an infected kennel with reproduction problems. The vaccine batch used was  at  approximately  twice  the  minimum  potency.    The  control  animals  were  given  a  placebo vaccination containing freeze-dried vaccine stabiliser reconstituted with the adjuvant solvent.

The study was conducted in 20 bitches in the breeding kennel.  CHV infection had been confirmed on the site by virus isolation and serological assessment.  The animals were randomly allocated to the group of vaccinates or the placebo treated group in a ratio of approximately 2:1.  The 14 bitches in Group  A  were  vaccinated  on  approximately  D10  and  D52  post-mating.    The  actual  planned vaccination dates were between D7 - D15 but 1 animal was injected on D20.  For the second injection it  was  planned  for  D49  -  D55  but  3  animals  were  injected  slightly  outside  this  timeframe.    The  6 placebo treated bitches in Group B were injected to the same time schedule.  Non-pregnant bitches were removed from the study and no data were presented for these 4 vaccinates and 2 placebo treated bitches except for some serological titres.

The animals were examined and rectal temperatures recorded before each injection.  Blood samples were collected before each vaccination and a few days after whelping.  Antibodies were measured by ELISA.

The vaccinates were monitored for their rate of pregnancy, problems at whelping, the incidence of stillborn pups, general condition and mean body weight of the pups at whelping, pre-weaning losses, general condition over 6 weeks and mean body weight of the pups at 6 weeks of age.  Although it is known that all these reproduction parameters can be affected by CHV infection in the kennels, only pre-weaning losses were relevant to the claims being made for the product. Post-mortem examinations were conducted on puppies that died and virus isolation was conducted from various organs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no significant differences in the rate of pregnancy or duration of gestation.  There were no abortions  or  whelpings  before  D58  and  there  was  no  difference  observed  in  whelping  difficulties. There were no significant differences in the number of foetuses per bitch. Four stillborn pups were seen in the control group and 2 in the vaccinates.  All but one of the pups which were less than 100g at birth were stillborn or died within 48 hours.  Although it appears from the data presented that the rate of survival over the first 48 hours was better in pups from vaccinates compared to the controls, the difference was not statistically significant.  No CHV isolations were obtained from any dead pup. The mean body weight at whelping between pups born to vaccinates was highly significantly greater than those born to the controls (mean 141.8 g compared with 85.0 g) but by weaning the differences were not significant.  The surviving pups in Group B grew faster.

The mean ELISA antibody titres were similar in the two groups at the time of first vaccination No control bitch seroconverted from D10 to after whelping and most titres stayed the same.  There were

1  or  possibly  2  non-responders  but  the  majority  of  the  vaccinated  bitches  had  higher  titres  after vaccination  and  after  whelping.    These  results  show  that  the  vaccine  at  an  antigen  content approximately double the minimum, is able to stimulate an immune response and raise the circulating antibody levels even in bitches which had a reasonable titre before vaccination.

It  was  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of  the  vaccine  has  been  confirmed in field conditions, based on serological results, and the trials also showed some evidence of protection against the CHV induced effects on pregnancy (e.g. from the increased mean body weights of the pups at birth) .

## 5. RISK-BENEFIT ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSION

Eurican Herpes 205 is a vaccine containing purified glycoproteins of canine herpes virus (CHV).  The product  consists  of  2  vials.    The  freeze-dried  active  substance  is  supplied  in  1  vial.    The  solvent, which includes an oily adjuvant (light paraffin oil) is contained in the second. The active substance is freeze-dried  in  vials.    The  vials  used  for  both  components  are  made  from  Type  I  glass.    Both  the freeze-dried pellet of the active substance and the solvent have been shown to be stable over a period of storage of 27 months at 2-8 0 C.  This justifies a shelf-life of 24 months for the components and the product.  The  information  supplied  has  provided  assurance  that  the  control  tests  will  control  the quality  and  quantity  of  the  glycoprotein  in  the  freeze-dried  powder  including  any  variation  in  the quantity of glycoproteins other than the gB content. All materials of biological origin are sourced in accordance with the Note for Guidance for Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Veterinary Medicinal Products, EMEA/CVMP/145/97-Revision.

The vaccine is indicated for use in pregnant bitches to provide passive immunity to their pups.  The vaccination schedule stated in the SPC is for vaccination 7-10 days after the presumed date of mating with  a  second  dose  6  weeks  later.    All  but  one  of  the  safety  studies  were  conducted  in  pregnant bitches and according to the recommended vaccination regimen.  The laboratory studies were carried out under GLP conditions.  The field trial was conducted in accordance with GCP. Three laboratory studies,  a  field  trial  and  a  statistical  analysis  have  been  conducted  to  establish  safety.  Most  of  the studies  have  been  conducted  in  seropositive  animals  because  of  the  difficulties  of  obtaining seronegative  bitches.    Supporting  evidence  of  safety  from  use  in  seronegative  animals  was  also provided.  No adverse systemic effects or adverse effects on pregnancy were observed in any of the studies.  A range of types of local reaction were seen in the different studies, due, in part at least, to the differences in the way they were conducted. Reactions at the site of injection have been observed but  are  not  considered  so  significant  as  to  cause  a  major  concern  regarding  the  welfare  of  treated animals but warnings regarding the local reactions that might be expected after administration have been included in the SPC.  It was demonstrated that there was no apparent increase in reactions after administration of four repeated administrations of a single dose.

Operator  warnings  for  the  oil  adjuvant  have  been  included  in  the  SPC  and  some  of  the  product literature. The overall risk to the environment is assessed as minimal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two laboratory studies and two field trials were carried out to establish efficacy.  In one field trial the serological response was measured.  In the other, a study was made of the effect of vaccination on the reproductive  performance  of  bitches  in  an  infected  kennel.  The  first  laboratory  study  was  a  dose response study to establish the antigen content likely to be required in a dose to provide protection. The second study was conducted to demonstrate the protection of puppies from vaccinated dams from a CHV challenge.  Good protection was achieved.  Over 80% of the pups from the vaccinated bitches survived and those pups that died were not considered to have died as a result of CHV infection.  On the other hand, 66% of the controls died.

The  Applicant  recommended  a  repeat  2  dose  vaccination  in  each  pregnancy.    This  approach  was accepted as the interval between pregnancies is variable and can be longer in some breeding kennels than in others.  In addition, it was shown that the immunity of the bitches wanes to a very low level at or before 12 months post vaccination and a single booster dose was not then effective. The data on the duration of immunity in pups is limited to 3 days post whelping, as this was when the challenge was administered in the study.  This was, however, considered acceptable as the pups become increasingly resistant to the effects of infection over the first 2-3 weeks of life. The claim being made reflects the data  generated  and  reads  'Active  immunisation  of  bitches  to  prevent  mortality,  clinical  signs  and lesions in puppies resulting from canine herpes virus infections acquired in the first few days of life'. Based on all the data provided, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products concluded that the quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  product  were  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Council Directive 81/852/EEC and the data supported the claims made.
