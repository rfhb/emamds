## I SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

The  active  substance  of  Xigris  is  a  recombinant  human  Activated  Protein  C,  or  drotrecogin  alpha (activated),  which  exerts  an  antithrombotic  effect  by  inhibiting  factors  Va  and  VIIIa,  resulting  in  a negative  feedback  regulation  of  coagulation.  Moreover, in  vitro data  demonstrate  that  Activated Protein C has an indirect profibrinolytic activity, due to its ability to inhibit plasminogen activator-1 (PAI-1) and limit the generation of activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect.

Xigris was first approved in the United States on 22 November 2001. On 22 August 2002 Xigris was authorised  in  Europe  under  exceptional  circumstances  through  the  centralised  procedure  with  the following indication: treatment of adult patients with severe sepsis with multiple organ failure when added to best standard care. Based on the results of further clinical trials, during its second annual reassessment,  the  indication  was  qualified  with  the  following  additional  sentence: the  use  of  Xigris should be considered mainly in situations when therapy can be started within 24 hours after the onset of organ failure. During its third annual re-assessment, the CHMP concluded that on the basis of the data submitted the benefit/risk balance for Xigris in the approved indications remained positive and Xigris should remain under exceptional circumstances until at least the  results  of  study  F1K-MC-EVBR (to  investigate  the possible interaction between Xigris and heparin) have been obtained. Therefore, the following Specific Obligation remained to be fulfilled: 'A further clinical study (F1K-MC-EVBR) is being conducted to investigate the possible interaction between Xigris and heparin. The final study report will be provided in April 2006'. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) provided the final study report of the study F1K-MCEVBR (now XPRESS study - heparin/Xigris versus placebo/Xigris) within the framework of a type II variation (EMEA/H/C/000396/II/0020), since the results of XPRESS identified the need for changes to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). 1.2 Clinical aspects 1.2.1 Background information on coadministration of heparin and Xigris There were clinical and theoretical concerns associated with the coadministration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) with prophylactic heparin. Both medications have anticoagulant properties and, therefore, coadministration  may  increase  the  rate  of  serious  bleeding  associated  with  either  therapy  alone. Additionally, a number of in vitro studies have documented increased inhibition of Activated Protein C activity by protein C inhibitor in the presence of unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin, albeit under high local concentration conditions (Pratt and Church 1993; Aznar et al. 1996; Friedrich et al. 2001). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Analysis of the PROWESS study data, which served as the basis for the Marketing Authorisation for Xigris, by heparin exposure raised the possibility that heparin may reduce the efficacy of drotrecogin alfa (activated). In PROWESS, approximately 75% of patients received prophylactic unfractionated or low  molecular  weight  heparin  sometime  during  the  study  drug  infusion  period.  A  significant treatment-by-concomitant  heparin  exposure  interaction  was  observed.  However,  this  analysis  was based  on  a  post-baseline  covariate,  and  there  was  no  treatment-by-baseline  heparin  exposure interaction between  Xigris and placebo treatment groups. Baseline prophylactic heparin  was administered to 64.5% of patients overall, but to a higher proportion (&gt;80%) in Europe. Furthermore, in an analysis stratified for concomitant prophylactic dose heparin administration, Xigris significantly reduced  mortality  compared  to  placebo  (p=0.005).  Mortality  rates  and  serious  bleeding  event  rates were similar for Xigris patients receiving and not receiving any concomitant heparin.

Nevertheless,  the  mortality  rate  by  prophylactic  heparin  exposure  during  the  infusion  period  in PROWESS raised concerns that Xigris might not be as efficacious in patients receiving heparin for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

any reason. These concerns were not supported in further studies such as ADDRESS and ENHANCE, but the potential interaction between heparin and Xigris was important to analyse in a study, such as XPRESS, where the decision to use prophylactic heparin treatment was randomised.

## 1.2.2 Description of XPRESS study

XPRESS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV trial of prophylactic heparin in patients with severe sepsis and higher disease severity who were undergoing treatment with Xigris.

## Study design

At baseline, the administration of prophylactic heparin was at the physician's discretion. Then, eligible patients starting treatment with Xigris at 24 µg/kg/h during 96 h (4 days) were randomised to either: low molecular weight heparin (n=500 planned), unfractionated heparin (n=500 planned), or placebo (n=1000 planned) for 96 h as well. During study drug administration, only mechanical  methods of deep  venous  thrombosis  (DVT)  prevention,  such  as  graduated  pressure  anti-embolism  stockings  or pneumatic calf or foot compression, could be used at any time. Commercial heparin could only be used  after  the  completion  or  early  termination  of  study  drug  administration.  After  study  drug administration, all severe sepsis care modalities remained at the discretion of the treating physician, including the choice of DVT prevention method. Thus, patients could be switched back to any type of commercial heparin immediately after the end of the Xigris infusion. Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion Patients were eligible for enrolment if they were adults ( ≥ 18 years old), were indicated for treatment with Xigris under the approved label in the country where the patient was enrolled, and were receiving treatment for  severe  sepsis  at  one  of  the  participating  investigative  sites.  'Higher  disease  severity', which defines the indication population, was defined as an APACHE II score ≥ 25 in the US and other countries and ≥ 2 organ failures in the EU and other countries. The exclusion criteria were similar to those of the PROWESS study, especially the exclusion of patients who were not expected to survive 28 days given their preexisting uncorrectable medical condition and those with a high risk of bleeding. In  addition,  in  XPRESS,  patients  were  excluded  if  they  were  contraindicated  for  treatment  with prophylactic heparin, required a higher dose of prophylactic heparin than specified in the protocol, had acute or chronic renal failure with an estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min, or had a concurrent need for other anticoagulant/antithrombotic medication during the Xigris infusion. Primary and secondary endpoints The primary endpoint  was  to  demonstrate  in  adult  patients  with  severe  sepsis  who  received  Xigris within its current indication that concomitant treatment with heparin was equivalent to treatment with placebo as determined by 28-day mortality, regardless of the cause of death. Secondary endpoints were: (1)  to  determine  the  relative  incidence  of  venous  thrombotic  events  in  patients  who  received concomitant heparin versus patients who received placebo during Study Days 0 through 6; (2)  to  determine  the  relative  incidence  of  venous  thrombotic  events  in  patients  who  received concomitant heparin versus patients who received placebo during Study Days 0 through 28; Medicinal product no longer authorised

- (3)  to evaluate the safety profile of Xigris and  prophylactic heparin coadministration as determined  by  the  relative  incidence  of  intracranial  hemorrhage,  fatal  bleeding,  nonfatal serious  bleeding,  heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia,  and  ischemic  stroke  during  Study Days 0 through 28;
- (4)  to evaluate the safety profile of Xigris and  prophylactic heparin coadministration as determined by the occurrence of serious adverse events including serious bleeding events and nonserious  bleeding  events  that  occurred  during  Study  Days  0  through  6  that  led  to  or contributed to the need  for transfusion of packed  red  blood  cells, study-drug-related nonserious adverse events, and adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As there was no clear difference between unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin in most analyses, the two heparin groups (unfractionated and fractionated heparin) were combined, but separate analyses were also provided.

## Study patients

Two thousand two patients (2002) were enrolled into this study. Eight (8) patients were removed from the database because of informed consent issues, thus 1994 randomised patients were included in the reporting database, of which 1935 received study drug (unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or placebo) and 1927 completed the study with known 28-day survival status.

The per-protocol  population  (PPP)  included  the  patients  in  the  intent-to-treatment  (ITT)  population who received at least 6 heparin/placebo injections or who discontinued the Xigris infusion for reason of  death.  The  PPP  was  of  1706  patients  (88.2%  of  the  ITT  population).  The  221  patients  excluded from the PPP were balanced between the heparin group (n=101) and the placebo group (n=120), but their mortality rates were quite different.

- Statistical analysis The primary endpoint was to demonstrate that heparin was not appreciably different than placebo in reducing  28-day  all-cause  mortality  in  patients  with  severe  sepsis  who  were  receiving  Xigris.  The equivalence margin was set at ± 6.2%, since in PROWESS, Xigris patients with a baseline APACHE II score ≥ 25 had a 28-day mortality rate of 31% and in equivalence studies, an equivalence boundary of 0.8 to 1.2 is often used (6.2% = 31% × 0.20). Similar analyses were performed for the secondary endpoints of the incidence of venous thrombotic events. Baseline characteristics The main demographic characteristics were:  Male/female, 58.8/41.2 %.  Mean age, 59.0; patients ≥ 65 years old, 40.3%; patients ≥ 75 years old, 18.7%.  Caucasian, 73.3%.  Europe, 35.1%, US/Canada, 47.1%; other regions, 17.8%. The main clinical characteristics were:  Patients with ≤ 1 organ dysfunction, 7.9%, with 2 organ dysfunctions, 28.3%, with 3 organ dysfunctions,  33.1%,  with ≥ 4  organ  dysfunctions,  30.8%.  Of  note,  the  number  of  organ dysfunctions present at baseline was assessed differently in this study than in previous studies of  Xigris.  In  addition  to  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  renal,  hematologic  and  unexplained metabolic acidosis dysfunction, the presence of central nervous system and liver dysfunction at  baseline  was  also  collected.  When  recalculated  according  to  previous  criteria  with  a maximum of 5 organ dysfunctions, 91.2% met the EU Xigris indication criteria of ≥ 2 organ dysfunctions.  This  proportion  was  higher  than  what  was  observed  in  the  PROWESS  and ENHANCE studies.  The  higher  severity  of  sepsis  in  XPRESS  was  confirmed  by  a  higher frequency of vasopressors and ventilator usage. Median  time  from  first  organ  dysfunction  to  Xigris  start  was  23.3  h,  i.e.,  relatively  similar  to ENHANCE. The EU SPC for Xigris recommends starting treatment within 24 h of the first organ failure; therefore, only half of the XPRESS population met this criterion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Baseline prophylactic heparin was used at the physician's discretion in 899/1935 ITT patients (46.5%) or 885/1927 (45.9%) in those who completed treatment. Unfractionated heparin was used in 24.1% of patients and low-molecular weight heparin in 22.4%. These groups were equally well randomised to placebo  or  to  each  type  of  heparin  as  a  study  drug;  thus,  among  patients  who  were  randomised  to placebo, 45.7% had to stop their prior heparin therapy according to the protocol. Aspirin was used by 7.7% of overall patients at baseline, and other anti-platelet agents by 1.1%.

In  general,  the  combined  heparin  and  placebo  treatment  groups  were  well-balanced  with  respect  to baseline  characteristics.  There  were  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  two  treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups in site of infection and exposure to aspirin at baseline. Although not statistically significant, there  were  some  numerical  imbalances  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  Relative  to  the  placebo group,  the  heparin  group  had  a  greater  number  of  female  patients  (42.7% vs 39.6%)  and  a  greater number  of patients who  were  older than 65  (42.2% vs 38.3%), who  were  older than 75 (20.2% vs 17.0%), who came from an acute care hospital (17.8% vs 15.0%), and who had a history of DVT (3.3% vs 2.0%).

## Concomitant treatments

More than half of patients (57%) received a mechanical method of DVT prevention at any time during the study (40% between Days 0 though 6). There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups.

The  use  of  heparin  or  heparin  flush  to  maintain  the  patency  of  vascular  access  lines  during  the administration of Xigris was discouraged, but not prohibited. Approximately 17% of patients received heparin  flush  during  the  Xigris  infusion,  but  the  percentage  of  patients  was  similar  in  both  the combined heparin and placebo groups. Most patients (84.3%) received commercial heparin after the completion of study drug administration, and  48.2%  received  commercial  heparin  during  Study  Days  0  through  6.  No  imbalance  between treatment groups (heparin vs placebo) was noted for commercial heparin administration. 1.2.3 Efficacy results Efficacy primary endpoint In  the  prospectively  defined  primary  analysis,  an  equivalence  analysis  of  28-day  mortality  for  the combined heparin and placebo groups, the 90% absolute risk difference confidence interval was not within  the  6.2%  equivalence  margin;  therefore,  the  combined  heparin  and  placebo  groups  were  not equivalent.  Lower  28-day  mortality  was  observed  in  the  heparin  group  compared  with  the  placebo group (28.3% and 31.9%, respectively). The absolute risk difference is -3.64% (in favour of heparin). The  90%  CI  on  the  absolute  risk  difference  was -7.08%  to -0.21%.  Of  note,  the  overall  28-day mortality (30.0%) was close to the expected value, i.e. the mortality rates in patients with ≥ 2 organ failures in PROWESS (26.5% for the Xigris group, and 33.9% for the placebo group). Even  though  the  results  were  not  equivalent,  the  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  for  the  combined heparin and placebo groups did not show a statistically significant difference in survival between the two treatment groups (p=0.086). The curves tended to separate beyond Study Day 5. Similar  results  were  observed  in  the  individual  heparin  treatment  groups:  equivalence  could  not  be concluded  in  both  the  analysis  of  low  molecular  weight  heparin vs placebo  and  unfractionated heparin vs placebo. Subgroup analyses Statistically  significant,  and  clinically  relevant,  treatment-by-subgroup  interactions  (Breslow-Day  pvalue &lt;0.10) were noted in the following subgroups: 1. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Gender (p=0.022). The mortality rate for male patients was similar in the heparin and placebo groups (31.5% and 31.1%, respectively); however, there was higher mortality among female placebo patients compared with female heparin patients (33.2% vs 24.0%). The reason for this gender  difference  was  unclear.  Female  placebo  patients  might  have  been  slightly  more severely ill than female heparin patients: relative to the heparin group, the placebo group had a greater percentage of patients who had three or more organ dysfunctions (67.5% vs 59.5%), who were on a ventilator (88.9% vs 83.5%), and who had renal dysfunction (46.8% vs 40.8%).

2. Region (p=0.050). Among patients enrolled in Europe, higher mortality was observed in the heparin group compared with the placebo group (27.8% vs 24.4%). In the two other regions, US/Canada and 'Other,' higher mortality was observed in the placebo group compared with the heparin group (US/Canada: 33.9% vs 27.2%; 'Other': 41.6% vs 32.2%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Baseline  heparin  exposure (p=0.029).  Similar  mortality  was  observed  in  the  heparin  and placebo groups among patients who did not receive heparin at baseline (29.5% and 28.9%, respectively).  Among  patients  who  received  heparin  at  baseline,  higher  mortality  was observed in the placebo group (i.e. where baseline heparin had to be discontinued) compared with the heparin group (35.6% vs 26.9%).
4. Time from the onset of the first sepsis-induced organ dysfunction to the start of the Xigris infusion quartile (p=0.058). Among patients who started treatment with Xigris early (first and second  quartiles),  higher  mortality  was  observed  in  the  heparin  group  compared  with  the placebo  group.  Among  patients  who  started  treatment  with  Xigris  late  (third  and  fourth quartiles),  higher  mortality  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  the  heparin group.

When the non-PPP was analysed,  it  appeared  these  patients  had  a  poor  outcome,  especially  in  the placebo  group:  28-day  mortality  rates  were  36.6%  and  58.3%  for  the  heparin  and  placebo  groups, respectively, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves differed markedly (p=0.0007). The reasons for this difference were not clear.

Efficacy secondary endpoints In this study, there was a lower than expected occurrence of venous thrombotic events: approximately 5% of patients experienced an event during Study Days 0 through 6 and approximately 6% during Study Days 0 through 28. During both time periods, asymptomatic and symptomatic lower extremity DVT were by far the most commonly occurring venous thrombotic event; pulmonary embolism and symptomatic central venous thrombosis were relatively infrequent events. The number of patients who experienced an asymptomatic lower extremity DVT and a symptomatic lower extremity DVT during Study  Days  0  through  6  was  nearly  identical.  Most  of  the  DVTs  that  were  discovered  during  the bilateral compression ultrasound examination were recorded as both an asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT (that is, the same event was reported under both classifications). Overall,  and  according  to  the  statistical  analysis  specified  in  the  protocol  (equivalence  margin, ± 2.5%),  the  heparin  and  placebo  groups  were  equivalent  during  Study  Days  0  through  6,  but  not equivalent during Study Days 0 through 28. During Study Days 0 through 6, 4.6% of heparin patients and 5.1% of placebo patients experienced a venous thrombotic event; during Study Days 0 through 28, 5.7% of heparin patients and 7.0% of placebo patients experienced an event. This difference was due to the category 'symptomatic lower extremity DVT', where the number of events in the placebo group exceeded the number of events in the heparin group by 7 (0.9%). Efficacy endpoints - analysis of the Per Protocol Population The PPP (n=1,706) was 88.2% of the ITT population. Demographic and other baseline characteristics did not differ notably from the ITT population, but the excluded population (101 in the heparin group, 120 in the placebo group) had a much worse outcome than the included PPP. In  fact,  the  primary  analysis  of  the  PPP  showed  equivalence  at  the  6.2%  margin  for  the  28-day mortality of the combined heparin and placebo groups: mortality rates were 27.3% and 28.1% in the heparin  and  placebo  PP  groups,  respectively,  and  the  90%  CI  on  the  absolute  risk  difference  was -4.39%  to  +2.75%.  Subgroup  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  showed  the  same  treatment-bysubgroup interactions than for the ITT analyses. In  the  equivalence and subgroup analyses of venous thrombotic events in the PPP, the results were similar to those seen in the ITT population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore, the reasons for terminating Xigris infusion early in the non-PPP and potentially important imbalances between the heparin and placebo PP groups were examined. Mean duration of infusion was ~40 h (38.7 h and 42.1 h in the heparin and placebo groups, respectively) instead of 96 h. Most patients had their infusion terminated because of an adverse event (48% and 42.5% in the heparin and placebo  groups,  respectively)  or  'other'  reason  (44%).  Thrombocytopenia  was  a  frequent  'other' reason in the placebo group (n=17), more frequent than in the heparin group (n=5). However when combining thrombocytopenia as an adverse event and 'other' reason the numbers for both arms were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

similar  (n=19  and  16,  respectively).  Seven  patients  in  the  heparin  group  stopped  Xigris  due  to  an improvement  in  clinical  status,  but  only  1  did  so  in  the  placebo  group.  The  causes  of  death  were similar  between  the  two  groups.  No  baseline  characteristics  imbalance  seemed  to  explain  the difference in mortality rates, even if there was slightly more COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) patients in the non-PP placebo group (16.8% vs 11.7% for the heparin group), and if non-PP placebo  patients  had  received  baseline  prophylactic  commercial  heparin  at  a  higher  frequency  than non-PP heparin patients (51.7% vs 34.0%, respectively).

## Pharmacokinetic analyses

No difference  was  detected  between  estimates  of  Css  (steady-state  plasma  concentration)  and  CLp (plasma clearance) in the unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin treatment groups (p=0.499 for  Css,  p=0.502  for  weight-normalized  CLp);  therefore,  the  two  heparin  treatment  groups  were combined  and  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  No  statistically  significant  difference  was  detected between placebo and the combined heparin group (p=0.604 for Css, p=0.862 for weight-normalised CLp);  therefore,  summary  statistics  of  these  parameters  were  calculated  across  all  three  treatment groups combined. These analyses indicate that heparin does not affect Css or weight-normalised CLp of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in patients with severe sepsis. Analysis of PK samples showed that there were no statistically  significant  differences  between  the  heparin  and  placebo  groups  in  steady-state plasma concentration and weight-normalised clearance of drotrecogin alfa (activated). 1.2.4 Discussion on efficacy results The CHMP was not entirely convinced by the study design (study population as well as primary and secondary endpoints): a comparison of Xigris vs heparin and vs placebo in a new 3-arm trial involving the  exact  EU target population (severe sepsis with at least 2 organ failures) would have been more appropriate though more difficult to set up. Nevertheless, the CHMP acknowledged that the XPRESS study  would  be  helpful  to  provide  further  information  on  heparin-Xigris  interaction  (Specific Obligation 1). The CHMP noted that the baseline characteristics were typical of severe sepsis patients with a higher disease  severity  and  were  similar  to  previous  studies  of  Xigris,  including  PROWESS.  However,  in XPRESS, almost all (91.2%) included patients met the criteria of the EU indication (at least 2 organ failures). On the other hand, treatment with Xigris was started relatively late, as the median time from first organ dysfunction to Xigris start was 23.3 h, meaning that almost half of the patients did not meet the EU SPC recommendations to consider Xigris 'mainly in situations when therapy can be started within 24 hours after the onset of organ failure'. There  was  no  clinically  relevant  baseline  imbalance  between  groups.  Similarly,  there  were  no clinically  relevant  imbalances  when  the  heparin  treatment  groups  were  analysed  separately  (low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin). The proportion of patients who were receiving prophylactic heparin at baseline (46.5%) was relatively low, at least with regard to EU standards. Indeed, in Europe, only 46.1% of XPRESS patients received baseline  heparin.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  baseline  heparin  was  similar  across  all  regions (although it varied markedly between countries; for instance, in Germany, 79.1% of patients were on baseline heparin, compared to 30.2% in France). It was also similar across most other parameters such as gender and age. Medicinal product no longer authorised

According to  the  protocol,  about  half  of  the  patients  randomised  to  placebo  had  to  stop  their  prior heparin prophylaxis when they started treatment with Xigris. The CHMP noted that this situation was rather artificial.

The CHMP noted that 68.5% of patients received commercial heparin during Study Days 7 through 14, which means that treating physicians decided to administer commercial heparin in two-thirds  of  patients  immediately,  or  shortly,  after  the  Xigris  infusion  ended.  Eventually,  84.3% received commercial heparin. These percentages were higher than at baseline (46.5%), a fact which the MAH was requested to comment upon.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH suggested that the lower rate of heparin prophylaxis at baseline in XPRESS (46%) than in PROWESS (67%) and in similar studies may be partly explained by the investigators' awareness that the patient was to be included in a study where heparin treatment would be randomised. After Xigris was stopped, the rate of heparin prophylaxis increased somewhat (55-70%) but remained &lt;70% at any given time. The CHMP noted that evidence from 'no heparin' group of XPRESS and from PROWESS showed no increase in the rate of thrombosis once Xigris was stopped and considered the explanation proposed by the MAH acceptable.

Having  considered  the  efficacy  results  in  the  subgroup  analysis,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  nonequivalence in mortality rates between heparin and placebo was driven entirely by the results observed in females. The difference in 28-day mortality rates between female heparin and placebo patients was -9.2% (it was -0.4% in males). The reason for this gender difference was utterly unclear. The MAH argued that due to imbalance, female placebo patients might have been more severely ill than female heparin patients: if accepted, this argument leads to the conclusion that heparin and placebo treatments were  indeed  equivalent.  To  determine  the  significance  of  the  interaction  'gender'  with  the  therapy, logistic regression was utilised by the MAH in a multivariable model that included significant mortality risk  factors  identified by previous analysis of the PROWESS data. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the different outcomes in males and females were mostly driven by other prognostic factors such as age, APACHE II scores, number of organ dysfunctions, type of sepsis, and region, rather than by randomisation to heparin or placebo. The CHMP considered this explanation acceptable.

In the post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients representing the population as per the therapeutic indication of the European SPC, heparin-Xigris coadministration may present a negative benefit/risk balance, since there seemed to be no additional efficacy (in terms of mortality and rates of DVT) of adding heparin prophylaxis to Xigris, and there is a slightly higher risk of bleeding. In the European centres  of  XPRESS,  heparin  patients  tended  to  have  higher  28-day  mortality  than  placebo  patients (27.8% vs 24.4%, respectively). It was also noted that among patients treated within 24 h of their first sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, as recommended in the EU SPC, mortality was similar between the heparin and placebo groups (28.9% and 28.0%, respectively). Therefore the MAH was requested to assess  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  heparin-Xigris  coadministration  in  both  the  ITT  and  PP  patients meeting the therapeutic indication in the European SPC. A summary of the analysis of the ITT and PP population, with multiple organ dysfunction and treated within 24 hours of first organ dysfunction, split according to baseline heparin prophylaxis, is provided in the tables below.

In XPRESS, the EU indicated population represented 443 heparin-treated and 447 placebo-treated patients (total  890  ITT  patients).  The  MAH  did  not  detail  the  baseline  characteristics  of  these  two  groups  but apparently they were comparable. The mortality rate was lower in the placebo group than in the heparin group in both the  ITT  and  in  PP  populations:  26.85% vs 30.25%,  p=0.26,  in  the  ITT  population,  and 22.37% vs 29.44%, p=0.02, in the PP population. This seemed to indicate that the combination of heparin and Xigris was not beneficial, and may even be deleterious, in the EU indicated population. Looking at the  subgroups,  it  appeared  that  this  deleterious  effect  was  concentrated  in  patients  who  were  not  on baseline  prophylactic  heparin,  thus  who  started  heparin  and  Xigris  simultaneously.  This  combination resulted  in  a  28-day  mortality  rate  of  30.22%,  as  compared  to  23.02%  in  patients  who  started  Xigris together with placebo (p=0.06, ITT population; in the PP population, the corresponding numbers are even more striking: 29.31% vs 17.45%, p=0.002). The explanation for this deleterious effect of the combination therapy was unclear. It did not seem to be driven by serious bleeding events (the rate of 'any bleeding event'  was  increased  with  the  combination  therapy,  but  this  was  expected).  The  MAH  suggested  that patients randomised to placebo were older and sicker than those randomised to heparin, but the arguments in favour of that hypothesis were considered weak.  The CHMP concluded that the results of the XPRESS study  cannot  be  translated  into  useful  recommendations  for  the  use  of  Xigris  in  the  EU  indicated population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH suggested that when patients were already on prophylactic heparin, this drug should not be stopped when they start Xigris, due to a higher risk of serious adverse events (observed in the multivariate analysis of the overall population, as well as in the EU indicated population with p values &lt;0.001) and to a higher  risk  of  death  (observed  in  the  overall  population),  both  of  which  may  be  due  to  rebound cardiovascular events. The CHMP noted that the increased risk of adverse events in patients who stop baseline prophylactic heparin when starting Xigris was also due to an increased rate of bleeding events, which is a paradoxical observation. This contributed also to the CHMP's conclusion not to include in the SPC a warning that prophylactic heparin should not be discontinued, as initially proposed by the MAH, (see section II below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to the efficacy secondary endpoints, the CHMP noted that the apparent non-equivalence in  terms of thrombotic events (difference &gt; 2.5%) was due to a slightly higher rate of symptomatic lower extremity DVT in the placebo group than in the heparin group. When examined more closely, it appeared  that  'true'  symptomatic  DVT  were  present  in  3  placebo  patients  and  2  heparin  patients during Study Days 0 through 6, in 3 patients in each group on Day 7, and in 9 placebo patients vs 2 heparin patients during Study Days 8 through 28. However, further analysis yielded very confusing information.  First,  all  supplementary  cases  of  symptomatic  DVT  occurred  in  patients  who  were receiving both prophylactic commercial heparin and mechanical compression methods. No single case of  thrombotic event occurred during the whole 28-day study period in the 48 placebo patients who received no DVT prophylaxis at all. Secondly, subgroup analyses of venous thrombotic events also yielded confusing results. For instance, among patients with recent surgery, a statistically significantly (Breslow-Day  p-value  =  0.088)  greater  percentage  of  heparin  patients  experienced  a  venous thrombotic  event  compared  with  placebo  patients  (6.7% vs 4.8%),  and  among  patients  with  no anticoagulants at baseline, a significantly (Breslow-Day p-value = 0.091) greater percentage of heparin patients experienced a venous thrombotic event compared with placebo patients (5.5% vs 4.4%). On the other hand, among patients with baseline prophylactic commercial heparin, a greater percentage of placebo patients experienced a venous thrombotic event compared with heparin patients (5.5% vs 4.0% during Study Days 0 through 6, and 2.6% vs 1.3% during Days 7 through 28). This reinforced  the  previous  impression,  based  on  mortality  data,  that  patients  already  on  prophylactic heparin, regardless of which type of heparin received at baseline, should not stop this treatment when they were started on Xigris.

With regard to pharmacokinetic, the CHMP concluded that that there was no apparent PK interaction between  heparin,  whether  unfractionated  or  low  molecular  weight  heparin,  and  drotrecogin  alpha (activated).

The CHMP concluded that based on all the above inconsistencies, the value of the overall 'difference' (non-equivalence) in  the  rate  of  venous  thrombotic  events  in  favour  of  the  heparin  study  group,  as concluded by the MAH, was dubious. The MAH agreed with the CHMP not to include any specific information of that type in the precautions/warning section of the SPC. Having considered the efficacy endpoints in the PP population, the CHMP noted that the rate of (very) early discontinuation of the study drugs, including Xigris, may not be very high (11.2%), but the nonequivalence  in  28-day  mortality  between  the  heparin  and  placebo  groups  in  the  ITT  population  was clearly due to a much worse outcome in the non-PP placebo group (mortality rate, 58.3%) compared with the non-PP heparin group (mortality rate, 36.6%), which meant that non-equivalence relies on reasons for early  discontinuation  of  the  study  drugs.  The  heparin  and  placebo  groups  gave  equivalent  28-day mortality in the PP population. Based on the data provided, there was no clear explanation for the poor outcome in the non-PP placebo group. One possibility was that patients on prophylactic heparin who were randomised  to  placebo  and  thus  promptly  discontinued  their  heparin  anticoagulation  were  somehow exposed to a higher risk of death while they started treatment with Xigris and that many of these patients discontinued  the  Xigris  infusion  due  to  an  apparent  adverse  event,  such  as  thrombocytopenia,  that heralded a fatal outcome. If this was true, heparin and placebo would be equivalent additions to Xigris, but there would be a strong rationale for not stopping heparin prophylaxis when starting Xigris therapy. The MAH was requested to comment on this issue. To explain why the outcome was worse in the placebo non-PP population than in the heparin non-PP population, the MAH noted that, as for the overall population, patients who stopped baseline prophylactic heparin  experienced  a  higher  rate  of  death  and  adverse  events.  The  CHMP  considered  that  this explanation can be acceptable for the overall population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.2.5 Conclusion on efficacy results

The XPRESS study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV trial of prophylactic heparin in patients with severe sepsis and higher disease severity who were undergoing treatment with Xigris.  The  XPRESS  study  was  designed  to  determine  the  risks  of  using  prophylactic  heparin  and Xigris concomitantly, depending on the time-course of such a combination. The CHMP noted that the numerically  lower  mortality  rate  observed  in  the  overall  heparin  group  (heparin  28.3% vs placebo 31.9%, respectively) must be tempered by the opposite results in sub analyses of patients in European centres (heparin 27.8% vs placebo 24.4%) and the post hoc analysis of patients in the EU indicated population  (patients  with  multiple  organ  dysfunction  treated  within  24  hours  of  their  first  sepsisinduced organ dysfunction). Namely, the mortality rate in the EU indicated population was lower in the placebo  group  than  in  the  heparin  group  (26.0% vs 30.3%,  p=0.26).  This  seemed  to  indicate  that  the combination of heparin and Xigris was not beneficial, and may even be deleterious, in the EU indicated population. Considering the subgroups analysis, it appeared that this deleterious effect was concentrated in patients who  were not on baseline prophylactic heparin (i.e who  started heparin and Xigris simultaneously). This combination resulted in a 28-day mortality rate of 30.2%, as compared to 23.0% in patients who started Xigris together with placebo (p=0.06). The explanation for this deleterious effect of the combination therapy was unclear. It did not seem to be driven by serious bleeding events (the rate of 'any bleeding event' was increased with the combination therapy, but this was expected). Thus,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  results  of  the  XPRESS  study  cannot  be  translated  into  useful recommendations for the use of Xigris in the EU indicated population. The CHMP concluded that the XPRESS results did not further clarify the benefit/risk balance of Xigris. On the contrary, uncertainties related to the interactions between heparin and Xigris remain. 1.2.6 Safety results Two safety endpoints were prospectively defined as secondary endpoints in the study: -incidence  of  fatal  bleeding,  nonfatal  serious  bleeding,  heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia,  and ischemic stroke, and incidence of central nervous system bleeding; -incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  including  serious  bleeding  events  and  nonserious  bleeding events  that  occurred  during  Study  Days  0  through  6  that  led  to  or  contributed  to  the  need  for transfusion of packed red blood cells; study-drug-related nonserious adverse events; and adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. Secondary analysis (serious adverse events) -  prospectively  defined  serious  bleedings,  Central Nervous System (CNS)bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and ischemic stroke. There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  heparin  and  placebo  patients  in  the occurrence of fatal bleeds, nonfatal serious bleeds, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia during both Study  Days  0  through  6  and  Study  Days  0  through  28,  although  there  was  a  tendency  for  more frequent fatal bleeding events in the placebo group during Study Days 0 through 28 (1.1% vs 0.4% for the heparin group, p=0.065). Medicinal product no longer authorised

A statistically significantly greater number of placebo patients experienced an ischemic stroke during both Study Days 0 through 6 (1.3% vs 0.3%; p=0.018) and Study Days 0 through 28 (1.8% vs 0.5%; p=0.009) compared with heparin patients. These strokes occurred throughout the study period. Patients who  experienced  an  ischemic  stroke  were  more  likely  to  have  a  history  of  hypertension,  to  be  on vasopressors, and to be on a ventilator than the overall population.

The  number  of  patients  in  the  combined  heparin  and  placebo  groups  who  experienced  a  central nervous system bleeding event was similar during both Study Days 0 through 6 and Study Days 0 through 28 (3 vs 3 and 10 vs 7, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary analysis (nonserious but relevant adverse events) -  bleedings  leading  to  a  need  for transfusion,  study  drug-related  nonserious  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  leading  to discontinuation of study drug.

For all of these nonserious events, a numerically greater percentage of heparin patients experienced an event compared with placebo patients:

- -Nonserious bleeding events that led to transfusion during Study Days 0 through 6 - heparin 5.0%, placebo 4.2%, p=0.372.
- -Study-drug-related nonserious adverse events - Study Days 0 through 6: heparin 10.0%, placebo 7.2%, p=0.026; Study Days 0 through 28: heparin 10.1%, placebo 7.9%, p=0.089. The difference was due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and renal bleeding events in heparin patients. There was also an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia in heparin patients. The risk of any bleeding  event  (10.8% vs 8.1%;  p=0.049)  during  Study  Days  0  through  6  was  also  higher  in heparin compared with placebo patients.

Following the explanation from the MAH on the classification of thrombocytopenia, the CHMP noted that it was indeed quite strange that if the treating physician believed that thrombocytopenia was due to study drug (heparin) or the combination of Xigris and study drug, this event was recorded as an adverse event, whereas if the physician believed that thrombocytopenia was not due to the study drug (but, e.g. to sepsis), then this was not classified as an adverse event but a clinical outcome, and if Xigris was stopped, then  the  study  drug  would  be  stopped  as  well  but  not  vice  versa.  Thus,  if  a  patient  developed thrombocytopenia while doing relatively well, the physician would probably tend to attribute this event to a potential heparin treatment (and this could indeed be the case, i.e. there seemed to be more heparininduced than placebo-induced thrombocytopenia), whereas if the patient developed thrombocytopenia in the context of clinical deterioration, all drugs may be stopped. Since placebo patients who had stopped baseline heparin fared less well, the above-mentioned data was compatible with the explanation provided by the MAH. Since this peculiar classification of adverse events did not seem to have introduced any significant bias, the CHMP considered this issue clarified.

- -Adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug - heparin 8.3%, placebo 7.5%, but this difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.519).  It  was  primarily  due  to  an  increased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding events (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) and thrombocytopenia in heparin patients. A statistically significantly greater percentage of heparin patients discontinued study  drug  because  of  thrombocytopenia  [11  heparin  patients  (1.1%)  and  2  placebo  patients (0.2%); p=0.013)], and a gastrointestinal event [26 heparin patients (2.7%) and 13 placebo patients (1.4%; p=0.041)], mostly of the haemorrhagic  type, compared  with  placebo  patients.  A statistically significantly greater percentage of placebo patients discontinued study drug because of a  cardiac  event  compared  to  heparin  patients  [1  heparin  patient  (0.1%)  and  8  placebo  patients (0.8%;  p=0.018)].  These  cardiac  events  were  myocardial  infarction  (3),  atrial  fibrillation  (2), cardiac arrest (2), and unstable angina (1), whereas 1 case of myocardial infarction was recorded in  the  heparin  group.  However,  the  overall  occurrence  of  serious  cardiac  events  was  similar between  the  heparin  and  placebo  groups.  During  Study  Days  0  through  28,  3.0%  of  heparin patients and 3.2% of placebo patients experienced a serious cardiac event. 1.2.7 Discussion on safety results The CHMP noted that among 81 patients who discontinued heparin due to adverse events, 49 did so before receiving at least 6 injections; while in the placebo group among 72 patients who discontinued the  study  drug  due  to  adverse  events,  51  did  it  before  receiving  at  least  6  injections.  However,  the CHMP  noted  that  thrombocytopenia  was  quoted  only  twice  as  an  adverse  event  requesting discontinuation of the placebo study drug, while it was mentioned 17 times as an 'other' reason for stopping the placebo study drug before 6 injections had been administered (non-PPP). For the heparin group, these numbers were 'reversed': 11 cases of thrombocytopenia as an adverse event and 5 as an 'other' reason for stopping the study drug very early. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The CHMP noted that the frequency of serious or fatal bleeding events through Day 28 was relatively high in XPRESS, both in the placebo group (5.4%) and in the heparin group (3.9%). CNS bleeding events  (~1%  through  Day  28)  were  similar  in  both  treatment  arms.  However,  there  was  a  small

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increase  in  the  'any  bleeding  event'  category  for  the  heparin  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm. This  increase  was  statistically  significant  (10.8% vs 8.1%,  p=0.049)  during  Day  0  through  6  only. Thus,  prophylactic  heparin  given  concomitantly  with  Xigris  infusion  for  6  days,  whether  or  not preceded  and/or  followed  by  prophylactic  heparin,  seemed  to  slightly  increase  the  risk  of  bleeding inherent to Xigris administration. This conclusion was based on a comparison with the placebo group in the present study. However, the placebo group in XPRESS may be somewhat artificial, since about half of these patients had to stop the prophylactic heparin they were receiving at baseline by the time they started the Xigris infusion. There was, for example, a potential for rebound thrombosis following heparin cessation, which may have occurred in this study (1.8% of placebo patients experienced an ischemic  stroke  compared  with  0.5%  of  heparin  patients,  and  placebo  patients  with  baseline commercial  heparin  experienced  more  cardiac  events  and  more  thrombotic  events  compared  with heparin patients). However, the rebound thrombosis phenomenon remained speculative as it has not yet been specifically studied in the sepsis population.

The CHMP noted that the increased risk of adverse events in patients who stop baseline prophylactic heparin  when  starting  Xigris  was  also  due  to  an  increased  rate  of  bleeding  events,  which  was  a paradoxical observation. The low rate of ischemic strokes in the heparin-Xigris group in XPRESS (0.5% through Day 28) was an interesting finding, but no conclusion can be drawn based on this single study. The  results  of  the  XPRESS  study  were  also  discussed  at  the  PhVWP  at  its  November  2006  plenary meeting.  The  PhVWP  compared  the  safety  data  from  XPRESS,  PROWESS  and  ADDRESS:  in XPRESS the rate of serious bleeding during infusion period was 2.3% in the Xigris group (vs 2.5% in the placebo group), which is similar to the rates in PROWESS (2.4%) and ADDRESS (2.4%). The rate of CNS bleeding during the infusion was also similar to other studies (0.3%). However, the additional analysis of the mortality data of the subgroups (baseline heparin or not) of the XPRESS study were unclear and inconsistent. The PhVWP concluded that the safety data from the XPRESS study overall were very similar to that seen  in  PROWESS  and  ADDRESS  and  it  was  not  possible  to  conclude  any  clear  benefit  from initiating heparin treatment with Xigris. The additional data from subgroup analyses (in severe sepsis patients who are receiving (or not) prophylactic heparin when organ failures develop) could not lead to clear cut conclusions on the interaction between heparin and Xigris. 1.2.8 Conclusion on safety results The CHMP concluded that in the XPRESS study serious bleeding rates were consistent with those observed in previous studies over the treatment period of 0-6 days, and prophylactic heparin did not increase the risk of serious bleeding compared to placebo (2.3% vs 2.5%, respectively), including CNS bleeding  (0.3%  on  both  arms).  However  prophylactic  heparin  increased  the  risk  of  non-serious bleeding compared with placebo (8.7% vs 5.7%, respectively; p= 0.0116). The CHMP also concluded that serious bleeding rates were consistent with those observed in previous studies during the 28-day study period (days 0-28). Prophylactic heparin did not increase the risk of serious bleeding compared to placebo (3.9% vs 5.2%, respectively), including CNS bleeding (1.0% vs 0.7%, respectively).

Therefore the CHMP concluded that the coadministration of prophylactic heparin with Xigris has an acceptable safety profile.

## 1.3 Overall discussion on benefit/risk and conclusions

Having  assessed  the  results  of  the  XPRESS  study,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  numerically  lower mortality rate observed in the overall heparin group (heparin 28.3% vs placebo 31.9%, respectively) must  be  tempered  by  the  opposite  results  in  sub  analyses  of  patients  in  European  centres  (heparin 27.8% vs placebo 24.4%) and of patients in the EU indicated population (patients with multiple organ dysfunction treated within 24 hours of their first sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: heparin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

30.3% vs placebo 26.9%). The  results of the XPRESS  study  cannot  be  translated into useful recommendations for the use of Xigris in the EU indicated population.

The CHMP noted that the clinical results of the XPRESS study, taken in conjunction with the results from other recent studies, raised concerns on the overall risk/benefit profile of Xigris.

The CHMP concluded that the XPRESS study had not brought a response to the question whether there is a pharmacodynamic interaction between heparin and Xigris on the contrary uncertainties related to the interactions between heparin and Xigris remain. Thus, the XPRESS results did not further clarify the benefit/risk  balance  of  Xigris  which  was  under  assessment  in  the  parallel  on-going  4th  annual  reassessment (EMEA/H/C/000396/S/0021). Therefore, a revised Specific Obligation to further clarify the benefit/risk  balance  of  Xigris  was  discussed  and  agreed  within  the  framework  of  the  4th  annual  reassessment of Xigris.

II CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION Further to the assessment of the proposals of the MAH to amend the Product Information and in light of the assessment of the submitted data, the CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposed changes to sections 4.2 'Posology  and  method  of  administration',  4.8 'Undesirable  effects'  and  5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties' of the SPC. With regard to section 4.4 'Special warnings and special precautions for use', the MAH had initially proposed  to  include  a  warning  that  prior  to  initiating  or  during  treatment  with  drotrecogin  alfa (activated), prophylactic heparin should not be discontinued unless considered medically necessary. The CHMP noted that the benefit/risk balance of Xigris has not been clarified by the analysis of the XPRESS results. On the contrary, uncertainties related to the interactions between heparin and Xigris remained. The short period of heparin vs placebo randomisation (4 days) compared with a relatively extensive  use  of  commercial  heparin  may  be  one  reason  for  the  confusing  results  of  subgroup analyses. Additionally, the CHMP noted that the increased risk of adverse events in patients who stop baseline  prophylactic  heparin  when  starting  Xigris  was  also  due  to  an  increased  rate  of  bleeding events, which was a paradoxical observation. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the warning to avoid discontinuation of heparin should not be reflected in the SPC. Although the MAH considered that this warning would have been of practical value to clinicians, the MAH accepted the CHMP's request to not include this warning in this section. Thus, the warning to avoid discontinuation of heparin before administering Xigris was also deleted from the MAH's text proposal for the Package Leaflet. With regard to the changes in section 4.5 'Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction', the CHMP requested to include the results of mortality of heparin versus placebo observed in patients  with  multiple  organ  dysfunction  treated  within  24  hours  of  their  first  sepsis-induced  organ dysfunction. The MAH agreed with this request from the CHMP. Furthermore, the CHMP and the MAH agreed to include the results of mortality of heparin versus placebo observed in the subgroup of patients on baseline heparin (see discussion above), highlighting that the reasons for this difference were unknown and could be related to other factors.

For  further  details  on  the  agreed  changes  to  the  SPC  refer  to  the  Product  Information  available  in  the European Public Assessment Report.

The Product Information includes also the changes from Type II variation EMEA/H/C/000396/II/0022, adopted by the CHMP in its February 2007 plenary meeting, related to an  update  of  sections  4.4  'Special  warnings  and  special  precautions  for  use'  and  4.8  'Undesirable effects' of the SPC with information on increased risk of serious bleeding events in surgical patients, following  the  CHMP's  assessment  of  summary  data  on  bleedings  events  in  surgical  versus  nonsurgical patients from the major studies with Xigris. In addition the MAH completed the list of local

representatives  in  the  Package  Leaflet  to  include  the  two  new  EU  Member  States  (Bulgaria  and Romania).

## III CONCLUSION

On 22 February 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics based on the observations and the appropriate conclusions.

The CHMP adopted on 22 February 2007 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of the Community Marketing Authorisation, as amended.
