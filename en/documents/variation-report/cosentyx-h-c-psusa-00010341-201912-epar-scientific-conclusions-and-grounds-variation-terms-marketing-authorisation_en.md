## Scientific conclusions

In view of available data on fatigue, nausea and headache from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between secukinumab and these adverse reactions is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing secukinumab should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
